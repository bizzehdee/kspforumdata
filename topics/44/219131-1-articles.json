When you\u0027re talking about rocket engines, you need to be conscious of both power input and power output. The power input is the amount of power that is generated by the turbopump in order to push the propellants into the combustion chamber(s). The turbopump is basically a jet turbine engine all on its own and can be almost arbitrarily large; the fuel turbopump for the Aerojet M-1 engine produced a 75,000 horsepower, and the RD-170\u0027s single-shaft turbopump produced a whopping 230,000 horsepower. That\u0027s up there with the horsepower of the largest diesel engines ever produced, although it is dwarfed by the effective horsepower of airliner engines (like the GE-90\u0027s 21 trillion horsepower).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe drive to multiple combustion chambers was not an issue of power, but an issue of combustion stability. Once you end up with a gigantic combustion chamber (the volume of the F-1 engine combustion chamber was almost a full cubic meter), the flow of massive amounts of propellant starts to produce currents that can impede combustion. That\u0027s why the Russians used multiple combustion chambers, and it\u0027s one of the reasons that a company like SpaceX would rather have dozens of smaller Raptor engines than build a gigantic Super Raptor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224317892\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022219131\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221693495204\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022197504\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spacescifi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Spacescifi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMain Question: What happens if your chamber pressure is too high and your nozzle is too small?

Or did you just assume that? That\u0027s not how it works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen exhaust comes yeeting out of the combustion chamber, it has a lot of heat and a lot of pressure. The nozzle allows the exhaust to expand, trading heat for velocity and providing a surface against which the expanding exhaust can push to produce thrust. Complete expansion is impossible without an infinitely long nozzle, so you have to truncate the nozzle somewhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPressure is the force that a fluid exerts on a containing surface (and on itself). Force is proportional to acceleration, so the higher your chamber pressure, the more rapidly it will accelerate as it travels down the nozzle. At very\u003Cb\u003E\u00A0high\u003C/b\u003E\u00A0combustion pressures, you can get away with a relatively \u003Cb\u003Eshort\u00A0\u003C/b\u003Enozzle, because of how quickly the exhaust expands. At \u003Cstrong\u003Elow\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Ecombustion pressures, you need a\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Elonger\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0nozzle to give the exhaust time to fully expand. So it\u0027s exactly the opposite of what you were told.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your nozzle is not large/long enough for your design pressure, it won\u0027t hurt anything; you\u0027re just wasting pressure that could otherwise be converted into thrust (the exhaust will spill out the edges of the nozzle before it has fully expanded).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224317892\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022219131\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221693495204\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022197504\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spacescifi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Spacescifi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecondary Question: Higher chamber pressure equals more thrust right?

If you increase the pressure, the forces acting on the nozzle are greater, and so even though you still have spillover at the edge of the nozzle, you will have gotten more out of the exhaust flow by the time it reaches the edge of the nozzle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to increase thrust directly, you have to increase the amount of propellant going into your engine, usually by spinning the turbopumps faster. There is a limit to how fast you can spin your turbopumps before you just kinda have to build a bigger turbopump.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is no real limit on how high the chamber pressure can be, except for the fact that a higher chamber pressure requires a heavier chamber (to contain the pressure) and a beefier turbopump (to push the propellant into the chamber at a higher pressure) which means your engine will be much heavier overall. So there\u0027s a tradeoff between chamber pressure and engine weight. There\u0027s also a tradeoff between chamber pressure and turbopump power consumption. The turbopump typically burns a portion of your propellant to provide the power to push the rest of the propellant into the chamber, but if you ramp up your chamber pressure too high, then you end up using up too much of your propellant inside the turbopump.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224317892\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022219131\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221693495204\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022197504\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spacescifi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Spacescifi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird Question: Can you have multiple rocket engines on ONE nozzle?
