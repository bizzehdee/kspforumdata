That is why I wanted to ask if someone here has stumbled over something like this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me clarify - I don\u0027t mean a map of our galaxy as we \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eobserve\u003C/span\u003E it right now, as this would only be a collection of snapshots from the past (depending on the distance of each star to us). What I want to find is a map of some part of the galaxy, in which the position of all objects is \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eextrapolated\u003C/span\u003E to their \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ecurrent\u003C/span\u003E coordinates. I know this requires a very difficult model simulation, but someone somewhere should have done it at least for the local group of stars near our Solar system. As all star orbit the center of the galaxy and have different velocities and orbits, they should be changing their position with regards to our sun. So even a star as close as Procyon (~ 11 light years) should be in a different position with regards to the Solar system 11 years from what we see today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I know they have done it for the movement of the Andromeda galaxy and have seen that it will collide with the Milky Way in about 4 bln. years. So it should be doable. So if you have come upon something similar to what I am searching for, I would be deeply gratified if you share it with me. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-12T15:48:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI do not know how precise Space Engine is in regards to actual stars - but on the other hand I do not really know what you are up to? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis wont work in office but maybe it is what you are looking for?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.3dgalaxymap.com/Galaxy/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.3dgalaxymap.com/Galaxy/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-12T16:11:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe don\u0027t know the motion of all those stars (but perhaps the general arms).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo just rotate the picture by enough. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElse it\u0027s only 100,000 light years across.

You can take a look on Hipparcos catalogue and/or Tycho catalogue (from hipparcos satellite). Or wait for Gaia... To map, use spherical coordinate (r, \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8, \u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0) which \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8 is galactic latitude (l ; yes, the leter) and \u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0 is galactic longitude b. r is of course distance. Not sure what program to map through. HII regions should be slightly easier to map (distance is extrapolated from radial velocity assuming some models), but if you want to be accurate get the error bars in. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding rotational speed, galactic rotation isn\u0027t keplerian nor rigid body; kind of horrible to graph and to think about as there should be some dark mass but if you think nearby star should zip fast enough, just think how much km you need for a star 1 pc (1 pc is precisely 206265 AU) so you\u0027d notice it already moves half a degree (the width of Moon and Sun); most star velocity is below 100 km/s. Takes you hundreds of years; farther stars would take longer even if the speed is higher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT : if you wonder is it really slow, the Sun over it\u0027s lifetime (until now) has just revolved like 20 or 21 times.
