You don\u0027t really need speed here. You need lift. Lots of lift. That comes easier with speed, but you don\u0027t want to hit wave drag. This means that they will likely use straight wings so as to have more lift to drag at low speeds, to get altitude with relative speed.

Using an already existing, proven,\u00A0engine which can go beyond your performance requirement gives you margin. And that\u0027s always good to have (unless it costs you too much money). Even more important is that this is not a 747-400. It\u0027s fuselage is fundamentally different. It\u0027s designed for air launch.

Swept wings would allow the plane to go faster, which might provide more lift, but would need a stronger and heavier structure which would reduce payload capacity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you said, the U-2 was capable of flying at a high altitude at low speed. Same as the White Knights, Proteus, and Global Flyer, etc...\u00A0Roc will have a similar flight envelope: high and slow, which is why it has a similar wing design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt any rate, there are many problems with the Stratolaunch concept. The design of the carrier aircraft is really the least of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-15T08:51:53Z\u0022 title=\u002202/15/2017 08:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 15, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
