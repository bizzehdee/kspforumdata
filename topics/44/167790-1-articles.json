This makes sense because Speed=Distance/Time. The shortest\u00A0wavelength\u00A0travels\u00A0less distance to the ear because it\u2019s journey is closer to a straight line. The largest wavelength\u00A0travels\u00A0more distance because it must ascend and descend a good distance before making much forward motion. If the electro-magnetic spectrum includes large wavelength radio waves, medium wavelength visible light, and very short wavelength gamma rays, then why does it not follow that light must travel at varying speeds and not constant. If gamma rays and radio waves both were moving at 186,000mi/sec wouldn\u2019t the radio waves be slower than the gamma rays since Speed=Distance/Time. The radio waves takes a longer journey than the gamma ray because the wavelengths are\u00A0the photons\u00A0ascending and descending and not moving purely forward at 186,000mi/sec. If we do observe all of the spectrum being constant at the same speed, wouldn\u2019t that mean that radio waves move faster than gamma rays to make up for the\u00A0greater ascension and descension? If all light is constant in speed then isn\u2019t all light moving faster than the speed of light because 186,000mi/s (I assume) is the speed of light from point A to point B in a straight line in a vacuum?\u00A0Light must be traveling faster than that figure to make up the extra distance, right?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-22T11:25:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello, and welcome to the forums!\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223225265\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022167790\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221511331272\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022182999\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jordan The Wonderer\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, Jordan The Wonderer said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe shortest\u00A0wavelength\u00A0travels\u00A0less distance to the ear because it\u2019s journey is closer to a straight line.

sound that comes to your ears can come straight from the lightning bolt, sure-- but you\u0027re also getting echoes as the thunder bounces off of terrain and such, resulting in many, many potential pathways of varying lengths.\u00A0 My guess would be that the initial \u0022CRACK!\u0022 is the direct-from-the-bolt sound, and the long drawn-out rumble would be the varying-path-length echoes.\u00A0 Note that although sound\u0027s frequency doesn\u0027t make much difference to its speed, it \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edoes\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E make a big difference to

This makes sense because Speed=Distance/Time. The shortest\u00A0wavelength\u00A0travels\u00A0less distance to the ear because it\u2019s journey is closer to a straight line. The largest wavelength\u00A0travels\u00A0more distance because it must ascend and descend a good distance before making much forward motion. If the electro-magnetic spectrum includes large wavelength radio waves, medium wavelength visible light, and very short wavelength gamma rays, then why does it not follow that light must travel at varying speeds and not constant. If gamma rays and radio waves both were moving at 186,000mi/sec wouldn\u2019t the radio waves be slower than the gamma rays since Speed=Distance/Time. The radio waves takes a longer journey than the gamma ray because the wavelengths are\u00A0the photons\u00A0ascending and descending and not moving purely forward at 186,000mi/sec. If we do observe all of the spectrum being constant at the same speed, wouldn\u2019t that mean that radio waves move faster than gamma rays to make up for the\u00A0greater ascension and descension? If all light is constant in speed then isn\u2019t all light moving faster than the speed of light because 186,000mi/s (I assume) is the speed of light from point A to point B in a straight line in a vacuum?\u00A0Light must be traveling faster than that figure to make up the extra distance, right?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen lightning strikes the air around the discharge explodes, that is what you should hear, but unless you are very close thats probably no what you actually hear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLight travels relatively close to the speed of light in a vacuum.

If you are far enough away you may not hear the initial strike. This is because the earth is curved and there is alot of interference close to the ground and the sound you hear are bouncing off of very large structures (the rumble).

and descend\u0022?\u00A0 Sound waves travel in straight lines.\u00A0 \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E(Well, okay, they can bend due to diffraction, refraction, and such, but they go in straight lines through a uniform medium.)\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0 The speed of sound in air is pretty much constant across frequencies.\u00A0 My understanding is that there is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Esome\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E variation, but in the audible frequencies it\u0027s very small, less than 1 part in 1000-- in other words, not anywhere near enough to account for the long drawn-out rumble of thunder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBear in mind that when you hear thunder, you\u0027re not just hearing sound that\u0027s coming straight from the source.\u00A0 Sound \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ereflects\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 The sound that comes to your ears can come straight from the lightning bolt, sure-- but you\u0027re also getting echoes as the thunder bounces off of terrain and such, resulting in many, many potential pathways of varying lengths.\u00A0 My guess would be that the initial \u0022CRACK!\u0022 is the direct-from-the-bolt sound, and the long drawn-out rumble would be the varying-path-length echoes.\u00A0 Note that although sound\u0027s frequency doesn\u0027t make much difference to its speed, it \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edoes\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E make a big difference to \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eabsorption\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 High-frequency sounds get absorbed much more readily than low-frequency ones; they don\u0027t reflect as well.\u00A0 So I\u0027d guess that the low drawn-out rumble is simply a result of the higher frequencies getting filtered out as the sound waves ricochet around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis, an gunshot work the same way it sounds different close up than far away, yes its not as load but you also get\u00A0echoes who draws it out.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor explosions this is far more noticeable as its far loader, you are less than one meter from the source of sound then firing an gun, that would kill you with typical high explosives at one meter, the explosion is also faster but not sure this matter here. Now very close lighting sounds like close high explosives and is scary.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
