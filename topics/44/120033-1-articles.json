And it\u0027s different on a per-mission basis, depending on the configuration of the rocket, which of the two fairing types is used, the mass of the payload, the G-load tolerance of the payload, the destination orbit, and other such things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsually it will push somewhere between 3 and 5 G over most of its first-stage flight trajectory, throttling as required to maintain it. Whether or not it needs to hold back on that before max-Q or not, I have no knowledge.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-03T14:40:10Z\u0022 title=\u002209/03/2015 02:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
