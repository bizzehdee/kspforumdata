Also, Orbcomm used F9 because the contract was moved from Falcon I to F9 when the FI was retired. Smaller sats are launching on F9 becuase Delta II is dead in the water, Taurus has to be recertified and has a bad reputation for failure, Pegasus costs an arm and a leg, SPARK is still under development, Minotaur One to Six are owned by the USAF and need special permission, and Antares is probably still more expensive than F9. This is almost certainly destined to be a temporary situation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222388062\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002288441\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221454280328\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022133850\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022wumpus\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n42 minutes ago, wumpus said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA lot depends on who is launching, where they are launching (anywhere works for the first one, it gets worse as they go up), and what is the cost of each bird (typically, they are a lot. \u00A0But at 700, they might finally be mass produced). \u00A0At least one of SpaceX secondary customers lost a payload when the DoD (? might have been NASA) demanded that all fuel be used to cover their launch and reserve, while SpaceX could launch both (but not with full certainty).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suspect that with launching 700 birds, they are going to break a few of the old rules. \u00A0Those rules just never were made for 700 birds all at once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey will never launch 700 at once- nobody ever needs 700 sats in a single orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222388039\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002288441\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221454279266\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022118368\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022EladDv\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, EladDv said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhat you all seem to think is that the falcon has to launch 1 type of payload from 1 customer at a time - they have constructions that allow them to launch may payloads in one go, having stuff launching like the SpaceIL spacecraft and a few more sats and about 1/20th of the OneWeb sats that would have them split the costs even more and cost even less for OneWeb with the recovery, seeing now as SpaceX is the cheapest option AND with recovery AND with splitting room on the rocket? i say that there is little to no reason to choose any other launcher\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI never said that. people could definately get cheap rides to orbit as a secondary payload on a Dragon, or another mission where F9 has overcapacity. And SpaceX is not the cheapest option for EVERYTHING. Soyuz is still cheaper for those who want LEO sats, secondary payloads are not always available, increasing cost. Sometimes, they might not be able to use F9 without wasting money and payload (smallsats) and things like Ariane Six are being developed for launch in four years with practically the same cost and payload as FH. Also, we know little about F9 and FH. Currently, F9 has a Ninety-five Percent success rate. They really only have twenty launches under their belt, so we really have no clue what their overall sucecess rate will be- it could very well end up like Proton- a cheaprocket prone to failure one tenth of the time. I doubt this, but it\u0027s still a possibiility, especially since rocket production at such a high rate can easily undermine safety.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, You would never choose F9 if you wanted to launch things at precise times, like a plantary launch.
