I wanted to simulate a bacterium\u00A0or something in a computer program, but without having programmed it to act like a bacterium, but it\u0027s made of simulated atoms and particles, with all the energy levels and whatnot the same, and see what it does? Like, it is a collection of many, many virtual atoms arranged like the ones in a real bacterium, and see if it acts alive or just sits there no matter what is tried to get it to wake up (whatever would work in real life). Is this feasible, and what kind of computer processing power\u00A0would be needed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow good are you at statistics?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm going to say something here that is very theoretical but has very practical implications.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the subatomic level, meaning how we understand electrons and protons, ions, etc, is determined much more by quantum mechanics that we biochemist like to account for. According to the copenhagen interpretation lack of space-time continuity at the quantum level resolves itself at the level of observation, which is suitable for a chemical interpretation. This sounds very theoretical, but on the scope of the cell, process can be practically inferred from the laws of mass action, this basically mean that quantum uncertainty ultimately results in a kind of distribution of outcomes over measurable time, at statistical outcome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo lets say we took a bacteria and found it to be composed of 100,000 processes, and we created a stoichemetric equation, just as you did with chemistry. We would not get the same result, this is because in chemistry you frequently don\u0027t list the Nth possibilities which are random, quantum events would create outcomes from some chemistry that would be unexpected unless you ran each or the equation 100 times.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the next question is how much of a bacteria (in-terms of space-time) the scale of which is down in the 10E-40 range. You\u0027de have to have enough to represent the continuoum of hundreds of atomic and molecular processes somewhere between 10 and 1000 times. You would not have to represent quantum events itself, but the statistical outcomes. Consider water all by itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWater is not water, or what we think is water is almost never in a pure state. You could not take water say at a given moment rotate the molecules in space and get exact replications in nearly quantum space-time. Aside from the bond wobbling that goes, stretching and shrinking, the electrons are moving further away and closer to water, sometimes electrons from adjacent molecules swap in a process where hydrogen is handed off or returned (and is the reason water has a pH of 7). Now we throw in ions such as sodium, potassium, etc, and this becomes a complex mess. You haven\u0027t even started with biochemistry. Biopolymers use water to force hydrophobic parts of its structure to interact, while at the same time exchange protons with water in very complicated ways (Histidine being an example). Ions in water flow into and out of pockets on biopolymers, they chelate, So this is the basic chemistry of life, that is pretty much to say that energy flow within biological systems is pretty much conducted by polymorphic aqueous states at some point in their pathways. There are exceptions such as fat mobilization and lipoprotein complexes. But this one super-system in and of itself given quantum mechanics is a nightmare to model.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-09T18:26:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the tenor is clear: the atomic level is too complicated and uncertain to model in a program and the step towards a chemical process has it\u0027s own uncertainties and complifications.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe higher the abstraction, the more possibilities to model.

But it\u0027s impossible to model that many atoms. It takes me 24 hours with a pretty damn powerful computer to optimize a simple complex with 100 atoms. And that\u0027s low level theory. For this kind of project you need to simplify to some extent. So you can go with what I call the circuit model, which only looks at proteins in and out products and their effects. That gets you a good bit of the way there, but not all the way of course. Maybe you can move on and\u00A0model each enzyme as a particle, with their diffusion modeled explicitly, which is harder but might give more insights. You can then have enzymes as shapes corresponding to their physical envelope and try to have the rules for association thrown in, and get more out, but I\u0027m willing to bet that\u0027s the limit. And missing from all of this of course is the translation machinery, and just as important the small molecule metabolome. But it all depends on what you want to get out of it. Maybe looking at how a protein behaves in the context of the cell explains some quirks of its known\u00A0in vitro behavior, but to get at that which level is really necessary?
