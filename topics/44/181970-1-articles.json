After all, such a system would require divine intervention to set up anyways right? No one says it has to last forever! Admittedly, lasting long enough for life to develop is almost definitely a no. However, it might even be a fun plot point that citizens already on these planets would need to pump water around to help keep it all stable for as long as possible.

For a pair of orbiting bodies, the period of rotation is (Kepler\u0027s third) T = 2*pi*sqrt(a^3/GM) where \u0027T\u0027 is the orbital period, \u0027a\u0027 is the sum of the planets\u0027 semi-major axes to the mutual center of gravity, G is the gravitational parameter and M is the combined masses. If we assume 2 equal planets (rigid for starters) with radii r and mass m, this would become . T = 4*pi*sqrt(r^3/Gm) We could assume our planets have super dense cores for simplicity, but maybe let\u0027s assume they\u0027re water-density through and through just to see what happens. In that case the mass would be m = (4/3)*pi*r^3*Rho where r is the planet radius and Rho is the density of water (1000kg/m^3). Bringing it all together, we get T = sqrt(12*pi/GRho) .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the planets to be grazing, they\u0027ll have a specific period that depends on their densities, but not their size!

The potential wells in the photo on the right are just 3d interpretations of the one on the left. Here we can imagine our planets are as though we filled the potential wells up with water to the level it just bridges between the two, and makes a channel of some thickness. Notice in the picture on the right, we can fill it up to make a stable channel that won\u0027t leak out to space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe very center of the channel won\u0027t experience any net force, but it will have a net pressure, which is a good sign. The outer surface of the water channel bridging between the worlds will feel a net inwards force towards the center of the channel due to gravity from the two planets. At the outer surface of the bridge, the gravity of the planets will cancel eachother in the back-and-forth direction, but will still pull towards the point that\u0027s directly between them in the \u0027radial\u0027 direction. It\u0027s the same force that allows people to orbit satellites around certain Lagrange points. As for the stability in the back-and-forth direction, the water in the very center of the channel will be supported by the water pressure of the attached worlds. If you were to draw a line between the planets\u0027 centers, the middle of the bridge would be the lowest pressure point, but could still be submerged and have a pressure if there was enough water. We can imagine the supporting pressure towards the middle of the channel as being provided by the inwards pull from all other points on the planets\u0027 surfaces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, if you were sailing along the surface of the channel bridging worlds and dropped a penny, it would sink \u0027quickly\u0027 to the inside of the channel, and then slowly towards whichever world was closer. Meanwhile neutrally buoyant things would just happily float like the rest of the water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStability... We\u0027re imagining the planets are the same size, and in this case it all works out nicely. We should doublecheck the system won\u0027t destabilize (have the channel grow) from small perturbations though. For example, what would happen for a small perturbation like water flowing from one planet to the other? Since a planet\u0027s radius is dependent on the cuberoot of volume, the receiving planet would grow less than the losing planet shrinks, causing the channel to narrow. This is a stabilizing factor then! Also, gravitationally, the receiving planet would pull towards the combined center of mass less than the losing planet would pull away, which is also stabilizing. Over astronomical time scales, there\u0027s no doubt the system would work its way towards becoming a single oblate sphere, but over short time scales I think it could be stable as two planets with a connecting channel!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...
