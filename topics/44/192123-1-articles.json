The first thing we do in aero engineering is drop that gravity term from the equations. The other engineers keep it in there (but they drop all the compressibility terms...). Anyway, while all fluid dynamics is kind of related, this thing really doesn\u0027t work like a siphon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry taking your standard toilet and just dumping few liters of water into the bowl.
