Then the missiles wouldn\u0027t be facing the airstream anymore but would be angled instead, probably creating some nasty turbulences.... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what happens ? Do the pylons turn in the opposite direction ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-30T22:12:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep, on the Tornado, and I think also the F-111, the Pylons are linked to the swing-wing mechanism, and rotate to always face forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the F-14, the Pylons are all mounted to the fuselage, with none on the wings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-31T05:40:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SargeRho\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SargeRho\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYep, on the Tornado, and I think also the F-111, the Pylons are linked to the swing-wing mechanism, and rotate to always face forward.\u003Cp\u003EOn the F-14, the Pylons are all mounted to the fuselage, with none on the wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s great !
