But engineers are still humans. Say we need to divide the budget for 2015 in a technocratic society. The genetic engineers think their field is most important since it\u0027ll increase crop yields. Meanwhile the nuclear guys want to build another experimental fusion reactor to solve the energy crisis. The economist who has to divide the money isn\u0027t an expert in either field so he only has the arguments of either side to go on, and since neither side is an expert in both fields they can\u0027t compare the relative importance of their work either. So it all boils down to a good old debate except you cut out the middle man politician. Furthermore, how do they decide who is qualified? Scientists aren\u0027t robots, its in their interest to stay in office. Since only people with a good deal of knowledge in a field can deem someone else knowledgeable (else you could get elected by simply spouting enough technobabble) you\u0027d get a small elite that decides who gets to rule the country.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot to mention that the public will grab torches and pitchforks every time the technocracy does something that makes perfect sense from a scientific point of view, but is controversial with the public (obligatory Orion drive reference).

Of course it can be operated safely, but that requires one more thing general public can\u0027t understand - 100% engineering attitude. You can make a rocket Kerbal way (with terrible risks and expenses, but it really worked good when there were no meas to precalculate everything), but you can\u0027t make fission reactor even slightly Kerbal way at all.

It can\u0027t. It\u0027s impossible. The worse thing that can happen is a steam explosion carrying fission products into the environment, and for even older plants that\u0027s highly unlikely. In addition, every one of them has a containment building, unlike Chernobyl which was just a reactor with something like an easily blown away metallic hangar over it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E100% attitude is not only possible, it\u0027s not even happening and it doesn\u0027t need to. Nuclear power plants aren\u0027t something which needs extreme constant attention to avoid an apocalypse. The amount and the redundancy of the feedback loop systems inside is insane. It\u0027s virtually impossible for an operator to create a meltdown without extensive team hardware modifications. If the system detects errors, it corrects itself and if there\u0027s even slight probability of even turbine damage, it shuts down. It\u0027s actually highly annoying for student operators because they have to extremely careful not to cause system shutdown. It\u0027s that sensitive.

Maybe people tend to project their personal experience on such cases and see that they are more than likely to make the same mistakes that led to the disaster (and they don\u0027t care that with expert personnel and some additional security measures it\u0027s much less likely to happen) so that\u0027s what really is too dangerous... and it is if you let these people to the controls, but that\u0027s why nobody does.\u003Cp\u003EAnd honestly, I wouldn\u0027t let myself to a nuclear reactor.

Using potentially toxic substances in products other than those ingested by humans (such as electronic devices) may seem to be safe, but there are several ways in which chemicals can enter the human body and the environment. Substances can leave particles during consumer use, for example into the air where they can be inhaled or ingested. Even where they might not do direct harm to humans, they can contaminate the air or water, and can enter the food chain through plants, fish or other animals. According to the European Commission, little safety information exists for 99 percent of the tens of thousands of chemicals placed on the market before 1981. There were 100,106 chemicals in use in the EU in 1981, when the last survey was performed.
