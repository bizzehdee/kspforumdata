The distance covered by the Enterprise in this \u0022listing\u0022 due to being shot, is going from medium lunar orbit, to nearly sea level on earth, in less than 20 minutes of real time. This means that by being shot by the Dreadnought, the Enterprise accelerated to about 250 km/s (0.008c, or 8.63 million kilometers per hour) seamlessly, without being noticed and completely by accident.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Star Wars, it is not unusual for vessels the size of small islands to be able to accelerate in excess of 2000 g-forces- a force which is compensated for by devices usually not much larger than a small fraction of the vessel\u0027s full size or energy demand, which is so robust it never actually causes a problem as seen in any of the movies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Gravity, for the sake of the audience\u0027s viewing pleasure space debris is slowed down to a speed necessary to make it possible to see (because usual free and random intercept speed of debris is many times the speed of a bullet, making it too fast to be seen).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn almost every movie with them, lasers travel at speeds slightly less than the speed of sound, to make visible light beams and darts of \u0022pure energy\u0022 fling around like dramatic space arrows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGravity earns its merit through the details that weren\u0027t thrown away for the sake of drama.
