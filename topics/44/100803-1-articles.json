Neither of these approaches offers the prospect of a Mars landing in a realistic time-frame or budget. Therefore, many claim that a Mars landing won\u0027t happen until the distant future, if at all.\n\nRobert Zubrin developed the Mars Direct mission plan, which could be implemented in ten years, with existing technology, using a portion of NASA\u0027s existing budget. It could then be continued into a base-building phase, which would then be expanded into the first settlement. The key is that it uses the resources available on Mars to support the mission, instead of hauling everything from Earth at great expense.\n\nThe Mars Direct plan is explained in this documentary:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/tcTZvNLL0-w?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-11T15:30:07Z","Content":"\u003Cu\u003ETagging this onto the thread\u003C/u\u003E\n\n[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=plTRdGF-ycs](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=plTRdGF-ycs)\n\nIf this guys is the salesman for the manned mars mission don\u0027t count on any footprints there soon. This guy needs to take lessons of how to give a presentation and the effect of body language on the favorabikity or unfavorabikity of the audiance with what you say. \n\nMost of what hes says needs to be done can be done by humans,\n\nLife appears to have evolved on earth between 3.8 and 4.2, so that argument is wrong, and there is no evedence of fossilized macroscopic life so that is kind of a red herring argument. If life evolved in the first billion years on mars, it was likely as simple or more simple that contemporary life on earth, even if it was more complex, it would not be magnitudes more so than on earth, so that argument is kind of bogus. Or to put it otherwise if we except that the null hypothesis is no life or very simple life,mthe alterative is superterran contemporary complexity, then what is the risk reward of the research. \n\nThe one thing i like is the drilling argument, which might need probative humans tobsearch out a drill site, given the extreme cost of deep drilling adding a few live humans does not significantly alter the risk of the mission. Thats about the only thing i agree with him on. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-11T15:38:21Z\u0022 title=\u002212/11/2015 03:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB666**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-13T10:17:07Z","Content":"A couple of things have always bugged me about the Mars Direct plan. \n\nFirst of all, what\u0027s the point of the tether induced gravity for a 6 month trip.

It has often been argued that the reason for this is that NASA had much more money then than it does now. While NASA\u0027s share of the federal budget is lower, the federal budget is now much larger. Adjusted for inflation, the present day NASA budget is quite similar to the average budget that was available during Apollo.\n\nZubrin has often quoted comments from NASA engineers, who asked: \u0022If we could put a man on the Moon, why can\u0027t we put a man on the Moon?\u0022 and \u0022It wasn\u0027t this hard to get to the Moon **last time**.\u0022 Much of the perceived difficulty of sending humans to Mars is the fact that no astronauts have flown beyond LEO since 1972. The extremely drawn out and expensive development of SLS is a good example of this.\n\nThe Mars Direct plan is usually presented without mention of testing and precursor flights. This gives the impression that the hardware is flown to Mars without prior test flights. This would never be done in practice. With the exception of STS1, human rated flight hardware has always been test flown first before being flown with a crew. Un-crewed precursor flights would be flown to demonstrate that safe return of the crew is possible.\n\nZubrin\u0027s opening address to the 2015 Mars Society Annual Convention sets out his current thinking on the subject:-\n\n[https://youtu.be/3UChuIqIKF4](https://youtu.be/3UChuIqIKF4)"}]}
