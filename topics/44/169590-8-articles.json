It\u0027s from 1969, and he does the math that SpaceX and BO are doing now. He flatly states there is no way to get cost to orbit lower without reuse, and with reuse, it can drop precipitously. Shuttle was supposed to do that. The VTHL designs (most were like Shuttle in this respect), and the VTVL designs (Bono\u0027s own work) were all reusable. A couple were HTHL designs as well. I think all the engineers were on the same page regarding reuse. Look at the concept art for prepping Shuttle, LOL.
