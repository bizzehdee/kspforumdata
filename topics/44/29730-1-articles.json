It\u0027s part of what I consider the lifecycle of a community, that the drama kicks in eventually and it either takes over or settles down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut think about this: KSP isn\u0027t a game that is easy to pick up and play. It requires a certain amount of introduction and interest in exploration and achievement. Even if your typing isn\u0027t great, you can build rockets and planes, and ask for help... and pretty much every single person who actually plays KSP has faced the same or similar problems, and are interested in helping out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might want to pick up a copy of \u003Ca href=\u0022http://janemcgonigal.com/my-book/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u0022Reality Is Broken\u0022\u003C/a\u003E by Jane McGonigal for an uplifting, easy to read book about why KSP appeals to us (unnecessary obstacles to overcome, the feeling of achievement, the ability to create) and why we, as humans, are inclined to collaboration and generally acting to further communities. We are psychologically inclined to establishing connections and assisting each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvolved tendencies, combined with the intellectual hurdle presented by KSP that will attract people who have very specific interests and outlooks, are helping the community maintain cohesion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESteam brought a huge influx of new players, and that\u0027s what\u0027s causing the current angst about new people ruining things, or old players being elitist. But that\u0027s mostly people worried that their community will fall apart because of change. That\u0027ll come and go with each new influx, such as those that I anticipate at Beta and release. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you know how hard it is to troll this game? Even if intentionally stupid questions are asked, they get answered by a lot of people eager to share their experience, on the assumption that the question was asked out of genuine curiosity. The rest of the time, we\u0027re trolling the physics engine, and then sharing our insane victories and epic failures with equal abandon. The most aggressive topics I\u0027ve ever seen were people arguing over not passing on bad build habits to new players (surprisingly, strapping on another SRB is not the best school of design). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnlike an MMO or RTS or FPS or MP Minecraft, the KSP community can\u0027t directly compete or hinder each other. We aren\u0027t tied to factions or playstyles or DPS or really able to be elitist, because it takes so much effort just to get off the ground, and once you\u0027ve gotten one landing, it\u0027s just a matter of time until you\u0027ve got the rest, and a bunch of stories to tell. We have to make challenges with each other, promoting friendly competition, and it\u0027s hard to cheat with modded parts because we can do the math to figure out what\u0027s within the realm of possibility. Some of our most popular Youtube stars aren\u0027t serious at all, or are so informative that they inspire you to try something new. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s always problems within gaming communities, little factions that form, people who will always take the side of the developers or be excessively insulting when posting, but KSP has the major advantage of being KSP. It\u0027s a community game, all of us reaching for the stars alone, yet together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWas that quotable enough?
