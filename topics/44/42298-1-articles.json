First, as Jaydee says, you can\u0027t shut a solid booster off. If you have a problem with it, you have to either ride it out or jettison it. There are no other options. Then there is the fact that a smallest crack in the fuel can lead to an explosion. It\u0027s rather difficult to inspect a solid engine for things like that. Finally, the biggest issue. When the SRB blows, the whole thing does. All of your fuel is sitting within microns of all of your oxidizer. It\u0027s a powder keg, almost literally. If your liquid engine explodes, it\u0027s bad, but all of your fuel won\u0027t go into a fireball all at once. You have a chance to fire up an emergency escape system. With boosters, the whole thing will be over before even automatic systems can react to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiquid engines come with their own hazards, of course, but most of these are things where you\u0027d have some sort of control over it.
