In that 8 years they had more than one space station with the Soyuz/Proton launchers. Hell, they launched the first module of Mir before Buran went up...

It was only occupied for 171 days, out of 2249 days in orbit. Salyut 6, by comparison, was occupied for 683 days out of 1764 days in orbit. It was also designed to be resupplied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSalyut 6 is notable because it could be resupplied, crews could hand over the station, and it helped establish many different techniques for long term station operations. Skylab may have been more advanced with its scientific instruments, but it was barely occupied and was using left over Apollo hardware. Salyut 6 was purpose built.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027re not comparing two fighter aircraft here. Neither are we comparing the Shuttle to Soyuz. We\u0027re comparing two methods of station building. One uses small capsules for crew and supplies, and a larger launcher for individual modules. The other does it all in one spacecraft, with the added ability of bringing stuff down from space. This ability, however, is the only advantage offered by a spaceplane like the Shuttle. And it wasn\u0027t used very often.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Soyuz could carry a full crew of the\u00A0stations it serviced. And you wouldn\u0027t need a Shuttle sized vehicle to carry\u00A07 people up, either. The Soyuz wasn\u0027t designed to carry heavy cargo, for good reason. If all you\u0027re going to do is send crew, why waste a huge rocket? That\u0027s inefficient. So, they had two rockets for their station programs. Proton, which does the heavy lifting, and Soyuz, which brings up the crew, and Progress, which flies on the same rocket as Soyuz, would resupply the stations. The Soyuz designs serviced\u00A09 space stations. The Shuttle? Only two. And one of those it barely did anything\u00A0to actually service\u00A0(Mir). I\u0027d say the Soyuz-Progress-Proton system was far more effective and successful at maintaining/building stations. They even used this system for the beginning of the ISS, and still use Soyuz and Progress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCost is the trump card. Why make one vehicle that can do it all when you already have two that can do almost the exact same thing? The only thing you lack is down mass capability.

In that 8 years they had more than one space station with the Soyuz/Proton launchers. Hell, they launched the first module of Mir before Buran went up... It was taking too long, and the only benefit was down mass capability, and that\u0027s an awful lot of money just for down mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSkylab was ONE space station, and it couldn\u0027t even be resupplied. It was only occupied for 171 days, out of 2249 days in orbit. Salyut 6, by comparison, was occupied for 683 days out of 1764 days in orbit. It was also designed to be resupplied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSalyut 6 is notable because it could be resupplied, crews could hand over the station, and it helped establish many different techniques for long term station operations. Skylab may have been more advanced with its scientific instruments, but it was barely occupied and was using left over Apollo hardware. Salyut 6 was purpose built.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027re not comparing two fighter aircraft here. Neither are we comparing the Shuttle to Soyuz. We\u0027re comparing two methods of station building. One uses small capsules for crew and supplies, and a larger launcher for individual modules. The other does it all in one spacecraft, with the added ability of bringing stuff down from space. This ability, however, is the only advantage offered by a spaceplane like the Shuttle. And it wasn\u0027t used very often.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Soyuz could carry a full crew of the\u00A0stations it serviced. And you wouldn\u0027t need a Shuttle sized vehicle to carry\u00A07 people up, either. The Soyuz wasn\u0027t designed to carry heavy cargo, for good reason. If all you\u0027re going to do is send crew, why waste a huge rocket? That\u0027s inefficient. So, they had two rockets for their station programs. Proton, which does the heavy lifting, and Soyuz, which brings up the crew, and Progress, which flies on the same rocket as Soyuz, would resupply the stations. The Soyuz designs serviced\u00A09 space stations. The Shuttle? Only two. And one of those it barely did anything\u00A0to actually service\u00A0(Mir). I\u0027d say the Soyuz-Progress-Proton system was far more effective and successful at maintaining/building stations.
