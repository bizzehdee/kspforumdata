Science is that which expands science, part of that process is sorting through the caga. Because of the time and money required to impliment fusion reactors people are looking more distally for alternatives as they should, but since its been 60 years and we still don\u0027t have a working reactor and couple this to the problem of electric power needed in space, i would say the concept at least is worth consideration [cough]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe cover many topics in this forum, of those tpoics the two most important given the obsession with mars venus are power generation and holo-life support. This is followed by landing systems in the case of mars. Interplanetary propulsion decreases time from the hohmann transfer minimum to a high energy intercepts that are highly energy dependent, but reduce time and the need for life support. So the VASIMR or even the mg2\u002B ION drive require huges amounts of electrical power, a capacity hat we do not have. Nerva have thier own problems.

That\u0027s one of multiple reasons why nobody has found the \u0022perfect\u0022 fusion reaction yet, and most research reactors would suffer significantly from neutron embrittlement if they were run for more than a second at a time every couple weeks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-28T12:31:21Z\u0022 title=\u002209/28/2015 12:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-28T12:55:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s not what he said though.

Neutron radiation from a D-T event is a bit more energetic than from typical fission reactor, but still in that ballpark. So if we were to find a highly efficient source of muons, this would be a viable way to build reactors. And since they require muon production, they can potentially be far safer than fission reactors overall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trouble is, of course, that nobody has figured out how to produce muons at anywhere near sufficient efficiency. Any reactions we know that do produce muons produce way more energy as other types of radiation, so it\u0027s far easier to just build a reactor on that. In fact, that\u0027s basically what we do with fission reactors.
