Restartable rocket engines are quite more complex, so that level of complexity is only implemented when necessary, for the S-IVB or the CSM for example. The Shuttles OMS engines were restartable, but not the SSMEs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason there was propellant left in the stages is because it\u0027s preferable to shut down the engine with a bit of extra propellant at the end of the burn than to run out of propellant prematurely and starve the engines. Turbopumps don\u0027t like starvation and can fail catastrophically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe S-II kept on burning at low throttle in order to maintain positive acceleration for a clean separation event. You don\u0027t want things accelerating and decelerating all over the place. Also, rocket engines take several seconds to cut their thrust. It must have been around 2% throttle at separation time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe actual staging sequence was something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- S-IC burn for a pretermined time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Cut off S-IC engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Fire explosive charges for S-IC separation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Fire ullage motors on the interstage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- S-II engine ignition\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Fire explosive charges to jettison the interstage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe interstage was jettisoned separately because they were afraid about the clearance with the J-2 engines. If it had stayed attached to the spent first stage, they were afraid that it might hit the engine nozzles. The interstage itself contained the ullage motors and was a heavy piece of kit that needed to be jettisoned. Failure to drop it would have prevented the rest of the rocket from reaching orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ullage motors were small solid rockets that gave a jolt to the S-II (and S-IVB) before main engine ignition. This was designed to settle the propellant at the bottom of the tanks to prevent cavitation in the turbopumps, which could be catastrophically destructive. As you can see, the whole sequence is a tad more complex than \u0022press space\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-04T19:50:03Z\u0022 title=\u002211/04/2013 07:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T20:05:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022goldenpeach\u0022 data-cite=\u0022goldenpeach\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThey didn\u0027t empty the second stage for redundancy: in case of a problem (like an engine shutting down(like on Apollo 13)) they could still finish the mission.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engine didn\u0027t shut down on Apollo 13.
