Windows 8 is \u0022usable\u0022 with constant workarounds and constant mental gymnastics. Whether you are conscious of them or if you personally find them trivial or not is irrelevant.

And yeah I don\u0027t mind a new touch gui for touch screens. I\u0027m totally ok with that. It makes perfect sense... However, a touch gui for non-touch screens... makes alot less than perfect sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis, remember that the majority if pc users has some skills, they are not superusers but neither novices who have problems handling a mouse. More importantly they are not very interested in computers but has learned the skills they need over they years. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eusually they have no problems installing software but don\u0027t like it at least things who looks complex, no problems copying files to memory sticks or mailing them and other everyday skills. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow give them a new UI and they don\u0027t understand anything, an superuser will try things and find that works and that not pretty fast but not the majority so they hate it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey will start asking for help often, this causes internal support to hate it too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWindows 8 might be easer for the total novices however they are a far smaller group and rarely do anything on an computer except starting the 2-3 programs they are trained in using. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes Microsoft did a lots of idiot design errors in Windows 8, some was insane. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo folder support on the start screen, probably my favorite, if you install office it contains lots of small utility programs for special use, same with sql server, now all of this end up on the start screen cluttering it a lot, yes its include office and sql server 2012 who is designed for 8. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther stuff like moving small utility apps in windows to another place than the start screen, mini apps who have to run full screen on your 27\u0022 monitor and more. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that all of this is mistakes not related to touch, just related to that windows 8 looks to use lots of features who would fit better on an cell phone than a pc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Twreed87","CreatedById":50017,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-04T04:34:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WestAir\u0022 data-cite=\u0022WestAir\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENo windows 9?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy is there no Windows 9?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause Windows 7 ate 9.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rtxoff","CreatedById":107622,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-04T11:00:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECaution, following words are based entirely on my personal opinion, don\u0027t get upset because of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYesterday i tried the Win 10 technical preview, i don\u0027t like it. The design is much worse then Win7, it\u0027s just ugly. Also the way they trying to force a microsoft account onto their users is more then questionable. Yes i know it\u0027s not a must and you can create a local account only but this is note obvious when you install it. The over simplification of the system settings is ridiculous. I just don\u0027t get it why they trying to patronise the users, even if they had to do it please leave an option for older folks to access their stuff like they used to. People are getting older and their will to learn new things again and again fades. I know it\u0027s just a preview and until release they might change stuff. However they changed so much since Win7 that a change is not an option for me. I am a Windows user since 3.11 and since then adapted often enough to new windows version, the adaptation from XP to 7 was my biggest change yet. The change from 7 to 10 is something i can not tolerate anymore. I am going to use Win7 until it\u0027s not possible anymore after that i probably go to a Linux distro. I hope Linux get\u0027s it\u0027s .... done until then.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-04T12:18:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid you ever try Windows 8 ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour gripes sound like most peoples\u0027 criticism of Windows 8.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-04T14:24:38Z\u0022 title=\u002210/04/2014 02:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
