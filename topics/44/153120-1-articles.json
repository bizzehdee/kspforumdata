Couple of things:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReactor design is a staggeringly complicated field. I spent six years running nuclear reactors in the Navy, and I couldn\u0027t even begin to scratch the surface of it. But it is not at all like putting gasoline in the tank of a car, or wood on a fire. The amount and/or concentration of uranium-235 in a reactor is almost secondary. It has much more to do with the configuration of that fuel in the core, especially in relationship to the neutron moderator (whether that is the cooling water, or graphite, or whatever). The concentration of U235 has much more to do with the length of useful core life before it needs to be replaced. But even that can be increased or decreased by design factors. Remember that when your core reaches the end of its useful life, the vast majority of the uranium-235 that it started with is still in the core. Only a very small percentage of it is fissioned before the concentration is reduced to the point that a chain reaction is impossible. (That\u0027s why reprocessing is such a big issue.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, if your 20% enriched reactor core produces enough heat and has enough core life to accomplish your mission, you probably aren\u0027t going to see a massive weight reduction by moving to a 95% enriched core. (Although you might see a much longer core life, which for a spacecraft probably isn\u0027t a big deal.)

Just, no. Repeat after me: You cannot take a reactor fuel element and make a nuclear bomb out of it. It is not improbable. It is not a small but unlikely possibility. It is impossible. Nuclear weapons require large masses of solid, elemental uranium in very specific physical configurations. Nuclear fuel elements contain discrete elements of uranium dioxide that have been deliberately designed to prevent their being arranged into a critical mass. Now, if you had a highly-enriched fuel assembly you could conceivably take it and reprocess it to recover the U235 and use that to create a bomb. (This is why reactors that use highly-enriched uranium are a non-proliferation issue.) But you couldn\u0027t take a highly-enriched fuel assembly, pack a bunch of explosives around it, and expect a nuclear explosion to result. That would be like blowing up an auto parts store and expecting to find a Cadillac in the rubble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DBowman","CreatedById":122106,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-09T05:07:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222880342\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022153120\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221481238602\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002270033\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheSaint\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, TheSaint said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, if your 20% enriched reactor core produces enough heat and has enough core life to accomplish your mission, you probably aren\u0027t going to see a massive weight reduction by moving to a 95% enriched core.
