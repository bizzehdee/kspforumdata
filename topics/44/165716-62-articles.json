I do agree that it would likely use Ursa Major engines. The only Ursa Major engine that uses methalox as its fuel is the currently under development Arroway. I think it would use multiple of these, with one in the center and 2-4 on the outside. This is because if they plane to propulsively land the booster, they wouldn\u2019t want all the engines to fire at once otherwise it would have too high of a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. I say 2-4 because I\u2019m not sure how much thrust would be needed for it to liftoff.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe side boosters are something I\u2019m not sure of. I think they could go the Space Shuttle route and use big solid side boosters, and then have them splash down in the ocean under parachute, but they could attempt a fly back booster. I think that they might also go a different route and not have side boosters at all, similar to Falcon 9. They could do a Falcon Heavy move though and strap the 3 cores together for more performance. I feel like that is most likely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe upper stage I feel would absolutely still be hydrolox because ULA knows how to handle it, and it has incredible performance. The RL10 would definitely not be used because is costs way too much to produce, and has low thrust. I think they might use a BE-3U, but as you said, Blue Origin might not want to do that. If they did use the BE-3U or something similar, it would probably have an extendable nozzle since it would need to land back on Earth. Another alternative I really like is doing something like Stoke Space, and using an aerospike engine and heat shield combined into one. It would be similar to ACES in the way that it could stay in space as a propellant depot, but then it could be brought back eventually. I think that if they don\u2019t use an aerospike engine like Stoke, they would use an inflatable heat shield similar to what they currently plan to do with SMART reuse. (A Starship style second stage doesn\u2019t seem likely to me.) They could either then try and flip the stage around and propulsively land it, or they could use parachutes and catch it with a helicopter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for its name?
