For a science example, to automate a study takes excessive amount of time, but would prolly be more precise than human doing the same study. But if you need a quick and dirty answer you can get the humans to do a preliminary study which then allows you to design a better automated study. This is not completely black and white.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLets say we had humans on Mars. Now lets say we have machines around that human doing Martian tests. Now lets further say that humans have some fabrication capacity. If tests X, Y, and Z suggest that tests XA, YA, and ZA be run. With the automated machine you have to design (5 years), fabricate (5 more years) and Send (2 more years) to get a result. You may still have to do that with a human on Mars, but that human may also do a few quick and dirty experiments which means you can be writing papers (keeping your science going) while designing a better apparatus to send to Mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is this, at least the way I look at it. We don\u0027t send scientist per say, we send astronauts, which are more or less lab technician II to IV grade. A well educated engineer would be great and this would be good for many things up until you actually start doing biology and organic chemistry. The second problem, the way I see it, you have got at least 12 years of infrastructure building just to get humans to Mars, once there you might have a pay-off, but the infrastructure pipeline to keep humans alive is very complicated and not amenable to the Russian/Private sector-style supply failures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is another problem I don\u0027t see anyone talking about. I think we can find a way in space to deal with radiation, I think if we tweek the science we can extend human longevity in space, but on Mars, so far as yet I don\u0027t see anyone talking about excavating martia to build domiciles underground where it is radiation safe. So in essence we are talking about land and return missions, and really other than gathering Martian rocks (which can be done robotically) there is no advantage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I said before on occasion, you are not designing a manned mission with some sort of experimental design that would be difficult to do robotically, there is no sense other than watching the way humans deteriorate after being stranded (or killed on impact) on Mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-14T19:03:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222456791\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022133914\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221457979302\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107380\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n41 minutes ago, PB666 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is this, at least the way I look at it.
