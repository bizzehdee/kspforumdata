be a level playing field for all in a certain league.\u00A0 Let\u0027s say there is a group of schoolkids that have grown up together.\u00A0 They used to all be roughly the same size, but one of them got his/her growth spurt very early, and is now much bigger than the other kids.\u00A0 Is it still fair for them to compete at the same level?\u00A0 One has more natural capabilities than the others, which puts them at an advantage: ergo an uneven playing field.\u00A0 In my humble opinion, the sudden acquisition of additional skills (or powers in this case) should put the person in question into a different league where they are more evenly matched.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen again, I wonder what is really at risk?\u00A0 In the case presented in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E, the son is using his intelligence for football.\u00A0 I never played football as a kid, so maybe I\u0027m wrong, but I believe the advantage in that game is typically either body mass or agility.\u00A0 If you\u0027re bigger than the other guy, he won\u0027t be able to tackle you as easily.\u00A0 If you\u0027re quicker than the other guy, then you can dodge him when he goes to tackle you\u00A0 Intelligence, however?\u00A0 Sure you may be better able to tell where the ball is going to go, but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s enough of an advantage to warrant a different level of play.\u00A0 If he were, say, gifted with super strength, or super speed, or something like that, it would be a much bigger advantage.\u00A0 Like an adult playing tug-of-war vs a 4-year old.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d say super intelligence should really only be considered a true advantage in sports/competitions that strictly involve intelligence: chess games and the like.\u00A0 If a super strong guy was playing chess, would it be an advantage for him?\u00A0 Not unless he punches the other guy, which is generally frowned upon.\u00A0 In the same way, one with super intelligence wouldn\u0027t have THAT big of an advantage in a game where physicality is the big factor, rather than intelligence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHopefully that makes some sense and doesn\u0027t just sound like rambling \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022
