WHY BUILD THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I curiously looked up the backstory of CoD: Ghosts, and *spoilers* half the U.S. gets smashed by their own rods-from-god satellite (ODIN) when the enemy hijacks it. Millions die.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrushing aside any Hollywood-esk inaccuracies or the way the Federation hijacks it (why use space marines when you can use robots?) , I would first want to say that a virtual nuclear arsenal in space would have to follow the same rule of two safety rules that nukes require. There\u0027s not that many details on ODIN, but I\u0027m going to say that any enemy should not be able to turn a super weapon on its owners so easily or quickly. It\u0027s like one second is return from EVA, and the next is OH NO FEDERATION OH NO THEY\u0027RE SHOOTING AT OUR CITIES OH NO! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy would the United States or any other super power build such a weapon? It seems like only reason why it was around in the story was to be used on its owners. I understand that the satellite is simply a plot device for the story of a mostly multiplayer game, and the CoD franchise uses crazy moments in their story (No Russian, east coast invaded, ISS blows up, etc). But I find this event highly implausible due to the lack of safeties and the why-is-the-sat-there-in the first place. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy personal guess is that the DoD wanted ODIN built in exchange for an expanded space program. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dunno.
