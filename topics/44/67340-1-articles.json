Also rockets use hydrogen and a LOT of it. So do blimps (some of them). The reason why rockets don\u0027t \u0022float like balloons\u0022 is 1 they have far too much weight and 2 the hydrogen stored is in a liquid state (denser than air). I think I can get around both of these.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat if the hydrogen was stored in a giant balloon (and when I mean giant I mean giant) which would lift the balloon high into the atmosphere. When the hydrogen starts to expand too much, it can be compressed and then used as a propellant. Also you could even use the balloon as living space (if enough oxygen is present) and possibly even a parachute (maybe).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are your theories on why or why not this would work?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-31T18:02:33Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2014 06:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Avera9eJoe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skyler4856","CreatedById":76452,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T18:03:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe balloon would have to be absurdly large.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T18:17:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eand the pressure would be far too low.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sgt_flyer","CreatedById":57690,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T18:21:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethere\u0027s several groups working on airships to orbit concepts (the most known would be JP aerospace)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehere\u0027s a wikipedia page on this concept, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_airship\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_airship\u003C/a\u003E which also summarize the technical difficulties needed to be overcomed \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T18:49:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESweet.
