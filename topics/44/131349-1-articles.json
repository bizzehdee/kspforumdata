But it has next to no effect on gamma rays, x-rays, and any other part of the electromagnetic spectrum, so, it protects us against some cosmic rays, as well as the solar wind and CMEs, but not against solar flares themselves.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe person I\u0027m arguing with is insisting that the van allen belts stop the EM-radiation from solar flares.

Van Allen belts are formed due to solar wind getting trapped in Earth\u0027s magnetic field.

Por ejemplo, solar wind. But it doesn\u0027t stop electrically-neutral radiation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s going on is this: within a magnetic field, charged particles follow curved paths. If the magnetic field is even (i.e. the \u0022field lines\u0022 are parallel) the charged particles will scribe perfect circles. When the magnetic field lines aren\u0027t parallel, the charged particles tend to curve in directions that take them wherever the magnetic field is weaker.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome fun things that happen as a result: the Earth\u0027s magnetic flux is weakest at the poles. We get auroras because more charged particles get through the Earth\u0027s magnetic field at those points. Also, the \u0022magnetic bottle\u0022 you hear about in science fiction isn\u0027t fictional. If you shape a magnetic field so it\u0027s weakest in the middle, charged particles (such as plasma) will concentrate in that middle section and can be contained. Then you\u0027ve got the Van Allen radiation belts: the Earth\u0027s magnetic field is something of a magnetic bottle that tends to concentrate charged particles it captures. The Van Allen belts aren\u0027t extremely deadly (some of the Apollo missions passed right through them), but they can give an astronaut a fatal radiation dose in a few months, and they are really hard on electronics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-04T07:24:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks, \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/148918-generalveers/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022148918\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/148918-generalveers/\u0022\u003E@GeneralVeers\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57710-k2/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002257710\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57710-k2/\u0022\u003E@K^2\u003C/a\u003E, and \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129408-kerbiloid/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022129408\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129408-kerbiloid/\u0022\u003E@kerbiloid\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/span\u003E, that answers my question!
