Basically, I have to get the best out of a certain limited set of resources. If I am too cautious, we fail by not getting anywhere. If I am too bold, we fail by never getting anything to work. It\u0027s like driving a Formula 1 racecar through a very demanding track where all your dreams are what\u0027s at stake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Formula 1 driver approaching a turn, make an intuitive guess about how much friction he can expect from the wheels and the suspension. He must calculate the trajectory through the turn, so he carefully optimise the path to use the least possible friction and thus find the path through the curve which gives maximum radius and thus require the minimum lateral forces on the wheels and suspension. If he followed the advice of my old driving instructor, he would get through the curve by first stopping up completely and then rolling slowly through while looking over the right shoulder. It is safe, but it is also a losers strategy. If he does it the right way, he drives all the way just a fraction below loss of friction and come through with almost no tolerance. It is dangerous, but it\u0027s a winning strategy. If he forces it just a little bit further, he ends up in the barrier as a loser and perhaps dead or injured. Driving Formula 1 is about being best to guess or calculate how far the equipment can be stressed without failing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same applies to CS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I had unlimited resources, we would test run our Tordenskjold engine to pieces in a test rig before it was built into our HEAT-2X airframe. We would run tests every other weekend and we would test both below rated load, at rated load and to destruction. The engines would be built on an assembly line, and their tolerances would be small. We could measure their internal tolerances with ultrasound, x-rays or whatever. But we are far from having the resources - primarily in available man-hours - as this comprehensive step-by-step testing requires. Therefore we are forced to follow an \u0022all-up\u0022 strategy, where we take some chances - like a Formula 1 driver - to optimise the few scattered hours we have access to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you just are sufficiently skilled you can also succeed anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHEAT 2X full duration test is a true thoroughbred, nerve wrecking, 90 seconds long trip in purgatory for CS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it goes well we are on track for a potential spaceflight in 2014. That is, after more nail-biting, nerve-disintegrating concerns about guidance, recovery, organisation, refuelling at sea and 1.23 x10^17 other challenges. But we\u0027ll at least be in the final.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf Tordenskjold doesn\u0027t succeed and e.g. explodes in a classic hard start, it will break the air frame and the whole stack ends up as scrap. Similarly, if we get a thermal fault and burn a hole in the engine. It\u0027s built into the rocket, so if the hundreds of thousands of kilowatts escape the engine the wrong way it will be extremely destructive. The 160 tons of steel and concrete in VTC 3 ensures that the fault has no effect on anything except the 2X itself, but it will be costly for CS. It represents many months of work that can be destroyed. A situation like when the Formula 1 driver reaches the curve and have to assess exactly how hard he can push the equipment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, what is the alternative? Sure, we have the good, proven HATV hybrids. We could fly some more of them and then postpone the large HEAT rockets few years. We could, after we think we\u0027ve flown enough Sapphires, look at a flying the 2X again in 2020. Then a couple of years with them until we master it in 2025. Then some years of turbine testing on the ground - and perhaps a first flight with a HEAT 1600 in 2030. We don\u0027t have to force anything through, - or what?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt just cannot work out economically. The rent in HAB is the same whether we are very much or somewhat active, and there are limits to how far we can stretch this before there is too little activity compared to the cost. I would personally get bugged down and get stuck in cobwebs in the office chair. CS will dry out and mummify as a coffee and pizza club.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is why we invest. That is why we take the \u0022all-up\u0022 model and test the complete rocket stage. If it goes well, it is possible for us to succeed with our project. If it goes bad the alternative is not the slow strategy because we cannot win the Formula 1 race by following my driving instructor\u0027s advice and stop. Whether we realise it or not, we do not have thirty years to do this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe racing driver must guess his coefficient of friction, but it\u0027s worse than that. He\u0027s probably not aware of the force diagrams and theoretical conditions for his suspension that will determine if he survives curve. We can as a \u0022rocket engineers\u0022 do a lot of measurements on the ground before we drive into the curve ( before we fly ). With measurements and theory in hand we can calculate what will happen. We can test unmanned race cars before we ride them. We can be deliberate and targeted in our ride through the curves. We do not rely on common sense, omens or black crows on our shoulder. We can do a lot of testing and measuring on a small scale before we push our speed machine into the curve and take a bet with the devil about who is the fastest and smartest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus also last night at the HAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart of my life is about building a rocket engine that will not melt. I do this by jamming propellant - that seconds after will be burned - through Tordenskjolds quite advanced cooling system. The problem is that the heat input in the engines most critically affected parts are quite enormous. Without cooling it would burn a hole in the 3 mm thick steel wall within approx. 5 seconds. This is not a guess but based on practical experience. When we need to run for an eternity - 90 seconds for a rocket engine equates 90 years for a human - we must remove all of the heat. The engine must achieve thermal equilibrium within the first 15-20 seconds, such that all the heat input to the engine wall is removed by the cooling system. If the engine just stood submerged under water it could not prevent burning a hole anyway. In order to remove enough heat should I force coolant past the wall at high speed in order to create the required contact between refrigerant and metal. This is the core problem with all heat exchangers. Only a high flow rate can remove enough kilowatts. The temperature just a few millimetres inside of the combustion chamber exceed the boiling point of steel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHigh flow rates cost give pressure drop and then we just do not have enough unlimited pressure. The tanks on HEAT 2X - especially the fuel tank - will be pushed to the limit in order to deliver sufficient feed pressure to both squeeze the refrigerant (fuel) through the cooling system, to then atomise it in the hundreds of nozzles in the injector and finally to have some pressure left to produce internal tank pressure. Our \u00C3\u0192\u00CB\u0153650 x 6 mm light metal tank burst at about 34 to 38 bar. We have a reasonable confidence that it will sustain the pressure test at 30 bar. If it was an industrial system, we would then be able to use an operational pressure of up to 20 bar. Compared with an air tank for diving being pressure tested to 300 bar and which is used at 200 bar. When we pressure tests very often and take care not to throw the rocket about as you can do with an air tank, we may increase the limit a little above 20 bar. Perhaps 22 to 24 bar. We pressurise the tank without people around, so it\u0027s not a disaster if something happens. But we will lose one airframe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYesterday we measured the pressure drop across the cooling system: During the 42 seconds we pumped 400 litre of water through the system with a pressure drop of 0.8 bar. This corresponds to a pressure drop of more than 1.5 bar when using the alcohol/water mixture targeting nominal flow (no more than 10 kg/s). The test shows that the tolerances in the cooling system are as they should be and that the flow rate at the most critical parts is near the expected 10 to 12 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mean that our race car driver now know much more about the coefficient of friction in the curve. The Tordenskjold can still melt and smash everything when we run the test, but now we have at least measured that we are where we should be - and actually at the high end of what other engines with similar pressure, propellant and material has been running successfully with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut we may still have a hot spot - or a hard start - and now soon I will soon no more nails left to bite!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s nerve-wracking. I have an ability to pad myself into a kind of \u0022reality screen\u0022 when we have tests. It just will not work out for me to run around on the VTC 3 and say, \u0022Argh - I can not take it. I want my mother - arghh!\u0022 We must meet the challenge and take it like a man. Whether it works out well or not, you still learn something new.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes it can be hard to convey the message that it is ok when things goes different than planned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWatch this CATO video:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;video link\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGalcit testing engine goes CATO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter this CATO I would have liked to wait to tell about it until the error had been found and fixed. For that reason the video department agreed to send the video out to the CS only at first. Now it\u0027s like any other video freely on display. The problem has long since been solved. We had a little debate about \u0022how open - open source is it\u0022 because you always end up editing whatever reality is shown. I now think we get the best result by preparing people that tests are most likely to go wrong, and then rejoice when things are going well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that even if you truly are under pressure, you can still be quite cool when problems happen. There\u0027s no point in panicking or freaking out. So we don\u0027t. Immediately after a \u0022situation\u0022 there is always a lot of theories thrown about. I always ask people to stop it guessing, save their data and information and not to speculate too much. The best part is - literally - to pick up the pieces and analyse fractures, photos, video, high speed and measurement data and then draw the right conclusions few days later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the case of the Galcit CATO the fractures revealed that it was cast at too low temperature, which had resulted in a \u0022de-bonding\u0022 between the motor case liner/coating and the propellant. This typically results in CATO in a solid engine. So we changed the casting procedure, and it was resolved. This is how you have to work. I\u0027m happy about the blast because it showed us some limits. This is what bugs me a little about the H202 plant - it has never had any problems. So I do not know the margins for sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWatch this video :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etwice testing galcit after change in casting procedure\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe press will always look out for where the excitement is or where to find conflicts. They don\u0027t understand that this it\u0027s not at about the feelings of my family regarding my role in the project, or if it will be von B or me or someone else that end up be launched. That is not what this is about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe conflict is between the cooling system and heat input. Between guidance and deviation. Between the turbine blades, scalding hot steam at high pressure and violent centrifugal forces. Between parachutes and crash. These are the things that matter and not some of the romantic hogwash, unimportant side stories about feelings and whether you dare this or that or the other. I say screw all that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn reality it is quite interesting to see if we succeed with the test of 2X, so we can get into the finals for the big race for the stars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeter Madsen\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NASAFanboy","CreatedById":57300,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T11:26:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI want to move to Copenhagen just to help with this magnificent project....

The piece was recovered by divers from the sea bed close to the Norweigan port of Horten. It had been part of the ammunition of the very large 38 cm Bismarck canon position from 1944. Together with a similar position at Hanstholm, Denmark, they controlled the access to Skagerrak.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn such heavy artillery the propellant charge is of the shape and size of the panels of the striking surface on a household matchbox.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the cordite smoke rose to the ceiling of room 241 I realized that the smell burning in my nostrils was the smell of World War II.

In the documentary he tells about his work on the Saturn booster stage S1-C and about the huge test stands in Huntsville, Alabama. He tells about the relationship with von Braun \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CHe was very charismatic.
