Why? New technology always creates more jobs than it replaces. Let\u0027s look at the textiles industry. Originally, there were a handful of jobs requiring intense manual labor and which might cause you to go blind from squinting. The products were few and varied, dependant on the skill of the worker. When mechanical looms were invented, the jobs of the hand-weavers were eliminated, but there were more jobs operating machinery. As a second-order effect, the increased production required more people to distribute the products. People were also required to see that the company did not run below profit or manufacture too much. This gave birth to management. The raised real wages and lower prices of consumer goods benefited everyone.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe third stage is, of course, a completely autonomous factory.

We can use the simple example of hammering a nail to demonstrate this point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, there is the hammer, swung by a man\u0027s arm. The hammer is powered by a human, and guided by a human.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, there is the pneumatic hammer, used commonly by roofers to drive tacks. This is not powered by a human, but it is still guided by one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ultimate (third) evolution of hammering technology will, therefore, be a machine both powered and guided mechanically. We have these; they are called gang-nailers, and they are used to build prefab houses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pneumatic hammers made such jobs as \u0022roofer\u0022 possible.

(More than they eliminate.) These jobs are even less labor-intensive than those added by pneumatic hammers. We have the people who design the gang nailer, sell it, etc. We have the people who use it to provide low-cost, abundant housing, and those who provide insurance for that housing. There are people who design houses to be built, and there are people who decorate those houses. The list can go on and on!

The answer? It does not, and they do not need to be. The laws of economics and the capitalist system are the logical end of the starting principles of economics. These principles, or axioms, really, are known as human nature. Human nature is, by definition, unchangeable. If you change human nature, you will create apes or angels, but not humans.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany philosophers have tried to change human nature, or else make incorrect assumptions about it.

Every corporation is a miniature planned economy, and so is just as subject to politicking, nepotism, autocracy, and even ideological activism as a state apparatus. Pro-monopoly forces such as the high efficiency of vertical integration for industrial enterprises, or network effects for the IT industry, ensure that these \u0022miniature\u0022 planned economies are greater than many states. The Invisible Hand is helpless to stop this - indeed, we are increasingly living in an era where corporations shape the consumer and invent \u0022trends\u0022 that they enforce, not visa versa. Topping this off is the pernicious nature of government-corporate relations, where greed meets the monopoly on coercion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWorse yet, this is all covered in ideological fluff that makes examination and reform rather difficult. Consider the typical American myopia with regards to government surveillance versus corporate surveillance, or government censorship versus corporate...\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eeditorializing\u003C/em\u003E (\u0022Muh private platform!\u0022).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://thebaffler.com/salvos/all-effd-up-levine\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://thebaffler.com/salvos/all-effd-up-levine\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, considering the above, while planned economies replicate the bureaucratic deficiencies on an enormous scale, they reduce the inefficiencies arising from greed of individual actors, and they lend themselves to examination and reform. That, and you can actually mobilize them towards a non-profit-making cause.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
