If we take a system, and place it in an environment not significantly affected by another system of similar or greater complexity, can it replicate itself? If yes, then it should be possible to launch von Neumann probes and expect them to replicate themselves, given enough energy and raw materials. Otherwise replication should be possible only with the help of a sufficiently advanced civilization.\n\nIn more abstract terms, the question is about whether a system can replicate by itself or only with the help of a more complex system. Put in this way, it feels similar to many questions in mathematical logic, computability theory, and complexity theory."},{"CreatedByName":"spudman2","CreatedById":84199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T18:17:30Z","Content":"Oh, I have a NASA-authored article on this subject!
