Like all things, it\u0027s complicated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo first off,\u00A0my one and only defence what you were watching. We can do a pretty good job correcting for observation bias, as its something scientists know about going into things, and they have to work around it on a regular basis. When correcting for the planets we know we can\u0027t observe, and using the planets we can see to gauge their likelihood, we still find that most exoplanets are larger than Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat being said, there are still a lot of assumptions and misconceptions that can be unpacked here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost of the exoplanets we\u0027ve found were found by the kepler spacecraft, which was geared towards looking at K, G, and F type stars. These only make up 20-30% of all main sequence stars. The remainder is almost exclusively M type red dwarf stars. So we still lack a good census of what planets are like around these smaller, more abundant\u00A0stars, which the TESS spacecraft and JWST will hopefully address as time goes on. From what we do know, it seems that planet mass may be loosely correlated with star mass.\u00A0So worlds around these smaller stars will generally tend to smaller.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a further miscommunication, there is actually a frustrating amount of ambiguity in the compositions of exoplanets (even those with well defined densities). This is most apparent\u00A0with mini-neptunes, which could either be rocky worlds with an extended hydrogen atmosphere, or water rich ocean worlds with little or no\u00A0hydrogen. For smaller planets below about 1.5 Earth radii, where hydrogen is almost certainly not present, their compositions are slightly easier to pinpoint. As we don\u0027t know for certain how much iron an exoplanet has, or how much of that iron is oxidized, there is a lot of room for volatiles like water and carbon dioxide to sneak into a \u0022rocky\u0022 planet\u0027s composition. In\u00A0the small fraction of rocky planets with known and well constrained densities, most can allow for anywhere from 0 to 10% of their mass in water (for comparison, only 0.02% of Earth\u0027s mass is water). This doesn\u0027t seem bad, until you realize that an earth mass planet (or larger) only needs to be ~1% water for it to have a global ocean with a seafloor covered in high pressure ices, which would remove the rock-water interface which is thought to be a key requirement for abiogenesis. Also these ocean worlds have much smaller habitable zones, quickly going from frozen iceball to boiling steamhouse, much like the faucets in most buildings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat makes things worse, is that larger rocky worlds may also be unsuited for life. Planets larger than 2.5 earth masses will likely lack tectonic plates, and possibly magnetic fields as well.\u00A0While neither are strictly required for life to develop (Earth\u0027s magnetic field and plate tectonics likely started after life developed), they are very \u003Cu\u003Every\u003C/u\u003E nice things to have for a developing biosphere. The thick atmospheres these worlds will have will likely make up for the lack of a magnetic field for surface life, and the larger masses of these planets will prevent atmospheric escape in the habitable zone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-04-21T04:20:04Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2020 04:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by wafflemoder\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-21T08:07:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EIF\u003C/u\u003E the life requires tectonic plates and magnetic fields.
