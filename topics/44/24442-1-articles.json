You have Neon plus Hydrogen, you create Neon Hydride, which decomposes to Neon plus Hydrogen. This cannot produce or consume energy. The first step will consume vast energy as Neon really does not want to bond with anything - in fact, I don\u0027t think any Neon compounds have ever been created. The second step will release that same energy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
