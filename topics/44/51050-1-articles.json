Already the new ice models have spurred changes in the instruments being planned for the Europa Clipper mission, hopefully to launch in November 2021, which will do extensive reconnaissance work to prepare the way for a future Europa lander. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESource: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://news.discovery.com/space/is-europa-too-prickly-to-land-on-131028.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://news.discovery.com/space/is-europa-too-prickly-to-land-on-131028.htm\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(yes, it\u0027s pop-science so it might not be true after all, but it\u0027s cool enough to discuss it under a what-if premise)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ProjectXMark1","CreatedById":58759,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T11:35:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm, if this is true, like it said, it would be game-changing.
