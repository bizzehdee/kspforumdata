They are actually close enough to see quite a difference from day to day. Yesterday Venus was bottom right, with Jupiter top left, while today they are almost vertically lined up. To me, the fact that Venus is closer to the sun and Jupiter further only adds to the excitement of watching them line up so neatly.\n\nHave you seen the conjunction yet?\n\n![vannacht-venus-en-jupiter-samen-aan-de-hemel.jpg](http://static.nationalgeographic.nl/uploads/media/image/vannacht-venus-en-jupiter-samen-aan-de-hemel.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Frida Space","CreatedById":60943,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T23:30:18Z","Content":"This was my view a few hours ago from Milan, Italy\n\n![11703404_358265724384156_5528026720162688441_o.jpg](https://scontent-mxp1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xtf1/t31.0-8/11703404_358265724384156_5528026720162688441_o.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T23:39:30Z","Content":"I was really looking forward to seeing tonight\u0027s conjunction, but we\u0027ve very cloudy overcast skies ... so no viewing for me.

You did a great photo, so I cant said it will look better than that.\n\nBecause 300mm still is not enoght to see the sphere shape, not sure with digital zoom and tracking. \n\nI would love to have some ND filters, but they are quite expensives, so to normal photos I just try to remplace them with a good HDR software.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Beautiful!
