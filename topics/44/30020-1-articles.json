There may be safety advantages for large nuclear vehicles such as aircraft carriers, but the extra weight is an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThorium reactors are safer than Uranium or Plutonium-based reactors: the fuel is liquid and can be pumped through the heat-exchangers, and it can be dumped out of the reactor core into a heavily-damped secondary chamber that kills the reaction in the event of serious reactor failure, thus preventing meltdowns. Additionally, in some states (such as India) Thorium is much more readily available than Uranium. Finally, there is only one isotope, so it doesn\u0027t need to be enriched before it can be used.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T08:26:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Emolten salt reactors (forefather of lftr) have been demonstrated while installed in an aircraft. making lftr work in zero gravity would be a tough challenge. some of the safety features might not work. for example in the gravity well, when the reactor gets too hot, or the power goes out, all the fuel drains out to subcritical tanks. that would not work in space so well. perhaps draw it out of the reactor with ambient vacuum and a small amount of inert gas. on the other hand it would have similar benefits to the liquid metal reactors that have already been used in space. probibly in a fluoride with a liquid metal secondary loop, a thermionic converter and radiator panels, or i suppose to provide heat to a reaction engine. this kind of reactor is something i would use with nuclear-electric propulsion, rather than a nerva type engine though. it would be a lot more efficient than a nerva, with say mpd or vasmir type thruster (newtons to tens of newtons, and isp between 3500 and 6000), which are severely limited to what can be done with solar panels and rtgs (milinewton thusters are about all you are doing with those). and you would have power for more instruments and/or life support for manned missions, not to mention more powerful transmitters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enerva does have one benefit of being extremely simple with fewer moving parts. and we are probibly better off saving the thorium for ground based applications anyway since its really good at burning up long term nuclear waste. for an interplanetary or interstellar mission where the reactor is as far away from habited areas as possible, and probibly wont be coming back, nuclear waste is less of an issue, so use the uranium/plutonium for those jobs. we will be seeing nervas long before nuclear-electric is used (barring other breakthrough propulsion technologies making either of them obsolete).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-30T08:28:55Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2013 08:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Nuke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T16:34:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy do people conflate liquid salt reactors and thorium reactors?
