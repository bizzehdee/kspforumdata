I could plan my mission to fly by duna on the way out, and try to get a fly-by of Ike, but Jeb claims that there are secret resources on Moho. As everyone know Moho is a dV hog.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo lets do some Oberth. First I head to Duna, approach is from kerbol side Remaining dV is 27400,\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs I pass Duna I use a reversal of the oberth affect around Duna to slow me down relative to Kerbol\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis also gives me a chance to change the course so that I get a close flyby of Ike, Ike has no atmosphere to speak, I can get very close and use the oberth effect to create an ellipse that crosses but does not intercept moho\u0027s orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBy this time the ship is on the space side of Duna just beyond the pe, heading to Ike. Two close flybys done, now for the third, its a ball-buster.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOnce I get to Ike once again I use the oberth effect to create an intercept course with moho - dV is now 25900. Unfortunately the plane change points are close to latus rectum points, so I can\u0027t burn normal/antinormal for the 7\u0027 I need\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then make my plane changes and im down to about 24900 dV\u003Cbr\u003E\nI am not lucky enough to intercept Moho at periapsis, but once I reach the Kerbol periapsis, I can add just a few prograde dV (which I will get back a later as we will see) to create an orbit that intercepts Moho.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMoho does not have an atmosphere and turns relatively slowly, so you can get close enough to fry dust bunnies.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt Moho intercept about 5.5 GM im traveling at 18 km/sec versus Mohos 13.5, dV remaining is 24,812.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter entering Moho\u0027s SOI I burn just about as much fuel as I can and by the time I exit my circumsolar velocity is now 26,900 m/s and I still have \u0026gt;15,000 dV left\u003Cbr\u003E\nSince I am basically traveling perpindicular to Kerbol I can burn out the rest of my fuel, the final velocity is 42400.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow you might think aha but by the time you get back to kerbin orbit you will have lost alot of velocity. Actually because I accelerated so much in the moho flyby, getting back to Kerbin only robs me of 1800 dV so that by the time I reach Kerbol Im going 40000 meter/sec and by the time I leave the system (200GM) im going 39,500 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLogic should have it that if I did a retrograde burn at Duna, an inclination burn near Kerbin orbit that I should not have lost much of the dV for my fast exit, but because I save dV on two retro oberth effects, and saved dV on one positive at Moho, and then burn heavily at the at the low point of my circumkerbol orbit, I manage to obtain very high kinetic energy, only a small part I needed to give to thermodynamics, the rest was kept of my kerbol system exit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is another peculiarity of the oberth effect, depending how much you burn just before, at and just after you can use the effect to adjust course to flyby objects, and in the end you can get energy back to do high velocity things like leave the system or search for kuiper belt objects, whatever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fredinno","CreatedById":143381,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-08T04:58:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222501532\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022136358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221460082850\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107380\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, PB666 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis also gives me a chance to change the course so that I get a close flyby of Ike, Ike has no atmosphere to speak, I can get very close and use the oberth effect to create an ellipse that crosses but does not intercept moho\u0027s orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWouldn\u0027t this be worse since Ike is so small and can\u0027t offer very much in the Oberth effect?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, this sounds like a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi-elliptic_transfer\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi-elliptic_transfer\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-08T10:42:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222501732\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022136358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221460091507\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022143381\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022fredinno\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, fredinno said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWouldn\u0027t this be worse since Ike is so small and can\u0027t offer very much in the Oberth effect?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, this sounds like a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi-elliptic_transfer\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi-elliptic_transfer\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes indeed, Ike is an unplanned rendevous, the problem in ksp is the patched conics only\u00A0allows two layers, so that once acceleration inserted into ike you could only guess about the moho overlay, i provided as much dv as i could imagine for moho and then had to complete using ike. The odd thing is i did this manuever twice and ike got in the way both times. The satellites relatively large size and close orbit and the fact you have to cross through it twice to oberth ike increases the probability greatly the it will interfere with the patched conics.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe other problem with ksp is that if you target while still inside another system you cannot see the \u00A0nodes, and the graphics just arent good enough, even on a high resolution 32\u0022 monitor to see the two orbital planes clearly. You can do some, in one try i got 1.5 degrees, in another try 0.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could have actually gotten more efftect here, the problem was i was trying to keep the dV of the craft as high as possible, i have gotten up to 40k withou using ion drive systems, which would be totally reasonable with a moho flyby, but would be feckless with a moho oberth effect. If you had ion drive in ths case you would want to have a much more robust engine for the ike power burn and get as low in the kerbol orbit as the heat radiators can take, about 1 GM, once below 2 GM you full throttle the ion droves and leave them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth duna, ike and moho are non ideal. with jool you can get some really good retro dV for doing a kerbol flyby, but for moho, duna and ike will suffice. If you can manage to get a jool flyby on the escape trajectory this is also good. The problem is that the ion drives will be useless.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nION drives are actually the reason\u00A0\u00A0i gave this example, provided something like VASMIR becomes a reality, i could invision a sun\u00A0tolerant system traveling down to mercury, using some sort of weight efficient thruster and ion drives, which wont work behind mercury, unless you carry fairly large batteries or nuclear, blaster a booster at perigee. Then\u00A0get an\u00A0oberth that exits traveling at a slight negative radial, with the ions on full throttle for the entire time it takes to get to venus. At this point it would release vasmir and argon tanks, and use the remaing metal ion system and solar panels to push itsel out of our system.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-08T11:01:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically what you\u0027ve done is something like...
