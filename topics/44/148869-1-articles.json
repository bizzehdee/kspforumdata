I wondered what kind of propellants will fuel the future rockets and found many interesting things, like this weird \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.space.com/32567-nasa-green-propellant-mission-gpim.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHydroxylammonium nitrate \u003C/a\u003E\u00A0developed by Nasa as a mono-propellant. There is also this rocket fuel, called DMAZ, which stands for 2-Dimethylaminoethylazide and is studied to replace the very toxic UDMH.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe DMAZ is hypergolic with NTO, denser than UDMH (933 vs 791), have a little bit less Isp at sea level (283 vs 285, theoretically) and a good ignition time of 64ms with NTO (although higher than UDMH and MMH). Against UDMH, the most important point is that DMAZ isn\u0027t carcinogenic. It can also works well with H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003EO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E, with a high density impulse of 360.2s and a correct Isp of 280.8s, but the mix is not hypergolic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSource :\u00A0 \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07370652.2013.877101\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07370652.2013.877101\u003C/a\u003E,\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?2004ESASP.557E..22M\u0026amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH\u0026amp;whole_paper=YES\u0026amp;type=PRINTER\u0026amp;filetype=.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?2004ESASP.557E..22M\u0026amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH\u0026amp;whole_paper=YES\u0026amp;type=PRINTER\u0026amp;filetype=.pdf\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-Dimethylaminoethylazide\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-Dimethylaminoethylazide\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-28T20:49:44Z\u0022 title=\u002209/28/2016 08:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Andiron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DDE","CreatedById":146349,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-28T21:28:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNobody really wants to deal with major quantities of H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003EO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E, though. \u003Cem\u003EIgnition\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s chapter on it is subtitled \u003Ci\u003EAlways a bridesmaid\u003C/i\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andiron","CreatedById":141782,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-28T21:39:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222778541\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022148869\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221475098102\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022146349\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DDE\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 minutes ago, DDE said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNobody really wants to deal with major quantities of H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003EO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E, though. \u003Cem\u003EIgnition\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s chapter on it is subtitled \u003Ci\u003EAlways a bridesmaid\u003C/i\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s a good pun\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Steel","CreatedById":49317,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-28T21:56:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222778541\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022148869\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221475098102\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022146349\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DDE\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n25 minutes ago, DDE said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNobody really wants to deal with major quantities of H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003EO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E, though. \u003Cem\u003EIgnition\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s chapter on it is subtitled \u003Ci\u003EAlways a bridesmaid\u003C/i\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRealistically, if as much effort was put into the safe handling of Peroxide as, say, UDMH, Liquid Hydrogen, hydrazine or any of those other fun propellants\u00A0there would not really be a problem with handling large quantities.
