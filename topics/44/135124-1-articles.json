However, he added, that did not include an $800 million \u0022capability contract\u0022 that the military pays ULA annually to guarantee readiness and the ability to essentially launch on demand. If you factor in these funds, which SpaceX does not receive, the lowest cost launches that ULA can offer are about $200 million. \u0022\u003Csub\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/03/ula-executive-admits-company-cannot-compete-with-spacex-on-launch-costs/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E(1)\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/sub\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003ESo with the increased competition between companies trying to offer cheaper launches, especially that between spaceX and ULA, it is not surprising that \u003Cstrong\u003EULA takes SpaceX as a serious threat that stands in the way of profit and growth\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#696969\u0022\u003E.\u003C/font\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EOne thing i fear most is sabotage and murder deliberately made for their own personal gain.
