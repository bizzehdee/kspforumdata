The camera pointing \u0027across\u0027 the ring is the more important of the two, as it will provide us with vertical data about the gravitometric response of the moss (how it reacts to gravity).

About 0.1G (the moon) and about 0.3G (Mars). If the moss cannot determine which way is up in the 0.1G or 0.3G settings, this tells us important things for food production in space, as this means the plants will have greater difficulty living and growing correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bunsen","CreatedById":10598,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T16:33:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the summary! I took a look at the cubesat thread many months ago, got frustrated with 75% of the comments being from people not reading the thread and posting the same crap that had been posted and answered a dozen times over, and gave up after about 20 pages. There\u0027s no way I\u0027d survive slogging through nigh 200 pages of that. [edit: having glanced at the last couple pages of the enormothread, I notice that I kinda did that myself. Mea maxima culpa.]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESensors for humidity, pressure, and O2 are all small, cheap, common, and consume extremely little power. I don\u0027t know about CO2 off the top of my head, but I think those are similarly easy. I would be concerned about temperature variation -- a 1U doesn\u0027t have a lot of thermal mass for its surface area, and its temperature can swing pretty wildly between sunlight and eclipse. I\u0027d want to check that 90-something minute temperature cycling doesn\u0027t mess up the moss.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise, you\u0027re going to need to stabilize its temperature somehow -- I see two obvious options: (1) design the craft to give the sample chamber a natural average temperature below what you really want, insulate it well to slow down heat exchange, and provide heaters (you \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E don\u0027t want to deal with the power consumption of active cooling, which is why I suggest designing it to need heaters) or (2) use a phase-change thermal buffer (basically a capsule of wax chosen to have a melting point near your desired stable temperature) which would passively limit temperature swings, but would provide no direct control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETemperature cycling becomes a non-issue if you can swing a sun-synchronous orbit, but there are far more launch opportunities to lower inclinations, and sun-sync orbits require some real attention to thermal management to avoid overheating things.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-17T18:52:44Z\u0022 title=\u002212/17/2014 06:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Bunsen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Creature","CreatedById":106457,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T19:11:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mazon Del\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mazon Del\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso under discussion is the idea of having all sample containers be their own pressurized containers.

Going with multiple pressurized containers you lower the risks of seal breaches. There are more possibilities for it, but the effect is dramatically reduced if it happens. However this shouldn\u0027t be an issue because the container needs to be tested and manufactured so well that breach is not even a real possibility. On that thought, one mission critical thing to consider is what sort of regulations the launch provider has for pressurized containers. It\u0027s probably doable with just one bar of air inside but it may affect the design so it should be cleared as soon as possible (unless someone already has?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never cultured plants (unless growing chilies counts) but I\u0027d imagine that atmospheric variables are a factor in growth. As a rule of thumb with biologicals is that you need to know everything. If there\u0027s no growth somewhere, it helps ruling out at least the most obvious factors. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand if you have shared atmosphere but you\u0027re actually studying individual growths, then if there\u0027s early and/or strong growth, can this affect the growth of others by affecting the shared atmosphere and could it be an issue? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother issue is with temperature measurements. It would be good to measure it from the inside of the growth chamber so that you can tell what the true ambient temperature is, not to mention the gas sensors which need to be in contact with the atmosphere. Obviously due to weight considerations you can\u0027t do this with individual cells, the wiring alone would hog several percentages of the precious weight budget. Additionally you need to find a way to get the wiring through the chamber wall while keeping it airtight. This might cause some headache, especially with multiple chambers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me it seems that you can either choose isolated chambers if you don\u0027t necessarily need all that data from the sensors and free up some weight budget or choose shared chamber if you want that sensor data and the interference isn\u0027t an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr go with some kind of hybrid solution? Divide the chamber in two separated parts, both with their own heating element and sensors. This way you could keep the other half at low temp where the moss hibernates (guessing around 5 degrees celsius?) and keep the other half at growth temp at the first g-force level. Once the first experiment is finished, spin up to the second gravity condition and start heating the second block. This is of course supposing that hibernating moss starts growing in a reasonable timeframe. As a bonus you could see what happens to the first growth when changing the gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne more thing popped into my mind. Was there a spesific reason this experiment is done with the cubesat instead of inside the ISS (apart from the coolness factor)? It would also be interesting if identical experiment was done aboard the ISS using a small centrifuge. That would be a valid control as the conditions inside the station don\u0027t change and if the satellite-based experiment performs identically, it would also double as a proof of concept for cubesat based experimenting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mazon Del","CreatedById":32991,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T20:04:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe regulations for pressurization of the cubesat said something that ends up being \u0022no pressure vessel can contain more than 1.2 atmospheres of pressure\u0022 or something to that effect. However, this is only true of the sat while it is on board the vehicle. Technically once the cubesat is free, they don\u0027t really care what you do. With the future ground based testing, we\u0027ll be able to see how much (if any) pressure increase we get from the plant growth over our estimated time tables. It likely won\u0027t be much, mostly because the size of the plants is so small, but additionally we don\u0027t have the issues that the Mars One crew would have. In the MO situation, they are giving the plants water external to their environment, of which the oxygen ends up released into the room, slowly increasing the pressure. Considering that the plants will be utilizing the very light amount of water that is soaked up by the agar/sucrose, we most likely will not have to worry about this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe could theoretically have two different chambers as you suggested, though that will increase the mechanical complexity quite a bit. Personally I really don\u0027t think that sealing the chamber is going to present much of a difficulty at all. Getting the data/power lines through is not an issue. Once we figure out what we need in terms of power/data lines, we can buy connectors rated for vacuum operations (\u0027expensive\u0027 but only in the range of like $15-$20 expensive). Cut the precise hole, put the connector in place, secure it. It would come with vacuum rated O-Rings and such. I\u0027ve had to do just a little bit of that in the past.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big hatch ends up being the only \u0027difficult\u0027 part. But even then, it isn\u0027t THAT difficult. A nice large O-Ring, some bolts integrated into the structure of the sat, tighten those down nice and good. Bam!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as why we are doing this in a sat instead of the ISS, the ISS was supposed to get a module for this, but that didn\u0027t end up happening (it\u0027s in a parking lot somewhere). We are doing it for a cubesat because why not? If nothing else it could give us useful experience for when it comes time to send something out of Earth orbit in the far far future.

P patens is probably indeed the species you want since it is the moss model organism (i.e. intensively studied). Furthermore, mosses come in two different shapes; a gametophyte type and a sporophyte type. The sporophyte is for sexual reproduction, but gametophytes grow significantly better so you would probably want to use a colony of gametophytes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs other have said, I\u0027d reckon temperature control is going to be a major issue.
