IIRC the atmosphere drag is most effective in first 40kfeet i might be wrong though. Since earth has the same gravity with kerbin even though earth has way more surface area, high density atmosphere is more scattered at lower levels meaning closer to the surface. The reason Saturn V turned later than the shuttle is that shuttle is aerodynmacally more effective than Saturn v at gaining horizontal speed at lower altitudes. Of Saturn v tried to do the same maneuver, it would break apart because of the pressure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(PS: I might sound a little douche with grammar mistakes and all I\u0027m writing from mobile so please don\u0027t mind ^ ^)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-20T22:14:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022miracmert\u0022 data-cite=\u0022miracmert\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E(PS: I might sound a little douche with grammar mistakes and all I\u0027m writing from mobile so please don\u0027t mind ^ ^)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh don\u0027t worry about it...

Yay!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the question is why Space Shuttle isn\u0027t doing gravity turns like we do in KSP. Well, what I\u0027m trying to say is that in KSP the atmosphere is much more \u003Cstrong\u003Edenser\u003C/strong\u003E than it is in real life. Let\u0027s think about the formula we use for gases: P.V=n.R.T where P is the Pressure and V is the Volume, n is mol (m/M) and other part is needless for now. In order to provide us a realistic physics simulation, SQUAD kept 1atm pressure and ~10 g gravitational acceleration so we could feel like flying a rocket in real world. However, Kerbin is much more smaller than Earth in volume, therefore in surface area. In order to keep P=1, since V is similar to Earth\u0027s (actually smaller than Earth\u0027s atmosphere volume) we assume the RT part is a constant (even though T is not, we assume T is same in both situations) we need to bring n up. That means we need to put more mass to keep the pressure same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo when we compare the radius of Kerbin and it\u0027s atmosphere, there\u0027s already a lot more room for atmosphere as ratio compared to Earth. Still, to keep the pressure close to 1 atm we put more mass in so we brought up the density.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn real life, dense part of the atmosphere is about 40k feet high(which is the trophosphere level) and then the atmosphere suddenly starts getting less dens. However, if you look at Kerbin, it\u0027s pretty dense until 30k meters. It\u0027s because you have to share the density to more volume in order to keep the pressure Earth-like. In KSP, you need to get higher first because you don\u0027t want to mess with high drag while trying to get horizontal speed because that would cost you fuel. IRL, you need to get horizontal speed as soon s possible because you need \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ea lot of delta v\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E. So the thing is: Go little bit straight up so you will have enough vertical force to keep you out of the troposphere quickly, and start turning to gain more and more horizontal velocity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd about Saturn V again: Saturn V was not designed to have quick and easy manuevers like Shuttle was so if it were start turning too early, either it would lose control or the external material would brake apart due to high resistive force in the air. Instead, it just got high enough for itself to have an easier manuever, and then fire horizontal. Even at some point of the burning sequence, there is a part where one of the stages burn towards closer towards earth to gain horizontal velocity and drag apogee back to wanted altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know I suck at telling some stuff in English even though I studied one year in US, but I hope I could give you a little idea about why they do it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-21T00:11:07Z\u0022 title=\u002201/21/2014 12:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by miracmert\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-21T01:02:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a side note, since we\u0027re talking about aerodynamics in KSP vs. real life, the actual density, pressure and temperature parameters are close to correct for a real life atmosphere (though density and pressure following a linear relationship is wrong).

The first, and single most important reason, is range safety. NASA honestly isn\u0027t THAT worried about an exploding booster dropping debris back on the pad--after all, it could just as easily explode on the pad and completely wipe it out. However, the horizontal distance that debris will travel before hitting the ground depends on altitude, and if they launched straight up, it wouldn\u0027t take long for an exploding vehicle\u0027s debris to be able to travel far enough to land in Titusville or other open-to-the-public areas. Therefore, just after clearing the tower and completing the roll program, they initiate an early part of the pitch program to pitch over about five degrees and start the vehicle downrange. This actually costs them a little extra delta-V, but it\u0027s considered beneficial for range safety requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, yes, the drag model in KSP is screwed up (and so is the *rate* of change in the atmosphere\u0027s thickness), resulting in the lower atmosphere being like soup compared to Earth. This means that you do want to start gaining downrange velocity as soon as possible (look, for example, at films of Polaris or Trident submarine-launched ballistic missiles being test-fired from submarines and starting pitchover almost immediately after ignition), though not as aggressively as the Shuttle did; that profile was almost entirely for range safety.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, as noted, an early start to the gravity turn is very important to avoid excessive aerodynamic loads on the vehicle. This is more important than you might think--most people think that the Challenger was torn apart by the force of the external tank exploding; it wasn\u0027t. When the ET ruptured and the LH2 and LOX burned, it generated very little force, at least compared to what the Orbiter\u0027s structure was built for. What caused the Challenger to break up were the extreme aerodynamic loadings caused by the Orbiter abruptly pitching towards the horizon due to the now off-axis thrust provided by the main engines (still burning on residual propellant in the lines). That accident happened at fairly high altitude and low velocity, yet the aerodynamic loads were still enough to break the vehicle apart. (The Saturn V started its turn later because a \u0022single stick\u0022 configuration is more tolerant of aerodynamic loads than a winged vehicle--there\u0027s no big flat wings to build up massive loads and tear off.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESide note: The Saturn V made the earliest pitch maneuver of any manned spacecraft ever. In the first few seconds after launch, the booster was within ten meters of the launch umbilical tower, and the inherent imprecision in the guidance system could have easily had it drift over into the tower in a vertical launch. Therefore, pretty much as soon as the engines were clear of the flame pit, the S-V was programmed to make a 2-3 degree pitchover *away* from the tower; it would then pitch back to vertical as soon as it had cleared the tower. This was internally known as the \u0022lean,\u0022 and was only there to decrease the odds of a catastrophic collision with the LUT, and is, to my knowledge, completely unique to the Saturn V (though I wouldn\u0027t be shocked if the Saturn I and IB also had a similar maneuver in their profile).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
