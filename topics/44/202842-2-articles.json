US forward air bases and the bases of American allies on the Russian and Chinese periphery are extremely vulnerable to mass ballistic missile attacks. The likes of RAND and the DOD are fairly positive that if war came tomorrow, most of the American bases in those regions would be put out of action very early on in the war (like within hours). Even if the bases survive, they will have to fight with the [snip] air forces of Russia and China, and ammo and planes will runout quick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is where Starship \u003Cstrong\u003Ehypothetically\u003C/strong\u003E shines.

The launches will be very easily detected with existing ballistic missile early warning satellites and once Starship drops to a low enough speed it will be an easy target for long range SAMs like the S-400 given its size and predictable trajectory (it\u0027s not like it can perform evasive maneuvers, or take back off or anything). Not to mention dedicated ABM systems if the enemy happens to have them on hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo bring up the comparison with helicopters, while a helicopter can perform evasive maneuvers and use terrain for cover, and abort a mission if new intel comes up preventing it from happening, Starship can\u0027t.

Aircraft carriers are crowded with planes and helicopters above and below decks. So what, you just halve your plane storage by keeping them below deck and afterwards the starship will take up too much room for the flight deck to even be useful. There also isn\u0027t any equipment people would need so desperately that it needs for a rocket to bring it to the fleet. That equipment is available in redundancy across numerous ships and bases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
