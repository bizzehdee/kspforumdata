You now only need to replenish 1.15*10^13kg of gas per year (your block of ice is now down to 2.2km x 2.2km x 2.2km). That\u0027s still a lot for one reentry, but what if it was spread out over the course of the year? Now you\u0027re looking at 3.15*10^10kg/day. Your cube of ice is now down to 315m x 315m x 315m.

A common erroneous belief is that the primary non-thermal escape mechanism is atmospheric stripping by a solar wind in the absence of a magnetosphere. Excess kinetic energy from solar winds can impart sufficient energy to the atmospheric particles to allow them to reach escape velocity, causing atmospheric escape. The solar wind, composed of ions, is deflected by magnetic fields because the charged particles within the wind flow along magnetic field lines. The presence of a magnetic field thus deflects solar winds, preventing the loss of atmosphere. On Earth, for instance, the interaction between the solar wind and earth\u0027s magnetic field deflects the solar wind about the planet, with near total deflection at a distance of 10 Earth radii.[2] This region of deflection is called a bow shock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepending on planet size and atmospheric composition, however, a lack of magnetic field does not determine the fate of a planet\u0027s atmosphere. Venus, for instance, has no powerful magnetic field. Its close proximity to the Sun also increases the speed and number of particles, and would presumably cause the atmosphere to be stripped almost entirely, much like that of Mars. Despite this, the atmosphere of Venus is two orders of magnitudes denser than Earth\u0027s.[3] Recent models indicate that stripping by solar wind accounts for less than 1/3 of total non-thermal loss processes.[3]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile Venus and Mars have no magnetosphere to protect the atmosphere from solar winds, photoionizing radiation (sunlight) and the interaction of the solar wind with the atmosphere of the planets causes ionization of the uppermost part of the atmosphere. This ionized region, in turn induces magnetic moments that deflect solar winds much like a magnetic field. This limits solar-wind effects to the uppermost altitudes of atmosphere, roughly 1.2\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u01531.5 planetary radii away from the planet, or an order of magnitude closer to the surface than Earth\u0027s magnetic field creates. Beyond this region, called a bow shock, the solar wind is slowed to subsonic velocities.[2] Nearer to the surface, solar-wind dynamic pressure achieves a balance with the pressure from the ionosphere, in a region called the ionopause. This interaction typically prevents solar wind stripping from being the dominant loss process of the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s also this article:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.space.com/11187-earth-magnetic-field-solar-wind.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.space.com/11187-earth-magnetic-field-solar-wind.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich is well worth the read.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, we don\u0027t know if Mars\u0027 atmosphere was or would be stripped away by the solar wind with any certainty, but we should all be very excited about the MAVEN probe, and what it discovers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RuBisCO","CreatedById":59540,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-27T00:36:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAgain people Zubin has already done the calculations for you. Assuming a certain amount of CO2 and water is sequestered in the Martian soil all that is needed is to bring up Mars\u0027s temperature a few degrees to start a global warming chain reaction, he\u0027s numbers show that it should be possible to bring Mar\u0027s surface to habitable pressures and temperatures in UNDER A CENTURY! Making enough oxygen would take a few centuries to a millennium longer. So we are talking roughly 1000 years to terraform mars with minimal energy imputs of a few GW a year. Also maybe we can do it all without having the slam in comets if there is enough CO2 and Water on Mars already, which is a big if, alot more science is needed to be done on Mars to answer the questions of how much water ice, permafrost and geological deposit still exist and how much CO2 is soaked up by the very cold-dry soil, the answers to this will determine if mars can be terraformed without need of outside sources of water, CO2 and nitrogen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat last one is one Zubin barely talks about but is rather important.

If that was to be found as sodium or potassium nitrate deposits it would be ~2.7 million km^3 of nitrate salts, or equal to a cube of salt ~140 km wide!

Mars\u0027s low gravity would mean a lot of atmosphere loss from the impact plums. Comets would at best need to be detonated somehow into snow to spread out their impact over a whole hemisphere of the planet. Forgoing that we would need to mine ammonia directly from a comet, ship it to Mars and dump it in smaller manageable amounts. ~10^18 kg of ammonia would also provide a lot of hydrogen (24% of that ammonia is hydrogen) that hydrogen would react with all the oxides and superoxides to form water. Adding a little more water to Mars, not much though that is between 1/10,000 to 1/100,000 the amount of water on earth. If Mars needs more water we can just take chucks out of comets and deliver them to mars without processing out the ammonia.
