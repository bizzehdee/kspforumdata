critique about space radiation (there are plenty of people, even at NASA who have overblown fears about it), but it would be helpful to everybody else if you linked to the video so people could draw their own conclusions about the validityof the criticism and qualifications of the person making it (just working at NASA doesn\u0027t nwcessarily make you knowledgeable about the risks of manned interplanetary travel- it\u0027s a large organization with lots of specialization of roles...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(2) \u00A0Radiation is a drastically overblown fear. \u00A0The dosage isn\u0027t comparable to standing next to the Chernobyl reactor at all. \u00A0Though the sun emits huge amounts of radiation, it dissipates by the Inverse Square Law- so by the time it gets this far out in space it\u0027s actually not that concentrated. \u00A0We have reliable data on\u00A0radiation beyond Earth\u0027s magnetosphere from the Apollo program and interplanetary probes- it\u0027s really not that dangerous...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Apollo astronauts received about 1200 millirem over 10 days (for reference, the average adult receives around 620 millirem per year on Earth, and nuclear power plant workers can receive up to\u00A05000 mrem per year without ill effect),\u00A0and some\u00A0of that was from passing through the Van Allen belts, where you receive up to 13,000 millirem per hour in some parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, Musk\u0027s plan calls for a 90-120 day transfer, and it only has to pass through the Van Allen belts once. \u00A0Beyond the Van Allen Belts, the Chandraayan-1 spacecraft showed us radiation exposure only\u00A0averages 1.2 millirem per hour (note that this measurement was taken in 2008- a solar minimum).\u00A0 The lowest dose known to cause any ill health effects is 10,0000 millirem (a slight increase in cancer risk- about 1%- much less deadly than if you smoked), \u00A0and it takes 100,000 millirem to cause acute radiation sickness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA 120 day journey to Mars would take 2880 hours, and thus during years of a solar minimum, like in 2008, would only equate to up to 3456 mrem of radiation exposure- less than the 7000 mrem received during a typical 6 month International Space Station\u00A0stay. \u00A0However, during a solar maximum radiation\u00A0exposure in deep space can be close to three times\u00A0as high,\u00A0so about 10,050\u00A0mrem in 4 months is not unreasonable during a solar maximum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs can be seen, background radiation is NOT an immediate issue for a Mars journey- although it could slightly increase your risk of cancer. \u00A0The main danger is actually from getting caught in a Solar Particle\u00A0Event\u00A0(aka.\u00A0a \u0022Solar Storm\u0022). \u00A0During one of these, exposures can reach over 1,000,000 mrem over the course of the event.\u00A0 A dose of 400k mrem will kill 50% of adult humans, so this is more than enough radiation to prove lethal without shielding...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFortunately, the radiation during an SPE is\u00A0lower-energy than cosmic rays and thus easily absorbed (this actually makes them more dangerous if unprotected- most cosmic\u00A0rays simply pass right through you due to their enormous energy levels,\u00A0which is why your mrem levels end up being so comparatively low despite the huge number of cosmic rays). \u00A0A 10 cm aluminum shield will block more than 98% of them, for instance- lowering the exposure from an SPE to a manageable 20k mrem or so...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWater and plastic happen to make more mass-effective shields against solar flares than aluminum, according to some studies (one NASA article states polyethylene provides 50% better protection than aluminum, for\u00A0instance)- and they don\u0027t produce problematic secondary radiation when bombarded by gamma rays like aluminum does, which can actually be more deadly than the gamma rays themselves... \u00A0Lead and uranium are also useful\u00A0radiation shields in an SPE-\u00A0although they are heavier for the protection they provide, and still produce a lot of secondary radiation...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, the best solution is probably the one Robert Zubrin proposed long ago- to simply huddle in your pantry and use your water supply as a shield (even if you only brought it on the journey for this express purpose, water is still lighter than equivalent-thickness\u00A0metal shielding, if far more bulky...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou don\u0027t need to shield the whole spacecraft- electronics can be rad hardened\u00A0for far\u00A0less mass\u00A0than they can be shielded, unlike squishy humans- you only need to have a radiation barrier you can rotate between the crew and the Sun to create a \u0022solar storm bunker\u0022 the crew can hide in when a SPE is imminent...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short, carry a bunch of extra water with you to Mars (preferably in a plastic or carbon fiber tank- aluminum, like I said, emits deadly secondary radiation of its own when bombarded by gamma rays)\u00A0and use it as a mass-effective rad shield during SPE\u0027s. \u00A0When you get to Mars, you can use it for life support and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E to reduce the need for local ice-mining for these purposes...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe radiation issues with space travel are really only of immediate concern when it comes to solar storms. \u00A0The rest of the time your radiation exposure should not pose a major health risk- only a slightly increased risk of cancer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFortunately, Mars itself has enough atmosphere to provide a level of rad protection equal to 11-22 cm of aluminum (depending on altitude and weather). \u00A0This is enough to protect against acute health effects from SOE\u0027s, but not enough for a permanent colony-\u00A0where doses can accumulate for decades and chronic health effects will eventually emerge-\u00A0but fortunately you have lots of soil available to bury your habitats. \u00A0A few (4-5) meters of Martian rock and\u00A0soil would probably provide enough protection to not have to worry much\u00A0about adverse effects on fertility, pregnancy, or immune/skin health.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf\u00A0you skipped on burying your habitats, however, you would probably see a substantial increase in infections, skin sores/lesions, anemia, a high (10-20% lifelong incidence) risk of leukemia, reduced fertility,\u00A0and birth defects emerge over a 15-20 year timeframe. \u00A0These health effects wouldn\u0027t necessarily doom\u00A0a Mars colony (early settlers if the Americas had it far worse- gaving to deal with disease, hostile natives, and starvation), but they would make it an extremely\u00A0undesirable place to live- in turn making it difficult to attract new colonists. \u00A0So burying habutats in the first year or two would be an extremely prudent measure...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegards,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNorthstar\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset

even at NASA who have overblown fears about it), but it would be helpful to everybody else if you linked to the video so people could draw their own conclusions about the validityof the criticism and qualifications of the person making it (just working at NASA doesn\u0027t nwcessarily make you knowledgeable about the risks of manned interplanetary travel- it\u0027s a large organization with lots of specialization of roles...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(2) \u00A0Radiation is a drastically overblown fear. \u00A0The dosage isn\u0027t comparable to standing next to the Chernobyl reactor at all. \u00A0Though the sun emits huge amounts of radiation, it dissipates by the Inverse Square Law- so by the time it gets this far out in space it\u0027s actually not that concentrated. \u00A0We have reliable data on\u00A0radiation beyond Earth\u0027s magnetosphere from the Apollo program and interplanetary probes- it\u0027s really not that dangerous...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Apollo astronauts received about 1200 millirem over 10 days (for reference, the average adult receives around 620 millirem per year on Earth, and nuclear power plant workers can receive up to\u00A05000 mrem per year without ill effect),\u00A0and some\u00A0of that was from passing through the Van Allen belts, where you receive up to 13,000 millirem per hour in some parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, Musk\u0027s plan calls for a 90-120 day transfer, and it only has to pass through the Van Allen belts once. \u00A0Beyond the Van Allen Belts, the Chandraayan-1 spacecraft showed us radiation exposure only\u00A0averages 1.2 millirem per hour (note that this measurement was taken in 2008- a solar minimum).\u00A0 The lowest dose known to cause any ill health effects is 10,0000 millirem (a slight increase in cancer risk- about 1%- much less deadly than if you smoked), \u00A0and it takes 100,000 millirem to cause acute radiation sickness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA 120 day journey to Mars would take 2880 hours, and thus during years of a solar minimum, like in 2008, would only equate to up to 3456 mrem of radiation exposure- less than the 7000 mrem received during a typical 6 month International Space Station\u00A0stay. \u00A0However, during a solar maximum radiation\u00A0exposure in deep space can be close to three times\u00A0as high,\u00A0so about 10,050\u00A0mrem in 4 months is not unreasonable during a solar maximum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs can be seen, background radiation is NOT an immediate issue for a Mars journey- although it could slightly increase your risk of cancer. \u00A0The main danger is actually from getting caught in a Solar Particle\u00A0Event\u00A0(aka.\u00A0a \u0022Solar Storm\u0022). \u00A0During one of these, exposures can reach over 1,000,000 mrem over the course of the event.\u00A0 A dose of 400k mrem will kill 50% of adult humans, so this is more than enough radiation to prove lethal without shielding...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFortunately, the radiation during an SPE is\u00A0lower-energy than cosmic rays and thus easily absorbed (this actually makes them more dangerous if unprotected- most cosmic\u00A0rays simply pass right through you due to their enormous energy levels,\u00A0which is why your mrem levels end up being so comparatively low despite the huge number of cosmic rays). \u00A0A 10 cm aluminum shield will block more than 98% of them, for instance- lowering the exposure from an SPE to a manageable 20k mrem or so...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWater and plastic happen to make more mass-effective shields against solar flares than aluminum, according to some studies (one NASA article states polyethylene provides 50% better protection than aluminum, for\u00A0instance)- and they don\u0027t produce problematic secondary radiation when bombarded by gamma rays like aluminum does, which can actually be more deadly than the gamma rays themselves... \u00A0Lead and uranium are also useful\u00A0radiation shields in an SPE-\u00A0although they are heavier for the protection they provide, and still produce a lot of secondary radiation...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, the best solution is probably the one Robert Zubrin proposed long ago- to simply huddle in your pantry and use your water supply as a shield (even if you only brought it on the journey for this express purpose, water is still lighter than equivalent-thickness\u00A0metal shielding, if far more bulky...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou don\u0027t need to shield the whole spacecraft- electronics can be rad hardened\u00A0for far\u00A0less mass\u00A0than they can be shielded, unlike squishy humans- you only need to have a radiation barrier you can rotate between the crew and the Sun to create a \u0022solar storm bunker\u0022 the crew can hide in when a SPE is imminent...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short, carry a bunch of extra water with you to Mars (preferably in a plastic or carbon fiber tank- aluminum, like I said, emits deadly secondary radiation of its own when bombarded by gamma rays)\u00A0and use it as a mass-effective rad shield during SPE\u0027s. \u00A0When you get to Mars, you can use it for life support and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E to reduce the need for local ice-mining for these

to provide a level of rad protection equal to 11-22 cm of aluminum (depending on altitude and weather). \u00A0This is enough to protect against acute health effects from SOE\u0027s, but not enough for a permanent colony-\u00A0where doses can accumulate for decades and chronic health effects will eventually emerge-\u00A0but fortunately you have lots of soil available to bury your habitats. \u00A0A few (4-5) meters of Martian rock and\u00A0soil would probably provide enough protection to not have to worry much\u00A0about adverse effects on fertility, pregnancy, or immune/skin health.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf\u00A0you skipped on burying your habitats, however, you would probably see a substantial increase in infections, skin sores/lesions, anemia, a high (10-20% lifelong incidence) risk of leukemia, reduced fertility,\u00A0and birth defects emerge over a 15-20 year timeframe. \u00A0These health effects wouldn\u0027t necessarily doom\u00A0a Mars colony (early settlers if the Americas had it far worse- gaving to deal with disease, hostile natives, and starvation), but they would make it an extremely\u00A0undesirable place to live- in turn making it difficult to attract new colonists. \u00A0So burying habutats in the first year or two would be an extremely prudent

Sorry, but I choose NASA... my personal experience with Chernobyl was here just to illustrate danger of radiation...man, when I see that chart it\u0027s\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E double\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of the amount of radiation we get here behind magnetic field shield. I don\u0027t doubt you are an scientist in real life, somebody without proper education couldn\u0027t write such thread, but you are biased to Musk\u0027s vision... I\u0027m not, that\u0027s all. Should he coat ships in RFX1? Sure,\u003Cstrong\u003E if\u003C/strong\u003E he can pay for it!

Should he dig in habitats inside the mountain? Sure\u003Cstrong\u003E, if\u003C/strong\u003E he can land robotic drillers there first, together with network of satellites to remotely control them! Again I think he bit more he can chew... we first need an infrastructure in orbit... a space dock for the beginning... his reusable rockets could help a lot there... space elevator would be even better. Also in my humble opinion\u00A0 he should hire those two guys from Skunkworks... Dr Harold \u201CSonny\u201D White and the other one (I don\u0027t remember his name) and give them REAL proper lab and money... not a mediocre lab and a shoe lace budget... Again, in my humble opinion \u003Cstrong\u003Espeed\u003C/strong\u003E is the key here. And btw why does \u0022scientific community\u0022 (whatever that means/is) delays publication of Emdrive peer reviewed paper for almost a year? Could it be because it\u0027s highly disruptive technology which renders all of the airplane\u0027s fleet\u0027s and airport\u0027s infrastructure\u0027s obsolete/useless in a very short time span? Like the famous comedian Russel Peters had said \u0022somebody is going to be hurt really bad!\u0022 Sadly, all comes down to state, politics, and protection of \u0022elite\u0027s\u0022 (bunch of crooks and thieves) interests and money... and we need much more than one Musk to get off this rock...
