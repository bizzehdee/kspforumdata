There is no science you can name on Mars that could not be done remotely. There is no science you could do with people on Mars that could not be done better with robots given the same resources to accomplish them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reality is that manned spaceflight is not done for science, but for excitement/adventure/flash. Manned flight is also vastly more expensive to do for any given science\u00A0goal. Probes will not get the budget that manned flight will get. Look at the Senate Launch System and Orion. A rocket without a purpose to launch a spacecraft without a purpose. Science will benefit as NASA is forced to build stuff to put on top of a ridiculously large rocket, but the only reason they have the rocket is to launch a manned craft. That craft, Orion, has as a first mission going off to do something that could be better done by a robot at far less cost/risk. Bottom line is that any science benefits from manned spaceflight are in fact just gravy, not actually the point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-30T19:10:05Z\u0022 title=\u002201/30/2016 07:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by tater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fredinno","CreatedById":143381,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-30T20:08:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222386126\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022130009\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221454151097\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u00227272\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nibb31\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, Nibb31 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, but 10 rovers that cover the same distance 12 hours a day over 5 years are going to give you a wider variety of samples than a single human stumbling around a limited area for 2 hours a day for 6 months.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are underestimating how hard it was for the Apollo astronauts to move around.
