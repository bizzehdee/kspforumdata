It\u0027s already traveling close to speed of light in its local frame, and you add frame dragging to it and you get an FTL total.

But it won\u0027t really have anything to do with what we think of as speed in physics. In order for there to be a speed, there has to be a signal group propagation, which implies lack of symmetry, and then it\u0027s not a singularity anymore.

Imagine you have a perfect cube of empty space-time and you could move it where you wanted to, now imagine if you could push that cube of empty space toward a black hole, as it approached the event horizon 1 of its dimensions would shrink to nothing (quantum space time intercellular distances would only be relevant in 2 dimension, a curvature on the surface at the event horizon) as it touched the event horizon its time dimension would fade (in other words watching a clock on the object slow and then stop, just like a photon it would no longer age), and as it crossed the horizon its 2 remaining dimensions would fuse leaving one dimension. As you precede to the event this has consequences, because your 3 dimension fill with quantum foam and since this alters your perception of distance your eyes percieve your feet and the top of your head moving away from you at the speed of light, eventually your body parts stretch out and then vanish.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is in essence the communication problem, there is a belief in quantum mechanics that all starting states can be reconciled with events in the future, that system information is propagated forward in time, but when information crosses the black holes event horizon the information is seemingly lost, but through the processes of quantum space-time at the boundary and Hawkings radiation the information is preserved. Since we cannot see into a black hole from an observer its a quantum singularity, which means its one-dimensional, but the radiation that comes from a black hole emanates from the shell representing the event horizon, this is a form of communication. Its somewhat a contradication and somewhat not, the information at the surface is not due to the dimensionality of the information inside, simply the amount of energy the shell is a result of the energy within. The observable shell is not shaped by the shape of \u003Cem\u003Ethings\u003C/em\u003E inside, those things exist in a non-observable sub-universe, but the position and shape is due to the center of energy of that non-observable system and can be represented by a singularity floating around in \u0027our\u0027 space-time (oxymoron but useful since the differences in motion outside of the black hole are trivial relative to the space-time at the event horizon).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thing to remember, black holes curve space time, this creates alot of contradictions, so there are alot of guesses about what goes on inside of a black hole. If we follow the trend at the even horizon your XZ dimensions eventually shrink its as if you become a conical strand of spagetti that shrinks to nothing as you merge at the center. As you the internal observer, cross the horizon your lines compress into a point roughly at c, This create contradictions on how space-time should behave, particularly at the quauntum level, these contradictions can best be handled by creating an unknown physical state such as the starting state of the universe. In other we arge given an universal starting state and inflation then Universe. By the same token we can argue given a intense warping of space time then we have end state, black hole, and you don\u0027t have to muck around with the contradictions internal structures within our laws of physics.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tullius","CreatedById":168049,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-25T16:38:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222729193\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022146502\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221472131448\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129408\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerbiloid\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, kerbiloid said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, I understand this.
