Stop pumping from some of the tanks and you reduce thrust.

Nuclear reactors are throttled through control of thermal neutron flux, but unshielded reactors also spew them in all directions, including towards other reactors, this keeping the entire cluster working effectively will be a bother - let alone selectively shutting down some of the engines.
