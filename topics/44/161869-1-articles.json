How do we store information afterwards given that even paper would be unavailable after a few years, how do we choose what is and isn\u0027t important enough to save? I predict a massive loss of historical data, resulting in the later generations knowing almost nothing of Earth other than it being the dead husk in the sky. And without computers, how are important systems going to be managed? If 3D Printing is available, then it could be possible to assemble more primitive computers in the place of the decaying modern ones, this would be a reversion to 70s/80s computing power, but such things as e-mail and social networking as well as data storage would still be possible, not to mention basic task management.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the original habitats break down, I expect a gradual migration underground. Some old-Terran equipment would be unrecoverable, such as modern PC\u0027s which have a transistor density so great as to be impossible to construct for another few centuries at least.

My thoughts:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt population of 20 000 what is a likely demographics? A Moon base with Earth still intact is clearly massively dependent on import of materials from Earth. You say the colony is fully independent, so we have to go with that,\u00A0let\u0027s assume that they are visionaries and decided to over engineer their hydroponics gardens and that the food is not a problem. So we are only dealing with stuff that can not be produced on the Moon. You guys have already mentioned computers, that is clearly not going to happen on the moon in a while, but a more immediate problem I see is nitrogen. Surface of the Moon has no known sources of nitrogen of concentrations higher than \u0022trace\u0022. Unfortunately, nitrogen is essential for a space based colony and I would assume that the bulk of it was imported from Earth during the construction. Since the plaque is in full effect, what now? Do we risk the colony and the entirety of human race and still go to Earth for more nitrogen, or do we slowly bleed it until there is none left? After all, with every airlock opening you lose some, it bleeds through the walls and floors, it is fixated into the soil by the plants, it is lost on a daily basis. A\u00A0ram jet space plane scoop\u00A0thing clipping the fringes of Earths atmosphere could conceivably collect nitrogen, but it\u0027s a risky thing to do. What if you bring the plaque home? An\u00A0alternative is mining asteroids. Do we have the technology to do that? This capability is of utmost importance. Without it there is no survival. The ability to\u00A0mine\u00A0asteroids for volatiles is not optional and while we\u0027re at it, we can mine all that iron/nickel/name your metal as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCouple of you guys mention genetic bottleneck. I don\u0027t thing that would be a problem if the colony adopts what is essentially a breeding program - eugenics. With careful planning and potentially genetic sequencing 20k individuals should be more than enough for a healthy population, in that regard. As for the implementation of the process itself, it could be based on the process of child adoption, artificial insemination, surrogate mothers etc... The child does not need to be the biological offspring of the parents that raise him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack to technical issues, namely habitat. Imagine that the Moon colony was just in the process of building an expansion, a large new habitat capable of housing, let\u0027s say, 2000, intended for visitors/tourists from Earth. At the moment of plague outbreak, the building process was nearing completion, it was pressurized and construction crews were working on interior. We can pick whichever phase this to be in. If our story is to be gritty, the habitat can be bare walls with only extension cables running to a relatively few places since the electrical installations haven\u0027t been put in place yet. The habitat is mostly dark as there are only a few lights here and there.\u00A0We can choose if there is a\u00A0functional plumbing\u00A0system (water or sewage). In this case, the story can revolve around the infighting between the main habitat habitants and those that have moved into this new barren part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, if the construction workers are already finished and the habitat is ready for new residents, we can decide to jumpstart the population (make a baby, get an apartment deal) or\u00A0turn the new habitat into a new industrial park\u00A0or expand the hydroponics\u00A0or plant a forest to complement the CO2 scrubbers that are near max capacity.... Possibilities are endless.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat bothers me is the eventual degeneration of materials. You can use a spacesuit only so much before it starts to leak and can patch it up only a limited number of times. Eventually you will need new spacesuits and for that you will need special artificial fabrics. How do colonists produce them? Not only that, but how do they make helmets? They need to figure out how to make glass visors and metal/composite shells that are airtight. Sooner or later even metal parts will wear out and you will need to figure out metallurgy. Here on Earth, we use huge machines to produce even the simple iron. What do we do with the outgassing and all the fumes from the production process? You need to filter that before returning it into the habitat. Venting into space is not an option. You can\u0027t afford it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll in all, for the sci-fi story, you can set up the scenario to suit you and guide the story in whichever direction you want. If you ever get stuck, you can always introduce some small\u00A0mining colony in the asteroid belt that saves the day with an asteroid haul. If it\u0027s for real, the fate of the colony depends on very specific details that can lead to any number of different outcomes. A single mishap can destroy the colony (catastrophic failure of hydroponics because a certain bacterial strain emerged and wiped out all the potato, leading to overstraining on the rest of the system).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-10T06:30:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223086641\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022161869\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221497075580\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002245577\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shpaget\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 minutes ago, Shpaget said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnitrogen\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOriginally a colony presumed to be self-sustained should have large amounts of imported nitrogen-containing materials (just for daily purposes).\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, they have some time reserve.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut this clearly define their long-time aim: colonize Titan proximities asap.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-Velocity-","CreatedById":74097,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-10T06:31:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf they have the technology to be truly self-sufficient, that technology takes a long time to develop, and during the time that that technology is developing, colonies will have been established on Mars and maybe some asteroids or in orbit. \u00A0So they wouldn\u0027t be alone.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf they are not truly self sufficient, then they will die eventually given enough time. \u00A0Considering that self-sufficiency is probably a requirement for a very large space colony, a non-self-sufficient colony will probably\u00A0be too small probably to develop the tech they need to become self-sufficient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best hope a small colony that is not truly self sufficient yet would have would be to wait until Earth became habitable again, and then return. \u00A0Then again- how would they get people home? \u00A0They probably do not have enough seats in the spacecraft they had left on the moon to get a few thousand colonists\u00A0back to the surface of the Earth. \u00A0So they might try to jury-rig something really crude together to try to get people back.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-10T06:36:32Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2017 06:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by -Velocity-\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-10T09:51:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it\u0027s really self-sufficient then it\u0027s not hard to regenerate things back to what it was I think.
