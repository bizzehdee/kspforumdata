I\u0027m guessing it\u0027ll be easiest if I just post the question and where I\u0027m up to.\n\nQ: X and Y are independent random variables with variances 4 and 12 respectively. Find the correlation coefficient between 2X\u002BY and 5X-Y.\n\nWhere I\u0027m up to so far\n\nX~N(x, 4) and Y~N(y, 12) (I\u0027ll use x and y as the means, I don\u0027t know how to get the actual symbols)\n\nSo call 2X\u002BY A, and 5X-Y B, then A~N(2x\u002By, 28) and B~N(5x-y, 112)\n\nI\u0027ll just say that there were n numbers taken from each distribution\n\nThen I got S\u003Csub\u003Eaa\u003C/sub\u003E=28n, and S\u003Csub\u003Ebb\u003C/sub\u003E=112n, so the denominator for the correlation coefficient should be the square root of 28n\\*112n, which comes out as 56n. So I already know the **denominator is 56n**\n\n(I\u0027ll also use {Sum} in place of a summation sign, again I don\u0027t know how to get those on here)\n\nWhere I\u0027m stuck is at finding the numerator. I expanded out S\u003Csub\u003Eab\u003C/sub\u003E={Sum}(a\u003Csub\u003Ei\u003C/sub\u003E-a)(b\u003Csub\u003Ei\u003C/sub\u003E-![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) to get this...\n\nS\u003Csub\u003Eab\u003C/sub\u003E= {Sum}a\u003Csub\u003Ei\u003C/sub\u003Eb\u003Csub\u003Ei\u003C/sub\u003E - b{Sum}a\u003Csub\u003Ei\u003C/sub\u003E - a{Sum}b\u003Csub\u003Ei\u003C/sub\u003E \u002Bab\n\nBut {Sum}a\u003Csub\u003Ei\u003C/sub\u003E = a\\*n, and similar for {Sum}b\u003Csub\u003Ei\u003C/sub\u003E\n\nSo then **S**\u003Csub\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eab\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/sub\u003E **= ab - 2abn \u002B {Sum}a**\u003Csub\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ei\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/sub\u003E**b**\u003Csub\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ei\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/sub\u003E\n\n=\u003E **S**\u003Csub\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eab\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/sub\u003E **= ab(1-2n) \u002B {Sum}a**\u003Csub\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ei\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/sub\u003E**b**\u003Csub\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ei\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/sub\u003E\n\nNow, at this point I\u0027m thinking I could just find the mean of A\\*B, and multiply this by n to get {Sum}a\u003Csub\u003Ei\u003C/sub\u003Eb\u003Csub\u003Ei\u003C/sub\u003E. But I have no idea how I could find a distribution for A\\*B, all I know is I can\u0027t simply multiply the means of each distribution. \n\nI hope this made sense, and any help would really be appreciated.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-29T15:22:46Z\u0022 title=\u002203/29/2015 03:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mb12777**"},{"CreatedByName":"mb12777","CreatedById":77529,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T17:01:03Z","Content":"Bump it up...
