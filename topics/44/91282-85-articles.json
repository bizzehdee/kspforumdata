Also, water vapor is part of cycles and feedback loops, like much of chemical erosion and physical transport of sediments, etc. Thus accelerating some processes or slowing them down, depending on its abundance and form of appearance. The weathering of a mountain range can have a global cooling effect on a geological timescale by binding atmospheric Co2, extreme weathering can even play a role in initiating an ice house.

So rather than production of water vapour being a problem, it is\u00A0the average temperature of the globe that affects the held\u00A0water vapour content of the atmosphere, so in that regard, it is relevant to global climate change discussions, but more as a symptom rather than a cause.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIncrease water vapour production (with hydrogen cars) and all you do is increase rainfall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut if other \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Epersistent \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003Egreenhouse gases cause a global temperature increase, the capacity of the atmosphere to hold water vapour increases, adding its greenhouse effect.
