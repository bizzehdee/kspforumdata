(Mammal =\u0026gt; mammary.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) A trained zoologist/paleontologist can recognize mammals from fossils. Distinguishing features include the dentary-squamosal jaw joint, the presence of three bones in the middle ear, prismatic enamel on the teeth, and the presence of a second knob on the underside of the occipital bone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) DNA evidence is harder to use than you suggest. We typically do not have DNA samples from extinct species, so you can\u0027t just compare. Nor do we usually know what phenotypic characteristics a particular gene gives rise to (i.e. we don\u0027t know all of the genes responsible for mammary gland development.) Dawkins gives a really good description of how DNA is used to construct phylogenetic family trees in \u003Cem\u003EThe Ancestor\u0027s Tale\u003C/em\u003E. But IIRC, it involves melting DNA strands and allowing them to re-anneal with the strand they\u0027re being compared to, then observing how well the hybrid strands bind to each other. This allows you to find the genetic distance between living species, but not between living species and fossils.

Cladistics is an optimization analysis, where distinguishing fossil traits are grouped, using computer programs for optimization, to produce the most likely distribution of traits along a lineage tree.
