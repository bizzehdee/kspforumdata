The membrane they are firing the UV through is oxygen permeable, and the plastic doesn\u0027t cure where oxygen is present, create sharp boundaries between the printed regions.\n\nThis is brilliant. It eliminates most of the flaws I have seen with plastic printed parts - they have these clearly visible seams between layers, and a rough surface. Parts out of this machine are continuous, mathematically smooth contours. \n\nIt\u0027s much, much faster - printing with a 2d image means it takes a lot less time. And it\u0027s much stronger - a continuous process can be optimized for maximum mechanical strength. A \u0022layered\u0022 process can\u0027t because there is variance in the layers.\n\nSo, how can this be done with metal? You could use several scanning beam projectors to create a 2d laser image on the metal surface. You use several so the beams overlap and create a smoother, higher resolution image. With quality optics, there would be enough beam intensity to melt metal powder.\n\nHowever, how do you get new pieces of metal powder to the surface in a continuous manner? You can\u0027t have the metal in a liquid form because heating it would only make it more molten. If you try to use liquid as a carrier, you are contaminating the metal with whatever the liquid is. \n\nThe only thing that comes to mind is if the pieces of metal are extremely tiny - smaller than the wavelength of laser light - the light would diffract around them. So, in a vacuum chamber, you would be spraying this continuous mist of metal pieces towards a surface. The laser beams would shine right through the mist to the surface, continually adding features. Anyone have a better idea?"},{"CreatedByName":"Mazon Del","CreatedById":32991,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T19:23:35Z","Content":"Most super high end \u0027standard\u0027 type deposition printers have the striations (layers) at far too fine a level for human senses to detect. For home printers (anything less than say $10K), you are likely going with methods that would cause the striations. I myself have three printers that do this.\n\nThe primary way to look at the speed advantage of this system (which strictly speaking is actually not a new system, it\u0027s just \u0027new\u0027 because the patents on it expired within the last year, so now little guys and startups can suddenly sell the tech in not-million-dollar formats) is that it is producing the entire \u0027layer\u0027 at the same instant whereas a print-head is like moving a single pixel around.\n\nThe way you do this with metal is pretty much the way we\u0027ve been doing it with metal this whole time. You have an arm (think the scanner light inside a photocopier) that sweeps across the part dropping down the fine metal dust particles of your chosen metallurgy and after the arm has swung by then really quickly a laser zap-fries the top surface in the design you want for that layer (pretty much as you described). This slightly melts the metal so that it merges with the previous layers. This method is \u0027fast\u0027 in that it is much faster than a print-head style printer while maintaining crazy good tolerances, but it\u0027s speed is ultimately limited to how quickly the deposition arm can make its sweeps while insuring that the powder falls in sufficient quantity over the part to guarantee coverage.\n\nThis method was actually the first used for liquid printers, except it was a spray line. Eventually they went full liquid immersion with all kinds of fancy tricks. Industry 3D printing tech is about 10-15 years of what you can snag for home tech. However, a lot of the very earliest patents are expiring which means that you can make a company based off of selling products using that tech without having to pay for royalties. Or perhaps to be more true to history, you can make a company that sells them at all. The makers of 3D printers have always been aware of how game changing their tech can become, and so they have hoarded their patents from each other as tightly as they can. Excluding some relatively rare cases, the tech never left their control over the course of the patents.\n\nThe unfortunate limitation when it comes to metal, is that unless we did something silly like using x-ray radiation that can pass through the metal (and do a converging beams style of heating) we are limited by the fact that the metal will block any attempts to melt it. Plastic (like the liquid plastic) has the advantage that you can play loads of fun molecular games with the long/short chains involved to get them to do things like cure under specialized conditions such that your UV light won\u0027t cure unnecessary plastic. Metal though, is just what it is. And what it is, is something that blocks the energy. I do believe (but I have no citations) that there have been attempts at using a relatively constant outpouring of a metal-particulate impregnated gas combined with the converging beam heating tech, but the results have not been particularly noteworthy.\n\nI am not aware (but am not a definitive source of info on this topic) of any attempts to do the sub-wavelength particle vacuum chamber idea. However, some issues that would likely result from this can primarily be summed up as cost. Churning out the pounds of sub-wavelength metal dust is likely to be a hideously expensive proposition and I doubt any printer manufacturer worth their reputation would be willing to let their warranties cover you scooping up the old unused dust and reusing it. Too much of a chance that a given particle had been heated up just enough somehow and joined with another one, ruining the consistency of the granular size and being more likely to clog your nozzles. Plus they are price gouging jerks."},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T19:48:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This is brilliant. It eliminates most of the flaws I have seen with plastic printed parts - they have these clearly visible seams between layers, and a rough surface. Parts out of this machine are continuous, mathematically smooth contours.\n\nThe promotional story sounds great, but I am left to wonder about the accuracy of the statements and many of the traditional issues with SLA printers. This software still needs to slice the project into layers. You can get a very fine resolution, possibly one that is greater than the roughness of the material. That would make them continuous for all intents and purposes, but not mathematically so. It is, in essence, still the same process, they just upgraded and fine-tuned it.\n\nThen there are the two classical objections to SLA:\n\n- The resin typically is very expensive, prohibiting freely printing whatever you need. Being able to do stuff quickly is nice, but when there is another hurdle like that, it still might be in vain.\n\n- These resins are generally of limited mechanical use. Cool for fancy trinkets, but useless if you want to make anything useful.\n\nThe last two have been, and by the looks of it still are, *the* big problems with SLS. Do not get me wrong, these are very exciting developments, but every printing company seems to make amazing claims.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The only thing that comes to mind is if the pieces of metal are extremely tiny - smaller than the wavelength of laser light - the light would diffract around them.

Anyone have a better idea?\n\nThough using a much more traditional approach, Renishaw makes (very, very expensive) printers that laser melt powder together. You can print in steel, titanium or other engineering grade alloys. Though there are layers, they are up to and probably well beyond the roughness traditional techniques like sand casting leave.\n\nPeople wanting to improve the roughness of plastic FDM prints I fully understand, but let us not forget that pretty much all traditional techniques also leave very distinct, and sometimes very obvious, tool and production marks.\n\n![a586fe026cc344489c8b26326499f750.jpg](http://www.renishaw.com/media/img/gen/a586fe026cc344489c8b26326499f750.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Iskierka","CreatedById":2116,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T21:05:09Z","Content":"Do bear in mind also that there are a number of metals which cannot be usefully printed - particularly as they may have properties that emerge from the way they are machined. Cold-rolled, hot-rolled, cast, forged, and all sorts of other variations on steel all have different material properties, and 3D printing will only be able to produce its particular property set (which will likely be most similar to cast). Milling and other machining techniques then perform work hardening on the material, in various different ways, meaning the 3D printing won\u0027t be the be-all end-all to manufacturing metal components - for many, it will still be more desirable to cast in a mould and then perform milling as it would have traditionally been done.\n\nAlso, maximum mechanical strength in a metal can\u0027t be achieved by this method. It\u0027s not enough of an advantage to actually be bothered with in most alloys, but with inconel it certainly is, and this has to be achieved by careful cooling of molten inconel in a mould over the course of around a week, forcing the metal structure to develop as a single crystal. The resulting components are then worked as needed to produce the final properties required. None of this process can be done by 3D printing, except for mould creation, which is already done in its most common application, the manufacture of jet turbine blades. 3D printing is interesting, but won\u0027t produce a flawless crystal structure in the metal, which can be achieved with moulds."},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T21:14:05Z","Content":"What we need is a 3D printer that can print wax.

So what it ends up doing is 3D print some of the part using the welder, and once it is about to get to a spot where the printing would cause it issues with the next step, it puts the welder away and then grabs cutting tools.
