The density of the antimatter itself does very little to impact the density of it when stored electromagnetically, and electromagnetic antimatter storage does not require ferromagnetic antimatter (that might even hinder storage attempts).

We\u0027re not really trying to make antimatter storage, so \u0022current technology\u0022 in this area\u00A0does not exist. There are a couple of designs that, if built, would be better at storing antimatter than anything we have.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, you\u0027re barking up the wrong tree. You focused on storage efficiency, but that doesn\u0027t matter at all. Why don\u0027t we have battery-powered rockets, then? Electron is not the case, it\u0027s a chemical rocket with electric engine pumps.\u00A0What matter is energy per unit of mass. There, antimatter leaves everything in the dust due to simple physics. As long as your storage method is sensible (say, a frozen ball of antihydrogen\u00A0suspended with superconducting magnets), you can\u0027t beat that even with fusion power. Not only that, gamma rays are actually \u003Cem\u003Eperfect \u003C/em\u003Efor energy conversion, exactly because they generate heat (and guess what\u0027s the easiest way of getting useful energy out of something. That\u0027s right, a heat engine). It\u0027s the other\u00A0particles that are problematic, and only neutrinos\u00A0are a total loss, in a well designed reactor or rocket engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had pointed out in my previous post that both antimatter\u0027s specific energy and energy density are only comparable to fission when factoring in storage and energy liberation. It\u0027s quite probably that this may improve with time, but so may fission and fusion technologies. Furthermore, fusion can very handily beat antimatter in terms of energy density (per volume, not mass), as Ultra Dense Deuterium can have a density of 130 kg/cm^3, which is more than enough to make up for the lower specific energy of fusion compared to antimatter. Both specific energy and energy density are important to have, with certain applications valuing one over the other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile heat engines are certainly the efficient and one of the simplest ways of harnessing\u00A0energy, they are not very mass efficient, so if trying to minimize the mass of your antimatter fuel cell, alternative methods of energy extraction are preferred. Magnetohydrodynamic generators, while slightly less efficient, are far lighter and more compact than a heat engine (which is why they are often proposed for fission, fusion, and antimatter bimodal power generation on spacecraft instead of more traditional brayton cycle heat engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsidering this discussion is about general uses for antimatter, not specifically in rocketry, discussing the storage efficiency of the antimatter batteries previously \u003Cu\u003Ebrought up in the original post\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0seems like a fairly reasonable tree to bark up. Additionally, we don\u0027t have battery powered rockets for the same reason we don\u0027t have fission\u00A0powered phones, it doesn\u0027t have the desired properties for the application with our current level of technology.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGamma rays are\u00A0pretty useful in heat engines\u00A0and antimatter thermal rockets, but not in MHD generators. This is because MHD generators work with charged particles (which photons are not). Similarly in more advanced antimatter beam-core/pion-core rockets, only charged pions can be magnetically directed as exhaust. These charged pions eventually decay into neutrinos and muons (which decay into more neutrinos), which can lead to some losses via scattering. Neutral\u00A0pions and gamma ray photons, not having an electric charge, cannot not be redirected as exhaust and heat up the rocket, facilitating the use of an ungodly amount of radiators.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-10T01:50:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223768707\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022192999\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221586482048\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002251745\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022wafflemoder\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 minutes ago, wafflemoder said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(per volume, not mass)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLast time I checked, only mass factored into rocket equation, not volume. Volume efficiency is nice, but it\u0027s not what you\u0027re after if you\u0027re using antimatter for propulsion. For weapons, maybe, but in that case, antimatter is more useful for lighting a fusion bomb than as the main charge, especially in space.

Antimatter thermal is a perfectly viable means of propulsion, and much less complex than beam core. Also, MHD can work with any kind of hot gas (such as coal powerplant exhaust, which is what they\u0027re used for right now), so if you can use these gammas and pions to make hot gas, you can use them for MHD, as well. In fact, with antimatter thermal, you can get anywhere in the solar system with a mass ratio of about 2 and a tiny amount of antimatter. This is due to a quirk in how rocket equation works.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternatively, just make the walls thin. The rocket will spew highly energetic radiation, but not heat up nearly as much. This will not eliminate waste heat, but will limit it considerably.
