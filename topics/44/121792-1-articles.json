Alge\u002Bwater is better, but only because we are dealing with water. Instead, make the farming modules outside of the shielded areas, and use a thin layer of depleted uranium followed by a plastic of some sort ended with a nice thick sheet of lead. The lead only needs to be around a few centimeters thick as the brunt of the impact is absorbed by the depleted uranium which makes a far more efficient shielding material, though upon exposure to high energy cosmic rays would produce some neutrons and gamma rays. Another thing to note is the utility in machinery being twofold, one, it does stuff, but it also can be used as shielding. Thus you could place your algae farms, radiators, and everything that you can around the heavily shielded areas thus preventing them from being exposed to as much radiation while not adding any mass in the form of conventional shielding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should also be noted that the really high energy radiation usually has warning before it arrives, thus you should be able to get to a sheltered room in time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-27T07:46:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou just need mass.

Most proposals use unprocessed regolith as shielding, BTW, or the slag form the colony construction.

Oh, and everything contributes more or less the same way: you are worried about GCR mainly, so the only thing that works is to put a lot of mass between you and them.

If you use steel instead of water, it means the inner ring tracks are attached to several meters of metal. There is absolutely no chance they are going to fail. (well, magnet failures, but there are passive ways to do this where the magnets are just coils of wire that have to be intact to work)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe transition car - essentially a maglev car riding a set of rails in between the 2 colony disks - works by driving itself faster and faster (using a linear motor embedded in the track it is riding on probably) until it matches speed with one disk or the other. It then extends a gantry to the hatch on the colony disk in question. The gantry would be designed to break off in the event of it extending to the wrong disk. Passengers board, and sit in special chairs that rotate so the passengers are lying on their back with respect to the G forces. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransit car transitions - amusingly, it could accelerate harder when the relative speed of the car is lower, keeping the gravity experienced by the passengers to a steady 1.5 G or so, and the seats would rotate in 2 dimensions. (they would be able to rotate 180 degrees, and also adjust their angle of tilt with respect to the floor). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, you can actually use the track and the outer ring it is supporting as part of the structure. All the pieces of the colony would exert pressure down on the maglev track and this essentially becomes hoop stress on the outer, stationary ring. So the radiation shielding is also part of the structure, yet it is not adding to the structural strain on the structure as it is not spinning.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-27T17:40:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei do like the double hull concept. you have an external pressure/shielding hull with an internal centrifuge hull on magnetic bearings. you could float around the internal hull unsuited, though the internal hull has its own emergency pressurization system in case the outer hull is breached. you can use multiple habitat rings for neutral torque or you can use a lighter disc at higher rpm to counter out the torque of the habitat. you could also have a number of rings with different gravity levels for different purposes, a low gravity havier industrial ring spinning at a lower rpm than a lighter habitat ring would not only balance out but also make heavy industrial operations require less effort due to reduced gravity. the whole solar exposed area of the station would be covered in solar panels or a solar-thermal plant (replaced by a nuclear fission or fusion reactor on orbits too far from the sun). so crops will require large scale hydroponic growing operations in artificial light which can be more finely tuned to specific crops. having a large pressurized outer hull is useful for large scale space construction, you can build space craft or work on strip mining a chunk of asteroid entirely in a shirt sleeve environment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kibble","CreatedById":131042,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-27T20:19:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDandridge M.
