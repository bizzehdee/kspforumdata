Quite the opposite. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe natural units where C = G = h = 1 make defining quantum and relativistic phenenema easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor all its worth, it is seldom used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe primary reason is that G, the gravitational constant, cannot be defined beyond the 3rd digit. Recently papers have cited errors in experiments using different means of supercooling. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe critical problem with measuring G from celestials are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-object density is estimated\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-N-body problem in a galaxy that has dark matter at an unknown distance from where G is being measured. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-In the laboratory mass is so low that attraction is relatively small. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-In space only relative gravity changes can be measured accurately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-mass of most objects is a function of energy (e.g. quark gluon interaction energy explains the overwhelming majority of mass in an object) getting rid of spurious energy for a true resting mass on a non-spinning object, difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe argument of the other post centers around the assumption that gravity is well-defined, but comparatively speaking, gravity is not well-defined, it is approximated. This compares to measures of C defined precisely, and because h is a function of wavelength, the measure by which C defines a meter, planks constant is also well-defined. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EG is the odd man out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-04T05:11:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMeh.
