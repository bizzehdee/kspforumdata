The worst thing is that it\u0027s going to take funding from Earth science programs.\n\nIt\u0027s quite obvious why they are taking away funding from the Earth science programs, that means the SLS needs to be named accordingly.\n\nI\u0027m opting for CO2.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T08:51:28Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 08:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Albert VDS**"},{"CreatedByName":"Darnok","CreatedById":85708,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T10:13:33Z","Content":"SVB - Saturn V with Boosters?"},{"CreatedByName":"AbhChallenger","CreatedById":106911,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T10:58:17Z","Content":"The Carbon Space Launch System.

The Ares was supposedly cancelled with the constellation program, but the MPCV was brought back, then given back its name Orion. Ares should get its name back as well.\n\nBut it\u0027s clear why its taking funding from the Earth Science programs. Ted Cruz, antiscience senator, is in control of NASA funding. Of course he doesn\u0027t like the political implications of the climate science program, so he\u0027s putting it to \u0022better\u0022 efforts.\n\nI feel really selfish right now, but I am almost happy that the deep space programs are being given funding.
