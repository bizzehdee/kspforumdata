Unlike those worlds, however, I was envisioning something far enough away from its parent star to not have lost its primordial hydrogen/helium envelope from ultraviolet exposure.\n\nI found my way to [this paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.0329v1.pdf), which contains this quote:\n\n\u0022...if we assume a more typical low-mass planet with a 5 [Earth-mass] core, then to be 2.0 [Earth-radii] it would need 0.5% of its mass in a H/He envelope. This may not sound like much, but it corresponds to ~20 kbars of hydrogen and helium, ~20x higher than the pressure at the bottom of the Marian[]as Trench. Moreover, the temperature at the bottom of such an envelope would be \u003E~3000K... We believe that such a planet is more properly classified as a sub-Neptune.\u0022\n\nWell, that\u0027s obviously more than I\u0027m going for. So after ruminating a bit and consulting the tables in that paper, I decided on the following planetary characteristics:\n\nMass: 4.2 MKerbin (2.222463306 x10^23 kg)\n\nEquatorial Radius: 1.5 RKerbin (900,000 m)\n\nFrom that I derived:\n\nGravity: 18.308158834093 m/s^2 (~1.867 G)\n\nSo far, so good. I also decided on .01% of the planetary mass tied up in the atmosphere. From that I derived:\n\nSurface-level pressure: ~39974624 Pa = ~394.5 atm\n\nHeady, but survivable by human-made craft, although compared to Eve\u0027s 5 atmospheres at sea level, getting back is going to be... challenging. I also arbitrarily decided on 3.5 g/mol for the mean molecular weight of the planetary atmosphere, on the theory that volcanism, and probably atmospheric processes, would dump some heavier elements into the atmosphere, but it would remain largely H/He. (I have no idea how realistic a figure this is, but compare to 2.07 for Saturn, 2.64 for Uranus.)\n\nUnfortunately, that\u0027s where my very limited command of physics hits the wall. I have no idea how to derive the density, (probably enormous) surface-level temperature, or volume of this atmosphere, but I am given to believe that without one of those three things I can\u0027t calculate the others. If I have to make up one of those values, I don\u0027t know what a good starting point would be. If I can get temperature, I understand I can figure out the scale height and, from there, a reasonable extrapolation of the height of the atmosphere.\n\nThe other question I have is, what would conditions on this theoretical world be like? Given the described pressure and atmosphere (and whatever the derived temperature is), would the atmosphere still be gaseous at surface level? Would landing using stock parts even be feasible, or would the temperature be too intense (or would moving through such a thick atmosphere at any appreciable speed -- like that necessary to achieve orbit -- cause such significant overheating as to destroy the craft)? If landing is feasible, what about liftoff?\n\nAssuming the goal is to have a rocky surface (rather than one encased in a sheath of liquid hydrogen), what would the byplay between the described atmosphere and the surface be? Would the hydrogen be pulled out of the atmosphere into compounds? What impact would typical (terrestrial) levels of volcanism have on the atmospheric composition? Does that make my mean molecular weight way too low?\n\nAt the upper end, would the atmosphere be layered (and if so, how)? How would the planet go about retaining its atmosphere? Assuming a distance from Kerbol comparable to real-world TNOs\u0027 distance from the sun, and therefore very cold corresponding temperatures of perhaps 12K-40K, would hydrogen liquefy and precipitate at some altitude? Or would the retained heat of the planet, and any geological activity, keep overall atmospheric temperatures up?\n\nThanks in advance for your thoughts!"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T01:07:26Z","Content":"The atmosphere will be a supercritical fluid. Which means, there is no longer a difference between it being a gas or a liquid. It also means that, unfortunately, most formulae you could have used for scale height are going to be useless. This sort of fluid is very far from ideal gas. The relationship between pressure, volume, and temperature is dominated by molecular interactions rather than ballistic movement of particles in an ideal gas.\n\nFortunately, the goal isn\u0027t to get exact numbers, but rather something plausible. I would assume, for sake of calculations, that density isn\u0027t going to change much once your atmo hits critical pressure. You can\u0027t really model that in KSP, but we\u0027ll pretend for sake of temperature calculations. I also am not sure what the critical pressure of this mix would be, but critical pressure of hydrogen is 12.96 bar, so lets use that. Next, you need pressure at the upper cloud layer, because that\u0027s where radiation equilibrium with the star will establish. Do you know how to compute radiation equilibrium, by the way? Wikipedia\u0027s article on [Black-Body Radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation) has a section called \u0022Temperature of Earth\u0022 that runs through an example. Use that to compute your T\u003Csub\u003E0\u003C/sub\u003E. You also need pressure at cloud layer, P\u003Csub\u003E0\u003C/sub\u003E. I have no idea what that should be, but I\u0027d use pressure of upper cloud layer on smaller gas giants as a guess. From here, I would assume [Adiabatic compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiabatic_process) to your P\u003Csub\u003E1\u003C/sub\u003E, which is your critical pressure of 12.96 bar. Use that to get T\u003Csub\u003E1\u003C/sub\u003E, which you\u0027ll use as surface temperature. Now, this is technically wrong. Atmospheric compression isn\u0027t Adiabatic, but correct model depends on so many factors... And you need an estimate, which this will give you.\n\nFinally, we get back to the question of scale height. Now, KSP actually has support for non-exponential atmosphere in its source code, but I don\u0027t know how to enable it for modded planets, or if it\u0027s even possible, so even though it\u0027s technically isn\u0027t right for supercritical atmo, you\u0027ll still need an H value. As I\u0027ve explained above, anything you\u0027d get from scale height formula is technically wrong. But what I\u0027d do is get scale heights at T\u003Csub\u003E0\u003C/sub\u003E and T\u003Csub\u003E1\u003C/sub\u003E, and use something in between. Real planet probably wouldn\u0027t be anything like that in terms of your ability to escape it, but it should, at least, give you something semi-plausible for landing probes. And that\u0027s probably all you\u0027ll be able to do with this world, so maybe that\u0027s good enough?\n\nFor atmospheric height, just see at what pressure they cut it off in KSP, and use your scale height formula to find the correct cutoff altitude. Again, it\u0027s not really correct, seeing how so many standard assumptions are incompatible with this world, but at least this value will be self-consistent with all the assumptions KSP makes."},{"CreatedByName":"The Hawk","CreatedById":125754,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T16:49:31Z","Content":"Well, the goal is to have solid terrain on which a landing and return is at least theoretically possible even if exceedingly difficult (otherwise it may as well be a gas giant). I\u0027m not married to the above figures if they conflict with that goal. It seems to me the way to accomplish that is either reduce the overall mass of the atmosphere so the pressure is reduced, or increase heavy elements in the composition of the atmosphere such that supercriticality is not an issue.\n\nThe Venusian atmosphere is said to be a supercritical fluid at surface level, and indeed the temperature and pressure there are well above the critical point for CO2, but it still seems to function substantially as a gas and did not prevent probe landings on the surface (though obviously the temperature was a pretty significant problem. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)) I confess, though, that the thought of an atmosphere on the tender edge in terms of pressure, such that below a certain altitude there are \u0022seas\u0022 (as KSP conceives of them) of supercritical fluid, with \u0022islands\u0022 of higher terrain in the gaseous portion of the atmosphere, is interesting to me."},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T22:24:40Z","Content":"Why would liquid \u0022atmosphere\u0022 prevent a probe from landing?

The bigger issue is probably temperature, and whether life is capable of developing in such an atmosphere at all.
