Wars aren\u0027t won when one person or a small group of people \u0022get people to do something\u0022. They are won when people care and do their best. To go back to my economic modernization analogy, Japan didn\u0027t go from a country that, for all intents and purposes, had only 17th century technology, to a great power with a navy rivaling that of the United States in just 70 years \u0022because they got everyone to do something\u0022.

If there is a town with a budget equipped to handle minor flooding and it gets hit by a tsunami, the people don\u0027t panic and leave, they adjust for the conditions of the situation and figure out how to solve things. The reason I made the statements in the previous post was because right now, that isn\u0027t really happening. Goals have been set but these are not enough, at the moment warming by 2100 will be somewhere between 2.0 and 4.9 degrees Celsius- and that assumes these goals are actually pursued and don\u0027t get changed or abandoned in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRapid change has occurred, albeit sloppily, in Japan, the Soviet Union, and China. If despite all of the issues those changes came with, they could still succeed, with the managerial techniques, science, and social awareness/dedication of 2021, I think solving the climate crisis is completely feasible in a short period of time (over the next 29 years), \u003Cem\u003Eif people care\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224078351\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022204060\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221642442451\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002277241\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MKI\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, MKI said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t bring all this up because I don\u0027t believe in climate change, or I want to \u0022alarm\u0022 people into action against it (there\u0027s enough of that).

We do hear about how different companies and governments are \u0022going to solve the climate crisis\u0022 but scientists have looked at the details of these plans and they don\u0027t really add up to what needs to be done. And there isn\u0027t any explanation of this- these companies and governments appear to want us to be fully convinced they \u0022have it in the bag\u0022. And yet, it really isn\u0027t- we are still on track for dangerous warming, despite Tesla and 2050-2060-2070 goals.

If we expect to somehow solve the issue of climate change within our existing understanding of economics and society, we will probably fail. The data is before us, little of what is problematic in trying to solve climate change is understudied or unknown. But if we try to think of solutions while thinking \u0022X entity helping the wider community with nothing in return is outrageous\u0022, what can be done is severely limited.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClimate change isn\u0027t just a \u0022I don\u0027t want hotter summers or I don\u0027t want the pretty tigers to go extinct\u0022 problem- it directly and indirectly threatens millions of lives and livelihoods. If it was the 1920s, I could see the major issues with trying to solve such an issue. But it is 2021. There are no technological or practical issues with solving climate change.

In the case of climate change, while a \u201Chatred\u201D (enemy justifying sacrifice in struggle against said enemy) of climate change is required, this is only possible if people care about the lives and livelihoods climate change might damage or destroy.

I know the beef industry impacts the climate through cow farts, so I decide to skip out on beef entirely. I also know other industries have their own carbon impact such as poultry and port. So I go full vegetarian and buy local. Not only do I need to eat more to keep up my calory intake, I\u0027m also paying more for food that isn\u0027t mass produced.

I now work from home, thus saving on the cost of energy for even charging my car. Now those costs are shifted to whatever costs for power, internet, and home computer setup I needed to do my job from home and offset all the \u003Cstrong\u003Ecosts to the grid\u003C/strong\u003E.

I change jobs to now work for green industries, so I\u0027m directly involved in building the infrastructure to support the green revolution.

Finally, I no longer work/pay for anything related to high carbon industries. \u003Cstrong\u003EThis could be from the obvious such as gas/coal, to more nuance industries like stuff built with non-recyclable plastic and general consumerism.
