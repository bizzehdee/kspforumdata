[...] So you \u0022just\u0022 need a fleet of space telescopes flying in formation across a few dozen kilometers of space, station-keeping with respect to each other with nanometer precision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a few problems with that which go a bit beyond engineering. First, I agree with the ~20km estimate, but that\u0027s just to resolve it as a point. Basically, you\u0027d be able to confirm that it\u0027s not a point object, which we already know. If you want to image anything of its features, you\u0027ll need a significantly larger effective aperture. Just to say, \u0022Hey, look, clouds\u0022 you\u0027ll need something like 10x larger size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, if we are doing this with a swarm, it\u0027s not really a huge problem. We can build an interferometer thousands of km across. In fact, anything smaller than Earth orbit is kind of pointless. But the larger you go, the more challenging it gets with precision. So lets talk about that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting with there not being a terribly good way to build an optical interferometer telescope. It\u0027s easy enough in radio astronomy. We just build an array, record the actual time-dependent signal, and use computers to sort out the rest. We can\u0027t do that with a signal in optical frequencies. So we have to build an actual interferometer. And again, on ground, it\u0027s not impossible. You just have to tune everything, like you said, to nanometer precision. The fact that this is something that\u0027s been understood for many decades, and we still only have a couple of arrays that are actually capable of doing something useful, with a few more planned or under construction, should tell you how difficult a task it is. On the ground, where things don\u0027t shift around, and we can measure distances with incredible precision. Distance is still a limiting factor. Across a few hundred meters, we can use lasers to measure distances very, very precisely. As distances grow, you start having problems. Not only is it hard to measure distances, but they constantly change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then we go to the big problem. Space. First of all, holding station with required precision is impossible. Just forget about that. Things are going to move and drift, and you\u0027ll have to find a way to deal with that. No mechanical system is going to move with sufficient precision and with little enough vibration to allow this to work. You\u0027ll have to measure precise positions of the objects and find non-mechanical ways to adjust distances that beams have to travel. Fortunately, there are electro-optical systems that can work for you, but nearly all of them require polarized light, so you\u0027ll have losses there requiring larger mirrors on telescopes. But that\u0027s ok, we can deal with that. Measurement, though... Lets start with the fact that GPS can pinpoint your position on the ground to within a few meters. You\u0027ll have to do better. Even if we forget about doing this full scale, and try to build a swarm just 200km across somewhere, you\u0027ll end up doing 200x better than GPS on timing along. So we went from error in meters, to that in centimeters. Perhaps, millimeters. We are still 4-5 orders of magnitude short. You can do improvements with the right geometry, doing some adjustments, improve timing techniques used for positioning, and you might be able to shave a couple of orders of magnitude off that. But you are still way short.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing interferometry to image exoplanets is a great idea, but we are not going to do this with modern technology. We can\u0027t. The only way we\u0027ll have chance is if we can do the same thing we do with radio interferometry and do computer processing. And to do that, we need optical computers. When that becomes a standard for computation, we can start talking about ways to build a large space array for imaging exoplanets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MBobrik","CreatedById":59889,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T23:06:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u0022 Lets start with the fact that GPS can pinpoint your position on the ground to within a few meters.

First of all, the 20 km diameter was clearly stated as simply being able to resolve an Earth-sized planet as a \u0022disk\u0022 from 50 light-years. \u0022Resolving as a disk\u0022 is the common term used when we talk about what resolution is required before a point source first begins to resolve. It is obvious I was talking about simply a fuzzy picture of something just barely larger than a point source. Clearly, if you want a true terrestrial planet imager, you\u0027ll need something like on the order of at least 100 km across, and then, you\u0027d only be able to get halfway decent images of the very closest planets. I had almost added that if we could make an interferometer some day with a diameter of 1000 km, we could put the equivalent of 50 pixels across an Earth-like planet 50 light years away, but I cut that part out; I thought it was too much detail and too distant of a proposition. Perhaps I should have left it in to make my meaning more clear?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps I misspoke when I said we can do it with today\u0027s technology, but we should be able to do it soon, especially if more funding and study was put into it. I don\u0027t see where there are any major show-stopper issues. Perhaps I misspoke because what I really mean, when I think of \u0022today\u0027s technology\u0022, is that it is something that we either already have, or could immediately begin research and development on, and have ready in a reasonable time span like 10 or 20 years. Clearly, if we directed NASA to build a space interferometer composed of a separately-flying, telescope constellation, we wouldn\u0027t be getting in for at least 10 years, probably more like 20- just look how long it took for just the \u0022simple\u0022 JWST. But at least, we\u0027d be working on it, and it would be coming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would assuming that station keeping would be accomplished with something like small electric ion thrusters. You can probably have some small adjustable optical elements to make up for really small, fast perturbations. You can determine the precise distance between the spacecraft with laser interferometry, and it is accurate to the required precision for optical interferometry. How can this not be extended to kilometer\u002B distances? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would think that the lack of atmosphere, ground vibrations, the ability to smoothly change the distances between the telescopes means space is a far better environment to build an optical interferometer than the ground. I don\u0027t see what you find so worrisome about drift. In space, perterbation forces are extremely weak, as opposed to on Earth, where we have wind, Earth quakes, even the minor seismic distrubances caused by people walking around or cars passing by; temperature swings, etc. Space is empty and constant. We have the thruster and MEMS technology to precisely position the telescopes, or there is no reason to think we couldn\u0027t develop it. We have laser interferometers capable of measuring extremely precise distances, precise enough for the task.
