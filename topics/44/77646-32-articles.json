And is there a free/inexpensive alternative to start working with? I would like to have ability to design pats in CAD, which would be ready for printing/millilng, but also be able to export them both for use in physics simulation and rendering. If CAD software has ability to build a tessellated version of the part and export it into something import-friendly, like the .obj, that would be ideal. Given a tessellation of a part with constant density, I can easily compute its moments of inertia, and rendering is obviously a snap. Then I can just use something like a simple XML file to \u0022assemble\u0022 the parts for the simulation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, I can work with CAD files all the way, but that\u0027s going to be a lot more work.

In my opinion it is the best CAD program there is....unfortunately its price reflects that. Several thousand for a yearly license. That said though, if one can somehow gain access to it, with someone there to explain it, it is easily possible to learn how to make just about any mechanical shape in an afternoon (I\u0027ve taught a few friends). My friends tend to like openscad because it is cheap and capable, though they describe it as \u0022programming a web page in html, except not html, and its a 3D part.\u0022. Others are freecad, blender, etc. But I admittedly don\u0027t have much experience with those.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally speaking most cad programs (be they open source, cheap, or things like Solidworks) have the ability to output in almost any 3D model format. The usual one for printing and such is the .stl format, as the .stl reduces the parts down to a series of triangles, I think it is what you are wanting. That said, if you do manage to get Solidworks it has a bunch of packages in it for things like stress analysis. Solidworks is also capable of (assuming you are good at informing it the densities and metalurgies of the component parts) information like estimated weight, center of mass, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, failing to contact Mary Musgrave, I have instead contacted a Biology Professor at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (by the name of Luis Vidali).
