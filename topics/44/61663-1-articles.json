And that if for example i was to take another two random values within the original ones i would also have equal number of solutions and impossible solutions (i really dont know what is the opossite of solution in math). What do you think, is it possible to have something like that?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bivouac","CreatedById":68988,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-31T02:48:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis sounds eerily similar to the P vs NP problem.\u003C/a\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-31T02:52:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDepends on the domain of a function.

Hm. It\u0027s definitely possible if we only consider rational numbers. Let me think for a bit if there are any contradictions with requiring this is also true for reals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Here is basically what it boils down to. If you require that on \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E interval the number of points are equal, it automatically demands that both sets are dense with respect to each other. So we need to split real numbers into two sets which are dense in each other, and both of these sets must be uncountable. That will satisfy conditions, but I\u0027m still not sure if this is possible. All of the methods of picking a dense subset of reals I\u0027m coming up with give me a countable subset, which doesn\u0027t satisfy the \u0022equal number\u0022 requirement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit 2: So apparently, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/35748/locally-non-enumerable-dense-subsets-of-r\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe answer is yes\u003C/a\u003E, but I\u0027m having trouble following it.
