You can maneuver like players do in the Asteroids game just fine, and if doing doing rendezvous just fly above or below to slow on aproach to avoid blasting rendezvous ship or station with exhaust. Afterward use up and down thrusters to line up, use side thrust if needed, and and let a docking port extend to attach.
