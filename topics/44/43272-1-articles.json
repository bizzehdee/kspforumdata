The technique is to use a \u0027brass pick\u0027 and a rubber mallet and tap in the center to knock it loose.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI seem to recall removing at least one fly wheel in my day and this technique is foreign to me. What I\u0027m gathering here is that the wheel itself is more or less just \u0027stuck\u0027 on there (perhaps with some little notches that lock it into place) and by tapping on the dimple in the middle it causes the underlying mount to recess and the fly wheel to shift upward (opposite to the direction of the tapping force). I recounted this understanding to the lady and she said, yep that is right. When I asked about putting it back on there she said \u0027it is basically just pressure that holds it on.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre any of you guys familiar with such an operation? Any advice or suggestions?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about this \u0022brass pick\u0022 business!? I may have a socket driver that has a small blunt square end which might fit inside that dimple, but I have never heard of a \u0027brass pick.\u0022 When I asked her about this she said \u0022more like an ice pick\u0022 and I clarified that what they really seemed to be talking about was a \u0022brash punch.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny idea why they would specify brass?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the amount of effort I\u0027m putting into fixing this thing, I\u0027m tempted to just move back to Atlanta; it would be simpler!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bunsen","CreatedById":10598,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T21:14:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI dunno exactly how things are arranged in there, but maybe look for a gear puller? Auto Zone and some similar shops often have free tool loan programs, so you might not even have to buy it. As for recommending a brass punch, I\u0027d guess that\u0027s to insure that any deformation from an over-enthusiastic hammer strike happens to the punch, rather than mushrooming the shaft and making removal impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T21:26:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBunsen already makes some good suggestions, but can you post a picture?
