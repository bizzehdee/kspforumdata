The trend is that not much more will come about.\n\nIf anything, this is more evidence that what is happening now politically will just as easily be reversed in the near future, rather than an indication of a trend. The movement of political influence and the opinions of the public follow trends which are often short lived. Both should be viewed as chaotic systems. You could say that the brain and therefore emotions that govern such decisions are fully deterministic systems, but in the absence of being able to accurately model these extremely complex systems, one should consider emotions to be unpredictable.\n\nTherefore I wouldn\u0027t call what is happening now politically a trend, at least not in terms of anything long term. The rational that governs these decisions usually involves limited sampling of facts, very little modelling of how their decisions will impact the future, and the measures by which they determine the value of endeavors is not always the same. Often times they measure the value of funding based on strategic or \u0022accomplishment\u0022 value, rather than scientific value.\n\nWhether or not this \u0022trend\u0022 lasts long term, gets significantly worse, or gets significantly better, is up to the whim of people, which are usually very short lived trends."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T01:17:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Realism is supposed to be in-between optimism and pessimism.\n\nThat\u0027s like saying rationality is supposed to be in between happiness and sadness.

A mars push is a romantic notion, but until you have Ph.D. boots on martian soil, it will naer amount to much. The private ventures are packaging suicide missions and selling them as huts on tropical islands. \n\nGood science is often built on little tiny steps. We have a lot to learn about surviving in low vacuum environments, add to this extended survival without physical support from earth and top this off with living in a climate in which photosynthetic EM is 1/10th that of Earth. It would take the resources, I estimate, of 20 LEO missions to retreive on neo-martian and bring them back to earth.
