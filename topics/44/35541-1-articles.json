I would think that any sort of time delay would be too unpredictable. \u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sorry if it seems like I\u0027m asking a lot of questions, I\u0027m super interested in this. I had a dream about launching rockets horizontally from way up in the atmosphere after having hoisted it there with a blimp. Obviously the math wont allow such a feat, but that dream led me to this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockoon\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockoon\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich is pretty neato.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u0027s\u003C/em\u003E what you mean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket will be mounted on a three-foot rail, at a seven-degree-from-vertical angle. The rail will be attached to a \u0027gondola\u0027 containing a power source to ignite the motor, cameras, weather monitors, and a radio link with the ground. Hopefully, this will allow for limited live telemetry, as well as the ability to send a signal to fire the rocket. Once the rocket fires, it will leave the rail and speed away from the gondola, which will still be attached to the balloon. The gondola will ride the balloon up until it pops, and then descend on a parachute. The rocket, however, will descend freely and land in a different spot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, the gondola would be capable of carrying both a more committed tracking system and a radio control capable of launching the rocket. The rocket itself would have some pretty bare-bones equipment: just a modest tracking system and a dual-deploy rocket altimeter. That\u0027s really it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and I should also mention that I\u0027m probably going to place a decal of Jeb at minimum, and actually fly a tiny clay model of him if at all possible. (The Shapeways model might be better for the gondola, as it\u0027s far too large for the rocket.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Errol","CreatedById":118622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T01:52:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHaving never flown a model rocket, but played TONS of this game (including TONS of faffing about with roverdude\u0027s sounding rockets mod) that is honestly the coolest thing I have ever heard of.
