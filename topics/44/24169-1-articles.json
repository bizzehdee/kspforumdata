But, the size of the thing would mean a pretty cramped capsule, with a weight considerably less than the mercury capsules. Not sure it would be possible to put a heatshield on it, so, do you ean put a human in space, and bring him/her safely down again? Or just into orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: yeah, the Pegasus takes some 443 kg to LEO. So, subtract he weight of the astronaut, (say roughly 100 kg, including a skinsuit.) now, with a suit and a helmet, forego a pressurised cabin, a simple liquid nitrogen RCS system, no parachute or heatshield for returning, no dockingring, it should be possible to make a minimalistic vehicle able to launch one human being into LEO for being picked up by another vehicle in orbit.
