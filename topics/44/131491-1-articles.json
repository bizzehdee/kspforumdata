The thing about all-out wars is that they become crippling pretty quickly. Look at World War 1 and 2. Any country directly involved had an economy in shatters, a society that barely functioned because the social fabric was torn apart, resources were scarce everywhere. Simply put, there was no way to sustain that fire for another 5 years. An all out marathon can only be run so long.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is like huge stars. They burn fiercely, but also die quickly. Meanwhile, pouring everything you have into a war against one country means weakening yourself when compared to others. If you fight an all out war against another super power, you are setting yourself up to be dominated by a third.
