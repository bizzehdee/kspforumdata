Hypothetically, the atmosphere of whatever colony would be standard pressure so water boiling would be the same temperature. Primarily, cooking is for 2 reasons, killing food-borne pathogens and increasing the caloric value of the food you\u0027re cooking. Also taste but that\u0027s not too hard to get around.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor actual cooking techniques, microwave for sure but water bath cooking (sous vide) might not be a bad idea either. You\u0027d probably want to eliminate hot oils as well so no deep frying. Hypothetically, a soup could be heated in an induction cooker like some of the newer stoves. I suspect that dishes in liquid or semi-liquid form would be the best for cooking and consumption.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would probably be a good idea to limit particulate seasonings so basically every type of seasoning would have to\u00A0be liquid or gel.\u00A0Hot sauce is already popular but there are many other types of sauces that could be easily implemented. Too bad that dried spices would probably be a problem but fresh spices wouldn\u0027t be bad. They\u0027d\u00A0have to find a way of making them into gels to preserve them. The more I think about it, the more that preserving spices seems like a problem.

In lower gravity (on the moon or Mars as you suggest) VOCs would behave differently and could affect how your nose collects them.

Hypothetically, the atmosphere of whatever colony would be standard pressure so water boiling would be the same temperature. Primarily, cooking is for 2 reasons, killing food-borne pathogens and increasing the caloric value of the food you\u0027re cooking.

You\u0027d probably want to eliminate hot oils as well so no deep frying. Hypothetically, a soup could be heated in an induction cooker like some of the newer stoves.

Too bad that dried spices would probably be a problem but fresh spices wouldn\u0027t be bad. They\u0027d\u00A0have to find a way of making them into gels to preserve them. The more I think about it, the more that preserving spices seems like a problem.
