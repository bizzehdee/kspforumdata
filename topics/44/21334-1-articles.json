An escape pod in the worst case, by contrast, will find itself on an intercept course with a star or into deep interstellar space near a star without planets. In either case, it will need engines and FTL drives on the order of capability of the mothership\u0027s in order to be useful as a means of escape, and even if only the case of using the escape pod in a system with planets is considered, it still has to be powerful enough to manage interplanetary transfers on its own while keeping the crew and passengers alive (or at least frozen) for what could be months. Since space travel can be very slow, this would ideally be accomplished in just one flight \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC a task which could require thousands of tons of consumables and organics to constitute a robust life-support system for a city-sized spaceship, plus thousands of meters per second of delta-v to account for planetary transfers, orbital braking \u002B capture burn, and/or landing if necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout powerful engines and an equally robust life support system to the mothership, casting off in an escape pod to get away from the mothership only cuts you off from your only possible hope of navigating safely to safety without the help of someone else; and if the escape pod is powerful enough for such a task, it might as well be the mothership itself. The original mothership would become a boost stage and secondary consumables reserve, with which there is nothing essentially wrong, but if we assume a constant payload then this new mothership would find itself scaled drastically out of proportion. Assume an interplanetary escape pod scenario and say that the pod would require 10km/s of delta-V: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/appringraiders.php#id--Why_Saturn?\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAtomic Rockets\u003C/a\u003E states that a hydrogen-propelled NERVA vehicle with around 11km/s of delta-V will have a ratio of total mass to dry mass of four. In other words, accounting for reinforced structure, the new mothership would require at least around four times the mass of the old mothership \u003Cstrong\u003Ejust in propellant\u003C/strong\u003E to allow the escape pod to make it safely to another planet in what isn\u0027t even the worst case scenario.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat doesn\u0027t begin to account for the increased antimatter fuel cost to account for increased volume the warp drive must bubble up, and if the escape pod can\u0027t safely make it to another planet, then it has very little chance of making it there at all in uninhabited space. If it misses the transfer burn by a little bit, it will zoom past the planet (most likely) or greatly risk burning up in its atmosphere (much less likely due to the small size constituted by any given planet) unless it has a very powerful heat-shield. At best, it would drive up the price of a ticket significantly; at worst, it would make the tourist line completely nonviable. And if the gas monsters are capable of intercepting an interstellar spacecraft with sufficient delta-V capacity for interplanetary operations in more than one solar system, then whether or not an escape pod can outrun other gas monsters is uncertain at best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat if the escape pod were merely a cryosleep truck or a hab module with no significant engines and a distress beacon \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC i.e., existing sections of the ship, wired together and beefed up with a little more structural support, just in case of any mundane disasters that disable the ship\u0027s systems? Then the pod would probably confer even less benefits than an escape pod that could perform interplanetary transfers. As before, the value of an escape pod without transfer-capable engines is dubious in the context of a possible interplanetary gas monster attack, and escapees would be cutting themselves off from the mothership\u0027s resources, leaving them without any hope of salvaging the engines and/or life support and electronics and getting home in the worst case scenario. Any well-designed spacecraft will have pressure bulkheads that can be sealed automatically, or manually, in emergencies to prevent the loss of immediate life support to any compartment that isn\u0027t damaged beyond hope, so at least if the crew could fend off the monsters for the time being, they would have some chance of restarting the spacecraft and limping home. In an engine-less escape pod, they would be even bigger sitting ducks than they would be aboard the damaged mothership.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe, like a parachute, the escape pod is designed only to save a relatively small number of people \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC the personnel, the \u0022VIP\u0022 passengers, whoever can manage to get in and cast off, or some combination of the three. Ignoring the possibly extreme unpopularity of such an option, what then? As before, the escape pod still needs to be able to support people for as long as it takes to make interplanetary transfer, meaning that for an escape pod capable of carrying one person to safety it needs to carry at least a fraction of a ton of consumables and recycling equipment to fulfill the person\u0027s material needs for some time, not counting the potential psychological trauma of being cooped up in a tiny \u0026lt;1-ton capsule for a period of what could be months or years (we can say it\u0027s a cryosleep casket). A NERVA engine itself \u002B radiation shielding masses at least several tons, and the mass of propellant tanks and maneuvering systems would constitute several additional tons at least, putting the minimum mass of a 1-person interplanetary escape pod at somewhere between 80-160 tons at a rough guess. Even if this would not take up a huge amount of the mothership\u0027s payload capacity, it would still drive up the price of a ticket, and would not even be the safest possible way for one person to get away.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-05T07:51:25Z\u0022 title=\u002210/05/2012 07:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 5, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Accelerando\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Khrissetti","CreatedById":29557,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-05T12:42:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEscape pods only make sense if there is a reasonable chance of rescue in a fairly short time, or if they can parachute to safety.
