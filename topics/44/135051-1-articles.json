This line will pass the grating. The resulting image will be a line, with each line corresponds to the spectrum of an object (to know which object will be processed, you can \u0022turn off\u0022 the grating, making view of the background available and the object(s) observed obstructed by a black line). This is how you can take spectra of multiple objects at once, or how to take separate spectra of disk, bulge and halo of a spiral galaxy at once. It really have no problem with what telescope you use - except smaller diameter telescopes will need more time to gather enough light, given that you\u0027ll split them, and will be less resolved (each linear length corresponds to larger angular length).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt least that\u0027s how it worked on simulations, an SBIG soectrograph which I forget the type and even some modern observatories. Even I heard a project where each object\u0027s light will be passed through fiber optic cables, all to its own signal processor, to obtain an all-sky survey.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-02T14:00:12Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2016 02:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by YNM\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DBowman","CreatedById":122106,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-03T01:05:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/98447-ynm/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002298447\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/98447-ynm/\u0022\u003E@YNM\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0it sounds like you are \u0027in the business\u0027?

I just happen to closely know the people in bussiness at a point tbh. Today, I\u0027m not (or rather, no longer, although I myself consider to be never in the professional part because it was just for a few months) in it, apart from amateur things. I base this off what those people have showed me and explained to me. There are real data pictures but I\u0027m no longer in appropriate contact for asking such things. And no, I don\u0027t have such expensive equipment like CCDs, spectrograph etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor your first question : Yes. Apart that the same \u0022laws\u0022 of photometry measurement applies (ie. too long exposure means mediocre S/N, too short means low S/N), as long as the grating are equally good it\u0027ll be the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the second, guess the difference is in the focal length then ? Well the telescope with longer focus will generate a bigger star \u0022spots\u0022. The light will spread over larger portion of the detector while the radiant intensity stays the same, so you\u0027ll end up with a bigger (more resolved) but overall fainter image. The other one with shorter focal length will produce small star \u0022dots\u0022, with each dots as bright as the spots from other telescope. But because each dots corresponds to smaller amount of pixel, the maximum count (representative to the amount of photons) will be higher - careful not to trip the maximum count limit ! Over time, it\u0027ll damage the detector, producing hot pixels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
