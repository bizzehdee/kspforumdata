Much faster than 1 LY per hour which is actually above average warp for some scifi universes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead you would just see the stars slowly crawl past the side view, not so much the forward view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMain Question: I hear space is near empty but not totally. Let\u0027s assume a spaceship can move space past it at 1 LY per hour. How much hydrogen gas and dust will be hitting the ship\u0027s deflector field per second?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow would it look? Would there be enough to make it look like the ship was flying through a billowing cloud of fog through space on the view screen?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat if the deflector field ionized the gas and dust hitting it? How would that look? Since space has hydrogen in it, I presume... a billowing cloud of pink plasma would be left in the ships wake perhaps, only to later cool and no longer be visible to the naked eye.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-06-25T22:58:20Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2023 10:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
