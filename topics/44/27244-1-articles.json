Some of this was due to the extreme difficulty of the mission (something poorly modeled in KSP).

The S-II was particularly problematic because it was contracted for last, and the S-IC and S-IV were already well along in design and development and had consumed a great deal of the available weight and performance margins originally specified. Which is why in midstream it morphed from having two separate tanks to the common bulkhead scheme. (And why, in \u003Cem\u003ECarrying the Fire\u003C/em\u003E, Micheal Collins discusses the rumors of the S-II \u0022being fragile, made of glass\u0022.) The S-IV always had the common bulkhead because it was originally designed for the extremely performance limited Saturn-I series.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, as the missions progressed the messed with the number of separation and ullage rockets trying to find the lightest combination that offered the best performance.
