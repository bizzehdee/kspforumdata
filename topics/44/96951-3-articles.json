Surface of a sphere is a 2d manifold that can be embedded in 3d space.

Some special cases can be embedded. You might have seen a picture of a funnel that represents curvature of space around a black hole. Of course, these representations are somewhat limited, since it is hard for us to picture more than 3 dimensions at the same time. But they exist, nonetheless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, an interesting result in GR is that a general solution to Einstein\u0027s Field Equations cannot be embedded. In other words, for any finite number of dimensions, there exists a mass arrangement that results in a space-time shape that cannot fit into that number of dimensions. Therefore, our space-time is not embedded. If it was, there would be significant and measureable differences in how gravity works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022EdFred\u0022 data-cite=\u0022EdFred\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E There\u0027s no proof either way, so an absolute cannot be stated.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESort of can. As mentioned above, ebedding is not an option. Some flavors of String Theory work with a bulk, but they also make predictions that do not pan out based on it. So bulk seems unlikely. Locally, topology is fixed, so there cannot be a connection to an outside of any sort. That leaves edges, but we observe a very uniform universe. So unless we are dead center of a huge, much larger than observable, but still finite universe, it does not look good for edges either. If you have some other definition of outside, please, bring it forward. As it is, I can claim lack of outside as a scientific fact. If you need a greater absolute, then yes, I cannot help you, being a mere mortal and all.
