This is why spaceprobes past Jupiter can\u0027t use solar panels for energy production. Or why a small light bulb isn\u0027t enough to light up your entire house.\n\nThe reason this happens is a simple consequence of living in a 3 dimensional universe (with time as a 4th, but lets not get into GR here). Say you have a bubble with 100 small dots on its surface. The bubble has a surface area of 1m^2, so the density of the dots is 100 dots per square meter. Now say we inflate the bubble so its twice as big. The bubble now has 4m^2 of surface area, but the number of dots stays the same. So the number of dots per square meter is now 25. Twice the radius means the dot density becomes 4 times as low.\n\nSame thing happens in the universe. Gravity (or light) is equivalent to the dot density. The number of photons/gravitons is the same but they\u0027re smeared out over a larger area. And because that area increases by the square of the distance you end up with the familiar inverse square laws."},{"CreatedByName":"Darnok","CreatedById":85708,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T10:13:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Light get weaker at distance, look at the sun, wait until night and look at an random star, notice the difference in light from it.\n\u003E Its the inverse square law who works for all point sources who radiates in all directions.

According to one of the most famous theories which are trying to \u0022tune up\u0022 the Newton-Gauss-Birkhoff theorems for explaining things like the rotation curves of the galaxies removing the dark matter from the equations, gravity force never weakens to zero. This theory is called MOND and it replaces the inverse-square law with a little term of acceleration. This theory says that every point in a hollow mass sphere distribution (the universe, in this case), is subject to an small force towards the center of mass. This way, any point in this universe would affect, still relative to distance, with at least the force this potential gravitational acceleration provides to it.

It seems there is a lot of things happening there, a huge sea of events with tides, waves and posibly catastrophic events. The random behaviour we see is the foam of this sub-Planck events. You probably heard about the quantum foam: the closest you try to look (the narrowest you try to make your observation), the most frantic the universe gets (and still, this tiny events can lead to macroscopic effects, like the spontaneous generation of particle-antiparticle pairs causing the Hawking\u0027s Radiation at the event horizon of a black hole).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I know, but now **IF** gravity works same way just in opposite direction that would means every particle on Earth can be pulled by \u0022gravity wave\u0022 send by planet discovered last week and being 1400ly away.

Since the graviton is stated would have mass zero, all its energy would be cinetic, as the photon. The difference with the photon is the nature of the force (the nature of the field) they transmit: electromagnetic for photons, gravity for gravitons.

Create a new empty universe. Place Hydrogen molecule (Proper) in the universe, then add another hydrogen molecule to that universe with energy relative to the first of say 0.0001 Kelvin. Track the motion of the first and second without observers paradox (Heisenberg uncertainty). Without EM we cannot see any acceleration or deceleration, but if we add EM we add energy, if mass can bend light, then light can move mass. The experiment is essentially impossible because the premises of the experiment violate empirical and theoretical physics. However the experiment must be reasonable even if we cannot conduct, a *force particle* must be sent from one part of space to the next. \n\nHow fast does gravity act, over planks time? And how big are for hydrogen atoms in mass, multiplied together the particle would be very small. How could you detect something that produces so little force. \n\nThus when we look at superstellar events and we see the wave, we are actually seeing particles, but the particles are so numerous, from all realistic points of view they look like a wave, because we do not have a perspective that can resolve the particles. I don\u0027t believe you can create a circumstance in the universe where you can see the particle (given that it is massless, traveling faster toward it will not make it bigger)."}]}
