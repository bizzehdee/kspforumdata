Get a program like \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4celestia\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 and search for this star. Actually, there are two of them, alpha and beta, both quite like the sun, and only 0.006 LY apart (IIRC). I read, that that\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s not quite close enough to form a binary (which is probably good for life). But imagine we had another sun-like star that close in our neighborhood - we could have probably detected any earthlike planet orbiting it decades ago - and imagine we would have!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dharak1","CreatedById":61137,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T09:17:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat would be great!
