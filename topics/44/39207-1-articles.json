I\u0027ve recently gotten into the habit of launching ludicrously large objects, and have devoted some thought to the problem of an actual real-life lunar colonial mission. Now, I\u0027d like to pose the same question to the KSP community - how would you go about designed a lunar colony mission/mission architecture? The following guidelines apply:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. You are limited to present-day (and historical) launch vehicles and technologies. No VASIMRs or SABREs, no SSTO spaceplanes. Space Shuttles and Saturn Vs are fine, though. NERVA engines are OK, but you\u0027re not allowed to fire them in Earth\u0027s atmosphere, or deorbit them onto Earth (due to environmental and nuclear-safety regulations).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Your development, testing, and launch budget is near-unlimited, and certainly not the shoestring NASA has to put up with these days. However, you are limited to one launch every 50 days for a Saturn V-scale launch vehicle (due to limited launch and production facilities). Smaller vehicles can launch more frequently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Your goal is to put a colony of no less than 100 people on the Moon by 2023. This colony should satisfy the following conditions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E i. As self-sustaining as possible\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E ii. Provides some entertainment facilities to prevent the colonists from taking a walk out the nearest airlock\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E iii. Provides some justification for its existence (scientific/economic/spaceport/whatever else you can think of)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. In the event of a major decompression/radiation/whatever else emergency, the entire colony is capable of surviving for up to 3 weeks before rescue arrives (it can be assumed that they will all be evacuated at the end of the 3-week period).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, have at it!
