Men that are born could add to the stock so that it can replenish as well over time, you just want to make sure it gets sent to the back of the line), the intervening generations of which will be born and grow old and die (probably through a planned suicide at 65) on the ship. It will need to be designed to have every part replaced on a five year timeline, no new materials just take the part and melt it down and reforge it.
