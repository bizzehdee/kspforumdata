But high pressure alone isn\u2019t particularly efficient. You want your exhaust gas to leave your engine as fast as possible, because the faster the exhaust leaves, the harder it pushes you in the opposite direction.

In subsonic flow, as the area constricts the flow speeds up, and as the area expands the flow slows down. But if you have enough upstream pressure to reach \u0022choked flow\u0022 (Mach 1 at the throat), then as you expand the area again the flow actually speeds up. But the static pressure gets lower and lower. As the static pressure drops below the ambient pressure, it starts to run into resistance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNormally fluids want to flow from high static pressure to low static pressure. But if it is already flowing, the fluid has some momentum that will help it push into that higher pressure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUltimately the flow must match pressures with the ambient, and supersonic flow does so by experiencing a shock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, the point is that if the flow pressure at the exit plane is higher than the ambient pressure, you are wasting some of your initial energy by releasing it as pressure rather than velocity. But if the flow pressure at the exit plane is too low compared to the ambient, the flow will not be able to properly push out of the nozzle and bad things will happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yes, there are other types of nozzles that are less sensitive to matching the ambient pressure (like aerospike nozzles), but they have their own issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-22T11:51:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224147375\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208609\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221655857065\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022150492\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Exploro\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 hours ago, Exploro said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nalternatives such as a plug nozzle (the kind used on many types of garden hose attachments) boast some advantages over De Lavel nozzles in terms of \u0022matching exit pressure\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA quick observation: a plug nozzle is still a \u201Cbell\u201D nozzle; it has simply been turned inside-out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA plug nozzle will be less efficient (both in terms of specific impulse and T/W) than an equivalently-sized bell nozzle at any given pressure.
