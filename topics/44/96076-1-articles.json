They do what we do, essentially. They have very smart people with very sophisticated computers and fantastic information gathering abilities, so they know exactly where everything important is and where it\u0027s going, and what burns to do to make the probe go where they want so it\u0027ll be in the right place at the right time to intersect its target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I secretly believe that NASA has a full 10-year plan for every \u002290 day\u0022 mission they\u0027ve ever made. They can\u0027t tell the public about this, though, because if in year 5 the probe breaks down the press will be all over them about how they failed halfway through. If it breaks in year 5 of a 90 day mission, though, they look super frugal and resourceful keeping the little guy running for that long.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T06:54:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1- They use computers. However, they typically work in reverse to what we do in KSP. Instead of launching the rocket and figuring out how to get to the destination from there, they determine where they want to put the probe, the various dV options to put it there, and work their way back to launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2- The extended mission objectives are vaguely outlined before the mission. It\u0027s not secret, but the details are decided on an \u0022as we go\u0022 basis, depending on where they are, what they found, and whatever resources (time, money, power, propellant) are left.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T09:12:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlanning a 5-year mission takes much more work and money than planning of 1-year mission.

Spaceflight is truly cutting-edge: there is so much we don\u0027t know and almost every mission is doing somethign that has never been done before. At the time, spirit and opportunity were some of the largest rovers ever sent to mars, and not a lot of rovers had gone before them. Scientists had theories and ideas about the difficulties it would encounter, but there wasn\u0027t a lot of real tried and tested information, so NASA is pessimistic and only gives a timeline they\u0027re reasonably confident about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, spaceflight is an industry where quality is of the absolute utmost importance. Things get way overdesigned with several back-up systems and failsafes. If these failsafes are not needed, they can be salvaged or re-purposed to extend mission lifespan, but there\u0027s no way to know that on launch. Improvisation is a big part of these missions because the amount of resources to resolve problems is extremely limited. Again, in the case of mars rovers it isn\u0027t uncommon to use certain instruments for uses they were never initially designed for, but you use them anyway because it\u0027s all you have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethirdly: rovers (and lots of other space instrumentation) are specifically designed not to have an \u0022off\u0022 switch. You never know if someone might press it by accident. And especially for rovers with solar panels, it\u0027s completely impossible to know how long those solar panels will work. Will they be covered in dust? Will the topography allow for hills so we can angle the panels towards the sun? Will there be fortouitous gusts of wind that clea the panels? Will there be a dustsorm that sompletely covers the panels and kills the mission 2 days in? No one knows. So again, you assume worst case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou also wondered how much extra science could have been done if longer mission profiles were anticipated? Probably not that much. During those ten years, opportunity has been doing everything it can with the instruments it has on board. It doesn\u0027t matter if they \u003Cem\u003Eplanned\u003C/em\u003E it initially or not, opportunity has been giving us information non-stop for those ten years. If you want to do more in-depth science, you need better instruments. Those are heavier, meaning more money required, bigger scope, bigger mission, etc... Basically you\u0027d end up planning a really big mission without any prior experience, not even knowing if all those heavy and expensive experiments you sent up will even result in good data. This is an example of \u0022scope creep\u0022, which is the bane of many projects in any industry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn essence, you shouldn\u0027t send a curiosity rover which weighs as much as a small car when you know next to nothing about the risks. Start small, learn from small missions, scale up. That\u0027s what spirit and opportunity and their predecessors were for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs frustrating as it can be, it\u0027s never a good idea to go with high-risk missions in something as expensive and critical as space exploration. Slow and steady wins the race as it has been said.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T15:38:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022whiterafter\u0022 data-cite=\u0022whiterafter\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi!

It had date along the bottom, and \u0022Mean time before equipment failure\u0022 for Curiosity\u0027s equipment along the left axis, and cost of Curiosity\u0027s equipment on the right axis. The data was showing that Curiosity\u0027s equipment was set for the first failures to begin a couple years after the end of the first intended period of operation on Mars. The project was also pretty on budget at this time. Then there is a data point on the date line that was a year or two after Spirit and Opportunity\u0027s landing, where they just kept getting funding for mission extensions. Suddenly the cost of Curiosity\u0027s equipment begins to rise fairly dramatically, but so did the \u0022Mean time before equipment failure\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the chart is real, then it was indicating that they chose to accept cost overruns on the hardware in order to give the equipment extra lifespan on the assumption that they would pretty much always be able to secure funding to keep running the radio communications to direct it. It is easier to ask for a couple $100K to run a system already in place, than it is to ask for a couple billion for a new launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I remember right, the projected lifespan of the equipment is now set such that as the power output from Curiosity\u0027s RTG falls, it will eventually reach the point where even though the power can only activate one science package at a time, something like 90% of the science packages should still be operable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T16:36:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn actuality, the dynamics of the solar system\u0027s orbits are well-understood, and not that hard to solve, especially after 50 years of doing it.
