This is both good news and bad news, on\u00A0one hand I absolutely loved the interviews and little details that were shared about the station, on the other it was starting to become a real bore-fest with the replaying of dull pre-packaged videos on\u00A0\u0022why the ISS matters\u0022. Of course it matters, we wouldn\u0027t be watching if we didn\u0027t already think it was cool...preaching to the choir folks. So in that regard I can respect the fact it is ending, but was very disappointed I wouldn\u0027t be able to see the downlinked video they would often play in the background.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLuckily I saw\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=49191\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E! Apparently this has been around but I never knew of it.\u00A0The videos are pretty much\u00A0audio free and cover activities aboard the station such as\u00A0unloading the recent Dragon delivery or Kate\u00A0Rubins working with the heart cells experiment.\u00A0This stuff is great if you are interested in a particular visiting vehicle or experiment as it contains a lot of usually unseen video such as on orbit Soyuz thruster test firings. The files are rather large for what you get though, maybe somebody can explain that to me...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
