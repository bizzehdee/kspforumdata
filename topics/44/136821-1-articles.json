I\u0027m torn between a Lunar research station and a LEO microgravity station capable of simulating gravity on Mars, Venus, Europa, etc. By having pods at different distances from the center you could actually simulate multiple gravity levels with a single rotating section. Another option could be an interplanetary ship, which can do crewed flybys of Mars or Venus, maybe even Jupiter. But without landers I\u0027m not sure what the point would be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that this is what you think it should be, not what it will be.
