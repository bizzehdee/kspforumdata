So Neptune has cleared its orbit, because the only things sharing it are Trojan asteroids and Plutinoids locked into a 3:2 orbital resonance (and minor Neptune-crossers which haven\u0027t been fully cleared). The same with Earth, everything earth-crossing is either locked in orbital resonance with earth (like Cruithne), or it is slowly being perturbed either towards an orbital resonance or ejection from earth\u0027s orbit. \n\u003E \n\u003E There is a mathematical parameter used to determine how dominant a planetary body is over its orbit, and how likely it is to clear its neighbourhood over astronomical timescales. It is called the Stern-Levison Parameter, and is anything but arbitrary. The major planets have Stern-Levison parameters from 942 (Mercury) to 1.3E9 (Jupiter). The most gravitationally dominant dwarf planet over its orbit is Pluto, with a Stern-Levison parameter of 2.95E-3. So Jupiter is 7 orders of magnitude more dominant than Mercury, and Mercury is 5 orders of magnitude more dominant than Pluto. Pluto, Ceres, Eris, Haumea and Makemake all have S-L parameters of roughly the same order of magnitude, so if you let one in you have to let them all in. Not that I\u0027m against that, but the IAU defined a very clear cut-off point of a Stern-Levison parameter of 100 for full planetary status.

You would need to take a long hard look at complicated nested systems (binary stars that circle a barycentre together with a third star, each of which has several layers of binary and tertiary planets and moons, for instance). This is already partly true, and eliminates issues with objects that do not quite fall into this category or that. I can imagine that things still need hydrostatic equilibrium to have a baseline, so that all the loose floaty rocks and dust will be cut out. Another baseline cap like certain processes, planetary differentiation perhaps, or something else, might be suitable too, though you need a great deal more information to establish that."},{"CreatedByName":"LittleBlueGaming","CreatedById":144665,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T23:27:28Z","Content":"This might be helpful to show just how big the gap is between the 8 current planets and Pluto/others.
