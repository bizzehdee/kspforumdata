Also there isn\u0027t any reason they couldnt develop in a different manner maybe looking almost drawven, to quadrupedal (or more feet), having some sort of prehensile tail or tentacles or even being aquatic.

Certainly some things like SSTO would be nearly impossible but just getting to orbit likely wouldn\u0027t be much more difficult at all. Assuming the planet in question has a density comparable to earth and a mass 1.5x that of earth and that earth\u0027s radius is\u00A06371km using R=(1.5*r\u003Csub\u003Ee\u003C/sub\u003E)^(1/3) (this can be found by setting the two densities equal and using the volume of a sphere) the new planet\u0027s radius is 7293km. Using a simplified vis-viva equation for a circular orbit (v=sqrt(1.5mu/R),\u00A0assuming that the gravitational constant is the same everywhere in the universe and a 400km orbit the orbital velocity may be found to be about 8.8km/s. This is higher than earth of course and we can probably expect higher gravity drag and higher aerodynamic losses. Even if those loses totaled 4k it would require 12.8km/s of delta V. It is quite a lot, but it isn\u0027t impossible given that that number is a little less than what we require to launch something to GEO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course there would be engineering challenges to address but even most of those could be dealt with. At launch engines would likely be less efficient than on earth and would either require a higher chamber pressure, earlier staging, or expanded use of altitude adapting nozzles. Though it really depends on how much their standard atmospheric pressure is. If they were only a 2atm, it likely wouldn\u0027t pose too much of a challenge except that engines would either have to run on a higher pressure or run less efficiently. If it were in the range of 20 then it would be quite a challenge though that could likely be overcome through launching from a high altitude, airlaunching, or accelerating through some other method. One thing that would be interesting, given that they would likely resort to higher chamber pressures they might never encounter engine coking below 5MPa.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-17T23:19:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting.

If we assume a 500km orbit (though at this point the atmosphere may be starting to get thicker than this then using the simplified vis-viva equation and our starting assumptions to be\u00A0sqrt(3.375*3.986E5/(1.5*6371\u002B500)) then we find we need a horizontal velocity of 11.56km/s. Gravity drag and aerodynamic drag will certainly be higher than on Earth. Even then vehicles with 15-16km/s available delta V are available. Certainly they would struggle miniaturizing their satellites and manned space systems would be quite expensive, though it would not be impossible. Though actually I have a fairly decent comparison for what 10km/s vs 15km/s does to an available load, our Dyeus H system is expected to carry\u00A0150kg to LEO\u00A0but would likely only be able to carry 5kg to a C3 of 1.78 (which would be 15km/s,\u00A0about 1km/s more than LLO). Probably the largest issue they would struggle with is\u00A0the atmospheric pressure at low altitudes which would either cripple efficiency or require massively increasing chamber pressures in order for rockets to actually be effective.
