If you give most people a pad of paper and a pen and put them in a boring meeting or a long phone call, they will fill the margin and eventually the page with tightly packed, baroque, shapes and designs. This might be because only the language processing parts of the brain in the left hemisphere and your creative/visual parts on the right get bored. Exactly why you go for recursively subdivided squares, rather than anything else is probably more a matter of habit than anything else. I tend to draw scrolling curves and wave shapes. Other people draw flowers, or stick men. The more you draw one kind of thing, the more comfortable you are with it and the more likely you are to draw it next time because that pathway has been reinforced in your brain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich is all just a long way of saying that it\u0027s quite normal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-10T07:46:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI draw tornado-ish things like this\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.--------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E..------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...----\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E....--\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dominatus","CreatedById":76870,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-10T13:24:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is quite normal to doodle; as for why your doodles tend to be squares divided into ever smaller triangles... Well, my theory is that your thinking leans towards solid fact as opposed to other ways of thinking. This logical approach creates a pattern while doodling, one which you default to because it\u0027s what you always doodle. That\u0027s probably so incorrect it\u0027s not even funny. I\u0027m by no means an expert in this, however. Feel free to correct me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
