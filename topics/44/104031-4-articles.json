But the US military spends $600 billion *a year*, and expects to spend $1500 billion on the F-35 fighter over its lifetime (OK, to 2070, but still). By military spending standards, kinetic bombardment doesn\u0027t look so expensive after all, especially if you can make a program out of it with multiple sats each capable of multiple strikes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jonfliesgoats","CreatedById":168077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-03T18:34:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaunch would be expensive, but your kinetic platform never has to land, refuel change crews, etc..

If every 500b GP bomb dropped by a B-17 or B-24 had landed within a few meters of specifically designated targets (not just \u0022factory X,\u0022 but each bomb aimed at specific elements, uniquely), then such bombing would have likely been very effective indeed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0The sort of area bombing utilized vs Japan (and to a lesser extent, Germany by Bomber Command) is another story, and more applicable to some forms of orbital bombardment. Not \u0022extinction level\u0022 bombardment, but perhaps \u003Cem\u003Elocal\u003C/em\u003E extinction level bombardment. Ie: hitting someone with something akin to a small asteroid. The largest possible effect that contains the bulk of effects within countries that are not a problem. Ie, you hit country A, and perhaps B and C have some minor effects since they are nearby, but country D that is a major power is totally unaffected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample targets would basically be places that you wish to no longer exist. At all. The sort of thing you could do with a nuke, but that has all the baggage of a nuke. Same sort of counter-value targeting, however.
