That\u0027s all I\u0027ve known about it though... I\u0027ve never heard any details.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found this book \u0022Operation Paperclip\u0022 by Anne Jacobsen ISBN 978-0-316-22103-0 and it\u0027s finally the history of it. I didn\u0027t know that it was a dozen different semi-conflicting top secret operations to capture German knowledge in order to either keep it from the Soviet Communists, or help end the war with Japan. It\u0027s not just rocket stuff, but chemical and atomic warfare too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s kind of a horror story, and there\u0027s the details of finding out who was who, and who should be arrested, and what should be done with them. It\u0027s in the same timeframe as the discovery of the concentration camps and tied up with capturing war criminals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot only are the Americans rushing to do things before the Soviets arrive, they also somewhat doublecross the British, French, and other Allies who wanted these people shot on sight as war criminals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe story of von Braun is far more complex than the simple \u0022he waited for the Americans and used documents he\u0027d hidden as a bargaining tool\u0022 that I\u0027d always heard - I found out why his arm was in a cast in all the pictures of when he was \u0022captured\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously if you believe (as I do) that von Braun was the single sole reason we were able to go to the Moon, then there\u0027s a fascinating tale of how things happened by the merest of coincidence, and just days before the Russians took control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m only 20% through it so far, but it seems to be well researched and written.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GeneCash","CreatedById":81605,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-25T11:05:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUgh. It\u0027s well researched, but it lets it\u0027s side down by starting to kind of foam at the mouth halfway through. Tossed in the recycling bin. 4 out of 10.
