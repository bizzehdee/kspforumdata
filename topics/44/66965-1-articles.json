Drag coefficients are complicated functions of geometry, Reynolds numbers, Mach numbers, Froude numbers (for partially submerged ship hulls) and relative surface roughness effects, therefore determining them analytically is often only done as an exercise for simple shapes. More often they are determined numerically, or empirically. Typically for aircraft and rockets Cd is not highly dependent on Re because all else being equal Cd approaches a constant value for high Re.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
