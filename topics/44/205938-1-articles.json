But I was messing with something and came across a weird number set. Not sure how to make it fit an exact year. But it makes an alternative clock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s base on a second being equivilent to 2.777777777777777 current seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt has a structure of 12 hours/12 minutes/9 seconds. It equals to one current day. This does not resolve the existing issue with left over days, but does fit a 360 day year. Was this ever used in the past. Does it have any odd applications now? It might fit 12 hour clocks if repurposed slightly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA day has 144 minutes and 1296 seconds. 3600/1296 = 2.77777777777. Somewhere in there it has to do with 1/3 and 2/3 times instead of 10 based I think. I can\u0027t refind how I got that though. So, it\u0027s actually more fitting to 360. Or should I say it\u0027s another aspect of a 360 day cycle naturally. 1 being 10 and this being 3 based.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould this be combine with the current 10 based system to find a solution to the 365.24219 day problem. It might make a spiffy dual system on a clock if not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBTW, this and the 3600 day can be converted at the minute mark as 3600/144 = 25 and 3600/9 = 400. Or am I thinking this out wrong?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfound the 1/3 part. If you take 9 seconds * 12 minutes you get 108. 360/108 = 3.3333333333. So, a clock face would have 3 hours doing one rotation. Or 1/3 of a circle. That means a clock can have one day equal to 4 rotations of a clock instead of 2 like a 24 hour current clock in 12 hour chunks. Edit: NVM, that isn\u0027t correct at all. 8) It\u0027s 3.333333 of a circle though. That would make it a bit odd if that was implemented like that. but 1 hour is 3.33333 parts of a circle. So you could divide 3 hours into 10 parts and a day into 40 parts on a clock. No idea if that is useful at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA day(and/or year?!) would have 4 quadrants each with 10 parts each. Those 10 parts would be made up of 9 smaller parts?! Or am I missing something. I feel like I am.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could also use a 12 hour clock using 12/12/9. Might be confusing something though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat means an overlapping 4 seasons divided by 10 units and a 12 month setup simultaneously. 12 months with 12 days and each with 9 hours?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes this make a weird overlapping time system? I assume you could make simultaneous 12 hour and 9 hour days. Could this concated system potential find a way to fit a 365.24219 day year? If it keeps overlapping it might find a naturally fitting systems. Or does it just make a weird system based on 360 degree circles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this is basically the inverted version of our current time system could both be combined to make a 24/12/9 hour day system or more?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the 108 parts in an hour come out to a 9/10\u0027s system. Isn\u0027t that the basis of decimals or the 0vs1 logic in our 10 based number system?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-12-11T09:04:54Z\u0022 title=\u002212/11/2021 09:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 11, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RCgothic","CreatedById":132560,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-11T15:37:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy favourite alternate calendar is:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n12 months of 5x 6-day weeks. 5-6 additional days attached to the end of December as a festive period.
