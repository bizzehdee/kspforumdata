This is what I\u0027m referring to when I say real world application. And no, if there are multiple inputs and you are only taking from one input you are only reducing the one input by said amount. It could be independent of the other input which proportionally could be in an direction depending on design or circumstances. This is another example of oversimplifying a complex system. Just like a circuit you could have multiple converging sources at one point in the system and then you can have reduced loss. Because it\u0027s not really reduced cost.

And this action results in the loss from only one intake source it reduces the whole in the end, but it does not reduce it as much if one input was used. If even proportions exist it literally halves the overall loss. Because assuming all input is from the engines would not have as much of a loss if part is from the water or other things in play. A boat in the water is in a big bunch of water with kinetic force. That is why the water can move the massively heavy ship to start with. So, we are already working with massive kinetic forces. If you take just from the waters inputs you can lessen the loss on the engines and maybe adjust things to be more efficient. Or if it\u0027s useful enough it doesn\u0027t matter. Or if it\u0027s used in a specialized matter it doesn\u0027t make any difference. That is part of a machines design. So, if your inputs from your water or other forces it take to make an additive and it outweighs the energy net loss from the ship you could hypothetically have a net gain.

After that, you cannot extract more energy from it; it has reached the lowest energy state possible for it. Also, some of this energy is lost as entropy, or waste heat, due to friction. Every time you convert between forms of energy, you lose some as entropy. We can come up with a rule of thumb; the process using fewer steps is more efficient.
