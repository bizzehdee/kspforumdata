The takeoff performance analysis factors in things like runway surface conditions, density altitude, wind speed, fuel and payload weight, etc. If the pilots deviate from the plan and operate the flight outside of the margins that they are provided, there\u0027s a good chance that things will end badly.

What if every single aircraft flight had sheets of ice come off the nose and sometimes impacting the wing or engines? What if 1 in 135 of those ingestions caused a LOV incident.

The ET\u0027s issue are of a different nature. The shuttles very high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E (a good thing) was provisioned by liquid gasesof molecular\u00A0 hydrogen and oxygen. The original design was to have H2 and O2 on board the orbiter, but this compromised the payload capability. So it was moved to the external tank. The ET is now one tank, its 3 tanks, 2 tanks inside the visible ET. This is attached to the orbiter. The ET design was all about getting the percent of weight in tank relative to fuel to the lowest possible, conservation of gases was not a major theme at the time (seventies and gas was 20 cents a gallon).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost of what tater has said about the tank is correct with regard to an inherent flaw, but as we will see its not a fundamental flaw as much as it is a design oversight.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo first, let us look at the design. For the cost of the SR-25s to be justified they need to provide the majority of acceleration, they are one of the few vehicles were the engines operate from launch to orbit, of the 9000 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E required to reach orbit, the SSME provide about 3/4ths of the acceleration, not powerful enough to provide lift off and vertical momentum, once these are provisioned the SSME carry the orbiter up. And pretty much as an isolated system they have only had two incidences on was qualified as an abort to orbit at a lower orbit 51-F.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022450px-Sts_et_cutaway.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022180\u0022 src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Sts_et_cutaway.jpg/450px-Sts_et_cutaway.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022450\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are two areas of the ET design that bring questions. The first is for fuel loading, when you add cryogenic gases (which I have done so many many times) you have an outgassing that is much larger in volume than the gas you put into the system. The gas hits the edge of the vehicle and it boils and at first the gas comes back warm but quickly evolves to a very cold gas as the entire system cools. So as the gas reaches the air you get nuclei (that which forms snow) and it gets over everthing, your gloves, the sides . . . . .Ice. As the wind blows the \u0027snow\u0027 can melt and refreeze into chunks of ice which can fall and hit the orbiter or the struts on the SRBs during flight, both are bad. So the solution is to move the fills on the slope of the ET that faces away from these, if Ice forms here and falls it falls away from the axis of the ET-Obiter interconnect plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second issue is ice that forms around the top of the foam and the foam itself. There are two issues. The first one is this what is the limit of foam that can be placed on the ET that in flight would never strike the shuttle. If we look at the tank about 80% of the ET can be covered with foam and never risk hitting the orbiter. So it doesn\u0027t necessarily involve covering all of the foam, just some of the foam, or likewise it means moving some of the foam inside the shuttle. THere are problem with doing this and maintaining function.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs an aside we are talking about significant vehicle evolution something that should have occurred in the 90\u0027s and 00\u0027s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni. That the SLWT was the only tank rated to reach ISS with PL and crew, which means weight is added.\u003Cbr\u003E\nii. That the ET may have to be reshaped slightly to improve the insulation and reduce ice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK so this problem as discussed in other posts is that having a 6-11 capacity is not required, in the worst possible situtation if you had 4 crew on the shuttle 3 ISS could evacuate to soyuz and 3 to shuttle resulting in 4 to 7 crew compliment. Updated computers to govern almost all aspects of flight and lower crew numbers and reduction in weight could have allowed the ET to add weight and safely mediate the ice issue on the orbiter side. But the shuttle really does not need to go to the ISS, it need only to reach an orbit where things can be assembled and the under their own power move to a higher orbit. Orbiters, for instance now can be made with carbon-fiber.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now having the weight we need where do we apply it. To mitigate the ice issue you need a barrier between the foamed tank and unprotected part. This can be done by bolting into the shell of the ET a section of carbon fiber about 3 or four inches wide (the insulation on a typical N2 tank is about an inch and half). And on top of this you would have foam but at the terminal you would have Al-Li composite. The internal struts likewise would have CF intermediates as they penetrate. The new more ovoid cross section tank would have insulation between the liquid storage tanks and the ET wall. In the wall you would, toward the top have a very simple serpentine wire heater that kept the metal above the melting temperature of water. This is only needed at the top below which was not needed as the ice would not likely impact the orbiter below a certain distance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are relatively minor design changes, overall the tank is the same, you have an additional 4 inches material on the orbiter side inside the tank, the fuel tanks are slightly shifted and more elliptical, the insulation could be done by an aerogel or other light weight insulation, about the same mass as the foam, all you need is the carbon-fiber expansion brackets that run the length of the tank on both sides and the intertank heat-transfer blocks built into the struts. Again you would never see these.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Preventing orbiter loss.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEven if we fail to consider loss-of-life, since the orbiter is a reusable vehicle, economically we want to depreciate it over its life (which in accounting should provides the capital for its future replacement). This means that as we use an orbiter its function provides a cost basis to provide for its own replacement through earning and savings. In government talk some aspect of each mission is cycled back into the fund to replace the capital equipment that makes the mission possible and this way costs are divided over time. In business risk of failure is an added insurance cost which increases cost and we don\u0027t want to do this.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnder two circumstances, as mentioned the loss of orbiter is result of launch damage. That revolves around two issues. First, the loss of the challenger is blamed entirely on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E, badly designed for manned space flight and badly implemented. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E should not be used and oddly the OMB should have forseen the trouble with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E and opted for more developed LFRB. As stated repeated the type of failure that the Morton-Thiokol 4 sealed \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E produces is unacceptable and its launch restrictions are unacceptable in manned space flight, and oddly they are being used on the SLS. There is no way to attenuate a faulty \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E in flight,\u00A0 .Management oversight of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E use should be rigorous to a fault.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe second issue is shuttle-tiling system and again we have two situations, 35000 tiles needed to be replaced, but 35000 of the tiles damaged were not critical, but one or two on the columbia were and the orbiter disintegrated. Again this is an issue of evolution from 1975 to 1983 the learning curve was pretty steep, this does not mean that learning stops. The shuttles heat resistant skin could have evolved overing both lower weight and increased resilience to damage. Above we see that the ET could have been improved to prevent damage.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAgain we see a circumstance that while in flight damage was noted, the damage could have been surveyed at ISS and crew members could have stayed on the station along with orbiter while a resolution to the problem was found. Again a shuttle could bring back eleven and the orbiter could have been moved to another location while solutions were found. But once again we had a management failure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrbiters will not last forever and eventually flight stresses will overcome them, so its almost better to retire and evolve orbiters after 10 or so flights rather than to take risk with older orbiters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Preventing loss of life, this almost entirely shows itself to be a management issue. Don\u0027t fly the any craft outside of the design tolerances of its composite parts. Again if a tile can withstand a force of impact of 200 lbs at a foot, then you don\u0027t expose the tile to 2 pounds traveling at 100 mph. Every part has a tolerance so its simple enough to decide, does this situation create an excessive deviation from design parameters, then the simple answer is don\u0027t launch. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E problem and ET problems can be mitigated by component evolution. The question is that if it can evolve should it have evolve.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo the concept to design phase was 1968 to 1975ish. That was 40 to 50 years ago, how much has your phone changed in 40 to 50 years, what about your car, your house. Everything you do has changed in the last 50 years.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe cannot argue that fixing the shuttle\u0027s structure is not a good thing. The first flights of the shuttle were a pioneering engineering feat but then who travels around in Connestoga wagons now-a-days. We would be all easting at Lake Tahoe DIY take out\u00A0 . . .Donner,\u00A0 party of 5.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe loss of life problem is tied to the fact that it should have evolved more rapidly. The replacements should have been notably more evolved than the first, the shuttles should have been retired after 10 flights under the condition that new shuttles were evolving toward some futuristic goal. And every major component of the complex system should have been treated as its own launch vehicle and the critiques that go with a more simple analysis. One of those goals would be greater safety. The shuttles ET facilities and assembly facilities should have been doubled in capacity and again we should have hired contractors to help get those LFBs to RTLS once their mission was complete.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo then to the loss of life question, by what the shuttle did and by 1968-1980 standards the shuttle was pretty fantastic system. But then if we argue, as Tater so aptly put, a system that repeatedly experiencing the same life threatening safety issue since day 1, then we should not look at the system in say 2000 with the same enthusiasm as we do in 1985. Of course we don\u0027t, who should? But the problem is that the fed is neither a scientist or an engineer, almost all appointments are political and that in-and-of-itself is a design compromise. But that\u0027s the nature of the beast, its up to people and organizations to insist on that evolution, its not a fault of the shuttle that it did not evolve to become more safe, its a fault of the people who were responsible for caring for the STS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Cost of mission and cost of failures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cost of failures cannot be underestimated. Both instances were intangible liabilities on the shuttle and space program in general. Not only they lead to cost overruns and costly delays. Challenger cost the program about 2 man-hour years. But the challengers failure can be rooted into a decision made by OMB 10 years previously and it was a bad decision. So of OMB is an oversight watchdog, who then watches the watchdog? Again the engineers on the program should have been more emphatic, because ultimately they will be harmed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cost of missions is debatable. The problem in the design and use we have to consider also alternatives and their repertoire of functions.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo there are metrics.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou have a vector state on an elliptical in space, you need to send 3 men to and from that vector, do you need a shuttle . . . .no.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou have a vector state on an elliptical in space, you need to send supplies do you need manned space flight . . . no.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou have a vector state on an ellipitical in space and you need need to send supplies, 3 men, and retrieve experiments and waste and return to earth do you need a shuttle, it might be useful.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou have a vector state on an elliptical in space and you need to add a structure to it and you need men to help do this . . .its a little more useful, but computers have replaced this function (e.g. biglelow pod).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOver time the cost function of the shuttle has increased because the alternatives either have increased performance or decreased cost . . . this is the way the system should evolve.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou have a concept state in space and you want to build on that concept (usually something bulky are heavy) do you need a shuttle\u003Cbr\u003E\na. you can insert a reference structure in space without a shuttle.\u003Cbr\u003E\nb. manned extensions of that space require a facility, shuttle was the only provider. The current replacement is vaporware.\u003Cbr\u003E\nc. manning of the extension does not require shuttle\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou have a valuable asset in space that needs tending or collection and it is not in the plane of the ISS, you need the function of the shuttle.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo that we can see that benefit to cost ratio of the shuttle has declined over time, but its still present, there is still benefit to some\u00A0 of its functions that are not (or have not been) replaced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome of NASA\u0027s new projects are talking about throwin 30 billion dollars into space, but its mostly vapor ware and the plans change every 6 months but there is little hardware to show for it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere is also a cost associated with any progressive society for not evolving or advancing, there is an intangible benefit to the non-redundant functions of the shuttle, and that is why it should not have been cancelled until its suitable replacements had been completed. As it looks to me, these replacements are not near-future, they are only waving hands. And if by some miracle they do appear . . . .SpaceX.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
