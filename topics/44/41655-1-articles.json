HTV actually docks to the Japanese segment. It has a bigger unpressurised segment which typically houses external pallets for the Japanese segment so it supplies it with experiments. It also carries 8 ISPR racks in the pressurized segment which can only pass through CBM ports, so they can\u0027t be transported into ATV or ROS. On the other hand ATV mostly transports liquids: water and propellant for the orbit keeping engines. These are their differences, but still, they both can carry lots of other goods like food or spare parts. Both of them are also used for taking the garbage out cause they burn up in the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
