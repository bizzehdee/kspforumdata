So momentum is increasing with the mass of the ship, linearly. Double the mass of the ship and you double the momentum. The force of gravity is increasing with the mass of the ship, linearly. Double the mass of the ship and you double the force of gravity. These two factors cancel each other out, so that all that matters is speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGravity\u0027s force isn\u0027t cancelled out, it\u0027s that force that curves the vessel\u0027s trajectory around the parent body.
