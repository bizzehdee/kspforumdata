Let us suppose that only 10% of Merlin flights require a rebuild, and 0.1% of airline engine flights\u00A0require a rebuild. 10% is a lot close to 0.1% than it is to 100%, wouldn\u0027t you agree? Looking at it on a percentage basis means that as long as you have more than two flights between rebuilds, you\u0027re closer to the 0% point (infinite reusability) than the SSMEs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow accurate is that 0.1% number, anyway? The airline industry uses a metric called Time Between Overhaul, or TBO. This represents the runtime (usually given in standardized hours) before an engine needs to be removed, disassembled, and overhauled. For high-performance\u00A0jet turbofan engines, the TBO is around 3,000 hours. Let\u0027s take an eight-hour transatlantic flight as an example. That means 375 flights between engine overhauls, or 0.27% of flights requiring a rebuild. Again, 10% is a lot closer to 0.27% than it is to 100%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ED:\u003C/strong\u003E Let\u0027s also take into account that restarts and shutdowns produce high stress on an\u00A0engine. The SSMEs could not be restarted in flight and had to be refurbished after each test firing, and most airline engines only start and shutdown once per flight. The Merlin 1D, on the other hand, is usually test-fired twice before each launch, and the central engine fires up to four times per flight (for RTLS profiles). The CRS-8 booster will do ten test-fires before reuse, but let\u0027s say that eventually we\u0027ll be looking at closer to four test-fires before reuse. That means ten restart/shutdown cycles per flight. If they can manage the projected 10 launches before refurbishment, then we\u0027re looking at 100 cycles before refurbishment, or 1% of all cycles requiring a rebuild. 1% is within an order of magnitude of 0.27% and quite far from 100%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EE:\u003C/strong\u003E The central booster will probably not be reused on the Red Dragon shot, and they definitely will not land the FH core as a single piece. Rather than using crossfeed, the center booster will throttle down rapidly after launch to maintain closer to constant acceleration on the vehicle as a whole; this will leave it with a large fuel reserve at separation, but not so much that it has trouble maintaining acceleration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EA:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0But SpaceX is making the cost estimate ASSUMING Booster reuse.

Each SRB adds about $10 million to the ELV price, supposedly. The five-meter fairing used for MSL\u00A0is also a touch pricier than the four-meter fairing. So we have $172.4 million as our total estimated vehicle price. I\u0027m going to round up to $175 million to account for the increased cost of support on a Martian launch; I think that\u0027s conservative.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. The contract price for ISS deliveries is part of a long-term contractual arrangement and includes priority provisions for NASA. For example, SpaceX can carry multiple payloads in one ISS-delivery launch, but they have to give NASA priority and must scrap the secondary payload if NASA says to. Such a contractual price is not indicative of the price for a one-off mission like a Mars payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. And no, we don\u0027t add $62 million to the FH launch cost; the $90 million pricetag \u003Cstrong\u003Eis\u003C/strong\u003E the cost of all three boosters, plus the second stage, plus launch services and launch support. $90 million is the price for a Falcon Heavy launch regardless of whether they can recover the boosters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. However, that\u0027s the price for a completely new launch vehicle. SpaceX will be reusing cores for the Red Dragon mission.\u00A0A reused launch comes with a discount -- probably 30-40% for F9Ft. Let\u0027s say 30% to be conservative, and let\u0027s say that the center core is new, so only the side boosters (which will be recoverable for the Red Dragon mission) are reused. That\u0027s 18 of the 28 engines being re-launched\u00A0(rather than 9 out of 10 engines as in a Falcon 9FT)\u00A0so we will reduce that discount to 21%. The FH launch price can thus be estimated at $71.1 million, less than 41% of the Atlas V 541.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. \u0022What about the capsule?\u0022 you say. Uh...what about it? The capsule is the payload for the launch vehicle. The 3.9 tonnes of Mars Science Laboratory wasn\u0027t the downmass to Mars; that was the launch mass of the entire transfer spacecraft: cruise stage, cruise propulsion system, battery and solar array, heat shield, EDL, and the \u003Cem\u003ECuriosity \u003C/em\u003Erover. The price of the spacecraft was not part of the Atlas V ELV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe dry mass of a Dragon V2 is nearly double the MSL mass, at 6.4 tonnes. Add 1400 kg of propellant and the claimed 4 tonne payload to Mars, and you have a launch payload mass of 11.8 tonnes. So on a price-per-kg basis, the Falcon Heavy\u0027s payload to Mars is \u003Cstrong\u003E13% \u003C/strong\u003Ethe price of an Atlas V payload to Mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d say that\u0027s transformative.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, but wait...according to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://space.stackexchange.com/questions/5449/cost-breakdown-for-curiosity-development\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis source\u003C/a\u003E, NASA paid $215.1 million for launch services associated with MSL. So actually, that\u0027s 10.9% on a per-kg basis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. Again, it depends on how you look at it. 100% of SSME flights required a rebuild. Let us suppose that only 10% of Merlin flights require a rebuild, and 0.1% of airline engine flights\u00A0require a rebuild. 10% is a lot close to 0.1% than it is to 100%, wouldn\u0027t you agree? Looking at it on a percentage basis means that as long as you have more than two flights between rebuilds, you\u0027re closer to the 0% point (infinite reusability) than the SSMEs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow accurate is that 0.1% number, anyway? The airline industry uses a metric called Time Between Overhaul, or TBO. This represents the runtime (usually given in standardized hours) before an engine needs to be removed, disassembled, and overhauled. For high-performance\u00A0jet turbofan engines, the TBO is around 3,000 hours. Let\u0027s take an eight-hour transatlantic flight as an example. That means 375 flights between engine overhauls, or 0.27% of flights requiring a rebuild. Again, 10% is a lot closer to 0.27% than it is to 100%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s also take into account that restarts and shutdowns produce high stress on an\u00A0engine. The SSMEs could not be restarted in flight and had to be refurbished after each test firing, and most airline engines only start and shutdown once per flight. The Merlin 1D, on the other hand, is usually test-fired twice before each launch, and the central engine fires up to four times per flight (for RTLS profiles). The CRS-8 booster will do ten test-fires before reuse, but let\u0027s say that eventually we\u0027ll be looking at closer to four test-fires before reuse. That means ten restart/shutdown cycles per flight. If they can manage the projected 10 launches before refurbishment, then we\u0027re looking at 100 cycles before refurbishment, or 1% of all cycles requiring a rebuild. 1% is within an order of magnitude of 0.27% and quite far from 100%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe central booster will probably not be reused on the Red Dragon shot, and they definitely will not land the FH core as a single piece. Rather than using crossfeed, the center booster will throttle down rapidly after launch to maintain closer to constant acceleration on the vehicle as a whole; this will leave it with a large fuel reserve at separation, but not so much that it has trouble maintaining acceleration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.

The price is still set on the promise of as much reuse as possible.
