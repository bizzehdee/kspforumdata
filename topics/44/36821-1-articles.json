Helis are the most dangerous sort of flying R/C vehicles (with a possible exception of rockets). Start with something simple like a powered glider (EasyStar/Bixler type), that is mostly stable in itself and can easily be controlled manually if an override is required. A heli, save for the tiniest sizes (100/150) has a lot more of a damage potential than planes and even multirotors, due to the sheer amount of kinetic energy in the single rotor.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-13T19:49:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethats why ive nicknamed my chopper the decapitron. its a chinese made trex 400 clone. it came with plastic linkages and tail but i replaced them with aluminum bits as they broke. and then i swapped out my fiberglass blades with carbon fiber blades. only other thing she needs is a new battery and the autopilot board (which i am designing on eagle cad).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eat first i will just stick to telemetry, which i will output to a monocle hud of my own design. mount an lcd screen at a 45 degree angle to a piece of dark plexiglass, makes a really good hud. i havent actually built it as i dont have an appropriately sized display (i saw a small, bright, oled display on ebay that will work quite well), but i know it will work. just knowing how level i am and my heading will help me fly it a little better. i wont have to break eye contact to look at a screen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E i was looking at rf modules, seen a long range nRF24L01\u002B based radio with a 1000 meter range and a 1-2 megabit data rate (though i will probibly run it at a lower data rate to play it safe), and about $20 each. i have the much cheaper $2 version that only does about 10 meters, which i got for surface r/c applications. i looked at xbees and other radios and i didnt like them, xbee in particular has too many pins, where as a nordic only needs 7 (its an 8-10 pin header, but only some of them are connected), and is a lot smaller and lighter of a module, and has a very easy to use library. initially this will be a separate link from the control radio, and then later on (when i verify reliability) i will send the control data though that link as well. i still want to fly it mostly on manual and have the autopilot try to level out and hover if i flip a panic switch. its one of those big long term projects (which i never finish).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-13T20:04:34Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2013 08:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Nuke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-13T20:27:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EASAS unit costs 1,000 dollars or so in game, fits in a huge case with a 1 meter diameter, and yet it is but an extremely buggy and glitchy function in a 20 dollar game created by an Indie Game developer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
