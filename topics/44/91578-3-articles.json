Agencies all the time evaluated lot of papers of possible projects, scientifics missions, etc. Is normal that just the most important and most qualify will be receive the budget. Skylon is a 20 years projects which reach their final step. If the second study gives green line (This mean that it can be build and it will work as prevented) then it will get the found without questions. They will share cost with private companies as always is done in these cases..
