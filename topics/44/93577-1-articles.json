In other words, trying to make a craft that can delivery a payload, act as a tug, go to the Mun, or help refuel as station is ten times harder than making a different space-craft for each mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the real world, that is what NASA tried to do with the Shuttle program - make a workhorse, a mule, that could do everything. It failed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut is there a way it could be done? For example, putting a payload into orbit has to be done again and again, cheaply, for a space program to get \u0027off the ground\u0027. A universal rocket is something NASA and other agencies around the world are always working on (SLS for example).

This is because for a launch vehicle, the mission is almost always the same: put payload X to LEO/GTO/TLI/whatever trajectory the client asked, and the performance margins are pretty small. Most of their development consists of trying to squeeze as much delta-V as possible while keeping costs down, all while keeping the rocket itself from exploding before the mission is done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpacecrafts, on the other hand, have a far wider variety of missions, from a simple communications satellite all the way to rovers, space probes, and manned landers. Compared to a launch vehicle, the dV requirements are lower, and the spacecrafts themselves must be able to do more than simply flying there, like transmitting signals or obtaining data from sensors. For this reason, the spacecraft\u0027s equipment are much more complicated than that of a launch vehicle, and generally different from other spacecrafts, custom fitted for the mission conducted in order to lower total mass as much as possible, conserving propellant needs for the same dV.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xenomorph555","CreatedById":103080,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T20:22:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirstly are we talking rockets, probe/sats or manned spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we are talking rockets, then the term universal rocket basically revolves around a rocket having a number of common components that can be stacked together in different ways to suit different missions, not a large single rocket design to do everything.

If you want to talk about that, start a different thread, or find an older one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECars are mass produced vehicles, used by many people in a diverse number of situations. The same car can be designed to operate in snow, or in swamps, at high altitudes or in the Dead Sea, as a personal transport, a cargo vehicle, a police car et cetera, with very little modification. This is possible, largely because we have the leisure of adding features and capabilities that most people do not use. This is the case for, among other things, the reason that cars are both in demand. People in many places do well to have cars for all sorts of purposes, and, when mass produced, cars are viable to sell to many people the world over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpacecraft are not like this. Spacecraft are expensive, and far from in demand. As a consequence, those who use them often make them themselves, and make them for a very particular purpose; flying to the Moon, to Mars, to visit a comet et cetera, and those spacecraft are designed, out of necessity to do only that which is required of them; every gram should be used, and no weight is spent on useless features. This means that they are usually extremely specialized, not that a Mars orbiter could not be useful at Jupiter, but that people want the instruments and abilities to do just what they want, and so when going to Mars it is prudent to design a vehicle just to ask the Mars questions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main place where this is changing perhaps is the region of LEO, where spacecraft buses can be used as a standard framework to build a satellite with. I imagine, in the future it will further change, as it is more practical to frequently visit more distant places, and more people will have the ability to send more distant probes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EzinX","CreatedById":118288,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T02:45:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the reasons what you have tried to do has failed is because KSP does not have a good way to \u0022package up\u0022 a payload into a real fairing that structural supports all the parts inside correctly. If you could package a wide variety of mission payloads into a universal payload fairing, where KSP would model the forces on the outside of the payload fairing only, and assume that all payload inside was \u0022strapped down\u0022 and unable to move at all in any dimension (realistic), it would be much easier.

The advantage is that the same asset can be used for a variety of purposes, often at the expense of the craft\u0027s mission-related performance (number of bombs/missiles carried compared to a specialized air defense/ground attack jets). In cases where the all-purpose craft has been mass-produced anyway, a common tactic of reducing the lowered performance is to deploy multiple crafts for the same mission.
