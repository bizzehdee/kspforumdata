Nuclear has great mortality/tW not because it is inherently safer, but because it makes so very much power. Humanity needs more and more electricity, so any power not created with nuclear has to be created by another source. Solar is in the same safety ballpark as nuclear, but still requires backup sources of power, virtually all of which are considerably less safer/power than nuclear.

live, but to develop a nuclear plant in the US (without bankrupting the power company that builds it) would pretty much require throwing the entire nuclear regulatory environment in the trash (mainly to kill the \u0022nuclear industry\u0022 that currently exists) and rewrite it in such a way that the commercial construction industry (who are certainly no angels themselves, but at least don\u0027t bankrupt *everything* they touch)\u00A0 can build the new plants.\u00A0 I can\u0027t imagine the politics behind this (never mind the \u0022masses\u0022, just imagine how many jobs will cease to exist both in the DOE and the \u0022nuclear industry\u0022) and I\u0027m sure it won\u0027t happen until the nuclear industry simply doesn\u0027t exist to object.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI bring up the idea of \u0022technology is what the infrastructure can produce\u0022 in discussions of the historical development of science and tech, but here it is blatantly in the present.\u00A0 The US (and most of the West) simply doesn\u0027t have \u0022the technology\u0022 to build a nuclear plant anywhere near profitable (not sure how Norway did it in the 1990s or so, but good luck letting them build those without worrying about local regulations elsewhere), thanks to the nuclear industry and the regulations that make sure they are the only ones capable of building nuke plants.\u00A0 You are far, far better off building wind and/or solar plus batteries than you are building a nuclear plant (and the batteries are a hard sell when you are already building cost effective natural gas plants [ignoring the carbon]).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheck the cost/kWhr coming out of any recent (or even not-so-recent) US nuclear plant: they are unmitigated disasters.\u00A0 Not only that, but any attempt for the nuclear industry to \u003Cspan\u003E\u0022catch up\u0022 (say if Lockheed *did* manage to build fusion reactors), it still has to race against rapidly less expensive (in terms of power generated) solar and wind plants (although I suspect that ideal wind locations are already in use).\u00A0 Public perceptions of safety are at best a tertiary problem for nuclear plants (unless you are talking about having Chinese construction companies build to Chinese standards): the cost is simply impossible to justify.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understand the Chinese are doing fine in nuclear plant construction, but high profile failures* make even moderate naysayers hardly willing to allow Chinese construction of nuclear plants (built to Chinese regulations).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, this entire rant is largely the reaction of a former \u0022true believer\u0022 in nuclear power (I still think it is a great idea, just that it pretty much has to start again from scratch.\u00A0 Perhaps with either \u0022hot pebbles\u0022 or fusion).\u00A0 When global warming was first discovered as a problem in the 1980s (and confirmed as a certainty in the 1990s, if not earlier), it was clear that nuclear power should have been our savior (from memory Norway was the only country to meet the Tokyo accords, and only by building \u0022not allowed by the Tokyo accords\u0022 nuclear plants).\u00A0 Unfortunately, people preferred to put their heads in the sand and the nuclear industry decided that the way to survive was to maximize the cost of the plants they were already building.\u00A0 By now there is no way that nuclear power can deliver its carbon-free power in time to avoid massive environmental damage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* to be honest, recent Chinese construction is mind boggling in scope.\u00A0 The only thing I can compare it to was 19th century US construction, and our bridges were collapsing left and right then.\u00A0 When you are constructing entire cities at once, having a few buildings collapse seems reasonable.\u00A0 But considering the \u0022locals examining hydrazine powered boosters\u0022 threads, I can\u0027t imagine many western nations willing to have nuclear plants built to Chinese regulations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill

Not only that, but China Syndrome came out weeks before Three Mile Island, and that certainly didn\u0027t help anything. Plus, the word nuclear is used both for reactors, and for bombs. And a good number of people don\u0027t like that, so they associate reactors with bombs, eventually.

And that would balloon costs like crazy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223509969\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002221979\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221545578331\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022133850\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022wumpus\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, wumpus said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure where you live, but to develop a nuclear plant in the US (without bankrupting the power company that builds it) would pretty much require throwing the entire nuclear regulatory environment in the trash (mainly to kill the \u0022nuclear industry\u0022 that currently exists) and rewrite it in such a way that the commercial construction industry (who are certainly no angels themselves, but at least don\u0027t bankrupt *everything* they touch)\u00A0 can build the new plants.\u00A0 I can\u0027t imagine the politics behind this (never mind the \u0022masses\u0022, just imagine how many jobs will cease to exist both in the DOE and the \u0022nuclear industry\u0022) and I\u0027m sure it won\u0027t happen until the nuclear industry simply doesn\u0027t exist to object.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI bring up the idea of \u0022technology is what the infrastructure can produce\u0022 in discussions of the historical development of science and tech, but here it is blatantly in the present.\u00A0 The US (and most of the West) simply doesn\u0027t have \u0022the technology\u0022 to build a nuclear plant anywhere near profitable (not sure how Norway did it in the 1990s or so, but good luck letting them build those without worrying about local regulations elsewhere), thanks to the nuclear industry and the regulations that make sure they are the only ones capable of building nuke plants.\u00A0 You are far, far better off building wind and/or solar plus batteries than you are building a nuclear plant (and the batteries are a hard sell when you are already building cost effective natural gas plants [ignoring the carbon]).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheck the cost/kWhr coming out of any recent (or even not-so-recent) US nuclear plant: they are unmitigated disasters.\u00A0 Not only that, but any attempt for the nuclear industry to \u003Cspan\u003E\u0022catch up\u0022 (say if Lockheed *did* manage to build fusion reactors), it still has to race against rapidly less expensive (in terms of power generated) solar and wind plants (although I suspect that ideal wind locations are already in use).\u00A0 Public perceptions of safety are at best a tertiary problem for nuclear plants (unless you are talking about having Chinese construction companies build to Chinese standards): the cost is simply impossible to justify.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understand the Chinese are doing fine in nuclear plant construction, but high profile failures* make even moderate naysayers hardly willing to allow Chinese construction of nuclear plants (built to Chinese regulations).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, this entire rant is largely the reaction of a former \u0022true believer\u0022 in nuclear power (I still think it is a great idea, just that it pretty much has to start again from scratch.\u00A0 Perhaps with either \u0022hot pebbles\u0022 or fusion).\u00A0 When global warming was first discovered as a problem in the 1980s (and confirmed as a certainty in the 1990s, if not earlier), it was clear that nuclear power should have been our savior (from memory Norway was the only country to meet the Tokyo accords, and only by building \u0022not allowed by the Tokyo accords\u0022 nuclear plants).\u00A0 Unfortunately, people preferred to put their heads in the sand and the nuclear industry decided that the way to survive was to maximize the cost of the plants they were already building.\u00A0 By now there is no way that nuclear power can deliver its carbon-free power in time to avoid massive environmental damage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* to be honest, recent Chinese construction is mind boggling in scope.\u00A0 The only thing I can compare it to was 19th century US construction, and our bridges were collapsing left and right then.\u00A0 When you are constructing entire cities at once, having a few buildings collapse seems reasonable.\u00A0 But considering the \u0022locals examining hydrazine powered boosters\u0022 threads, I can\u0027t imagine many western nations willing to have nuclear plants built to Chinese regulations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know.
