That way all your thrust goes directly into increasing your velocity instead of changing the direction of your velocity. The problem is that the equations for this don\u0027t have a solution if the TWR of the rocket varies throughout your launch. You have to do numerical simulations to figure out what the optimal trajectory is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding in aerodynamics means is even harder.

Thanks!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E There\u0027s not, and I doubt there ever will be. There are simply too many interdependent variables at work. You can, however, come up with very good empirical launch profiles simply through simulation or trial and error. They won\u0027t be ideal, but they\u0027ll be close enough that you won\u0027t miss the difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E When you get to the point where minor variations in your launch profile cost you less than the granularity of the parts themselves,... well, your profile might not be perfect, but you can rest assured that the imperfection is small enough to be negligible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slashy\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-07T09:11:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI was able to derive analytical solutions for certain stages of ascent, but not the whole thing.[...] Late in the gravity turn, when you are flying balls to the wall, there is an exact solution for the trajectory as well.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECare to share?

I thought you were in a rotating frame, but that is exactly when you would not need to subtract omega_s to get relative wind. So these are right. The v_theta/r takes care of Coriolis. Do you mean that you left it out of computation? That would, indeed reduce apparent dV requirement. Makes sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think, I will switch over to these eoms for my tests. They are more convenient than coords I was using. The methods are very similar, but because I work with parameterized forms, I can dump optimizer into C# code and have it run on the fly as a plugin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
