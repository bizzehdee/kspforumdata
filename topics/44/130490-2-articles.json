So far, I have but one major problem:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere should I test the motor?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI live in the Bay Area, so I\u0027m not exactly in a remote area, and neither my friends nor I own any kind of rural property. This would seem to limit my options with regards to doing static tests, never mind actual launches (I haven\u0027t even really thought about how I could get the required permits to \u003Cem\u003Elaunch\u003C/em\u003E rockets, as it would seem like it would be very difficult to do so in my area). I know lots of people launch/test model rockets in parks and the like, but I\u0027m not entirely sure I could do the same with an \u0022experimental\u0022 rocket. Furthermore, I\u0027ve heard that a lot of parks require permits to launch even model rockets. Also, I\u0027m a bit uncomfortable conducting tests in areas where there are likely to be other people, due to the risk that would be posed if the rocket CATOs (I\u0027m planning to install a relatively sturdy barrier around the test stand to catch any shrapnel if the casing ruptures, but I still don\u0027t want to take any chances).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have any advice on how I could go about finding a place to conduct static tests?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI live in a large city as well and I do my tests on my building\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s rooftop, if you keep your designs simple and not too ridiculous then the chances of a CATO are very low. I ve had my motors fail 6 feet from me and nothing happen, so long as you know the estimated pressure is not going to burst the pvc you are alright.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"B787_300","CreatedById":31055,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-21T00:53:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eya my schools motors have blown casings before... so not exactly small time stuff\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Armchair Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":76165,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-21T04:17:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022B787_300\u0022 data-cite=\u0022B787_300\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eon side note anyone know of a good Dual Deployment Altimeter, preferably accelerometer based that is relatively cheap?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese three are good choices: all are DD-capable, fairly cheap and popular, and will fit inside most rockets.
