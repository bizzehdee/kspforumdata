It comes with an 8 core SD810 on board with 4 1.56Ghz cores and 4 1.82Ghz cores. There are phones with the SD801 that packs 4 2.5Ghz cores and then the SD808 with 2 2Ghz cores and the clock speed on the others isn\u0027t listed. Then there\u0027s the SD805 a quad core 2.7Ghz CPU. Ignoring multitasking and GPU performance shouldn\u0027t the 805 be the best processor for mobile gaming? I know clock speed isn\u0027t everything especially on well rounded smartphones but doesn\u0027t higher clock speed generally yield better single core performance?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dilli","CreatedById":142986,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T07:28:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think there are large IPC difference between generations of SOCS, a quick google search suggested the SD810 is 20-50% quicker for same clock speeds. So how well a game can use the additional cores and how much quick the 810 is in that instance will determine whether its better of worse than the SD805 for that particular game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know too much about the different phone SOCs, only bother reading up every few years when need a new phone, so may be wrong about the above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese may help to better answer your question though: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.anandtech.com/bench/PhoneTablet14/990\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.anandtech.com/bench/PhoneTablet14/990\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.anandtech.com/show/9518/the-mobile-cpu-corecount-debate/17\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.anandtech.com/show/9518/the-mobile-cpu-corecount-debate/17\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T12:04:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ex86 cores have better performance than equivalently clocked arm cores, especially in the flops department. im not sure but i think clock speed is more important factor for the arm architecture than it is for x86.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
