Buy as much aperture as you can afford, and put it on an equatorial mount. Celestron makes it easy to do this, as equatorial mounts are designated with an EQ in the model name, and the aperture in millimeters is designated by the number. So one designated 114EQ has a 114mm aperture on an equatorial mount (also referred to as GEM, German Equatorial Mount).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou definitely want the GEM, as with proper polar alignment, it will allow you to keep the object you\u0027re looking at in view as the Earth rotates underneath the \u0022celestial sphere\u0022. A manual alt-az mount is only good for terrestrial viewing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually just bought a slightly-used Powerseeker 114EQ for $100 US (which if Google is right, is about your price range), and am actually quite impressed with it. The actual optics are significantly better than I was expecting, the only real complaint is that the stock finderscope is ass. But if you\u0027re smart, you can figure out a way around it\u0027s poor alignment. Just don\u0027t expect Hubble-quality views with this scope. But for $100, it\u0027s tough to beat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get an idea of what you can expect with it, at 225x (that is, using the 4mm eyepiece without the included 3x Barlow lens) Jupiter and the Galilean (Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto) moons fit comfortably in the field of view. Cloud bands (dark) and zones (light) were easily distinguishable. This view was also possible at 135x (20mm eyepiece with Barlow).
