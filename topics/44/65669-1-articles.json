As in, only barely faster than escape velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, it needs to pass very close over the planets surface, the lower the better (provided you don\u0027t crash).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThirdly, the planets needs to be easily deformable. So this won\u0027t work for very dense objects like neutron stars or black holes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe planet needs to rotate slowly, so that the surface is moving slower than the satellite that passes over it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically what happens is that the attraction of the satellite causes a tidal bulge on the surface of the planet. This bulge has some resistance and therefore moves slower than the satellite. Since any action has an equal and opposite reaction this resistance effectively slows down the satellite. But the effect is very small in most cases, that\u0027s why you need all the above things to maximize the effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe can see the reverse happening in the Earth-Moon system. The earth spins faster than the moon orbits. So in our case the tidal bulge is ahead of the moon, in effect slowing down the earth\u0027s rotation and accelerating the moon. This causes the moon to widen its orbit by about 4cm per year and slows down the earths rotation. Every year the day becomes 1.7 microseconds longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Nevermind, reading comprehension = 0. Thought you where trying to capture a massive object in a single body\u0027s gravity well. What you\u0027re saying is possible too, and in fact much easier. You just need to get a gravity assist of the moon. You can even do this in KSP, the Jool system is great for gravity assists. You can easily capture yourself into the Joolian system without aerocapture and use grav assists to get you back out.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-13T14:50:53Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2014 02:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Ralathon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-13T15:14:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlright, thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
