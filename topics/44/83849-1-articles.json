You have two parallel side by side rails. The voltage difference between the two is massive, lets call the right rail positive and the left rail negative. The electricity flows through the railgun round that is connecting the two rails, through magic reasons this generates a magnetic field on the front of the railgun round that pulls it forward along the rails. The greater the voltage difference, the greater the magnetic field, the faster the round goes. Now, something that operates relatively similarly is your standard welder. Charge your welding material, ensure the material to be welded is a suitable ground, bring welder material near the objects to be welded. As the electrons arc over, they carry the welding material with them, depositing it on the objects to be welded, also imparting a massive amount of heat. In the railgun you have a small amount of matter from the negative side depositing itself on the railgun round, which deposits some of its material on the positive side (remember kids, we got it wrong the first time and refuse to change, electrons flow from negative to positive! Even if the opposite was true, the railgun example would still be true, just which part is depositing on which part would change). So basically the left rail gets torn up while the right rail gets crap welded to its surface. Why might this be a problem you ask? Railguns work better when there is a firm contact between the round and the rails. If you fire weapon enough you run the risk of the round failing to achieve the velocity you needed it to, or worse, you risk the round jamming in the rails which instantly turns this device from a railgun, to the worlds biggest electric heater (without a \u0022load\u0022 for the energy to be devoted towards, in this instance pushing the object with the magnetic field, the whole thing becomes one super charged wire that was not designed to operate that way).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWays you might solve this? Every other shot, reverse the polarity of your rails. Suck from left, deposit on right. Next shot! Deposit on left, suck from right. This will delay the inevitiable accumulation on one rail and steady degradation on the other by basically causing both to accumulate and degrade at the same rates at the same time (the accumulation and degradation will NOT be evenly distributed along a rail, this is a matter for random placement of particles and such). However, it is still a simple and valuable thing to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow might you protect your rails from fouling? Well, their solution I\u0027m sure is classified, but my personal guess is that they are using some metal with a layered molecular structure like graphite or possibly depleted uranium. When a given rail happens to be the negative side, as the round shoots down the rail, the round is basically pealing up the whole top layer of the rail as though it were a giant strip of tape. This SHOULD rip up the layer, even if it is coated with slag from the round from a previous time when this rail was the positive side of the weapon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-05T17:38:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerbMav\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerbMav\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt still is debatable if we should build nuclear reactors on land - but using them on ships ... ships that are built for military use ... that might very well be fired upon at some time, destroyed and sunk, possibly close to shores ... nuts.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo could nuclear submarines, and they have nuclear missiles on them too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe chance of a submarine being sunk is lower than a battleship (I assume)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vger","CreatedById":67603,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-05T17:51:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mazon Del\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mazon Del\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWays you might solve this?

The arcing not only will occur, but it MUST occur in order for a railgun to work properly. The electrons have to flow from one rail, into the round, and into the next rail to build up the magnetic field. By suspending the round in air, now instead of the power flowing as it used to, you waste a bunch on having an electric arc snap out from the rail to the round to the rail. Everything is the same, but you have wasted electricity and chances are the magnetic field driving the round would disrupt the field suspending the round, so now your precision and accuracy go out the window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore along the lines of what you are thinking of is a Gauss Cannon. GCs work by having a big honkin coil of wire that you supercharge and then shove something magnetic into and away it goes. The problem is that a railgun is several orders of magnitude more efficient at converting electricity into movement then a gauss cannon is. This is because with a gause cannon, the magnetic field is very large, it exists through the entire tube (and because of the way field lines work) it extends to covering the tube itself like a sort of shield. In a railgun, just about all of the magnetic field is a couple inches to a foot away from the front of the round, and thats it.

Once the railguns are up and running, that changes a bit. A nuclear powered battleship sporting the largest and most numerous array of railguns on the planet makes for a stupendously powerful weapons platform. Imagine being under attack from 16 inch rounds impacting with the kinetic energy equivalent of a nuke each, from a ship 200 miles away, that is firing these rounds at a rate of like 4-6 per minute per gun, with 9 guns on board.
