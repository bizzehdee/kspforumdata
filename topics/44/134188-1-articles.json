There are tons of pigments that absorb at near-IR for example. It doesn\u0027t work at all like you described. The pigment doesn\u0027t have to be \u0022more sensitive\u0022 in any way, it just needs a different absorption band. Obviously the energy of longer wavelength radiation is much smaller, hence it\u0027s not a good source of energy for photosynthesis and the associated biochemistry would be different. I think there was a mention somewhere in Wikipedia about some plants even using IR for photosynthesis, but I won\u0027t vouch for it\u0027s accuracy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn any case, the light absorbing molecule is still just a regular carbon-based organic molecule and their photobleaching properties are a completely separate issue. For example you can\u0027t just \u0022bash\u0022 an IR-dye with UV kill it like you suggest. First of all it doesn\u0027t catch the UV light very well, it just passes over it. This is also a nice property, because it can be used for spectrophotometry. Second thing is that even if it would absorb it (and be an UV pigment instead), it would probably withstand our UV levels just fine since organic pigments do that fairly well in general. Unless you propose that the covalent bonds are somehow weaker around red dwarfs?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason why UV is dangerous for living things is because DNA has absorption maximum at 260 nm, which means that as long as the exoplants have DNA, they are susceptible to UV induced cell damage. This has zero to do with photosynthesis. Like I said, it\u0027s possible that life developing around a red dwarf might be ultra sensitive to UV, but it\u0027s just as likely that it would have the same resistance to it as any domestic plant. But since it\u0027s already hard to say if a plant from Siberia would live when transferred to Mongolia, it\u0027s impossible to say these things about a fictional exoplant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
