And of this amount of the budget, the government decides to spend over 56% of it on the military and such a comparatively small amount on both NASA that it comes out to less than half of a percent. And on actual scientific research? The amount doesn\u0027t even register as a percentage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen we talk about the US\u0027 budget and where cuts must be made, its the discretionary portion of the budget that needs more of the attention.

Presuming you had reallocated funds to work with, NASA wouldn\u0027t see too much of a boost (though really it doesn\u0027t comparatively need much to do far more than it has or can do) but education and scientific research would see huge and much needed boosts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI ain\u0027t even saying not to research the stars eventually, I\u0027m saying that it\u0027s not the time for it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think the peers of the first person to play around with harnessing fire thought it was time for it either.

By coming to understand the thing you\u0027re researching, you gain the ability to apply that knowledge again and again and again. We learned to harness fire, then we learned how to cook.
