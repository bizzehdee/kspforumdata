This system uses not one but two neural networks, pitting the pair against each other. One network is built to recognize natural images, and the other does its best to fool the first.\n\u003E Yann LeCun, who heads Facebook\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s 18-month-old AI lab, calls this adversarial training. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThey play against each other,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 he says of the two networks. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201COne is trying to fool the other.

Without the proper parameters, networks include various kinds of \u0022noise\u0022 along with the image.

Same with the notion of it being a step - maybe (at best) a baby step... the machine is still running off a set of given rules, not making them up on its own.\n\nIt\u0027s a bit more complicated than that. The *pointe* of ANNs is that it basically *is* the machine making decisions. Well, you could always argue that **all** processors work after a predefined set of rules, but it\u0027s the same with our brains ((bio-)physics).\n\nANNs work similar to that. The only layer in which things are predefined is a very fundamental one. In our (biological) case it\u0027s biology and physics, in the case of artificial neural networks it\u0027s the basic neural model (how do signals travel? what do neurons do?) and the learning algorithm. Keep in mind that the development of ANNs started as an attempt at recreating biological neural networks.\n\nYou only *show* an artificial neural network what to do. You actually *train* it (\u0022train\u0022 is the correct scientific terminology). The network has to do the \u0022learning\u0022 part 100% on its own. That is the point of artificial neural networks. And once it\u0027s ready, it will do and decide everything on its own, there is virtually nothing the programmer has created (except for maybe setting one or two paramaters, but that is not \u0022creating\u0022). That ANN may even react differently to exactly the same situation/input. Artificial neural networks sometimes (more or less usually) grow so large (depending on model) and complex that it is practically impossible to comprehend everything/anything that is happening inside them. You could say, they sometimes become their own territory.\n\nAs an example: I\u0027ve trained a neural network to do basic digit recognition. I have absolutely no idea how to program digit recognition. Not a single little idea. All i did was creating a model of ANNs, implementing it, initializing it, and telling it what to learn (of course also showing/training). At the end it could recognise digits, even those that were written in a way it had never seen before. **It wasn\u0027t me doing this.** I still have no idea how to programmatically do digit recognition.\n\nSo is it the computer making actual decisions? To some extend, definitely.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E they are starting to put fpgas in xeons now so that they can accelerate a wider array of algorithms to ease the cpu load in server farms. a couple years ago i read about neural net on a chip devices being tested. when those are as well developed as fpgas i can imagine a neural net being shoehorned into the die as well to increase the number of problems the cpu can solve (things like improved random number generation).\n\nIt\u0027s the Synapse project from IBM you are thinking about. They\u0027ve made huge progress since then, i recommend you to check it out. Really interesting.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-26T04:44:53Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2015 04:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tonnz**"}]}
