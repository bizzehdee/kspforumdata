Ultimately, though, these are effects of General Relativity. Gravity just doesn\u0027t work the way you normally expect when you are that close to something that dense. All orbits end up wonky, and the way tidal forces and gravity vary with radius is a bit different. Worse, the pull of gravity depends on how you are moving. It takes an infinite amount of force to keep an object at event horizon. The tidal force, then, is also infinite. Yet, if you free-fall into a black hole of sufficient size, tidal forces can be quite manageable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, almost any source I can point to assumes that you can work out gravity from the metric, and only list metrics.

Just to give some figures, Earth mass is approx. 6*10^(24) kg, G approx. 6.67*10^(-11) N m^2 kg^(-2) , and I assume that the distance (yeah, it\u0027s actually distance, not radius) between your CoM and Earth\u0027s CoM is precisely 5000 km (even while that won\u0027t be possible actually).\u003Cp\u003EF(grav) = (G*(m earth)^2)/(d^2) = 9.6048*10^(25) N\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea = F/m = 16.008 m s^(-2)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, both Earth and your Earth-massed body attracted pretty fast, with a relative acceleration of twice the value (observer have the same acceleration with the object).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is all fine, except you\u0027re calculating at roughly 1400 kilometers below the surface. Plug in the correct 6 400 ~ish kilometers for Earth\u0027s radius and you arrive at a more familiar value. And no matter how much you change the second mass, it always cancels out. Like I already calculated in abstract form and this is also what K^2 said earlier about the falling body\u0027s mass not affecting the acceleration caused by gravity, only the mass of the second body affects it due to elimination. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECreature, you seem to be confusing force and acceleration.\u003Cp\u003EIf Earth is pulling me down with a force of 650N, then I\u0027m pulling on the Earth with the force of 650N. That\u0027s Newton\u0027s 3rd Law in action. However, if I jump off a chair, these 650N will cause me to accelerate downwards at 9.8m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2. But Earth is really massive, so the same 650N aren\u0027t going to make much of a difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain I don\u0027t want to sound argumentative but to quote myself with some added bolds for emphasis:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat I mean is that let\u0027s say I\u0027m teleported so that I\u0027m floating in space next to Earth. I start to experience the gravitational pull F=G m(me)m(Earth)/r^2. \u003Cstrong\u003EFor my acceleration F=m(me)a where F is the gravitational pull. So m(me)a = G m(me)m(Earth)/r^2. m(me) cancels out which leads to gravitational acceleration g (roughly 9,81 m/s^2 on sea level). \u003C/strong\u003ESo that\u0027s why the acceleration is independent of my mass because it cancels out.\u003Cp\u003E But when I appear, \u003Cstrong\u003EI start to pull the Earth towards me with the equal force \u003C/strong\u003EF=G m(me)m(Earth)/r^2. Now the m(Earth) cancels out and the Earth accelerates at a=G m(me)/r^2 which is pretty small. But if you substitute the regular old me with a super-sized me that\u0027s the size of Earth, then suddenly my surface acceleration is also 9,81 m/s^2. Now the Earth starts to \u0022fall\u0022 towards me at a=9,81 m/s^2 (independent of Earth\u0027s mass, this is me pulling Earth).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So the point was that in \u003Cstrong\u003Efirst case I fall at 9,81 m/s^2 towards Earth and it falls at me with essentially zero acceleration\u003C/strong\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich at least in my mind sounds exactly what you just said? Or could you be more precise as to what you think I\u0027m confusing with what?
