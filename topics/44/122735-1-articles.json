More because the uranium it produces does not have a nasty neutron emitting isotope to deal with like Pu-240, thus making weapons design very easy. Oh, and it is uranium, so really easy would be a better term. Now it has less because it is also, due to decay of one of the other isotopes of uranium it produces, quite radioactive, thus requiring it to be handled in a hot cell, impeding some steps of production.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I prefer the uranium-plutonium cycle because it has already been done and is just as good as the thorium-uranium cycle.

Vital systems were placed at positions where they can get washed away by a tsunami or get bombed.
