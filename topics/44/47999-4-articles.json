Starting a base would be the start, figuring it out once you are there would be so much easier IF you are there... staking a claim to the real estate would also help... if there is nothing there... then use it as a stepping stone to... Mars?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, once resources here start to get scarce, the price will soar so high that mining it on the moon would be very viable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to what is on the moon, the real question is, what is under it. Billions of years ago, meteors constantly bombarded the moon, there could be rare metals, iron, even gold... would it be easy to extract... possibly, with help from the lighter gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould it be easy to get back to earth? hell yes...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the real idea would be to use those resources on the moon, such as, smelting them into sheets of metal, sending them into orbit where they could be used to build space ships to Mars or further... even if that took 100 years to accomplish, you have GOT to start somewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd Seret, you said it yourself...

China has the money to really think far into the future... and they have. They have plans to start with the moon, go to Mars and then to the asteroids. These are REAL plans with real funding... but they are in no rush...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd Kryten, going to the moon is the big cost, with its lighter gravity and on atmosphere, getting things OFF the moon would be simple, and very cheap....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Erocket rail sleds would force the resources into low moon orbit where it could be collected by robot transports and carried back to Earth... as no people would be involved, (no oxygen or life support systems or food etc etc) then it would be cheap....\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-14T10:33:24Z\u0022 title=\u002210/14/2013 10:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by kiwi1960\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr. Scruffy","CreatedById":38540,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-14T10:31:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TMS\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TMS\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow apt, given that white flags are often interpreted as a sign of surrender.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s what i thought.
