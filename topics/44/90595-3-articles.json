FTL is not a violation by any measure. Otherwise, Universe wouldn\u0027t be expanding at FTL speeds.\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest inaccuracy of KSP\u0027s Alcubierre Drive is that it doesn\u0027t properly take into account curvature due to gravity. You drop out of warp traveling at the same speed that you went into the warp at, but the frame of reference is accelerated. To account for this properly, author should have carried out parallel transport of the velocity vector in a curved space-time. Naturally, since gravity in KSP is a patched-conics approximation, it would be entirely acceptable to use Schwarzschild Metric for parallel transport as well, patching at SOI boundaries as necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a few minor issues as well. Energy consumption, visual effect of the warp, etc. But these could be chalked up to sacrifices in the name of gameplay and limitations of the rendering engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I write up my \u0022Space rescue team in space\u0022 themed sci-fi with FTL... can you do my Hyperspace jump physics?

Why does FTL reverse time travel, instead of reducing travel time?...
