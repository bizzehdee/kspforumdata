RCS fuel is likely to be at less of a premium than ammo. Close-in defences also have the issue that you\u0027re still likely to get hit by fragments of the projectile. Defences would want to take a layered approach, with missiles further out and maybe guns in close as a last ditch effort. You\u0027d be wanting to kill the missile as far out as possible. That\u0027s a similar approach to what naval vessels do. It\u0027s likely that only high-value targets like space stations would bother having that much defensive firepower, kill vehicles are likely to be small, expendable and have no active defences. They may not even have any weapons, since at orbital speeds your engine has more than enough smash to deliver a killing blow to an enemy vehicle or satellite. I suspect at most you\u0027d need some kind of terminal fragmentation effect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SchildConstruct","CreatedById":10241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-27T03:20:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WH40krules\u0022 data-cite=\u0022WH40krules\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHMore specificaly, stuff like the tactics and new weaponry and spacecraft needed for warfare in space.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKinetic Kill Vehicles are your friend. Nothing\u0027ll ruin your day quite like a soda can hitting you at 6-7 km/s. Cheap, virtually invisible, and difficult to dodge, too.

In LEO to MEO, that\u0027ll be an advantage due to all the noise in lower orbits (natural and man made).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELarge ships, however, are less fragile (more room for redundancy, and more room to let that KKV\u0027s plasma evaporate, like turret skirt armor for tanks), and require less support crew to service the ships, but they are far more intensive in construction. Way bigger heat signatures, too, so whoever is looking at the right spot at the right time with the best sensors wins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeat also eliminates any kind of weapon that is energy intensive, since water (the natural material with the highest specific heat, making for the best heat sink, is also danged heavy if you want to fire a weapon more than once). No lasers, no rail/coil guns. Missiles, maybe, but those are trivial to intercept at long ranges (and in space, everything is long range). Bomb-pumped lasers might work, being stand-off weapons, but are far-future sci-fi for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGround based assets (including fighter/bombers like the F-15 Strike Eagle) with ASAT missiles, or ICBMs will also ruin your day.
