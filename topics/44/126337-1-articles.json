Basically , the whole fuel tank is pressurised with a helium cylinder and releasing the fuel into the combustion chambers is much like squirting an aerosol can - instant. These pressure fed engines are used for orbital maneuvering and some upper stages.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, higher power liquid engines pump their propellants in with turbopumps. The fuel tank is unpressurised and they are reliant on a turbine to do the pumping. Some of the fuel stream is diverted to a power turbine to drive this turbopump. These are much more like jet engines and take a while for the pumps to rev up and reach max power. I think the space shuttle main engines were ignited 7 seconds before launch, because they needed to spool up. At zero seconds on the countdown, an incendiary charge is fired within the solid rocket boosters. Thing happen pretty quickly after that...\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T09:02:50Z","Content":"\nActually, on solid rockets, the thrust varies with burn time depending on mission requirements. Getting the proper thrust curve is a hard part of designing a solid rocket. They do this by using different castings for the solid fuel inside the booster. Also, they don\u0026#39;t stop instantly. They tend to burn out gradually, which is why they seem to still be burning when they are jettisoned.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-24T12:46:30Z\u0022 title=\u002211/24/2015 12:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T10:05:40Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Nibb31\u0027]Real world rocket engines hardly throttle at all.

Alas, the Merlin 1D as has flown so far can throttle only down to 60% of its 650 kN sea-level thrust, which is still a TWR \u0026gt;1 even with a single engine, and so the stage must perform a \u0022hoverslam\u0022 (suicide burn).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOf course, that \u002260%\u0022 figure is an old hat - now that the Merlin 1D is uprated to its \u0022full thrust\u0022 of 756 kN sea-level, it still retains the same minimum thrust from before, which is now roughly 50% of the maximum.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n@Topic: SpaceX has a much more throttle-able engine though, namely the SuperDraco. It can go at least as low as 20%, maybe even lower, and more importantly: it switches between throttle states almost instantaneously.
