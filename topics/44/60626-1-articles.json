That\u0027s why they go poof when they die- the skin ruptures. As for food, well, they photosynthesis. Water?

This is to talk about how kerbals are supposed to be like at version 1.0, not how they are now. My theory is: They need life support(not currently implemented) like any other creature, their heads are more resistant to impact than humans but not ridiculously so(any examples otherwise are a bug. also their necks should have snapped when hitting the ground at terminal velocity), and they have the same temperature tolerances as humans(reentry heat is not yet implemented), and that they are genderless(that\u0027s what the devs said). My point is that people should not make important assumptions based off of not-yet-implemented features, and instead stick to REAL science.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
