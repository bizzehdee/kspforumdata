It is possible for the amount of energy obtained from say two annihilating particles (i.e. an electron and position) to be greater than the total mass of the system. The total mass would be equal to 2 times the mass of an electron, and if the particles annihilated one another at rest then the total energy obtained would be equal to 2m_e*c^2. However, I imagine most annihilations occur with the particles possessing some velocity, and thus some kinetic energy.
