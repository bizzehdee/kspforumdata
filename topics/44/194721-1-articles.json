Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E spaceplane.\u00A0 Indeed many proposed\u00A0designs don\u0027t (having rockets you don\u0027t use until altitude, plus maybe briefly at takeoff), or use multi--mode engines which switch operations in flight (RBCC has *THREE* modes, for instance: Ducted Rocket, Ramrocket, and Scramjet).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRe-read what I wrote (with the clarification here).\u00A0 Any type of ramrocket design usually behaves as a Ducted Rocket at low speeds.\u00A0 Ducted (\u0022air augmented\u0022) Rockets produce Thrust and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E slightly better than a rocket at first,\u00A0increasing to the 700-800 second range by about Mach 3-4 (but a ramrocket will see ignition of the ramjet in the mixing zone long before this point...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo-Stage Spaceplanes are entirely feasible: with the upper stage spaceplane that actually achieves orbit riding piggyback on a larger spaceplane (technically only a plane, but to really get the most out of this it needs to be a much, much, much larger, faster, and more efficient plane than something like a 747) that then flies back to the runway independently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis allows the upper stage to only be equipped with engines that work well at high speeds/altitudes, such as the nuclear ramrocket I refer to here (a CONVENTIONAL ramrocket doesn\u0027t actually need the booster to get off the ground: as the rockets within the ramrocket usually produce enough Thrust acting as air-augmented rockets without complete\u00A0combustion yet occurring in the mixing chamber to reach speeds where the ramjets will operate efficiently.\u00A0 And I repeat myself: the primary rocket produces a sufficiently hot/fast exhaust stream for the ramjet to start producing a little Thrust even on the runway...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA diagram would be helpful, and maybe I\u0027ll produce one if you still don\u0027t understand.\u00A0 But this is a textual illustration of how both ramrockets and some designs of ducted rocket work:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPrimary Rocket --\u0026gt; Mixing Chamber --\u0026gt; Nozzle\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The mixing chamber is where the \u0027primary\u0027 rocket exhaust is mixed with air.\u00A0 In a ramrocket, the rocket simply operates fuel-rich, and the mixing chamber is designed to encourage/allow for combustion of the air with the fuel-rich rocket exhaust.\u00A0 But this ramjet combustion is not NECESSARY for the rocket to produce a fairly large\u00A0Thrust through the Air-Augmentation and nozzle on its own (indeed most\u00A0Thrust comes from the primary\u00A0rocket EVEN WHEN the ramjet is operating...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The primary function of the mixing-chamber is to provide extra Working Mass for the rocket.\u00A0 This\u00A0roughly doubles the Thrust if you mix the rocket exhaust in a 3:1 ratio with air and no ramjet combustion occurs, for instance.\u00A0 The ramjet combustion is actually a minor optimization to the design (typically providing around 10-20% extra\u00A0Thrust in a conventional ramrocket design: although Nuclear ones would benefit more sue to their anemic base-Thrust levels)- ramjets don\u0027t produce that much Thrust at reasonable sizes in real life, unlike in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The Nozzle, is s nozzle.\u00A0 You can use a typical bell nozzle, or opt for an Aerospike.\u00A0 Aerospikes should work very, very\u00A0well here as ducted rocket\u00A0exhaust is much cooler than in a conventional rocket (although you also have less unburnt fuel from the turbopump available for Regenerative Cooling) and the nozzle needs to be larger\u00A0to accommodate the high Mass Flow Rate from all the extra Working Mass from the atmosphere (larger rockets\u00A0are, paradoxically, EASIER to keep cool: due to effects resulting from the Square-Cube Law, which reduce the relative surface area exposed to hot gasses...\u00A0 I *highly* recommend the Everyday Astronaut article on Aerospike Nozzles for more detail\u00A0on precisely

It consists of a \u0022bump\u0022 and a forward-swept inlet cowl, which work together to divert\u00A0boundary layer\u00A0airflow away from the aircraft\u0027s engine. This eliminates the need for a\u00A0splitter plate, while compressing the air to slow it down from supersonic to subsonic speeds. The DSI can be used to replace conventional methods of controlling supersonic and boundary-layer airflow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDSIs can be used to replace the\u00A0intake ramp\u00A0and\u00A0inlet cone, which are more complex, heavy and expensive.[1]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTechnical backgroundEdit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen an aircraft is flying, the speed of the air relative to the engine is equal to the plane\u0027s flight speed. However, current turbine engines are unable to handle supersonic airflow. This is because\u00A0shock waves\u00A0associated with supersonic speeds can damage or cause dangerous vibrations in turbine blades, resulting in loss of thrust or engine failure. Consequently, in aircraft travelling at supersonic speeds, the air entering the inlet must be slowed down to\u00A0subsonic\u00A0speeds before reaching the compressor and turbine blades of the\u00A0jet engine. Additionally, the airflow must also be at the optimal speed and volume so as to offer maximum thrust.[2]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInletsEdit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nModern combat aircraft accomplish this in a variety of ways, through design of the inlet. The inlet sits upstream of the compressor and has a strong influence on engine net thrust. A well-designed inlet straightens out the flow, and feeds the compressor with low-turbulence air at a relatively constant speed and volume. This is not difficult to achieve in subsonic aircraft such as passenger jets, which do not perform high-speed, high-G maneuvers that lead to turbulent airflow.[3]Inlets on subsonic aircraft are simple and shorter, and are basically an opening designed to minimize drag.[4]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn supersonic military jets, the inlets are usually much more complex and use shock waves to slow down the air, and movable internal vanes to shape and control the flow. Supersonic flight speeds form shock waves in the intake system and reduce the recovered pressure at the compressor, so some supersonic intakes use devices, such as a cone or ramp, to increase pressure recovery by making more efficient use of the shock waves. The complexity of these inlets increases with an increase in top speed. Planes with top speeds over Mach 2 require much more elaborate inlet designs. This limits most modern combat aircraft to top speeds of Mach 1.8-2.0.[citation needed]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDiverterless inletsEdit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe DSI bump functions as a compression surface and creates a pressure distribution that prevents the majority of the boundary layer air from entering the inlet at speeds up to Mach 2. In essence, the DSI does away with complex and heavy mechanical systems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3 style=\u0022border:0px;color:#202122;font-size:1.2em;padding:.5em 0px;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022border:0px;font-size:19.2px;padding:0px;vertical-align:middle;\u0022\u003EWeight and complexity reduction\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022border:0px;font-size:19.2px;padding:0px;vertical-align:middle;\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Diverterless_supersonic_inlet\u0026amp;action=edit\u0026amp;section=6\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 style=\u0022border:0px;padding:.75em;vertical-align:middle;\u0022 title=\u0022Edit section: Weight and complexity reduction\u0022\u003EEdit\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022border:0px;color:#202122;font-size:16px;padding:0px;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\nTraditional aircraft inlets contain many heavy moving parts.

Thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s more than the Thrust of a single Merlin engine (9 of which are used to lift a Falcon 9, at 854 kN of sea level Thrust each).\u00A0 And if you used a 2:1 bypass ratio (easily feasible) you could get a little over 1.348 times the Thrust (sqrt of 1.818, which is 2/1.1) instead: or 1371.626 kN of Thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt these

only need a cluster of\u00A03\u00A0NERVA\u0027s converted into air-augmented rockets (at a 2:1 bypass ratio)\u00A0to lift a rocket with a launch stage capable of propelling the Falcon 9 upper stage 7000 m/s, if most of that 7 km/s were provided in-atmosphere where the air-augmented rockets work (not feasible in reality, I know, but a useful thought-experiment).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore likely a single, larger reactor, as reactor Thermal Power scales much faster than mass when you scale an individual reactor up (meaning one large reactor is better than 3-4 small reactors).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd all this is with 1960\u0027s reactor technology.\u00A0 More modern reactors should be able to obtain higher power

much more Working Mass to play with MASSIVELY increases your Thrust (about 5.56- fold for a 2:1 bypass ratio, BEFORE you include any extra Thrust from an included ramjet/scramjet in the mixing chamber...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t get me wrong though: chemical rockets can produce even more Thrust than this as ducted rockets for the same weight, at only moderately lower sea

Effective \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E is much, much higher (in the range of a jet engine just for the ducted rocket

1:6 to 1:12), and the airbreathing Effective \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E a bit lower than some high-end jet

propulsion is no longer viable (however with an internal Scramjet, rather than Ramjet, this wouldn\u0027t be until at least Mach 7-12).\u00A0 So the NTR is actively producing a *HUGE* amount\u00A0of Thrust (but \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is still poor as it weighs so much) in the atmosphere when in airbreathing mode (at very low Exhaust Velocity:

than being deadweight all the way until rocket closed-cycle Thrust is desirable...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis unfortunately doesn\u0027t scale down well- nuclear reactors become less and less efficient in terms of power output per kg of mass the smaller they become, but DOES scale *UP* extremely well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would\u00A0also require a rather large, to potentially HUGE airframe (with lots of wing-area, at very low Aspect Ratio due to the vast majority\u00A0of the time spent in atmospheric being supersonic/hypersonic) if put on a spaceplane (which is where this really shines) both due to the lack of scalability of the engine (you have to build a really huge airframe around a really huge engine) and the need to reduce re-entry and ascent heating (you can fly higher for a given speed with larger wings, helping with heat issues) to reasonable levels...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the payload capacity this design/airframe led to ended up being overkill, I would suggest NOT going the way of the Shuttle- and trying to find huge payloads to justify a huge spaceplane with more payload capacity than you actually need- nor of trying to shrink the whole thing down too far (which will kill the payload-fraction to little benefit, as reactors lose performance very quickly as you shrink them down), but instead suggest increasing the mass budget of the least reliable/reusable\u00A0or most expensive parts of the design, so heavier/cheaper/more reliable parts with wider safety-margins (and built to higher tolerances of manufacturing error) and built of easier-to-machine materials (high-end Steel instead of Aluminum, for instance: which is far heavier, but more heat-tolerant and much cheaper to machine)\u00A0can be substituted in instead (one of the reasons the Shuttle was so expensive- a lot of the parts were designed to INCREDIBLY strict margins, leading to a lot of parts that required excessive maintenance or had to be replaced after just a few flights...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can also add redundancies to the design,\u00A0increasing mass but allowing use of less reliable (but cheaper) parts that are more likely to fail, to trade-off any excess payload-capacity for lower cost and higher overall vehicle reliability...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium
