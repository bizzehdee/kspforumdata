How would dates work? If a document said, for example, \u0022this event happened on the eighteenth of november, 2022,\u0022 how would he aliens know what the heck we were talking about? Days, and years are subjective to the planet on which they are recorded. I suppose that yes, the aliens could come to earth and say \u0022Oh, so that\u0027s how fast it spins, and that\u0027s how fst it orbits. So that would mean that... this is exactly what they mean by \u0027day\u0027, and this is what they mean by \u0027year\u0027.\u0022 But it would be very complicated for each and every civilization to have its own way of writing down dates.\n\nMy idea is that we would choose a star (preferrably the largest star in the galaxy for clarity) let\u0027s say UY Scuti, and track how long it takes to make a full revolution around the galactic center. This length of time would be known as a \u0022Galactic Cycle\u0022 or a \u0022Scuti Revolution\u0022 or something, and fractions of it would be used instead of years. So we could say, for example, that Spacejam came out 1/24586956.304406th of a Galactic cycle ago.\n\nI would love to hear your opinions on this. (by the way, how far is UY Scuti from the galactic core and how long does it actually take to go around once?)"},{"CreatedByName":"baggers","CreatedById":143067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T03:54:30Z","Content":"Nah, stars don\u0027t really \u0022orbit\u0022 in a galaxy.

Something closer to a black hole would generate a higher relativity, leaving the measure of a year possibly being 7 years somewhere else. Logically deriving, I would say any kind of travel among any solar systems would be like visiting any country on Earth - where you change timezones depending on your location and the placement of the sun, how you accept how they track their own record keeping but you can translate it to your own timekeeping of choice.
