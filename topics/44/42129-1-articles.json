That was how long it was expected to take for Kepler to achieve its main goal: surveying a group of about 150,000 Sun-like stars up to 920 parsecs (3,000 light years) away to determine how common Earth-sized planets in Earth-like orbits are in the Galaxy.\u003Cp\u003E[...]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter launch, however, scientists discovered that most stars are more variable than the Sun (see Nature 477, 142\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153143; 2011). The mission would need more time to distinguish a random fluctuation in a star\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s brightness from a dip in starlight due to a passing planet, so last year, NASA extended the mission until 2016. But around the time of that decision, the first reaction wheel went bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo as far as I can see, NASA went with a SAS from Jebediah Kerman\u0027s Junkyard and Spaceship Parts Co where they should have gotten a more expensive Rockomax model. When looking at launch dates, etc, the failures are 4 years into a mission that was supposed to last only 3\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BD \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC so they lasted long enough for the initial mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen again, the design specs might have listed \u002210 years\u0022 in a better-safe-than-sorry attitude in the first place. NASA missions tend to run a lot longer than initially planned and I wouldn\u0027t be shocked if budgetary constraints have to do with that (a 10 yr mission means budgetting a 10 yr headcount for support \u0026amp; research. A 5 yr mission counts for only 5. \u0022Well it\u0027s still working it would be a waste to ditch it now\u0022 and then another 5-10 year. I can totally see that happen).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace is an environment that is incredibly harsh and you can\u0027t go out to squirt some oil in a bearing or replace worn parts. I\u0027m always amazed how they manage to keep things working for a so long, in an environment with huge temperature gradients, severe radiation, etc. Maybe NASA should take a more low-budget KSP style approach and accept the occasional failure? I for one would love to see wobbly contraptions with boosters jerry-rigged onto the main rocket with duct tape and tie-wraps. \u0022We don\u0027t know if she\u0027s gonna make it into orbits but we\u0027ve learned from our last failure and just doubled on the solid fuel boosters this time\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mefi282","CreatedById":63817,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T17:30:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERadial attached Reaction wheels:blush:\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Jedi Master","CreatedById":57348,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T17:40:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENASA disapproves of the new SAS. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously, if NASA had actual funding, this sort of thing would happen a lot less often.

When you\u0027re keeping something pointed with a precision that\u0027s right down near the attitude sensor noise level, you inevitably do a lot of back-and-forth and no-wait-back-the-other-way actuation, and that bleeds off propellant rather quickly. Reaction wheels and CMGs only burn electricity to do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut you always need thrusters (unless you can get away with magnetorquers, but we\u0027re talking about beyond-LEO missions here) to handle net torques, and there\u0027s a definite advantage to using finely throttleable thrusters so that you can burn propellant as a backup in case the wheels fail. That backup plan won\u0027t buy a ton of time, though, because those thrusters or their propellant supply always have a limited lifespan. I\u0027m not sure how much benefit you actually get from having that contingency option, nor how the cost balance plays out between hydrazine and electric thrusters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for LISA Pathfinder, that requires fine thruster control because it\u0027s compensating for disturbance forces, not just torques. I\u0027m guessing that attitude control imposes a minor increase in the delta-v requirement compared to canceling out radiation pressure, so it was simpler to do attitude control with the thrusters. It\u0027s also possible that a wheel-based system would have created too much vibration for that mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
