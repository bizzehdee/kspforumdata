It seems to me that there\u0027s two ways you could easily define a black hole...

But it seems that an equally useful definition is that a black hole is said singularity and it\u0027s associated sphere of influence and the effects it has on space-time.

Such events are predicted to happen. A neutron star with sufficient angular momentum can be past the gravitational collapse limit for a static object. And they do slow down because they lose a lot of energy due to electromagnetic and gravitational radiation. When it slows down sufficiently, it will collapse in an event known as \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitzar\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eblitzar\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E. We do have observations of events that match blitzar hypothesis, but no confirmation yet that this is the actual cause.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext part is slightly more complicated, but the key is to understand that while location for event horizon is defined only by the mass, angular momentum, and charge of the black hole, it\u0027s not until well into collapse that the horizon appears. The collapse starts simply because gravitational forces overcome various sources of repulsion in matter. Before the event horizon forms, could you spin the object back up to revert collapse? In principle, yes. At least, partially. The hard question, one which I don\u0027t have an answer to, is what happens to matter that has already become more compact than neutron matter. There could be some intermediate states, such as \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QCD_matter\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Equark or strange matter\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E.

This could lead to any number of outcomes from most of the star collapsing anyway, to it exploding instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, since there is no plausible way to supply required angular momentum anyways, this is purely academic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompletely separate is the question of what happens if we supply angular momentum once the black hole has formed. At first, not much interesting happens. You will, of course, have a Kerr black hole, which has a more interesting event horizon structure than Schwarzschild black hole, but real black holes are already going to have angular momentum and will already have that feature to some extent. There is, however, an extreme amount of angular momentum that a Kerr black hole can hold and still be a black hole. As the angular momentum increases, the size of the event horizon shrinks, until at some point, it goes away completely. Such an overextreme Kerr solution becomes a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_singularity\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Enaked singularity\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happens from there is not known. Kerr solutions are known not to be stable in the interior of a black hole or in the naked singularity case. But what that means is subject of some debate. There could be another solution for overextreme angular momentum, which still includes an event horizon. Or there might be one that truly does present a naked singularity. Or the singularity itself can be unstable, emitting all or part of its energy to shed excess angular momentum. Note that this can happen without violations of cosmic censor in a way similar to black hole evaporation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, it\u0027s clear that you will not be able to reverse the collapse once you have a black hole.
