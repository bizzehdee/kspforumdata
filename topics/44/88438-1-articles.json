The US and China are both developing heavy lift rockets though so it\u0027s a close call. ESA comes in fourth because of Ariane rockets and the probes they currently have out of Earth orbit. 5th is Japan because they have some comet probes. Something we really should know more about. India comes in 6th due to its recent Mars mission. Everything past this has no launch capabilities as far as I know (Except DPRK). DPRK comes in at 7th because of the satellite they launched not that long ago on their own. They kind of are put down by others but they seem to be moving forward although behind.
