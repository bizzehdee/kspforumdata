We can observe things, and we are conscious, therefore we know that something exists. It doesn\u0027t matter if the universe is a simulation or a giant power generator or just a random blob of wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey stuff, we know that\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Esomething\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eexists. Therefore,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enothing\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Edoesn\u0027t exist. So nothing is impossible. If nothing is impossible now, then nothing has always been impossible because\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enothing\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Estretches out across everything. So if there was something a trillion years ago but there is nothing now, then there is still\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Esomething\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ethat has existed. With that philosophy, there has always been\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Esomething\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ein the multiverse, but there has never been\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enothing,\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0nor will there ever be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore, the universe\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ehad\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to come into existence because otherwise there would be nothing. That\u0027s a little paradoxical and redundant but that\u0027s just the way it seems to be when we come to these kinds of questions. At the beginning of time there was a singularity, that\u0027s a zero-dimensional point with all the energy of the universe contained in it. Therefore, the concentration of energy was {total energy of the universe}/0. We all know that there are no rules when we divide by zero. So maybe that\u0027s how anything can happen, because there are infinite possibilities when we divide by zero, and when the singularity picks one, like the roll of an infinity-sided die, a new universe is born.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll that thought is making my head spin, I think I\u0027ll go do something else now.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-12T02:06:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222318457\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002244276\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221449863510\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022136090\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Interplanetary Engineer\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, Interplanetary Engineer said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like this mix of science and philosophy.

The law of natural selection, in its most basic form, is something like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn any space in which discrete entities can exist and have differing properties and some means exists by which new entities can be created, if an entity possesses a property that directly or indirectly results in an increased rate at which new entities with similar properties to it are created, relative to the rate at which those with properties similar to some other entity, then it is inevitable that over time entities with properties similar to that entity will comprise a larger fraction of the total population.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt sounds a little bit like legalese, for which I apologize, but the important thing is that when formulated this way it applies to quite a wide variety of things in addition to living organisms. The \u0022entities\u0022 don\u0027t have to be creatures or even objects - they could be computer programs. Say we have an internet with a bunch of computer viruses in it (which, incidentally, we do): the internet is the \u0022space\u0022 and the viruses are \u0022entities\u0022. They can have properties such as what they do, where they save themselves inside computers, how fast they replicate, etc. If a virus hides itself well and replicates quickly, then it will directly create lots of new copies of itself, and after some time anyone who goes around counting viruses can see that a higher percentage of viruses descend from it compared to slow and weak viruses. This even applies to things that don\u0027t replicate themselves: Imagine we have a cell phone store in which we sell cases in red and green. The \u0022space\u0022 is the store, and the \u0022entities\u0022 are the cases. We notice that people buy more green cases. In the interest of profits, it\u0027s only wise for us to make lots of green cases and fill the shelves with them. So a few weeks later, someone walking into the store is quite likely to find it filled with lots of green cases and not as many red ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other important thing about this is that it hardly relies on any physical laws at all - just very simple concepts like \u0022things,\u0022 \u0022time,\u0022 and \u0022a space of some kind in which things can exist.\u0022 As such, perhaps this is one of the \u0022original\u0022 fundamental laws that gave rise to all the others, if not the original law or proverbial chicken itself. \u0027Course I am tooting my own horn here xP\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GeneralVeers","CreatedById":148918,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-14T03:28:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222321456\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002244276\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221450047160\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022127797\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bill Phil\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, Bill Phil said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcept that still doesn\u0027t explain why the gravitational constant is the value it is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know.
