At short range, this could be hot, turbulent water with a velocity difference from its surroundings.

Just like low pressure, high pressure, or shear winds can create turbulent forces on an airplane, the same forces would affect the underwater vehicle. The difference is that if an aircraft drops ten feet due to a wind shear, it\u0027s still in the air. If a transonic U-boat drops even a few inches, it would come into contact with the water, and disrupt its trajectory, possibly even stop it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could probably adapt a CIWS like those currently in use to shoot down anti-ship missiles with bullets made of compressed lead powder which would disperse upon impact with the water, and with a high enough rate of fire, CIWS could be made to target an area that the submarine is calculated to pass through, dumping hundreds of kilograms of lead powder into the path of the torpedo and increasing the density of the water, collapsing the bubble when the submarine passes through it, and hopefully crushing it, or slowing it down long enough to take it out using conventional weapons.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
