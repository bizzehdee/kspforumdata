The space suit of an astronaut and the hull of a ship is more than adequate to shield against that.

On skin it\u0027s mostly absorbed by the outer (dead) layer of the skin so it\u0027s very safe in that regard. The only problem is if you\u0027re exposed to an alpha active substance so that it gets inside your body, the high energy in the particles will cause massive damage to your DNA. This is usually the real danger when working with any radioactive substances. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to answer your question, it\u0027s safe as long as it\u0027s kept inside the casing.

That\u0027s 27,000 microsieverts per hour.

If you open the case and there\u0027s plutonium dioxide pellet inside, you\u0027re pretty much ok because that\u0027s a ceramic material.
