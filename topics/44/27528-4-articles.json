To be sure, a human mission can still be \u0022wrong enough\u0022 to fail, but those parameters are much broader; and hopefully, we have some basic robotic recon at that point anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it comes to (\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E, we need to ask how much searching time is enough. If a lander can be expected to return a piece of information in, say, ten thousand times the amount of time a human would take (to make Squyres\u0027 glib estimate work), then we need to ask whether it\u0027s cost-effective to pay the engineers, scientists, technicians, ground support, custodians, etc., etc. for ten thousand times the amount of ground time or whether it\u0027s more cost-effective to build a manned program.

If you want to get a basic overview, a machine is much more cost-effective to send into the hazardous environment of space.

In practice this would mean that I would provide funding to develop the Skylon concept, a fully reusable spaceplane design powered by the SABRE engine in exchange for the right to either manufacture or buy a certain amount of these craft at a fixed price.

You can design a rover to accomplish a specific mission and its capable of performing within the parametres of that mission. On the other hand, humans are capable of changing the parametres of their mission due to changing circumstances. Humans have the ingenuinity to reassess the progress of a mission throughout its operation period and if somthing does not appear to be paying off, they can act on the information they have to redefine the mission in a way that affords better results. A rover is only capable to the limits of what was already planned for on the ground.\u003Cp\u003EThere is no doubt that a rover can achieve adaquete scientific objectives and, in many cases, for now they are the only option for exploring certain bodies but as it becomes possible to have humans closer to the action, doing so is certain to result in a higher quality of research. That\u0027s before we even add the fact that placing humans and in space and doing it safely presents technical challenges that are worth exploring in their own right, something that could have positive benefits ranging from human colonisation and resource utilisation of other planets to sub-orbital passenger flight here on Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t agree. The men you send out there will always be limited by the skillset and equipment you send with them and the very limited timescale of any mission; we simply can\u0027t send men to Mars for the duration needed to really do any significant research, however skilled and well-equipped they are. For the cost of sending two men and a small range of test equipment for a short-duration mission you can send dozens of rovers out with a far wider range (between them, not on any one rover) of test equipment, AND explore a wider variety of environments and terrains, AND continue the research for years afterwards, AND maintain a large Earth-based skillset to adjust the parameters of a rover\u0027s mission to within the limits of its design. Spirit and Opportunity enabled us to learn far more than any single manned mission could have done despite the low cost and limited equipment. Curiosity will do even better. And if it fails to answer any particular questions, then the next rover can be equipped to answer them - and all for far less than one manned mission would have cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving said that, I believe there is a place for manned research, but we can\u0027t just send men out blind. If we had sent a manned mission to Mars in place of Spirit and Opportunity then they would have learnt a fraction of what the rovers achieved and used up all NASA\u0027s research budget for twenty years, simply because we would have had no informed goals for them to accomplish. We need to learn as much as we can using rovers, so we can pick and choose the destinations for manned missions with specific research goals that rovers can\u0027t achieve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWait: Weren\u0027t we talking about the shuttle?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-20T21:22:43Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2013 09:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by softweir\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAfterthought.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Canopus","CreatedById":57774,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T21:33:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ThePyrateCaptain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ThePyrateCaptain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell until the tech catches up with the ideas, then don\u0027t make one.
