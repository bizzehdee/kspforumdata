On the one hand, the fact that the mass is water doesn\u0027t mean you need any less mass, even though you use it for other ends (the astronauts can probably take as many showers as the recycling system can process). And second, nobody is 100% sure of how much is enough. On the one hand, there is the people that say that if you try this at a solar minimum, there is a good chance you can just brave it out without any shielding (close to the maximum career limits for astronauts, though). And on the other extreme, 10-20mT of shielding per square meter will let you have radiation levels lower then Earth\u0027s surface in the middle of a solar flare (useful for colonies making babies). An infinite range between those two, so pick how much you want.
