Are they viable for every stage or just boosters? I understand how they have lower ISP but are pretty much throttle-able solid rockets.

Mythbusters built a hybrid rocket out of a salami.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHybrids are good for any stage, but not for any rocket. As you said yourself, they have slightly lower I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E than liquid rockets. So for large rockets, that\u0027s the deciding factor. If you need over 9km/s of delta-V, for something like LEO launch, going from 400s of a hybrid to 480s of a liquid rocket can save you almost 50% in fuel. In practice it will be less, but it\u0027s still considerable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, when you are building a small rocket, weight is a huge factor, and liquid rockets have many heavy components. These components also tend to make liquid rockets less reliable. Hence the use of hybrid rocket on Space Ship One and similar projects.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dharak1","CreatedById":61137,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T09:06:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI understand the minuscule difference but roofing tar is also easy for me to get for free. I also Dont plan on putting this in a rocket anytime soon. Maybe in 1 or 2 years after i have developed it enough to make a good use of it. My first plan is just a pipe with roofing tar having GOX run to it and light it on fire.
