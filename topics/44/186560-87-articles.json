With a low-boiloff, well-insulated hydrolox landing stage based on the BE-3U, BE-7, or RL-10, that\u0027s something in the neighborhood of 9.4 tonnes of braking propellant from TLI into LLO. The lander/ascender budget then becomes 15.6 tonnes, which gets you 10.3 tonnes landed on the lunar surface. Total hydrolox use is 14.7 tonnes, 13% less than the propellant load of a 4-meter DCSS. The 4-meter DCSS is 2.48 tonnes dry, so if we allow 2.5 tonnes for the dry mass of the landing stage (1.96 tonnes tank mass but tacking on 540 kg to account for boiloff, maneuvers, landing legs, and extra engines), then that leaves us with a payload and ascent module budget of 7.8 tonnes, 66% greater than the Lunar Module ascent stage.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus. building a new common bulkhead and adding four Raptors (or Be-4s) on a drop skirt to the existing SLS saves two RS-25s per flight and converts Block 1B into a single-stack moon rocket a la Apollo. SpaceX has dozens of deprecated Raptor 1 engines laying around at this point; I\u0027m sure Elon would let them go for cheap. Surface sorties can be augmented by surface assets emplaced through commercial heavy-lift.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s if NASA remains stubbornly insistent on flying segmented SRBs, SSMEs, and Orion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-05-01T02:40:09Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2022 02:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by sevenperforce\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded explanation\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-01T04:35:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224124961\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022186560\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221651372583\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157695\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sevenperforce\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n48 minutes ago, sevenperforce said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s if NASA remains stubbornly insistent on flying segmented SRBs, SSMEs, and Orion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the core is sacrosanct, I wonder what could be done with liquid side boosters.
