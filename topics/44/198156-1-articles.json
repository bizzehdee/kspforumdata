They claim that Tesla would single-handedly lead us into the bright future if it weren\u0027t for the likes of Edison ruining his chances. But the truth is that Tesla\u0027s biggest problem in making a successful business out of his genius was\u00A0lack of personal discipline, and it\u0027s the same problem that would prevent him from building anything truly grand given resources.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Serenity","CreatedById":179192,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-17T00:28:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone\u00A0who
