I should have said \u0022Life, intelligence, or civilization descended from humanity.\u0022\n\nCall me an optimist, but I think that human civilization (or at least a descendant of us) has a strong chance of lasting billions of years into the future. That is, if we maintain a strong space program.\n\nAnd by \u0022human civilization\u0022 I mean whatever species or civilization evolves from us. Since it would be unlikely for any species to last a billion year without evolving to be almost unrecognizable, and even less likely for a culture to last a thousand without such radical changes. \n\nNow I know this sounds kind of absurd. Billions of years? That\u0027s a lot. But look at it this way: Why not? The obvious answers are things like huge asteroid impacts, horrible climate change, disease, nuclear war, etc. But all of those things only affect one planet at a time. If we get some extraterrestrial colonies going, then there will always be a few people left after these sorts of disasters. And I think it would be entirely feasible to put a colony on Mars within a few decades, if only there was enough funding for the space program.\n\nSo here\u0027s my question: Assuming that all of the space programs around the world get an arbitrarily large boost in funding, why would humanity not last for a billion years?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T16:41:40Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 04:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by itstimaifool**"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T14:02:12Z","Content":"There are several possible extinction scenarios even if we get colonies on nearby planets.

I mean, are you talking the stuff we are supposedly \u0022causing\u0022, or just Earth changing as it has for billions of years? \n\nAnyway, it depends on us in the end. If we can colonize, as others have said, our chances are pretty good. The fact is, while there are hundreds if not thousands of scenarios out of our control that could cause our extinction, they are ALL quite unlikely to occur in any amount of time that would affect us. After all, the universe is 14.3 billion years old. It works a whole lot slower than humans, who have been around for less than 500,000. That is to say, geological clocks run much slower than biological clocks. If we don\u0027t destroy ourselves (nuclear war, virus, etc), I am optimistic. However, knowing how predictably unpredictable humans are, I am not optimistic that we won\u0027t destroy ourselves. Sorry to say, but WW3 will be nuclear, and if it doesn\u0027t kill us all, then we\u0027ll be fine.\n\nEDIT: If it doesn\u0027t kill us all AND we get off the planet in say, 100-500 years or so (very, very, very rough estimate according to scientists, some even speculate we could last 1000 years more here.

I mean, are you talking the stuff we are supposedly \u0022causing\u0022, or just Earth changing as it has for billions of years?\n\nGiven enough time, a runaway greenhouse could potentially lead to total extinction, but that\u0027s not what I\u0027m talking about. That\u0027s the long-term threat, but we\u0027re in deep trouble long before we have to deal with that.\n\nThe short-term threat of climate change is that it is a risk multiplier: it makes all of the existing problems worse. Famine, pestilence, war; the danger of all of these is enhanced by climate change, and they all feed into each other.\n\nFood crops are both location and climate dependent. As the US rain band shifts north to the defrosting Canadian tundra, you can\u0027t just shift the crops with it; the recently-thawed mud needs time to develop into proper agricultural soil. Shifting climate also trashes pollination mechanisms for wild flora and drives extinction of endangered species. Changing watercourses exacerbate already-dangerous shortages of potable water. Expanding tropical zones bring tropical diseases with them; you can already track the march of Dengue fever etc. southwards along the north Queensland coast.\n\nFor the most obvious example: almost all of Bangladesh is within spitting distance of sea level. On current rates, the country is likely to be largely uninhabitable (without Dutch-style water management, which the Bangladeshis don\u0027t have the resources to implement) within a century. Bangladesh\u0027s neighbours (India, China, Pakistan etc.) are all nuclear armed and have a history of military conflict. How do you think they\u0027re going to react when 100 million Bangladeshi refugees land on their doorstep? What will India do if China attempt to divert all of the Bangladeshis to the south and vice-versa?\n\nThat\u0027s just one example, but similar scenarios recur again and again across the world. Throughout history, most military conflict has ultimately been caused by competition over resources. Climate change, in the near future, is going to substantially damage the global food supply and the already-running-short supply of potable water. Desperate people do desperate things, and there\u0027s nothing like hunger and thirst to drive desperation. Historically, starvation leads to revolution.\n\nIf you go talk to the academics who specialise in conflict studies, they\u0027ll tell you that we\u0027re already seeing the first climate-driven wars. So will the people in charge of medium-term planning for the militaries of the industrialised world. Marginal environments like northern Africa are the first to go, but it will spread beyond that with time. We live in an interconnected world; everything affects everything else.\n\nThe situation we are seeing now is not \u0022the climate changing as it always has\u0022. Yes, climates change over geological timescales; the slow pace has historically given the biosphere time to adapt (and, in the rare cases of sudden change like Chicxulub, the slow pace afterwards has provided time to recover). What we\u0027re doing to the place is unprecedented in both its suddenness and its momentum. We\u0027re driving the change way too fast, and there is enough momentum built up (warmed oceans, melted permafrost, defrosted methane clathrates) that it\u0027s either too late to stop it or very close to that point.\n\nIf you aren\u0027t frightened by climate change, you don\u0027t understand the situation.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T15:30:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 03:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound**"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T15:26:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Someone mentioned unfriendly aliens, but what if *we* become the \u0022unfriendly aliens\u0022?\n\u003E Seeing as we fought many wars throughout history, that\u0027s bound to happen sometime in the future.\n\nActually, there is cautious optimism that our most violent days are behind us.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/NbuUW9i-mHs?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n that explains the basics. Both the cost of war and the profit from peace are skyrocketing. In addition, nowadays knowledge is much more valuable than the actual land.

Such societies become static, and in turn stagnant. Their technology base becomes fixed, and therefore so do their resources. This leads to a \u0022zero sum game\u0022, where resources are strictly controlled to protect the status quo.\n\nOur present civilisation has fortunately not yet become static. We are able to invent new technologies and find new ways to exploit resources. As demand for apparently non-renewable resources increases, supply also increases, as new ways to obtain them are found.\n\nIn a closed \u0022zero sum\u0022 world, population growth should be a threat to global food supply. However, in our world, this has not been the case. This is because humans are not merely consumers, they are net contributors. More people means better economies of scale and division of labour. Better education and technology increase this effect further. When humans are net contributors to their economy, every birth is a blessing, not a curse.\n\nThere are those who harbour extreme political views who don\u0027t see it this way. In their worldview, humans are doomed to compete against each other over fixed or diminishing resources. When other human beings are seen as a curse and not a blessing, the worst forms of human behaviour are seen as a necessary evil. In their view, the rise of human technological civilisation is a threat to the natural order and will lead either to a natural catastrophe, war, or a combination of both. This fate can, they say, be avoided by enforcing Orwellian restrictions that place strict limits on energy usage (and therefore economic activity), as well as \u0022reducing\u0022 the global population to \u0022safe\u0022 levels by unspecified methods.\n\nOur civilisation has already begun expanding it\u0027s economic influence into space. Satellite imagery and remote sensing is used to identify new resources on the ground and make better use of available land. The effects of pollution can be monitored and mitigated. Weather satellites are vital to many industries, as are satellite navigation and positioning systems. The importance of global communications cannot be understated. Access to space allows us to make better use of and take better care of the Earth.\n\nWhen new lands such as North America and Australia were first discovered, they were seen by many in Europe as worthless wilderness. They were too far away, undeveloped, and seemed to lack any resources that could readily be exploited. The West Indies and the Spice Islands did have resources that were of value, so the European powers readily fought over these, while vast tracts of \u0022worthless\u0022 land in North America were being bought and sold for a pittance.\n\nThe importance of human expansion into space is not understood by all, but there is a growing body of people who do. Entrepreneurs and visionaries have been working since the beginning of this century to break the stagnation that has existed since the demise of the Apollo Program and the Cold War Space Race. There are those who see these new developments as a threat to the status quo. There are those who say that the new worlds that await humanity are a worthless wilderness. That such worlds are too far, underdeveloped, and have nothing to offer us. We often hear stories about how the challenges of exploring new worlds are supposedly insurmountable, and should be abandoned in favour of go nowhere programs that cost a lot of money but achieve little.\n\nOnce humanity has overcome the current inertia, the first step will be to develop the resources of the inner solar system. The resources of the main Asteroid Belt are effectively inexhaustible. While the main belt is hard to get to from Earth, it is within easy reach of Mars, which has the resources needed to support a major industrial and technological civilisation. Anything the asteroid miners can\u0027t produce for themselves at their relatively small outposts can be imported from Mars.\n\nLater, the outer solar system will be settled to bring it\u0027s effectively inexhaustible reserves of helium3 fusion fuel into play. There are many ways to get sustainable energy on Earth, but since the energy needs of an advanced civilisation will be vastly greater than the present day, fusion will quickly become the cheapest game in town. The outer solar system will not only give us unlimited energy, it gives us the energy needed to propel starships. For a mature civilisation that had developed the resources of the home solar system, starflight would be the next step.\n\nFrom that point onward, humanity should be able to expand indefinitely, evolving onto a galactic civilisation. On the other hand, if we remain confined to the Earth, we will last as long as it takes for the next dinosaur killer asteroid to come along and wipe us out. Given this imperative, the claims that space exploration is a \u0022waste of money\u0022 that would be better spent elsewhere needs to be understood in it\u0027s proper context!"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T20:47:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Someone mentioned unfriendly aliens, but what if *we* become the \u0022unfriendly aliens\u0022?\n\u003E Seeing as we fought many wars throughout history, that\u0027s bound to happen sometime in the future.\n\nAn real danger, something like the cold war could go wrong, also has plenty of death cults or groups who wanted to end the world if they loose, spreading out will decrease the danger, interstellar war is very unpractical.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E We\u0027re a fairly persistent species, so unless Earth gets destroyed while we\u0027re still stuck here, I don\u0027t see how we could go extinct.
