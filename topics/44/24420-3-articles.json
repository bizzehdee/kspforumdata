Modded laser weapons have a limited range of 2.5km because that is the range of the \u0022physics bubble\u0022 around ships. So current weapon designs are all kinetic killers, trying to slam into something with as much relative velocity as possible. There is an upper limit to how fast you can slam into something too, since if you are moving in a frame further than the collision box of your target, you will pass right through it (Essentially teleporting to the other side of the object). So effective KSP stock weapons are relatively heavy, so that they can pack more kinetic power while moving slow enough that they wouldn\u0027t pass through their target. A good example was a design posted for a high velocity \u0022bouncing betty mine\u0022 type planetary defense.

Let me explain:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, as you stated, some of the behavior of things in Kerbal\u0027s physics engine are not quite according to reality, \u003Cem\u003Ee.g.,\u003C/em\u003E 2.5 km limit on lasers. But that\u0027s OK. The point is that there \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E behavior.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I was growing up, many SF fans including me were enamored of the hard science novels of Larry Niven. In the years since, many have pointed out the scientific inaccuracies in the novels. That does not matter. The point is that in the novels there were the rules of physics, and many of the novels presented the protagonists with puzzles which could be solved by the application of the rules of physics. Us SF fans were taught that there were rules, and by playing the game you could solve the puzzle. Very similar to a mystery novel, can you solve the mystery before the detective calls all the suspects into the living room before the fireplace?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, they teach you the method of science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal like Niven might have a few of the details of physics incorrect. But the players and readers can learn latter the little details. The important thing is that they have learned how to play the game of science. This is why I get so excited about forum posts talking about young children becoming addicted to KSP, and learning about rocket science all by themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy doing exploration and experimentation in the Kerbal universe, people have discovered in that universe kinetic weapons are superior to laser weapons.

From there, I think I learned the basics of KSP space \u0022combat\u0022. And the answer was pretty stunning: it is surprisingly rocketpunk-like! Let me explain further.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, if you go stock, the only option you have is to go kinetic. But, you have no clever computer to do the aiming for you, all the flying is manual. So, managing long-range intercepts is almost impossible, and pure luck if you manage to hit your target at more than 100m/s. As a result, you have to first get close to your target, roughly match velocities, then go for the (hopefully) kill. The implications of it are that the closing speed of projectiles are fairly low. What does that imply, in turn? Well, a bunch of stuff. First, massive projectiles pack much more punch. They are almost a must, if you want to really break stuff. Second, armor actually makes sense: the new plates (and the old wing parts) can shrug off a surprising amount of damage. People where actually building multiple-layered armors! And they were effective! Of course, a good big SRB could punch through pretty much anything, and what it didn\u0027t blow up it could knock loose. But that takes a big ship to get up... And last, but not least, all of the combat had to happen fairly close, mostly inside the 2.1kms physics sphere, where the combatants could spot each other using the old Mk I eyeball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what is the end result? Space combat in KSP was awesome, even if it resembled very low tech levels that would never happen in real life. Like massive armor-plated battleships closing on each other before unleashing smart missiles (one by one) and/or salvoes of dumb torpedoes. I think that is a good thing, and made for some great videos like the ones from Macey. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, with mods, you could tear down some of this limitations. Mechjeb gave you very accurate information, so you could plan high speed interceptions, like Scott Manley showed a couple of times: say goodbye to armor. The Lazor mod could vaporize anything coming inside a 2.1kms sphere, and had a perfect aiming tool: good point defense if you have the time to select the incoming projectiles and blow them off one by one. That is surprisingly realistic, too (other than lasers would have much greater ranges IRL). But I think stock made for a better show, IMO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then again, this is a game with real-life Newtonian physics, so perhaps it shouldn\u0027t be that surprising that the combat ends up being realistic...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
