Still attached by a tether, they have a hard time finding a grip on the station to stop themselves.

As her leg starts to slip, Clooney unclips his tether and falls away to his doom, saving her in the process. Except, well, not so much.

All she had to do was give the tether a gentle tug and Clooney would\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been safely pulled toward her. Literally an ounce of force applied for a few seconds would\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been enough.

If they were going only slightly faster or slightly slower, then the tether would have wrapped around the station and pulled them in. Basically, they had to be \u0022geostationary\u0022 above the attachment point of the tether. What are the odds of those two speeds \u003Cem\u003Ev\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003Ev\u0027\u003C/em\u003E matching exactly out of pure coincidence?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut ok, this is Hollywood.

They would have preserved the same absolute angular momentum \u003Cem\u003Ev\u0027\u003C/em\u003E but because the radius of the tether was different, their relative speed to the anchor of the tether would be much higher. Their speed \u003Cem\u003Ev\u0027\u003C/em\u003E would no longer be the magical \u0022geostationary\u0022 speed that it was at the end of the tether and would have wrapped around the station and pulled them towards it in a spiral.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other point that doesn\u0027t make sense in this scene, is that as soon as Clooney detaches himself, Bullock is no longer pulled away from the station. She should have had the exact same angular momentum \u003Cem\u003Ev\u0027\u003C/em\u003E as before, yet she has no problem climbing back up on the tether to get back to the station.

The only reason she didn\u0027t slide away as well is a bit of tension built up in the rope due to the fact that they were both sliding away from the station, which allowed for a bit to recoil.
