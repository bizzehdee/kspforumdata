We don\u0027t have much experience with these ideas, because we can\u0027t simulate the various levels of artificial gravity. It is expected that the Coriolis effect caused by the spin might cause motion sickness and various undesirable effects that might be more detrimental on the organism than the benefit of the artificial gravity itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo reduce the Coriolis effect, you want to make the diameter of the spinning vessel as large as possible and the spin rate as slow as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shand","CreatedById":57781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T09:05:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ecompletely forgot about that. the Coriolis effect would definately apply as the system was spinning up, but if you minimised the volume of the spinning bit (to control the air better) once it got up to speed would it still be significant. you want to minimise the velocity of the inner and outer edge of the rotating space to minimise the Coriolis effect - so yes wide and slow is the way to go. so now its a compromise given mass/volume of launch (tending to increase speed) and minimising the Coriolis effect (tending to decrease speed), so it will come down to which is the most constrating factor for the mission. for long haul interstellar flights you\u0027d go big and slow, for ISS small experiments (why would you do them in space?!) you\u0027d go small and fast.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T14:33:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022shand\u0022 data-cite=\u0022shand\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eas for lengths and rotation speed, its a compromise between the two. the longer the pivot, the faster the spin will have to be (is that the right way round), since there is very little cost in a faster rotation (once its got going) and a very real cost in getting said system up (volume and mass of launch).

So the longer the \u0022rope\u0022 is, the slower you turn for the same acceleration. In fact, at very short distances, the acceleration may become significantly different between your head and toes, so that would feel incredibly weird. Plus coriolis would become more significant, relatively speaking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, the energy contained in the system would be the same for the same acceleration and mass, so the length would not matter in the energy requirements to spin it up. Only a longer rope would be heavier, so it would matter in real life. For a practical number, around 50m radius would be OK (longer even better), but forget about centrifuges ~10m in diameter, unless you just want a small fraction of a G, or you just use them as beds. Studies seem to indicate somewhere between 6 and 10 rpm humans get sick (as in motion sickness sick) due to coriolis effects.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T14:57:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the fundamental principles of General Relativity is that you cannot distinguish acceleration from gravity. At least locally. What that means is that given a long enough tether, you can make it so that it\u0027s impossible for astronauts to tell whether they are in space, with gravity simulated by rotation, or the whole thing is sitting on the surface of the Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, \u0022long enough tether\u0022 in practice is going to be prohibitively long. With short tether, there are going to be some obvious signs that the gravity is generated by rotation. Coriolis effect is the single biggest giveaway. In terms of human biology, so long as rotation is slower than 2RPM, none of these effects cause any health problems. That means that if you want to actually use this in space to generate Earth\u0027s gravity, tether has to allow for at least 220m from center of rotation. In other words, if counterweight has similar mass to the ship, you are looking at about quarter mile of tether. This is far from impossible, but it\u0027s not going to be cheap.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nikolai","CreatedById":23085,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T17:19:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey actually tested this idea for creating artificial gravity on Gemini 11, tethering the spacecraft to its (Agena) docking target and thrusting sideways.
