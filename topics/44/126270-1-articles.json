That is around 5.7 g or 0.0057 kg of air at standard temperature and pressure.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSuppose you sneeze really hard (but only air is expelled) and expel this air from you lungs in one tenth of a second.

You can\u0026#39;t claim the human is just the fuel and work out deltaV from that. You can say that a [highly skilled athlete] can get to 4 m/s by jumping. Or you can build a \u0022rocket\u0022 that would be the equivalent of a command chair and ion thruster.

The big catch is that you still need to define when the human stops. Max output in a single day? Max output without additional feeding (cut the xenon, you won\u0026#39;t need much)?
