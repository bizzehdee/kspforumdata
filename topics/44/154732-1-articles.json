So this technology is really interplanetary such as Earth / Mars cargo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next are the Nuclear pulse rockets, which in deep space offer the opportunity to really crunch up the speed, need not worry about transfers, just point along an escape trajectory and go.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever the machinery for doing that is heavy and you need to launch from earth or build in space (say 100 SpaceX missions, a space factory, and a crew that operates in EVA or more advanced space robotics).\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe nuclear test ban treaty kind of forbids using it for a surface launch propulsion system. (Requires Uranium, Neutron generators, H, Li, Plutonium, etc.).

This provides electricity for the entire craft and carries some risk, the problem with fusion reactors is the high velocity neutrons are hard to contain, so the power systems need to be isolated from everything else. The smallest function EP fusion reactor in design is about 50,000 lbs, so that represents a pretty heafty cost in engine, if it produced 50 MW, than at about optimal efficiency if can produce about 0.3N of thrust (at an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E 1500000000s) or higher if you want to blow some fuel. Problem is fuel weighs. 0.3N divided over a vehicle that weights 150 tons (1/3 power, 1/3 fuel, 1/3 else), not a hell of alot of acceleration.\u00A0 0.000002 a For a year is 63.112 M/S. So to get 0.1C would take 480000 years. This number can be brought down with more effecient reactors, none the less we are still looking at an awfully long trip to the closest star, which really and truely is not a good candidate for which to travel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there are other schemes. For example why carry a reactor when you can create a system of photonic rely points, simply carry long lived photo cells. And somehow mysteriously light is delivered. The problem is that you need about 10 football fields worth of solar panels to do anything, and there is a problem in that solar panels have the bizarre thing called mass and they also have momentum and structural constraints. So if you alot 1kg per meter than your mass is 50,000 kg about the same as the fusion reactor. Of course you can increase the beam but then the panels are shorter lived. The other problem is that unless your beam ships are properly staged, there is no way to slow down when you get to the target. There has been a proposal of using a space parachute, but for a human colony in space, the chute would need to be kilometers across to have any affect in deep space. Also there was electromagnetic means, but again the system would need to project a great distance into space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally there is space fantasy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.

Star Gate style wormholes. Violates the time restraints.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo in modern space flight design there is always risk, craft break down into things like calculable risk, we can build a station, a space factory and stage conventional fuels in space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there are politically risky things that have little testing in space such as Nuclear Thermal Rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there is politically suicidal technology like nuclear pulse rockets, potentially doable, but crew may not be protected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there basically very high risk of failure because not currently doable (such as Fusion of any kind).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there are fantasies in which have not the foggiest clue as to how to start a design and testing process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven this there is a risk aversion strategy to make current systems more efficient, more bang per payload buck, and combine systems utilizing the greatest advantage for each system in the type of space where it is most advantageous (like Ceres exploration mission). Musk is trying new ways of more efficiently lowering cost to put more payload up, potentially enabling space assembly and staging and supply mission to marginally accomplishable goals. As of yet no-one is planning trips to human colonies on Pluto (and of course we know from new horizons is that once you get momentum to reach pluto, you have no power to stop so . . . . ) Basically it shows that you probably can get maybe 5000dV of stopping power and upto 25000dV launch to intercept and thats about it for our current landing targets.

This would allow ships to carry passengers (shuttle) between LEO and L2, which is 2 million miles from earth with a lower \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E than earth HEO. Once at the station, for example a nice rotating platform, that always points in the direction of the sun, no need to shift the solar panel. An analogous station could be a mars L1 that is unmanned. basically vessels would come in dock, so you could have multiple vessels docked with fuel until passengers arrive. The fuel tanks on the station load up, release the ships which return to Earth, and the station waits till passengers come, then starts spinning. After a few weeks of that they return to the MEO ships. Of course this might alleviate the gravitation-less sickness, but the stations would have to be armored also to protect from cosmic radiation, at 2 million miles from earth the magnetic field wanes. How the journey might be done is at LEO the ship is boosted to reach GSO requiring 3000 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, Launch and this consume the overwhelming amount of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E. From there the ship is traveling a few\u00A0 km/sec but it will have to slow down considerabily to intercept L2. Thus it would add another 500 to 1000 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E and remove that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E at L2. so\u00A0 a budget of 4500dV from LEO should suffice to get to L2. Considering an average speed of say a km/sec and 3 m km to travel 34 days. Consider station times its not that much. They would then get on their station and grav up. Next Get on the transfer ship also at L2. SInce the ship is 2 million miles closer to mars and the mars station is 2 million closer to earth it reduces speed but not transfer time (basically the average orbital periods of the two planets divided by 2); however because they are close high energy transfers are possible. Given the transfer is only 200 days or so, the the astronauts would reach MARS L1 station. Here they would again Grav up. The station would be set to spin, only occasionally stopping to take on fuel and supplies and the Mars LEO transfer ship. The ship they used from Earth L2 could be that ship, and take them down to LEO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThats the easy part, expensive but Easy the next part is not easy at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom mars LEO a pre-manned station needs to be targeted to a predefined landing site.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFrom mars LEO the survival package and supplies need to landed on the planet, complete with solar panels, food, water, fuel.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFrom mars LEO a return ship or a fuel supply for the return ship needs to be landed, given O2 is likely part of the package an O2 recyclig system needs to be landed\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally the crew would be landed. They would be largely enginneers technicians etc with minimal research science training. THis first crew would craft the station into working condition. After a few months and rock gathering they would return to fuel waiting LMO ship which would wisk them back to the mars L1 station were they grav up once more while they wait for a transfer window back to earth. Given that mars has some gravity, I would presume the gravity-less problems will be alleviated to some degree than spending a year in zero gravity. The mars station could be equiped with a Merry-go-round were astronauts spend a few days in or a few hours a day. SInce the return trip back to earth is pretty much payload they could go for a direct earth atmosphere intercept provided a reentry vehicle is attached at Mars L2. Basically this might mean that the ship detaches the station, then attaches to the reentry vehicle and goes back the same way it came, except intercept earths atmosphere where it burns and lands on the oceans with Martian rocks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-10T00:43:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyou can do a lot with ion drives if you can solve the power problem. if you have a couple megawatts to work with things get easier and you get a drive capable of in system travel. they will never work for heavy lift though. a high output power plant also lets you do \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003Eisru\u003C/abbr\u003E and colonization.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-10T00:45:24Z\u0022 title=\u002201/10/2017 12:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 10, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Nuke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Night_Wing_Zero","CreatedById":172351,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-10T15:25:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222915946\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022154732\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221483990001\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002261025\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KSK\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 hours ago, KSK said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNuclear fission, probably using a\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/multimedia/artgallery/art_feature_002_BNTR.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ebimodal\u003C/a\u003E nuclear-thermal rocket\u00A0Use it as an engine and a generator as needed.

Also remember that our vectors later in the orbit are pushing us further from mercury so we are loosing optimal acceleration so basically we have a complex spiral out of the solar system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can get substantially more acceleration if you cut the payload and this benefits greatly at mercury\u0027s orbit because of the gravity well affect on adding \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo lets say we are traveling 65km/s and this gets us back to orbit, the KE is\u00A0 2.115E9 per kg so if we could put all that 200dv in an periapsis we gain 1E7 joules per kilogram, at earths orbit, the problem is that\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. the velocity of at apoapsis is high 10,000s of meters per second. Which means in terms of energy that is a small amount\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. we cannot impart that much power in the depths of the gravity well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsequently as we reach about the orbit of Venus, we need to stop capturing power and wait till we get close to Mercury\u0027s orbit again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRinse, repeat, rinse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach time you do this you loss nine months, each time you fly by mercury you gain less E*t because your orbital velocity increase and each time you are spending time in space longer waiting to fall back to mercury. Over many years you eventually get enough speed to leave the inner solar system and reach the outer planets, were the massive planets will distort the hell out of the gravity assist, and course correction will be required, therefore some of that solar sail energy will have to be spent avoiding the gas giants.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sun produces a tremendous amount of energy, there is no doubt about that, the big problem is we have no effective means of storing (except in hydrocarbons). Even if you have 15 kw per meter, that means diddly in space were your orbital momentum is 10 magnitudes greater.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLets imagine the perfect solar driven system\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. We start at a submercurian orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Our sail or panel weight is infinitly low, all energy goes to payloads\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. The impulse is prograde to orbital motion\u003Cbr\u003E\n4. We can indefinitely hold orbit until reaching desired interstellar velocity and 5. can we obtain and indefinity amount of energy from the sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now lets take at look at the reality\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA. Submercurian orbit is very difficult to achieve, for human inhabitants it takes time.\u003Cbr\u003E\nB. Panels and sails need structural rigity either via bracing or panel rigidity.\u003Cbr\u003E\nC. The impulse of sails is only partly prograde some is radial, however with ION drive much more is prograde there is inefficiency in the conversion.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nD. We cannot indefinitely hold an orbit until we gain speed, the ship takes on an elleptical orbit that takes it away from the energy, the power time in each orbit decreases and the idle time increases, eventually until we are talking 100s of years, such a scheme is basically only good until you reach escape velocity, much less than is needed to reach the next star\u003Cbr\u003E\nE. the energy gain per surface are under the most ideal circumstance is nothing compared to the energy required to gain velocities to reach a star, less say we had 100mt ship that had a kilometer of sail and the sail weight nothing. 1000000 of sail would impart at best 50uN * meter2/ 0.1 kg\u00A0 = a of 0.0005. So at periapsis we are accelerate\u00A0 1.8 m/hour*sec or 44 meters/day*sec. When you think about the speed of light you would need to hold that orbital radius for 1866 years to reach 0.1C.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo reality check 1.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIts a generational ship\u003Cbr\u003E\ncheck 2\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt spends most of its time at large distances from the sun with little power input\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ncheck 3\u003Cbr\u003E\npassengers get stranded in interstellar space where they expire.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo lets just say that we take with us 50,000 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E of fuel and do a burn at mercurial orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n50,000 m/s has a kinetic energy. So at any particular orbit you like the amount of energy in velocity is equal to half the amount of energy to escape.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1/2 50,000^2 = 1250000000 J/kg if we add 50,000 it becomes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1/2 100,000^2 = 5000000000 J/kg\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe need only 2500000000 j/kg to escape at mercuries orbit, thus we have\u00A02500000000 which is 70710 m/s interstellar velocity.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the bottom line is that we need a propulsion system (either ION driven or Sail) which can achieve say in a period of a month these kinds of stats for a 100,000 kg vessel (BTW the size is too low probabily by a factor of 100, but lets just assume that we bioengineer a race of space tolerant microhumans).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is what we would want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt least 100N of thrust. Given the rated thrust per meter of Sail of 50 uN per meter we need 4,000,000 or about 4 square kilometers but preferably something like 400 square kilometers or a sail 20km x 20km. About the size of a medium size city. Again it has to be virtually weightless. That gets us up to par with the voyager speeds. However voyager would need 40,000 years to reach the closest star. We want to achieve that distance in 40 years. OK so how much area would you need to accelerate much higher speed. So the acceleration time is drastically cut, in a month of 0.05 average C the ship is way outside the system. In addition humans aren\u0027t too happy if they are place at more than 1 g for a great length of time. So we might set the practical limit at 1.5g or 15 m/s squared.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe need an arc of say 20 degrees from Mercury to accelerate. for the sake of argument lets say it strait. This solves one problem however we can use the sail to easily reach a close orbit, but the question is what are the parameters of the sail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. 57.9 x 2 x pi = 20.24 million kilometers\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n20.24 billion meters = 50k*T \u002B\u00A0 1/2 15 T*2 (hope you see the problem with this right off but I will walk through it). roughly 49000 seconds\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay so how much V will we generate in that amount of time? 50k \u002B 49000*15 = 729000 m/s (less than 1/400th the speed of light) and that would roughly get you 4 light years 4E16 in 1740 years, beyond that 20\u0027 arc you can still get energy from the sun but it, because of the radial speed (increasing) and the inclination (increasing) of the escape vector declines rapidly. So a lousy escape velocity like this how much sail do you need at mercury. We need a =15\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n15 x 100,000 kg = 1.5E6 N/5E-5NperMeter =\u00A0 a sheet of about 180km x 180km. We could design a super thin kind of plastic, but that plastic would not support the acceleration of the ship and would require structural beams, eventually eating up the payload to nothing. So talking about ships that could take humans to alpha century taking even 1000 years, much more than 100,000 kg in mass its structually impossible to make a sail that can accomplish the task.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo think in terms of a power supply that can deliver 0.001 to 0.1c and can deliver that speed at 9.8 a\u00A0 over a time frame of a few days to years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis eliminates all kinds of methods of transport for substantive mass objects.
