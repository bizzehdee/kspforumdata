The thing is, I\u0027m not an expert in plasmas or aerodynamics, so I come here to share my ideas and see what you have to say about them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first thought was that it would deflect charged particles found in the exosphere, which would cause drag, and if managed properly, lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the atmosphere starts to get thicker, it could either deflect air, or cause eddy currents, in both case causing some draft by \u0022catching\u0022 more air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that could help ditch some velocity in the early phase of the deorbit, making the rest easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it\u0027s mostly when you start to have plasma generated by compression heating that it could be very useful, by confining it and reducing the need for heat shield.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you orient the magnet perpendicularly to velocity, the plasma will have a lot more difficulty reaching the heatshield, limiting heat transfer, and will be pushed aside where it will cause more drag. The main problem I see with this is that some plasma might reach the hull from the side by following the field lines if it\u0027s not all blown away by the wind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you orient the magnet along the velocity, the plasma will tend to get stuck, not being able to escape by the sides. It sounds like you could have a bubble of hot plasma protecting your ship from superheated plasma. And the funnel shape of the field could potentially also increase drag significantly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd in both cases, eddy currents in the ionised atmosphere would cause significant drag, heating air that doesn\u0027t touch the capsule. And that\u0027s the main idea: you want to get rid of your kinetic energy while not getting to hot. Right now, the only way we\u0027ve found is to slam into air and put a heatshield, but magnetic fields allow you to dump your energy into air you\u0027re not touching.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI quickly googled, and only found people trying to mitigate the plasma sheath for radio-communication (plasma reflects radio waves, so there is a communication black-out during reentry), which at least tells me it can be done on a small scale at least.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-03T12:46:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMost of the plasma is generated in ionosphere, while most of the braking happens much lower.

If a magnetic field gives you 10 or 20 times the drag, you\u0027ll bleed off a lot more velocity before reaching thicker atmosphere, saving on heatshield mass. And if you somehow manage to get some lift, you can stay there for a longer time, bleeding even more energy at low temperatures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor single use craft, it will never be cheaper than a \u0022dumb\u0022 ablative heatshield that can absorb an impressive quantity of energy per kg, but for reusable craft it might be an option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, there is the case of planetary missions.

If you can survive lots of Gs, it\u0027s apparently preferable to choose a steeper descent and an ablative material that is a better insulator. I\u0027m not sure how it works, I guess more energy is dumped in the atmosphere and less in the heatshield if you work with higher deceleration and temperature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that to say that if you have a very different mechanism for braking, the optimal will be different. Also, the drag will also be larger in the lower atmosphere, and there might be some lift, so it\u0027s not directly comparable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-03T20:57:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehow are you going to power a significantly large field? look at how much power fusion researchers regularly pump through coils to contain plasmas. i dont think you could get that on a space craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-03T21:01:11Z\u0022 title=\u002212/03/2014 09:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Nuke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
