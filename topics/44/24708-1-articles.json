It\u0027s funny, I can measure my knowledge of space exploration using this project as a timeline. Before SS2 I was always kinda interested in space, knew a fair bit about what the Apollo missions accomplished and kept up with the ISS. But then SS2 put the idea of commercial space travel in my head, the idea that \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E could become an astronaut? That really kickstarted everything. Just a few years ago when the project was in it\u0027s early stages I used to look forward to the day when it would make its first orbital flight, because \u0022Hey! If they can go suborbital than all you need is a bit more fuel to reach the kind of height you need for orbit!\u0022 I would say, foolishly. I used to see SpaceX as Virgin\u0027s rival and hoped they\u0027d lose because the design of SS2 with it\u0027s carrier ship, shuttlecock tail, no need for tons of heat shielding seemed so much more... \u003Cem\u003Eelegant\u003C/em\u003E than an old fashioned firework on a stick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s about the time I started learning what an orbit actually was and why it would be impossible for SS2 to ever achieve, and by extension why they were not even slightly competing with SpaceX (who I now like a lot).

These days I\u0027m actually pretty well versed in the ways of space exploration and orbital mechanics. I mean, I\u0027m no physicist or engineer of course, but as layman go I\u0027m up there. Could answer Mastermind style questions on the topic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it doesn\u0027t matter to me if Virgin Galactic isn\u0027t the next giant leap in Space Exploration. They bring a taste of it to the common(ish) person. They inspired me to learn, and maybe they can bring a few new tricks to conventional air travel. Considering all that stuff, it gave me a lot of joy to see that engine light, and can\u0027t wait to see commercial operations begin.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-03T18:31:15Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2013 06:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Britpoint\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Canopus","CreatedById":57774,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T17:43:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Britpoint\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Britpoint\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E ...if they can go suborbital than all you need is a bit more fuel to reach the kind of height you need for orbit\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003ESorry its not that easy.
