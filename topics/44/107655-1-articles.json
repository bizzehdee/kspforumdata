There\u0027s options that allow you to change the style and color ... this is the closest screenshot I could find, but there is one that is a gradient with the colors green/yellow/red that look almost the same as above ... similar to the image below.\n\nThe color/style can be changed in several places ... one is on the scanner itself, the other is on the map view if you have the planet/moon targeted and go into the new KB icon on the right.\n\n![XLH1csC.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/XLH1csC.jpg)"}]}
