delta-v requirements. \u00A0From your numbers above [\u00226.4 and 8 km/s\u0022,vs. \u00223-4 km/s on a slower trajectory\u0022], cutting the delta-v in half should cut the fuel needed by an order of magnitude (not so much\u00A0if the McargoT is coming back without being refueled at Mars). \u00A0While the cost of the fuel (on Earth) might be trivial, getting it to LEO is over $1000/lb (so far).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGoing the \u0022slow way\u0022 via gravity tricks should work with Mars (although it and Venus have the least benefit of such tricks). \u00A0Also using ion propulsion would reduce the fuel mass by at least 80%. \u00A0The only reason that costs should be anywhere near 90% of a crewed MCT is impatience and cost of designing a completely different McargoT. \u00A0Beyond that, consider the benefits of using such a McargoT to transport fuel to an eccentric orbit (heading toward Mars)\u00A0around Earth with ~2000m/s delta-v difference between it and LEO. \u00A0The crew docks with the fuel tanker (likely a fueled up stage, until \u0022we\u0022 are that confident in in-space refueling) and then proceeds to burn at Perigee. \u00A0This bypasses the tyranny of the rocket equation by breaking the burns into two 2km/s burns instead of one 4km/s. \u00A0And while you can\u0027t really break natural laws, you *can* pay for the extra 2km/s in cheap ion propulsion delta-v instead of expensive methane/oxygen delta-v.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLess sure about cycler ships: typically the delta-v needed to dock/capture/etc plus the cost to get it started should end up a wash. \u00A0Presumably any justification would be due to life support benefits and/or the benefits of maneuvering an asteroid to serve as the base of a cycler (even then the delta-v to dock/undock isn\u0027t free). \u00A0These are so far in the future to not worry about (and hopefully propulsion systems will have changed by then).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy assumption was that the cargo-only MCT would be chemical, and would use the same aeroshell as the passenger MCT. \u00A0Also that, if getting payload to Mars would cost $140k/ton with Musk\u0027s current MCT, then getting fuel to LEO on his reusable tanker would be so cheap as to be comparatively\u00A0negligible in costs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously if fuel costs in LEO were high,\u00A0you went through the trouble of designing a cargo MCT that relied on ion engines, or you engaged in repeated gravity-assists and refueling in an eccentric orbit of the MCT then cost-savings for sending cargo seperately would be much higher than 8-11%. \u00A0But I assumed that none of these would hold true,
