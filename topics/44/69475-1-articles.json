The interesting thing was that as far as blood moons go, this one was more yellowy-orange than red. It was quite clean. That happens - I\u0027ve seen ones that are black which isn\u0027t much fun. This one was probably pretty similar to one we had in 2007 or the big one back in 2000.\u0027\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next total lunar eclipse for Manawatu to look forward to will be overnight on October 8/9, with mid-eclipse at 11.55pm.
