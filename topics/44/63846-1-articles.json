If you have an engine with 300s of I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E, then at 1lb of thrust, 1lb of fuel will last you 300 seconds.

Rocket science started out in Germany and spread primarily to USSR and United States after WWII. Soviets continued to use metric system. So if you take any Soviet textbook on rockets, you\u0027ll see specific impulse defined per unit \u003Cem\u003Emass\u003C/em\u003E and the units are going to be m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAmericans have always favored using Imperial units in engineering, and rocketry was no exception. So instead of taking impulse per kilogram, they took impulse per pound. Now, it is what they call \u0022pound of mass\u0022, which is property of material, not of the actual weight. So 1lb of mass on Earth is the same as 1lb of mass on the Moon. But the problem is that this value is defined as \u0022Mass of an object that has weight of 1lb on Earth\u0022. And that introduces that factor of g into all of the equations that deal with I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E using U.S. convention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, the unit is still the pound. So even though it\u0027s called \u0022pound of mass\u0022, it\u0027s still formally a weight. Just that instead of current weight of object in whatever gravity, it\u0027s always the weight that object \u003Cem\u003Ewould\u003C/em\u003E have if it was placed on Earth\u0027s surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully that makes some sense. It is a bit confusing. I still mentally convert all specific impulse to m/s, because it makes more sense to me that way.

I then did this in game and got about right below 1 minute 38 seconds.
