From a list of approx. 21 sites (almost 30 if you include some additions), scientists selected 8 sites:\n\n1. Jezero Crater; 2. Columbia Hills; 3. NE Syrtis Major Planum; 4. Eberswalde Crater; 5. SW Melas Chasma; 6. Nili Fossae Trough; 7. Nili Fossae Carbonate; 8. Mawrth Vallis.\n\n![marte.PNG](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qnF2wS5bipI/VcTArh-TPEI/AAAAAAAAFYM/SqUF_EPNur4/s1600/marte.PNG)\n\nPersonally, I\u0027m rooting for Eberswalde crater, because of its amazing and detailed delta structure. Also, from what I understood Jezero Crater is kinda rough for navigation. Also, only Eberswalde and the two Nili Fossae sites don\u0027t require the Terrain Relative Navigation (TRN) system, a new EDL technology which hasn\u0027t been approved yet. Also, Mawrth Vallis is an ExoMars rover landing site candidate too.\n\nJust some fast facts on the mission: final 4 landing sites selected in Jan 2017 and final landing site (\u002B backup) in Jul 2018. Launch in Jul/Aug 2020, arrival and landing in Feb 2021. EDL same as Curiosity (powered descent, skycrane). Then, in 1.5 years it will traverse up to 20 km and acquire a minimum of 20 samples to be returned to Earth on a future, yet to be approved mission. The only improvements over Curiosity are:\n\n- tougher wheels (finally!)\n\n- higher speed (from Curiosity\u0027s 12 m/hr to up to 60-80 m/hr)\n\n- improved, color engineering cameras\n\n- a camera pointed upwards toward the parachute during descent\n\n- higher efficiency due to new planning techniques (from Curiosity\u0027s 50% to 80-95%, not entirely sure on what this means exactly)\n\nNow onto the site selection itself. The engineering constraints are:\n\n- near-equatorial sites (\u002B/- 30 degrees of latitude)\n\n- \u003E-500 m MOLA\n\n- any \u003E100 m hill has to be at least 1000 m away\n\n- 16x14 landing ellipse\n\n- probability of hitting a \u003E55 cm high rock has to be \u003C0.5%\n\n- slopes \u003C25\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0\n\nScientific constraints/mission objectives:\n\n- the landing site must offer a habitable past enviroment\n\n- the landing site must offer a high probability of preserving biosignatures\n\n- the landing site must offer a variety, quality and quantity of samples sufficient to answer key astrobiology/planetary evolution questions, if and when they are returned to Earth\n\nThese are some interesting slides from the presentations:\n\nEngineering data:\n\n![engineering_1.png](http://s2.postimg.org/gu3mfzt53/engineering_1.png)\n\n![engineering_2.png](http://s1.postimg.org/s9p6w00xp/engineering_2.png)\n\n**Eberswalde**\n\n![eberswalde_1.png](http://s1.postimg.org/ov2f24g59/eberswalde_1.png)\n\n![eberswalde_2.jpg](http://s8.postimg.org/79m2dtmkk/eberswalde_2.jpg)\n\n![eberswalde_3.png](http://s29.postimg.org/7ai9dno8l/eberswalde_3.png)\n\n**Jezero Crater**\n\n![jezero.png](http://s14.postimg.org/yn9ofah9t/jezero.png)![jezero_2.png](http://s18.postimg.org/5n64pax6x/jezero_2.png)![jezero_3.png](http://s16.postimg.org/3tlj5fqrn/jezero_3.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Der Anfang","CreatedById":134627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T17:32:08Z","Content":"I\u0027m rooting for Galle crater because that is, perhaps, the happiest crater anybody has ever seen.

Honestly, a Direct-to-Mars Mission is unlikely- NASA made their own study, stating that it would take 10 years of no SLS launches or manned BEO missions (politically horrible for a program criticized for not having payloads) to land on Mars, never mind followup missions (though the mission *is* bigger than Zubrin\u0027s Mars Direct).\n\nSucking money from other programs was a much bigger problem politically when Mars Direct was proposed- not as much now."},{"CreatedByName":"Cydonian Monk","CreatedById":69224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T01:04:49Z","Content":"Ultimately all 8 of the finalist sites are worthwhile and interesting targets, but personally I\u0027d like to see them go for one of the Nili Fossae sites.

Rovers can trundle around for months and years, allowing mission controllers to think, plan, analyse, change plans and get the maximum out of the hardware they send. Manned missions have to stick to very tight schedules, and if something interesting crops up then something else has to be scrubbed from the schedule to make time for it.\n\nHumans on Mars would also have a very limited range, and though they could explore within that range more efficiently they couldn\u0027t learn very much more than a rover could learn - and the rover could move on and explore many, many more sites.

I thought balloon because it might work easier in thin atmosphere than helicopter blades; If they\u0027ve got a solution for that, even better. Such a drone could perhaps lift and transport experiments to the sites of interest discovered and put them down there, maybe even to sites unreachable by rovers."},{"CreatedByName":"baggers","CreatedById":143067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T02:28:23Z","Content":"You speak about groud Vs air, but what about underground exploration?\n\nSome caves exists on Mars, and some are accessible from the surface.\n\n[https://caves.org/pub/journal/PDF/V74/cave-74-01-33.pdf](https://caves.org/pub/journal/PDF/V74/cave-74-01-33.pdf)\n\nWould\u0027nt these \u0022protected area\u0022 (protected from the sun radiation, the high and low temperatures...) be of some interrest?"}]}
