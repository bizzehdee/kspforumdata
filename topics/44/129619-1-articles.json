Most buildings have at least a basement or a crawl space bellow the first floor. Not to mention the high risers of modern cities. In largest ones, there are places where you can spend majority of the day walking from building to building without ever touching ground. People might think ground is important to them, but once placed in environment far removed from it, nobody thinks about it twice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExpansion is limited by construction materials anywhere. On Mars you need significant protection from environment. That means significant construction of concrete, metal, and glass above or bellow ground. On Venus, all you need is a light barrier between you and the atmosphere. Construction would be all carbon polymer, which will be plant-derived. While acquisition would be somewhat slower, the amount of material you need to expand would also be greatly reduced. If anything, there would be greater freedom of expansion, since two cloud cities at quite a large distance can be connected by air traffic. Whereas two colonies on Mars would either have to be close together, or you have to undertake the major investment in building covered roads or rail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-10T16:15:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t really believe in any long term plan due lack of predictivity on how will be our\u00A0progress acceleration, but ignoring that factor and just projecting our current progress speed, then colonization is just something that will come naturally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first steps in certain path, are not taken because there is a current need with economic sense\u00A0right away..

Mars is the better option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce we get the tech level of around what is available in Green Mars? Venus starts to edge out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hardest part with Venus is you have two major scaled operations you need to attempt. The first is something akin to a giant solar shield to drop the temperature of Venus as low as you can make it, this will drop a lot of the various problematic gasses out of the atmosphere into solid forms more conducive to sequestration. The second is that unless you want to live forever with the threat that your solar shield could be destroyed or disabled at any moment, thus resulting in the loss of the planet, you will need to set up a series of very powerful and rather precise asteroid strikes to get the planet to have something approximating a normal day. It doesn\u0027t need to be actually anywhere too close to 24 hours, I believe I remembered reading that a Venusian day of around 5 Earth days is just slow enough that at high latitudes a biosphere could take hold with minimal prompting (assuming a good gas mix of course), but the closer you get to around 20 hours the better for heat exchange reasons. Anywhere in the 20-34 hour per day range provides you with just enough \u0022cooling time\u0022 out of sun for your biosphere to take up a reasonable fraction of the planetary surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally I am of the opinion that if you want to go about it, start with the asteroid collisions for the spin up, it\u0027s entirely possible that as you decrease the day, and thus drop the temperature, the gasses will sort themselves out to a level that means you can perform some more \u0022normal\u0022 terraforming methods rather than having to also do the sunshield.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two biggest reasons why Venus EVENTUALLY is the better candidate are that the gravity more closely approximates Earth\u0027s, and it has a native magnetic field powerful enough to provide decent radiation shielding. However the difficulties inherent in getting the planet to a usable state mean that Mars is just a far better candidate until our space infrastructure is present enough to start actually performing some mega-scale engineering. Mars does not require this to begin colonization operations with minimal risk. Sure, burying the colonies and such will be a bit of a pain for radiation reasons, but that is far from undo-able. Venusian floating cities have greater issues, both in the inherent engineering required (you need all the same engineering of the Mars systems, but it must ALSO fly AND\u00A0withstand occasionally exposure to a much more corrosive atmosphere) and because short of \u0022cloud city mining\u0022 there isn\u0027t really any nearby natural resources you can easily snag to help expand and other ISRU activities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA big problem for both planets is going to end up being the lack of nitrogen and other similar gasses. Yes, Venus has a nice voluminous atmosphere with a load of CO2, ready for conversion, but you cannot have too pure of an O2 atmosphere without great problems in terms of flammability, but you also cannot leave too much CO2 there as that is toxic for most Earth animals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-10T18:07:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222355865\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022129619\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221452447789\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002266349\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Motokid600\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n23 minutes ago, Motokid600 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The Venusian\u0022 When the airlock blew off Mark Watney fell 50km to his death.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCorrection.

Its really as simple as that. \u0022landism\u0022 yes... because we are land creatures. Let me know when we grow wings then maybe a Venus colony would be better. I understand your analogy about buildings and how humans don\u0027t literally have there feet on the ground. But heres the thing. From the top of said building you can look down and see the ground. You know that if there was a problem you can escape to that ground and it wont kill you ( unless you jumped ). Yes the Martian surface isn\u0027t \u0022safe\u0022 but should something go wrong with the HAB like in the Martian you have much more time to fix the issue. Because you or the entire colony isn\u0027t plummeting. There is no escape. No surface. You are at the mercy of the structure that supports you and the limited surface area it provides.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd all in all.
