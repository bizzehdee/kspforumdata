Let\u0027s suppose you had an interplanetary spacecraft with a powerful, high thrust, high ISP engine that only works in vacuum. Examples : a high efficiency NERVA engine. Reason it would only work in vacuum is that the propellant flow isn\u0027t enough to shed the waste heat from the nuclear reactor, so the engine would need a massive heat radiator. If the heat radiator were a droplet radiator or a lightweight conventional radiator, even the slightest impingement of atmosphere would destroy it. Or an open exhaust fusion engine would presumably be the same way - the tiniest bit of cold atmospheric gas would contaminate the fusion reaction and halt it. \n\nSo you\u0027ve got your interplanetary mother ship in a circular orbit. Explorers are down on the planet and want to get back to the mother ship. You have balls of steel and perfect engineering skillz so you are confident your equipment will not fail. \n\nSo you undock the engine from the rest of the mother ship, leaving the main propellant tanks, habitation and laboratory modules, etc in orbit. The engine module is just the heat radiator and enough propellant tankage for this maneuver, and the power take-off module that extracts power from the nuclear engine. (with a fusion engine, you\u0027d collect power from the electrically charged particles from aneutronic fusion, you\u0027d have a sterling engine if it were a NERVA fission engine)\n\nThe ascent vehicle has enough delta V to reach apogee above the atmosphere, but will swiftly fall back down. Your engine module does a big braking burn and essentially intersects the ascent vehicle at the top of it\u0027s ballistic arc. You dock instantly (the ascent vehicle is computer controlled and aligned the right way) and then the engine module does a high ISP burn to get back into orbit. With the engine module \u002B ascent vehicle mass, in vacuum you develop enough thrust to be greater than the gravity of the planet in question. \n\nReason to do this is to be a propellant miser - a heavy vacuum-only nuclear engine is going to be more efficient than anything an ascent vehicle could have on it.\n\nReasons not to do this - on many possible approach trajectories, the nuclear engine will pass right by the crew compartment of the ascent vehicle. A NERVA engine or a fusion engine at full burn would be just as dangerous as standing next to the live reactor core after the Chernobyl reactor exploded - lethal dose in seconds. \n\nIf the maneuver fails, the ascent vehicle would fall back down. On somewhere like Mars, it would mean death for the crew as it wouldn\u0027t have enough propellant to stop. \n\nWould it work?\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nOh, I thought of a few tweaks to make it more practical. You\u0027d send the ascent vehicle up with enough fuel so that if the maneuver does fail, it can safely land. You\u0027d \u0022catch\u0022 it and transfer propellant to the tankage of the engine module, then drop it. This would be a way to refuel the mothership. You\u0027d send the ascent vehicle up unmanned to avoid the radiation problem mentioned before. The times you have crew onboard, you would do a more complete burn with the ascent vehicle to put it all the way into orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T19:38:13Z","Content":"So you mean a sub-orbital RDV then orbital injection with the mothership to use the engine that has the best Isp ?

Tough.\n\nThis is basically correct. From what I learned on KSP, docking is a devilishly hairy thing to do. RDV and matching velocities, and the problem of maneuvering the ports to mate each other, with both ships being in a stable orbit, is already complicated. Doing all this stuff while being in what is basically an ICBM trajectory (high apogee suborbital, right?), along with all the tight time constraints, just brought it to another level of difficulty."},{"CreatedByName":"Dkmdlb","CreatedById":70275,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T20:09:14Z","Content":"He\u0027s not talking about ramming into a sub-orbital payload at orbital speed, he\u0027s talking about doing a retrograde burn with a high efficiency engine to meet the sub-orbital payload at the top of its arc and at the same speed, at which point the payload is picked up and accelerated to orbital velocity using the high efficiency engine. \n\n\u0022The ascent vehicle has enough delta V to reach apogee above the atmosphere, but will swiftly fall back down.

However, if your NERVA engine has an ISP of 1200, or you have a fusion engine with an ISP of 10k or more in high thrust mode, you gain a lot of propellant in theory. You lose the propellant to decelerate the engine module down to meet the lander, and vice versa, but it could result in a net gain if you had a hugely more efficient engine.\n\nEnergy isn\u0027t the problem with nuclear engines - plenty of energy from the mass deficits.
