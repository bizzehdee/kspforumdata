There was a old thread discussing the possibility of using Red Oxygen and Metallic Hydrogen as oxidizers, but it mainly focused on Metallic Hydrogen, a theoretical form of Hydrogen that may or may not exist. Therefore, I have created a new thread focusing on the more practical component, Red Oxygen.\n\nRed oxygen is a stable form of Oxygen that is a dark-red solid allotrope of Oxygen, aka. O8. It is produced by compressing oxygen at room temperature to 98692.3 atm, or 10 GPa (Really hard to produce). Due to its incredible density, it has a higher ISP, and would mean (in theory) smaller, and more economical rockets (especially for ultra-heavy launchers). It also is metastable, meaning that rockets will not need excessive reinforcing.![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nFor more information: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_oxygen#Red_oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_oxygen#Red_oxygen)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-24T21:13:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2015 09:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by fredinno**"},{"CreatedByName":"dansmithers","CreatedById":11592,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T21:07:51Z","Content":"It could be useful, assuming its meta-stability doesn\u0027t make it nonflammable.\n\nAnd, of course, assuming that you could modify an engine to burn it."},{"CreatedByName":"SciMan","CreatedById":12748,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T22:01:46Z","Content":"Not to mention that the tanks for containing it need to be able to withstand 10GPa continuously.

I presume the suggestion is similar for red oxygen. However, red oxygen likely isn\u0027t being discussed for two reasons: A, it very likely has a lower energy release, and B, hydrogen is a sixteenth of the molecular mass once decomposed, meaning that to compete in velocity oxygen would have to be released with four times as much energy, greatly exacerbating the problem in A.\n\nIf red oxygen turned out to be metastable and metallic hydrogen didn\u0027t, then it may be somewhat interesting, though likely doesn\u0027t have near the same exceptional Isp offerings - in fact it likely wouldn\u0027t significantly outperform LH2-LOx, if at all. Red oxygen is only particularly something you might consider as it has lower formation pressure - though I suspect if you could reach the formation pressure of RO, MH would not be too infeasible.\n\nEDIT - reading more, apparently O8 isn\u0027t meant to be used similar to metallic hydrogen, and is an actual oxidizer. The problem I imagine forming here is that it may be metastable in the same way ozone is, which we have tested as an oxidizer as it gives an extra oxygen with nearly no energy required to remove it. Trouble is, those tests generally turned into magic tricks, as ozone was rather fond of making the test stand vanish in a poof of smoke every time it encountered the slightest contaminant in fuel lines. It was in fact so volatile and eager to perform its trick that if you dilute it down with oxygen to the extent that it stops this act, you\u0027ve lost basically all performance gains offered by the O2/O3 mixture.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-24T23:02:10Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2015 11:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Iskierka**"},{"CreatedByName":"fredinno","CreatedById":143381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T00:07:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What?
