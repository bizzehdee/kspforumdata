It took 18 months of planning to develop the procedures, modify the tools, test and simulate the GN\u0026amp;C, EVA, and robotics choreography, and prepare all the paperwork to satisfy everyone that it was a safe plan for both orbiters and the crew. The proposed plan in this article would have been even more difficult because there was no opportunity to use the RMS (robotic arm) to grapple Columbia. Columbia wasn\u0027t carrying an arm, and Columbia itself did not have a grapple fixture that Atlantis\u0027s arm could use. I am extremely dubious that the manual station keeping would be doable even just from a propellant standpoint: STS-400 had the crew transfer requiring two days. (The STS-400 timeline is available online) For Columbia, that would mean manually station-keeping for an entire EVA (6.5 hours), then separating until the next EVA is ready, and performing another rendezvous and station keeping for \u0026gt; 6.5 hours. I don\u0027t think there is anywhere near enough RCS fuel to do that.\u003Cp\u003EThe only hope that this plan would have ever had would have been if the plan had already been in place prior to Columbia\u0027s launch, as there is no way on this Earth that NASA would have approved a flight with untested procedures that could destroy both orbiters. As I said above, the very similar STS-400 flight planning took 18 months; even if the entire NASA work force worked around the clock, that amount of work wasn\u0027t going to happen in just a few weeks.

In contrast, de-orbit burn can last up to 1,250s at 26.7kN, which would require over 20,000kg of fuel. And the figure I found actually quoted for this is 21,660kg of fuel in two pods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose, they might have been going for something like 1,000ft/s each, but in either case, Orbiter is capable of significantly higher delta-V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, even taking empty weight and full OMS fuel, I still come up with only 850m/s of delta-V, which would be easily enough sufficient to move to necessary altitude and match orbits if it weren\u0027t for inclination change. Even if ascending nodes of the two orbits were drifting fast enough to have them match before life support runs out, that\u0027s still almost 1.7km/s burn, as maccollo points out. And inclination change isn\u0027t large enough to save any fuel with a bi-elliptic transfer, or any other trick for reducing delta-V required for inclination change. At least, not by any amount that\u0027s going to matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to everyone who helped clear this up for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-03T08:31:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs mentioned by the article, this proposal was published as an appendix of the CAIB report.
