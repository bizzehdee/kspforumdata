By that time, the sun will have swallowed the Earth.\n\nThe evidence is in: The universe is toast.\n\nAfter a wild youth about six or seven billion years ago, the universe is slowly dying. \n\nBut you needn\u0027t book your table at the restaurant at the end of the universe just yet \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 the old age of the cosmos is likely to be very long and drawn out. \n\nHow do we know this? Professor Simon Driver at the University of Western Australia and his colleagues have, for the first time, produced the first fully empirical measurement of the energy output of the universe.\n\nAnd the news is grim.\n\nAccording to their findings, the universe is currently generating about half the energy it was just two billion years ago. \n\nThis means that eventually the universe will stop generating energy and our cosmos will become a lifeless, cold abyss with the light from every star and galaxy snuffed out. \n\nThe cold, dark relics of dead stars is all that will be left.\n\nHow long will it take? \n\nDriver says: \u0022From here on, there is a gentle decline, which technically will go on forever. In about 100 billion years you\u0027d be very hard pressed to find any optical photons our eyes could detect.\u0022 \n\n\u0022Of course, by this stage the sun has already swallowed the Earth (in about 5 billion years) and our [Milky Way] galaxy will have merged with Andromeda (in about 10 billion years).\u0022\n\nSo it\u0027s fair to say that Douglas Adams\u0027 \u0022Don\u0027t Panic\u0022 remains a useful piece of advice in terms of cosmology.\n\n\u0022The universe is settling down on the sofa for a long, eternal slumber but we are still able to look at the photo album of its energetic youth,\u0022 says Andrew Hopkins, head of research at the Australian Astronomical Observatory. \n\nHe says the universe was at its peak in terms of star formation about six or seven billion years ago; about half the age the universe is now.\n\nHopkins is co-author of the paper Galaxy and Mass Assembly panchromatic data release being presented on Tuesday (NZT) at the general assembly of the International Astronomical Union in Hawaii. \n\nThe research is part of the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) project, the largest multi-wavelength survey ever put together.\n\nStarting with the Anglo-Australian Observatory in NSW, Professor Driver and his colleagues used seven of the world\u0027s most powerful telescopes on Earth and in space across 21 wavelengths for five years to measure the energy output of more than 220,000 galaxies. \n\nThey looked back 2.3 billion years and found that the universe was producing about 2.5 x 10 to the power of 35 watts of energy per cubic megaparsec of space. \n\nIt has now dropped to about 1.5 x 10 to the power of 35 watts per cubic megaparsec. (A megaparsec is about 3.26 million light years.)\n\nThe researchers looked at a small slice of the sky across almost the entire electromagnetic spectrum \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 from the far ultra-violet range, through visible light to the far infra-red and the edges of radio waves. \n\nAnd while the section examined may seem small \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 just 0.56 per cent of the whole sky \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 the data from the 220,000 galaxies is sufficient for the astronomers to be very confident of their findings.\n\n\u0022That sounds like quite a small amount,\u0022 Hopkins said. \u0022But if you look at the simulated flight through of the galaxies you\u0027ll get an impression of just how much information there really is.\u0022\n\nSo will our descendants of the far future eventually see the stars and galaxies go dark?\n\nYes, says Hopkins, but probably much earlier than at the time of the energy death of the universe. \n\n\u0022It will be due to the accelerated expansion of the universe that we will eventually stop seeing stars and galaxies.\n\n\u0022Because the universe is expanding, eventually the galaxies will get further and further apart until ultimately \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 on the scale of hundreds of billions of years \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 the universe will be a cold, dark isolated place.\n\n\u0022We won\u0027t be able to see any other stars or galaxies and any sentient beings alive then will be very, very isolated indeed.\u0022\n\nBut Driver says death may not be the end of all things: \u0022There is one tiny glimmer of hope.\u0022 \n\n\u0022We may have been here before,\u0022 Driver says. \n\n\u0022Theorists believe the early universe also went through a period of inflation (which we\u0027re in again now). \n\n\u0022In that case it is argued that it suddenly stopped and dumped the dark energy driving this inflation into normal energy.\n\n\u0022This is highly speculative but it is possible that we\u0027re in a recursive universe, which periodically goes through periods of inflation followed by periods of activity and evolution, which eventually dwindle as we enter the next inflationary phase.\u0022\n\nSo that\u0027s something to look forward to.\n\n - SMH \n\n=====================================================================\n\nNot really news, we always knew the universe was going to die...."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T00:37:13Z","Content":"Nothing ever really changes.

Think about it, as the universe expands eventually intergalactic space cools, the remnant hydrogen condenses into stars and new galaxies, which then die themselves, leaving the universe dotted with quantum singularities and all the mass condenses into these leaving nothing (because no light exits)....perfect vacuum.

Again we have to separate the two Universe definitions. One that is commonly used is the visible universe, which is a small fraction of a potentially limitless universe that may have properties we cannot see or will never be able to see. \n\nNote that our solar system has already had its ups and downs. When the sun was born it produced a brief period of more intense sunlight, but then it declined and has been steadily rising. I think that the authors are trying to point out that galaxies are sort of fizzling out, the effect of merging galaxies and massive central black holes is ejecting gas into intergalactic space which is basically starving the galaxies of material for new star formation. As a consequence many galaxies are loaded with red-dwarfs and old stars in which the spectrum has shifted to red. But the gas that ended up in intergalactic space is in an equilibrium, because these x-ray jets are heating the gas which is keeping it moving, once gas stops being fed from other galaxies it will cool down and can condense to form new galaxies and other stars. This could go on for a while but it will eventually stop. Our milky way is enjoying a sort of happy life as a young vigorous adult, however once it merges with andromeda there will be a brief period of star formation but then all the gas will get sucked into and shot out of the central vertices leaving it rickety old man."},{"CreatedByName":"rtxoff","CreatedById":107622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T13:34:49Z","Content":"It\u0027s just a hypothesis so somehow i won\u0027t accept this opinion that all is meaningless and that someday all will went to oblivion.
