I know that the scene is really stupid, but it got me thinking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, do you feel the zero g only after the craft circularizes? Or as a gradual loss of weight, or what?

It is important to start with this fact before all else. The acceleration due to gravity on earth is 9.81 ms^2. This is also about the same on Kerban.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you move towards orbit, the engines are pushing you ever faster, as a result the people in the craft will feel acceleration from the engine and it is identical to them as gravity would be in every way except magnitude. When the craft reaches orbit, the engines stop, the crew feels instant weightlessness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you ignore what the crew feels and look at the physics of the ship itself, as it approaches orbital speeds the effect of gravity seems to dissipate. That is the ship doesn\u0027t have to try as hard to keep altitude, but that is only because the ground is curving away from the craft at a rate approaching the acceleration of gravity. Or put another way, in near orbit gravity is accelerating you downwards at say 8 ms^2 but the ground is curving away from you at 5 ms^2. The ship only has to make up the remaining 3ms^2. The net effect is that the ship experiences less and less gravity until orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-14T21:15:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s how Chris Hadfield \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14schr/i_am_astronaut_chris_hadfield_commander_of/c7fyfd7\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edescribed\u003C/a\u003E a Shuttle launch:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELaunch is immensely powerful, and you can truly feel yourself in the centre of it, like riding an enormous wave, or being pushed and lifted by a huge hand, or shaken in the jaws of a gigantic dog.
