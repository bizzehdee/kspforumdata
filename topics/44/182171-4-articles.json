There\u0027s enough energy packed in there for all sorts of applications, typically in welding or making large steel castings, but the idea here is to slow the reaction way down, so we can harness the heat to make electric power rather than just melt things. The general concept is surprisingly old, some of the original rocket pioneers had plans to grind up spent fuel tanks and use them as reaction mass in the next stage. Use all parts of the buffalo!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe need a source of finely divided Aluminum, and the lander\u0027s spent tanks would be just ideal! As a ballpark guess, the tanks of a Methalox moon lander they\u0027re proposing may have 100kg of Aluminum? (Though If someone has a better number, please let me know!) Anyways, for the Thermite reaction (and the one I suggested later), the Aluminum needs to be a very fine powder, but mechanically grinding a tank on the moon would be impossible. Fortunately, if you scratch an Aluminum surface and rub a very small amount of Gallium metal onto it, the Aluminum will fall apart to powder overnight. The Gallium actually soaks inbetween the Aluminum\u0027s grains, prying them apart. It can be a little tricky doing this on Earth because the Aluminum scratches heal so quickly with Alumina passivization layers, which provide excellent protection to Ga attack, but in the hard vacuum of the moon it would be a simple task.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow we need to find our oxidizing agent, Fe\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003EO\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003E.

The resulting Hydrogen gas can be circulated (or allowed to diffuse) to the lunar soil compartment through the tubes, where it can react with the silicon/iron oxides to become H2O once again. At equilibrium, the amount of water vapor in this system will be extremely small relative to the Hydrogen, so it will mostly be Hydrogen gas (at perhaps .1bar) that circulates the heat. To run the reaction faster, we could raise the heat, circulate faster, or increase the Hydrogen pressure. For a slower reaction, vice-versa.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reaction can be used to drive the box\u0027s temperature up to 300-600C to serve as a heat source, and some Aluminum heat sink rods can be dug into the (~0C?) soil to serve as cold sources. Between them we would put thermoelectric generators, which convert large temperature differences directly into electric power in any of a few different ways (just like on an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E). The one I\u0027m the most enamored with is the Sterling Radioisotope Generator\u0027s Sterling engine. But, I\u0027ll assume we\u0027ll use something more mundane for the example!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOperating at maybe 5% efficiency, which sounds reasonable in context, from each 1kg of Al we\u0027d get 75KWh. Scaled to the mass of Aluminum in the lander\u0027s tanks (again guessing 100kg), this could total to 20kW over a month!\u00A0 Life support should 100% be run from solar panels of course, but I think this could open up a lot of other avenues of activity on the Moon. It\u0027d be nice to bulldoze some berms and caverns, right? Here\u0027s a 20kW power supply that can run a real bulldozer! Also, the waste heat from the reaction could be used to heat an almost unlimited amount of inflatable auxiliary habitats/green-houses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe resulting \u0027waste\u0027 iron particles could be used to make \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E metal castings by reversibly liquefying them in carbon monoxide gas at 100-200C, at least according to Zubrin.

Charged dust particles love nothing more than to wedge themselves into small spaces, like our gaskets, and wear them out in a hurry. Case and point would be the fate of the samples Apollo returned from the moon! If we could solve this, It\u0027d certainly open up a lot of new avenues. If we ran the box at 300C we could at least use organic o-rings, which I think would be a real benefit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn conclusion, thermite the moon! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-02-19T00:21:08Z\u0022 title=\u002202/19/2019 12:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 19, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Cunjo Carl\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-19T13:10:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223543059\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022182171\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221550532730\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022162109\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cunjo Carl\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 hours ago, Cunjo Carl said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n... So hear me out. I have a plan that may sound a little Kerbal, but I swear it\u0027s good science. We could actually use the fuel tanks from a spent lander as a very convenient high-energy power source. As a blue-skies guess, 20kW of electricity for a month! And it would let NASA tick off the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E box as bonus by using the moon for its Oxygen content.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThermite! There\u0027s enough energy packed in there for all sorts of applications, typically in welding or making large steel castings, but the idea here is to slow the reaction way down, so we can harness the heat to make electric power rather than just melt things. The general concept is surprisingly old, some of the original rocket pioneers had plans to grind up spent fuel tanks and use them as reaction mass in the next stage. Use all parts of the buffalo!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe need a source of finely divided Aluminum, and the lander\u0027s spent tanks would be just ideal! As a ballpark guess, the tanks of a Methalox moon lander they\u0027re proposing may have 100kg of Aluminum? (Though If someone has a better number, please let me know!) Anyways, for the Thermite reaction (and the one I suggested later), the Aluminum needs to be a very fine powder, but mechanically grinding a tank on the moon would be impossible. Fortunately, if you scratch an Aluminum surface and rub a very small amount of Gallium metal onto it, the Aluminum will fall apart to powder overnight. The Gallium actually soaks inbetween the Aluminum\u0027s grains, prying them apart. It can be a little tricky doing this on Earth because the Aluminum scratches heal so quickly with Alumina passivization layers, which provide excellent protection to Ga attack, but in the hard vacuum of the moon it would be a simple task.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow we need to find our oxidizing agent, Fe\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003EO\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003E. According to the internet there\u0027s quite a bit of Iron oxides on the moon, so I\u0027ve checked the kinetics for FeTiO\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003E, Fe\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003EO\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003E and Fe\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003EO\u003Csub\u003E4\u003C/sub\u003E, and they all look ok to use provided the particle size is ~1um. This said, thermodynamically we should be able to use any of the common oxides on the Moon (excluding Na,Mg,Al) so silicaceous soils (SiO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E) would work just as well, though perhaps at a lower rate than the iron oxide bearing soils.

From messing around with it, I think around 1% by weight to the Aluminum would be tenable, but not having a lander handy I might be off by a factor! Still, that represents a few kg, which is certainly non-zero. I was assuming mechanical grinding wouldn\u0027t work because it would require an abundance of tools from a cutter, to a shredder and finally a grinder. Every 2 orders of magnitude or so in size would require a different tool, which would get cumbersome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso agreed about the enrichment. All this would be dependent on the process working on soil just as it is when dug out of the ground. Thermodynamically it should work on whatever soil\u0027s handy (as long as it has Oxygen and not too much Al,Na,Mg in it) and I was able to check the kinetics for iron oxides (in 2\u002B, 2 2/3\u002B, and 3\u002B), but I wasn\u0027t able to find good kinetics for Silicon at a glance. Being the most important, it\u0027d be nice to find, I\u0027m sure it\u0027s out there. Anyways I feel it would probably work, but I think the only way to know for sure would be to grab some lunar regolith simulant and give it a try.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had no idea about the soil reduction, if anything I\u0027d assumed the soil would be in a slightly superoxidized state thanks to the solar wind. That\u0027s fascinating. I checked a couple papers, and it looks like most (~98% by weight) of the lunar iron is in the form of FeO (the 2\u002B), and conveniently enough this would make for an even more energy-releasing reaction than the higher oxidation states. It\u0027s a little backwards, but there you go!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy ratio, the amount of metallic iron is in the lunar soil is apparently in the 0.1 - 1% range across the areas we\u0027ve landed on already. The iron particles are also all so small (~1-10nm) as to be single-crystal, so they probably have an enormous magnetic-moment to mass ratio. If we dragged a rare-earth magnet across the moon\u0027s surface, would we pick up usable amounts of iron? That would be hugely convenient, to put it mildly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Apparently the iron nanoparticles are largely caught up within larger (~20um) glassy particles of moon dust, so no free iron.

Because the lander is sent to LEO, it can be dramatically larger than otherwise possible. With Atlas V 551 it could go up to 19 tonnes; with Delta IV Heavy, 28 tonnes; with Falcon Heavy reusable it could go up to 30 tonnes or more. New Glenn, Vulcan, or Delta IV Heavy would be ideal for launching the refueling module because the residual hydrolox will give better TLI performance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-22T19:23:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe nice thing about the XEUS concept is that it uses the RL-10 where possible, and the Masten engines are simply for the terminal landing burn.
