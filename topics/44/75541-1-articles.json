Nothing about the payload of six satellites is particularly newsworthy. There is of course the fact that there will be another ocean soft-landing test conducted during this flight, much like during CRS-3 in April, so maybe we can get more (and better) juicy video of that. But what I do think is actually newsworthy is the fact that the launch itself is happening. See, SpaceX cites a total of 13 missions in its launch manifest for 2014. We\u0027re now approaching the end of June, which marks half of the year come and gone. How many 2014 missions has SpaceX launched so far?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also needs to be seen against the backdrop of a grand total of three Falcon 9 launches in 2013, and two more so far in 2014 (one of which was a delayed 2013 mission). Also, a minimum of one flight was already pushed out of the 2014 flight manifest into 2015, which now contains 16 missions. That gives us five completed flights in the past 18 months, but a launch manifest of \u003Cem\u003Etwenty-eight\u003C/em\u003E upcoming launches for the next 18 months. Some of which are Falcon Heavy flights, which require three Falcon 9\u0027s worth of hardware. That\u0027s a tall order. No wonder that ULA, the company that they\u0027ve been brawling with a lot recently over government launch contracts, has called SpaceX \u0022overcommitted\u0022 - and personally I\u0027m surprised they didn\u0027t find stronger words than that, considering how aggressive Elon Musk often acts towards them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a recent speech at the start of the month, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.spacenews.com/article/launch-report/40798spacex-aims-to-boost-rocket-production-to-two-per-month-by-year%E2%80%99s-end\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGwynne Shotwell of SpaceX addressed this issue\u003C/a\u003E, and conceeded that they have to up their game and prove that they can deliver on the promises made. However, she also feels confident that they can in fact pull it off. She says that currently, the company produces one Falcon 9 rocket per month, but by the end of the year it will be producing as many as two per month.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow nevermind the fact that a production speed like that still won\u0027t be enough for SpaceX to \u0022meet their cadence\u0022 as Shotwell promises, not in 2014 and not over the 18 month timeframe outlined above either. I\u0027m sure that if they can ramp up now, they can continue to ramp up in 2015 and catch up with whatever backlog they have, if it makes economic sense to do so. No, what I\u0027m more interested in is the question: if they are currently producing one Falcon 9 per month, where are they? Even the Falcon that launched in January was originally scheduled for November/December 2013, and thus likely came out of production in mid-October. And then there was one launch in April. Meanwhile, the inhouse Falcon Heavy demonstration flight scheduled for Spring 2014 has been scrapped completely and thrown somewhere into 2015 because there are simply not enough Falcon rocket cores available to assemble one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m as much as a SpaceX fan as the next guy, but I\u0027ll admit I\u0027m worried. Now what do you guys think? Is SpaceX as overcommitted as its critics claim, or will the company be able meet its launch cadence? And where is the one rocket per month they claim to be producing? How many Falcons do you think will actually fly in 2014?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-20T08:27:16Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2014 08:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"QPDO","CreatedById":104760,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T09:29:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think they tend to focus on being percieved as reliable and trustworthy, rather than meeting their schedule and wasting some of their customers sattelites.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T09:34:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter they finally got the April mission up, Musk said \u003Cem\u003Ethen\u003C/em\u003E they were planning on 10 missions from the Cape in 2014, including the January and April missions. So including todays launch, that is 8 more. Only 2 of those are Dragon missions since CRS-6 was pushed to January due to the ISS schedule getting messed up by all of the issues (not just SpaceX)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 of the remaining 6 will be 2 AsiaSat launches (8 and 6) and 2 Orbcomm OG2 launches (today\u0027s, and one more in September)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the last two, one will be Turkmenistan\u0027s staellite, and the last one will be either the Eutelsat launch or the Loral launch - neither have been been reschduled since the delays at the Cape. It\u0027s very possible that neither of those fly this year and we end at 8. All the others SHOULD fly unless something major happens. And then there is one launch at Vandenburg (CONAE) and while the Falcon Heavy launch won\u0027t happen until early 2015, the cores are supposed to be at Vandenburg this year. So that is at least 9 and up to 13 cores delivered for the year. Considering that the 1st flight of 1.1 was Sept 2013 it seems they aren\u0027t TOO terribly behind schedule. (if they manage to deliver all of the above, that\u0027s 13 cores in 15 months - we\u0027ll assume that the 1.1 maiden flight with CASSIOPE and SES-8 in early December were worked on before September primarily)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpaceX is still a startup, so these issues were pretty much expected as they are doing things from the ground up.

But then if we go by other examples, they wouldn\u0027t need to innovate, and would be far less interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, the manifest on SpaceX.com seems to be out of date.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-20T09:48:03Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2014 09:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Tiberion\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T10:57:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tiberion\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tiberion\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E(...) By the way, the manifest on SpaceX.com seems to be out of date.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8 launches in six months does sound more manageable than 12, no question. But if that is the case and the launch manifest on the website is indeed out of date, that means that they had a fairly major rescheduling action only recently. The launch manfiest was updated with the completed CRS-3 launch at the end of April. That would imply they basically sat down in May and figured out how many boosters they could produce until years end, and then pushed four 2014 launches back into 2015.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would line up better with Shotwell\u0027s statements, and with those of Elon Musk that you are referring to. If we then allow for one or two excess Falcon cores in storage because of the multi-month delay of CRS-3 followed by a temporary grounding due to a helium leak investigation, then a production speed of one core per month can indeed be enough to keep pace with the (revised and shortened) launch manifest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, with a launch every 3 weeks or so (and more like 2 weeks come 2015), their single launchpad and the ability to quickly put rockets onto it might turn out to be a bottleneck if there is a delay at any point. I suppose that means the engineers get to practice rapid launch preparations then... if SpaceX\u0027s plan is to land a used booster back at KSC, refuel it and relaunch it \u0022the same day\u0022 (quote Elon Musk), then they better learn how to put up and launch a factory-fresh Falcon in the same timeframe \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, that still doesn\u0027t answer the question of \u0022where are all the Falcons\u0022 considering their claimed production speed.
