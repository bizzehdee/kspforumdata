They are different vehicles designed for different purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe CCDev vehicles (Dream Chaser, Dragon, or CST-100) are designed to act as cheap LEO taxis, to deliver crew and supplies to the ISS. Orion is a deep-space exploration vehicle designed for a harsher environment and different mission requirements. Dream Chaser isn\u0027t made for long duration flights, it cannot withstand high-speed reentry, it has less shielding against radiation, and it cannot be depressurized for EVA like Orion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it\u0027s silly to bring a winged vehicle into deep space. The wings and landing gear are just a waste of payload mass and the TPS is much more exposed and fragile. A capsule is much better suited to the job.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-21T16:13:05Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2013 04:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stinkk","CreatedById":72349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T18:54:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh ok, thanks a lot for the reply!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
