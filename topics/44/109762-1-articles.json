(Assume you were frozen in such a way to prevent rupture of cell membranes and protein aggregation)\n\nCase 1: All the neuronal connections are mapped out, but your body is destroyed in the process.\n\nA clone is made with has your memories and your personality (much like the clones in the movie 6th day)\n\nDo you wake up in the clone body?\n\nCase 2: Your body is carefuly thawed and brought back to life.\n\nDo you wake up in your own body.\n\nMany sci-fi games and movies would imply that is effectively what happens in case 1 - although its often ambiguous... but from the perspective of others it makes no difference. Often the clone seems to believe it is still the original, and doesn\u0027t fear death because it can be resurected as before - particularly prevalent in the movie 6th day.\n\nIf not in case 1, then why in case 2?\n\nBecause the atoms that make up the clone are different from the original?\n\nThe atoms in the original are already different from what they were 10 years ago.\n\nDid the you 10 years ago go to sleep one day and never wake up? is the old you just as dead as the destroyed original in case 1? Even more dead because your personality and memories are surely different?\n\nIf yes in case 1, what happens when they make 2 copies? (as in a scene in 6th day where the new clone is activated while the old clone is still dying.... the old clone realizes the new clone is a different consciousness, and when old clone dies... old clone is dead - the new clones existence is not resurection).\n\nAs far as I can figure, as soon as there is a break in consciousness, you\u0027ve died (not biologically, but... philisophically).\n\nIf an identical consciousness starts afterwards... that is no matter.\n\nConsciousnesses change over time (as people experience new things, form new memories, age, etc), but there is an unbroken chain.\n\nThe personality and memories need not be identical to prevent \u0022death of consciousness\u0022.\n\nSo why should a newly started consciousness be relevant to the old one, just because the personality and memories are identical?\n\nThe physical material hosting the consciousness also changes over time, so it shouldn\u0027t matter if the newly started consciousness is hosted by matter that hosted the terminated consciousness or hosted by new matter.\n\nSimilar philisophical problems emerge when transfering consciousness to a machine like a computer.\n\nIf a human mind could be linked to a computer, processes run in parallel, gradually shifting over to the pure machine hardware as the parallel biological process is shut down, without ever breaking the continuity of consciousness, then I\u0027d say you could make the shift without killing yourself.\n\nBut if its just taking date about your consciousness, starting a copy on a computer, and then shutting down the biologically hosted one... the biologically hosted one has died, vanished to never experience anything again.\n\nLuckily, there\u0027s enough going on during sleep that I\u0027m confident I will experience another day when I go to sleep, that the continuity is unbroken."},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T14:55:13Z","Content":"I\u0027ll just leave it here:\n\n[What makes you you?](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/12/what-makes-you-you.html)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jesrad","CreatedById":49762,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T15:15:00Z","Content":"This experiment has been pretty much done, many many times, on simpler creatures.

Our decisions are based on very sensitive electrical potentials set up by chemical reactions. These are quantum phenomenon, if you look closely enough, there is noise in them due to quantum mechanics. Quantum indeterminacy creates noise in ANY system. Our brains are affected by this noise just like everything else, and since our \u0022logic circuits\u0022 are rather small, and they are analog, they would be affected rather strongly as compared to more macroscopic systems. One doesn\u0027t need direct evidence specific to human brains, just as one doesn\u0027t need to fly to Alpha Centauri Bb and drop something to say that gravity makes things fall down on an Alpha Centauri Bb. The assumption that the physical laws hold everywhere in the universe is one of the cornerstones of physics. Our brains exist in the same physical universe and thus must be subject to the same physical laws- that is all the evidence that is required. \n\nThe point is, the noise creates deviations in behavior, and even if they are very tiny differences, they **must exist**.
