A company could argue that a rock small enough to tow around does not qualify as such.\n\nWhile the Outer Space Treaty applies to nations, Article VI states that nations are responsible for actions carried out by non-governmental entities. I would take that as meaning for example that if the United Kingdom permitted a British company to test a weapon in space then the UK would be considered to have breached the Outer Space Treaty.\n\nArticle VIII states that\n\n\u003E \n\u003E A State Party to the Treaty on whose registry an object launched into outer space is carried shall retain jurisdiction and control over such object, and over any personnel thereof, while in outer space or on a celestial body. Ownership of objects launched into outer space, including objects landed or constructed on a celestial body, and of their component parts, is not affected by their presence in outer space or on a celestial body or by their return to the Earth.\n\nThis will I think be key. The likely argument is that a chunk of ore mined from an asteroid counts as an \u0022object constructed on a celestial body\u0022, and will thus be owned in accordance with the laws of the country with jurisdiction. The closest precedent for this are the missions that have returned rock samples from the Moon. In 1993 samples from the Soviet *Luna 16* were sold at auction with no legal objections from anybody. Though on a tiny scale, that strengthens the case that mining other worlds for profit is lawful.\n\nArticle XVI permits states to withdraw from the treaty in any case."},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T02:46:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yeah it can not claim ownership, but lets said that a company capture an asteroid and waste a lot of resources to place that asteroid in earth low orbit (just for this example), then it should be laws to have into account all the resources that this company spent and charge a tax for other companies in case they also want to mine this asteroid.\n\u003E There is nothing like that in the law right now, so it may be added once the first case emerge.\n\nIt would work as international water, however better behaved as space is more expensive so you would only get nations and large companies. \n\nCompany pay taxes to where its registered. its accounting rules making it harder to obviously bleed off an daughter company in your country. \n\nNo reason to start fighting over it, just capture another."},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T03:00:17Z","Content":"Cantab already explain some points.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Oh, the governments of the world would have so much fun with that though.
