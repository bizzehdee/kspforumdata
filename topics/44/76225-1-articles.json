They can also be produced by pair production with lasers or very strong magnetic fields. My very simplistic understanding is that if a particle\u0027s kinetic energy exceeds the energy equivalent of its inertial mass than it can produce an antiparticle when it collides with a target. In this way particle accelerators accelerate protons until their energy is on the order of 1 GeV (the energy equivalent of their rest mass E=mc^2), and collide them with a very dense target, made of tungsten or gold to produce anti-protons. The process is very energy intensive and capturing the particles thus produced is horribly inefficient (like .001% efficient). AFAIK the best we\u0027ve done is capture a few hundred atoms at a time. And they don\u0027t store for very long, even when cooled to very low temperatures in a high vacuum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have faith that we could someday produce large volumes of antimatter economically, but our current technology and engineering isn\u0027t optimized with industrial scale anti-proton production in mind. And efficient production technologies like gamma-ray lasers are probably still a very very long way off. Also even if the process was 100% efficient, we would still need tremendous amounts of power to produce large volumes of anti-matter; thousands and thousands of terawatts to produce maybe a few hundred kilograms of antihydrogen a year. We would need huge Dyson arrays, or similar megastructures closely orbiting the sun, to produce this much power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, assuming warp drive doesn\u0027t pan out then antimatter rockets, despite their many practical problems, are about the only half-way feasible way in which humans could travel to nearby stars in reasonable time spans. When antihydrogen is reacted with hydrogen it produces , among other things, charged pi-mesons that could be funneled out of a magnetic nozzle with exhaust velocities of up to .9 c. Put that in your Tsiolkovsky\u0027s rocket equation and smoke it! You could crank up to .5 c and make the crossing to Alpha Centauri in less than 15 years in a single stage rocket with a mass ratio of 3!

You can slow down those positrons and antiprotons and then mix them, which results in anti-hydrogen (one anti-proton with one positron orbiting it).

You want a whole mess of quarks to interact at pretty much the same time if you want a good chance at anything more exciting than a meson.

To be honest, I don\u0027t know how much it depends on structure of the nuclei involved. Some might be better than others, and energy you can put into the beam is also a factor, but this isn\u0027t my field.
