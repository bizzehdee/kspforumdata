No gravity, or strictly along gravity. The general case for 2D motion with gravity is extremely complicated. There are analytical treatments, but you can never get a fully analytical general solution. If you understand PDEs, I can walk you through the key steps of derriving 2D motion. Otherwise, I\u0027m afraid the only useful formulae I can give you are these for simple special cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo gravity: v(t) = v\u003Csub\u003E0\u003C/sub\u003E / (1 \u002B k v\u003Csub\u003E0\u003C/sub\u003E t). v(0) = v\u003Csub\u003E0\u003C/sub\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGravity, object is falling down: v(t) = - v\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E tanh(g t / v\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E). v(0) = 0. v\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E = sqrt(g/k) is terminal velocity. tanh is hyperbolic tangent function. You can find it on most calculators, or just use Google Caclulator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGravity, object is launched upwards: v(t) = v[sib]t tan(g t / v\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E - a). You need to solve for a, such that v(0) = v\u003Csub\u003E0\u003C/sub\u003E. This solution works right up until body reaches the apex.
