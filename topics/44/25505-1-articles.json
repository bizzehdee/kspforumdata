Could this disturb the orbits of planets and celestial objects if it is used because the force I know of in the universe that can bend the fabric of space is gravity, or at least how i see it is demonstrated in videos I see when they show a fabric to represent space and gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T03:02:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOutside of the warp bubble, the space-time is flat. So there is no gravity generated by warp drive out there. There is also the interior region which is flat. The space ship is located in the interior and also does not experience any gravity. And then there is the boundary region in between. That\u0027s what actually makes the warp bubble a warp bubble, and space-time there is very much distorted. That does result in quite a bit of gravity acting on anything that passes through the warp bubble boundary. The boundary could extend quite a bit around the ship, in which case, you can run risk of damaging something or throwing it out of the orbit, but to shift something as big as a planet, or even a small moon, you need an enormous amount of energy. If we need that much to make the warp drive work, we might never get that far with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt any rate, any safe operation of the warp drive would be such where there are no objects within the bubble boundary.

As a result you have to use another, conventional engine to match your speed with your target. For example: Warp gets you from Earth\u0027s orbit into general vicinity of the Mars, and when field drops you still have only Earth\u0027s orbital speed which is higher than martian. So you have to use your NERVA engine to do correct insertion burn into martian orbit. Did i got it right? Still, it seems to save a lot of dV, not to mention time. You don\u0027t have to reach escape velocity, then do translation burn - you only have to brake yourself into orbit around Mars.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T11:46:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou know...

I can do very basic math with the warp metric and I can do very simple math with the Schwartzschild metric, which would describe gravity around the star. But combining the two?
