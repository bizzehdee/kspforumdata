The subject of this experiment is to analyze the comportment of a biologically engineered specie that has a limited IQ, a ridiculous hunger for spatial exploration and advanced rocket technology at their disposition. The Kerbals. But, to make this experiment quicker, they decided to artificially create a reduced scale solar system so that interplanetary trips would be much quicker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, how does it work? Well first you need a star. So, they just took a brown dwarf, that was way too shabby to start nuclear fusion on it\u0027s own, and heated it with lasers until it actually started the chain reaction that triggerd nuclear fusion within the brown dwarf, creating a low mass star. It\u0027s rather large diameter is explained by the fact that the newly triggered fusion tries to expulse the outer layers of the star outwards, but it\u0027s low gravitational force due to it\u0027s extremely low mass has a hard time keeping it close, creating a much larger diameter than it originally had and also that would be expected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow we have a star, time for some super massive planets. Instead of creating some new supermassive material, why not take what\u0027s already around free to use? Aka neutron stars? So all you need to do is haul half a dozen of those around the newly ignited star, chunk them off to have the desired mass, put them in the right orbit, build a radiation shield around them that then also happens to be the surface of the new planet or moon, and tada, you have a basic canevas for a planet. Just add some details to the surface, an atmosphere if you wish so, and you should have something pretty neat, that seems superdense, but that is basically hollow with an actually superdense neutron star core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust add the Kerbals to Kerbin, leave a few rocket parts lying by the side of the roads, and watch them shoot to space with the most ridiculous contraptions they can think of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etl;dr: Magratheans.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-29T07:31:10Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2013 07:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by stupid_chris\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frogbull","CreatedById":70707,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T07:41:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think (not sure at all) they have to made that choice because of rounding mathematics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust look how Jool is buggy near the surface (cause of its hard gravity force).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T07:56:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Frogbull\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Frogbull\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think (not sure at all) they have to made that choice because of rounding mathematics.\u003Cp\u003EJust look how Jool is buggy near the surface (cause of its hard gravity force).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey just made the choice to have a reduced scale planetary system to make the game much more playable on numerous factors (let\u0027s not start this debate here).
