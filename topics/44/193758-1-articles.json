There are some\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ewild\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0trajectories out there, but you rarely find something good near these, and if you did have such a mission profile, one little error would mean a total loss. So all of the practical missions are found in fairly large \u0022valleys\u0022 of reasonable solutions. Once you constraint where you\u0027re coming from, where you\u0027re going, and how many transfers you want to make, there are not that many initial conditions you have to try before you can just gradient-descent the rest of the way. Some general ideas, like Earth-Earth fly-by used by Rosetta sound silly until you do the math, and somebody must have had a stroke of genius to suggest them initially, but once you know the kinds of \u0022points of interest\u0022 you might encounter, iterating through all the possible combinations doesn\u0027t really take all that much computing power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hard part is actually coming up with a \u0022map\u0022 of the Solar system that lets you integrate motion precisely enough that your answers aren\u0027t total nonsense. Computing optimization problem for one ship, even with all the iterations and false starts that any search will have to do, is nothing compared to building up the map of every single object of any significance, as well as reconstructing average contribution from all the other orbital junk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the truly amazing thing about all of this is that NASA is sharing their data via convenient interface.\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJPL Horizons\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0provides positions of the Sun, planets, over 200 moons and planetary satellites, thousands of comets, and nearly a million asteroids. With this data, you can actually plan missions on your home computer, provided you have solid enough grasp of numerical methods or have software that handles that, of course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you have a mission plan, you still have to execute on it, of course, and that\u0027s another matter entirely. Space telemetry is hard. I\u0027m sure a lot of otherwise good mission plans end up on the cutting floor because they require too much precision in execution. A mission to \u0022maybe make a crater on a moon of Jupiter, or maybe miss it entirely,\u0022 is not going to get a lot of backing even if you promise to cut delta-V requirements in half.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
