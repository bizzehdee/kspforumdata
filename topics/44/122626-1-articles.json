Distilled to its essense Dark matter is actually an unknown source of graviational acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Supposing these are wimps they accelerate from interstellar space approach and whiz backed into space without interaction, if each of these is following elliptical orbit they would spend most of thier time distal to the star\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. As the stars mass originally blows away some of the dark matter will follow the lost mass, there is no reason that new dark matter would approach. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i don\u0027t think this is a proper explanation, but if it is the case that these nova progenitors do lack adequate mass then this is something that needs to be investigated, maybe mass estimates are wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-10T03:23:54Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2015 03:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T16:38:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIndeed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve always wondered this: how do we know that dark matter really is Mysterious Invisible Stuff\u003Csup\u003ETM\u003C/sup\u003E?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat we\u0027ve observed is that, based on the motions of stars and galaxies, there is something out there that has mass and which doesn\u0027t glow or block light strongly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it could just be a bunch of rocks.
