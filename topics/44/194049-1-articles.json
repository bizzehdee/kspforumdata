However, atomic nuclei have positive charges, and thus to get any two nuclei close enough to induce fusion a certain energy threshold must be met. Generally this threshold is quite large but after passing it the nuclear forces overcome the electric forces and fusion occurs. There are a variety of methods to reach this threshold. In magnetic confinement the goal is to create a high temperature plasma. This is necessary to get the nuclei past the energy threshold so fusion can occur. High temperatures correspond to high average velocities, and thus high average energies. Hopefully fusion occurs. Cold plasma is simply not going to do it on the desired scale. Sure some random events may happen, but not in the numbers needed for energy production. The idea is that the fusion reactions could release enough energy to maintain the high temperatures in at least some portion of the plasma. But plasma likes to induce its own magnetic field, and the whole thing falls apart. It may be possible, but it\u0027ll be tough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally I think we should be looking into more advanced fission reactors more-so than fusion (but fusion is certainly worth developing). Accelerator driven reactors could be deployed to burn off nuclear waste and get energy from it; turning the waste into easier to handle elements and isotopes. If such a technology proves effective it could be worthwhile in general since it can be kept sub-critical, runaway reactions with such a reactor are simply impossible.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-22T09:00:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlasma is simply a state of matter, as a function of their energy and density. Depending on what the kind of matter is in the plasma, their overall thermal properties may differ, but the individual particle\u0027s specific properties are more or less the same. For this reason, normally \u0022cold\u0022 plasma is merely utilizing the lightest matter normally encountered - electrons - and as such, they have low energy density and doesn\u0027t really bother with the much heavier atomic nucleus. Fluorescent lamps and CRT tubes are technically utilizing electron plasma in order to generate light.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProblem is, fusion specifically has to do with the much heavier atomic nucleus - at least 1000 times heavier than electrons - which means that, whether you like it or not, the energy density required would almost always has to be high enough for it to happen in a meaningful rate, and that energy is manifested in heat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-22T09:08:49Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2020 09:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by YNM\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-22T23:06:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are fusion systems in use right now, as\u00A0neutron generators.
