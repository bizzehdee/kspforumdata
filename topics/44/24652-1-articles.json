It is designed to be attached to a Deep Space Habitat for anything worthwhile. Unfortunately, there probably won\u0027t be any budget left for a DSH once SLS is up and running.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere. That\u0027s my whole point. \u003Cem\u003EOrion is not a deep space vehicle\u003C/em\u003E. It hasn\u0027t got the consumables, it hasn\u0027t got the liveable space, it hasn\u0027t got the radiation protection for it. It depends on some \u0022yet-to-be-designed\u0022 actual deep space vehicle (hab\u002Bpropulsion stage, bonus points if you have enough heatshield for aerocapture), and only serves the purpose of crew delivery and crew return. Dragon can do that, since its heatshield is also capable of high velocity reentry. Rating a Dragon for long endurance in space is pretty much trivial if you manage to get fuel lines that don\u0027t corrode over the desired time, and the toilets aren\u0027t going into the capsule anyway. And Dragon weights half as much. Same goes for Soyuz, or Shenzhou, only the crew numbers and weights are different, which is the only reason I\u0027m comparing it with Dragon mainly. Never forget Soyuz was also designed for lunar missions, BTW.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune. And if you plan to do regular flights to interplanetary space, you\u0027d better stop the whole thing back in LEO and then you don\u0027t need the heatshield (or, in fact, the whole capsule) anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T23:24:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDeep Space in NASA-speak is anything beyond the Van Allen belt. The Moon is Deep Space, and Orion is designed to go there. Dragon or the Shuttle were not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour Deep Space exploration vehicle is the DSH. The Orion is needed as a lifeboat for the DSH.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yeah, I agree with you that the whole SLS/Orion project is wonky. I would have rather preferred to see a reusable exploration vessel (DSH attached to a SEP tug) that would brake into LEO and use a COTS taxi for crew transfer. The whole plan of staging exploration missions from EML-1 or EML-2 sounds more like a justification of Orion than an actual mission requirement. A bit like the modular ISS design (or space station Freedom) was a justification for the Shuttle rather than a rational way of building a space station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut at any rate, you still need a deep space capsule with high-speed reentry capability and high delta-V for abort modes in case something goes wrong with your star cruiser and it fails to insert into LEO on its way back. I don\u0027t think Dragon has that capability, or at least it wasn\u0027t designed for it in COTS. Orion is one component of a larger system. The problem is that with SLS it is the only component with an actual budget.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-30T01:13:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAgain, and I\u0027m starting to think you guys don\u0027t read: Dragon\u0027s heatshield was designed for Mars return reentry velocities from the start (including the cargo version used on COTS). At a fraction of the cost the traditional contractors were asking for, for an inferior product (read up on how PICA-X came into existence, lots of help from the NASA technical library, and much more ingenuity and cost control). And if something goes wrong with your \u0022star cruiser\u0022 while you are very far away, the heatshield is no issue: you will die for lack of consumables or a solar flare before you reach Earth, be it in Orion or in Dragon. As a side note, even Soyuz\u0027s heatshield is (or at least was at some point) capable of reentry from lunar trajectory, and there\u0027s not much difference between the two. But let\u0027s keep on comparing american products.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to NASA\u0027s definition of deep space (which itself changes all the time), Orion is still incapable of most of it: How would you feel about sitting in an Orion for, say, a year in geostationary orbit? Because your chances of not frying yourself to death would be slim. But you would probably die of hunger first anyway. Orion can do lunar missions on its own, and that is trusting no inconvenient solar flare happens during the mission (a non-zero fatal possibility). Period. Just like Apollo, but with seven people.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe original Orion\u0027s service module propulsion was designed for lunar return, so I won\u0027t buy that it is \u0022necessary for abort modes\u0022. Those abort modes are fantasies to justify the project, the weight of Orion itself and the artificial requirement of launching on a SLS poses greater risks to the overall mission. And the actual service module that ends up flying is going to be built in Europe anyway, so actually Orion is basically only a capsule with no propulsion system, attached to an European ATV. Dragon has a huge advantage there with its integrated LES running on hypergolics. And its gonna end up costing, what, less than a fifth of what Orion has spent to date? Perhaps half if they have huge cost overruns late in development? I hope keeping the engineers at Lockheed happy and fed is worth it, I will keep on thinking there were more productive ways of spending their time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune. For boops sake, the crewed version of Dragon is supposed to land propulsively on land with chutes only as backup. In what way is Orion superior, again? The bathroom?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
