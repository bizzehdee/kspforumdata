To take the Dawn probe you cite as an example, it\u0027s using a 10kW/1AU solar array to drive a 2kW NSTAR gridded ion thruster delivering 0.09N worth of thrust at 3100 Isp (it has three for redundancy, but fires only one at a time). So basically it experiences up to 80% reduction in solar power efficiency out there in the belt, and the power requirements of the engine are tiny.

For instance, the same VF-200 mentioned above has been theorized for a solar electric lunar ferry/tug. Equipped with 200kW worth of panel area, it could ferry payloads between Earth and Moon orbits, with full reusability. You kind of need the (for electric propulsion standards) high-thrust magnetoplasma rocket for this application because you\u0027re trying to propel payload in addition to the craft itself, and because you don\u0027t want to take months for a trip a chemical engine could do in three days.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Justin Kerbice","CreatedById":101695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-30T10:30:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe the main issue with power generators is the use of the old concept of alternator.

You can lift and hold one no problem. They\u0027re smaller than you think - the nozzle skirt of an NTR alone is probably heavier.\u003Cp\u003EThe thing that makes a real mass difference between the NTR and the electric propulsion system is the thermodynamic heat engine and power management infrastructure used to create electric power from the reactor in the first place, because fission produces mostly just heat. Now I\u0027m not sure how much extra mass that costs, but considering designs exist that use the same components that an NTR would use as part of their heat engine, the difference is probably not very large.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that a space based nuclear generator gets maybe 10% efficiency at best, because it can\u0027t get rid of the heat easily, and the insane mass of the cooling and power conversion systems. If we take the SNAP8 as an example, it weighs 4.5t, produces 600kW thermal but only 35kW electric. For comparison, NERVA had an empty mass of 35t for 1100MW, 2000 times more powerful but only 7 times heavier. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI couldn\u0027t find how much the actual SNAP8 reactor core weighs, but it has 6.5kg of uranium, and 12 control rods weighing 12kg each, in a steel core that\u0027s 23cm in diameter by 53cm height. The coolant alone is more than 400kg, and the heat exchangers and piping probably account for most of the mass, so I\u0027d be surprised if the reactor itself was heavier than 200kg. On the other hand, you have to take the turbopump and and nozzle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s do some math, boiling and heating 1kg of H2 to 2500K takes 18MJ, with 600kWt available, it means a flow of 32.5g/s. I doubt the pump and nozzle required to handle 32g/s of hydrogen have masses in a the hundreds of kg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we assume a 600kW NTR would weight 1t, 8.3km/s ISP, a 1t payload and a 6km/s deltaV budget, we would need a wet mass of 4.1t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the SNAP8 and a ion thruster of negligible mass and 100km/s ISP, we have a dry mass of 5.5t, and a wet mass of 5.85t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the NTR mission wet mass to be heavier than the ion mission dry mass, you need a delta V budget of 8.3km/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, there must be a niche for nuclear powered ion thrusters, but given the weight of a nuclear power generator compared to a NTR, it ill be only for very heavy payloads and massive deltaV budgets, when dividing reaction mass by 100 compensate the mass of the cooling and power conversion systems.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-Velocity-","CreatedById":74097,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-01T22:12:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nuke\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nuke\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethen isru can move into the realm of uranium processing.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt takes A LOT of processing to make uranium fuel. Now you want to do that on another planet or an asteroid? That\u0027s tough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re going to make a fission reactor that is to be refueled by in-situ mining operations, you\u0027d probably be A LOT smarter to utilize thorium, and a thorium reactor. In fact, there are a lot of thorium proponents out there that say in general, a thorium-based fuel cycle is vastly superior to a uranium fuel cycle (in terms of safety, lower quantities of nuclear waste, nuclear proliferation, and abundancy of fuel), and that the only reason we don\u0027t have thorium reactors instead of uranium reactors is because thorium reactors cannot easily be used to breed fissile material for nuclear weapons. Creating nuclear weapons was a priority back in the 40s and 50s when we had to chose whether to develop uranium reactors or thorium reactors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure that someone out there has pointed out flaws in some or more of the arguments of the thorium reactor proponents. The only one I am aware of is that thorium reactors actually could be used to breed uranium-233 (and the fissioning of U-233 is where the majority of a thorium reactors energy output comes from), which could in fact be used as a nuclear bomb... but I don\u0027t know how easily that could be done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless of how superior thorium reactors are over uranium reactors, the point remains that if you\u0027re mining asteroids for your nuclear fuel, it makes a hell of a lot more sense to mine thorium than uranium. Thorium-232 composes almost all of naturally occurring thorium, and it\u0027s your fuel in a thorium reactor. Uranium-235, the fuel required for uranium reactors comprises only like 0.7% of all naturally occurring uranium (the majority of natural uranium being uranium-238), requiring you to create massive uranium enrichment plants in order to acquire usable fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-01T22:14:50Z\u0022 title=\u002210/01/2014 10:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
