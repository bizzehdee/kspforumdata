I didn\u0027t think they\u0027d be quite that far yet - usually, test flights in space are done at a fairly advanced stage. But Paul seems convinced that they could stuff everything needed into a 3U cubesat and just toss it up there. He\u0027s even been asking people to comment on typical launch prices... while also disclaiming at the same time that there is absolutely no budget for any such thing, not even the cubesat itself. So don\u0027t expect anything like that to actually happen. I\u0027m just pointing this out because I find it impressive enough all in itself to know that an involved scientist is saying \u0022the only thing keeping us from throwing this up into orbit right now is money\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T11:23:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI thought NASA was meant to be putting out a paper on this around the end of summer?
