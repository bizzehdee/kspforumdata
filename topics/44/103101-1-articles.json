That\u0027s because, as I mentioned, the idea of the \u0022ultimate\u0022 freight carrier is meaningless -- there\u0027s nothing that\u0027s best in all cases.

Ports are not cheap, but they serve enormous cargo loads, and you don\u0027t really need that many of them (since you aren\u0027t delivering directly to the destination, the ship is only one step in the pathway).\n\nAs for transferring cargo: In most cases an aeroscraft would also have to transfer cargo to land transport (as you mentioned). However, transferring cargo is one of the things that ships and trucks and trains \\*excel\\* at: if you don\u0027t support intermodal containers and aren\u0027t carrying a single kind of bulk cargo (like oil carriers or car carriers), your transport method isn\u0027t even worth talking about for cheap mass freight. The challenge for aircraft (including this) is that intermodal containers don\u0027t tend to play nicely with them. 40-foot intermodal containers tend to way between 20 and 30 tons (max weight is 30.5t), which means you can\u0027t take very many of them on your craft (and note that a 40-foot container weighs 4 tons empty, so if you load them lightly then the weight of the containers is a significant fraction of cargo weight).

As for container handling: You wouldn\u0027t be loading/unloading stuff to trucks without ground infrastructure; you need stability when putting a container on a truck.

The source Wikipedia cites is per ton-kilometer and gives \\*ranges\\*, and I\u0027m not sure how faithful the Wikipedia numbers are for that.\n\nIf you bring up hydrogen fuel cells, I think I can bring up electric trains. They\u0027re more powerful than diesel anyway (the reason they aren\u0027t universal in the US is that electrification requires maintenance, and lots of US rail lines are through the middle of nowhere), and have zero emissions just like hydrogen fuel cells. Like hydrogen fuel cells, everything depends on how the (electricity/hydrogen) is produced.

But you can only travel at few locations and that efficiency is for freight trains which travel at 40km/h average.\n\nRails infrastructure also means waste time for cars and trucks due cut roads, these means more infrastructure needed for bridges or tunnels over all the rail route.\n\nAnd even with all that efficiency they would not beat a hydrogen-fuel cell-PV airship, because the only energy consumed would be in its construction. Then they fly for free, the only you need to pay is for the 2 pilots and some maintenance.\n\nAnd if you increase the volume it becomes more and more efficient in cost, I read that if they overseed the 500 to 1000 tons, they already can compete with ships\u002Bother methods in transport cost.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Zeppelins are way too sensitive to weather and have too small a cargo capacity to form the backbone of a transport system, they will be niche at best.\n\u003E Electrified rail on land (powered by some green energy source) and ships by sea (also with comparably clean energy sources) will beat the zeppelins senseless in almost every metric.\n\nThey are not very sensitive to weather, that is a misconception.\n\nThe zeppeling in 1930 fly faster than the airplanes of that time, and the accidents due weather was mostly due over pilot confidence on how good they were.\n\n[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Airships](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Airships) (read misconceptions)\n\n*\u0022Modern airships are actually quite safe, and compare favorably to helicopters. It\u0027s hard to make generalizations, though, because airships are just like airplanes when it comes to safety: an ultralight plane is less safe in inclement weather and crash situations than a 747. In the same way, some hot airships are blown backwards in a light breeze, but on the other hand, in the 1950s an American naval blimp program manned an Arctic airborne early warning station continuously for 10 days in the winter. The weather was the area\u0027s worst in years, grounding all other military and commercial airplanes with combinations and variations of ice, snow, rain, fog, and 65 mph winds. The airships went on sorties that lasted for days, in extremely heavy icing conditions, and succeeded in their mission with no crashes- effectively crushing the misconception that airships are inherently more vulnerable to weather than other aircraft. In fact, their natural buoyancy, lengthy endurance and ability to maneuver at low speeds makes them very well suited to ride out storms.\u0022*\n\nAs I said before, at big scales, the good thing of airships grow much faster than the bad things.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E For \u0022last mile delivery\u0022 I know Amazon is looking into Quadcopter Drones to deliver right to your door.

Yes, they may go quite slow near inhabited areas, and some awkward locations put 30 mph or so limits on them to survive the slope and turns, but often they\u0027ll idle around highway speed once they can, especially if going long-distance.

The main benefit of this is that it can place oversize cargo pretty much everywhere.\n\nWind represent some issues, one use who would be nice but would probably be too hard because of wind would be to pick up an module on a ship and move it somewhere. \n\nIf the ship is in a bay it should work, this saves too. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E The military are the ones more interested, they with nasa provide the money to the prototype.\n\u003E \n\u003E Military wants a dirigible transport able to land and take off without ballast or infrastructure since \u0022always..\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E They even did a test with an average helium blimp, they fire all they got (missiles, high caliber bullets, etc) to the blimp, the blimp complete the mission and 2 hours later return to the base.\n\u003E \n\u003E A bigger rigid dirigible is even more strong than this, the only way is to shot the cabin, but without heat signiture or anything to guide a missile to the cabin is not easy task.

This is because the rockets tend to go after the rear of the engines and this is an part who can take lots of damage as its exposed to the fire of the engine all the time, the exhaust also protect the engine. They probably compare well with helicopters here but probably has larger chance of survive as it might be able to keep in the air on the remaining cells if it drops the cargo, an helicopter can auto rotate on engines out but not if pilot or rotor system is down.\n\nYou will neither use airships nor cargo planes in an area where the enemy has heavy anti air missiles. Here helicopters has an benefit as they can hug the terrain well. \n\nHowever the only stuff you will do here would be to deploy special commands or extract people. \n\nIn the future we will probably get laser defences against missiles this will tip balance against heavy platforms who can carry the laser.\n\nIn short airships might be an military thing, civilians can rent them as they can rent military cargo planes \n\n\u003E \n\u003E The only you need is a not flamable envelope and hydrogen sensors.\n\u003E \n\u003E Even with ignition and holes, the fire would not extend, and the same fire would prevent any high mixture in close enviroments.\n\u003E \n\u003E Was already discover than paint surfaces with 100nm of reduce graphene oxyde (very easy to make) removes in a 100% any leak.

However, transferring cargo is one of the things that ships and trucks and trains \\*excel\\* at: if you don\u0027t support intermodal containers and aren\u0027t carrying a single kind of bulk cargo (like oil carriers or car carriers), your transport method isn\u0027t even worth talking about for cheap mass freight. The challenge for aircraft (including this) is that intermodal containers don\u0027t tend to play nicely with them. 40-foot intermodal containers tend to way between 20 and 30 tons (max weight is 30.5t), which means you can\u0027t take very many of them on your craft (and note that a 40-foot container weighs 4 tons empty, so if you load them lightly then the weight of the containers is a significant fraction of cargo weight). Compare to a train, which can handle 1 or 2 40-foot containers per car, or a ship.\n\nYou are talking of TEU, 1 cargo container has 20 foot and some toes, weight 3400 kg empty and 24000kg max weight. The average weight will be 13000kg.\n\nThere is this image in the official page but I agree that there is not much sense to use this containers.\n\n![4601177206_524x416.jpg](http://aeroscraft.com/communities/4/004/011/780/344//images/4601177206_524x416.jpg)\n\nAlso, you dont need them, these containers are designed to move the cargo between different transport methods.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Container cranes are not light; you lose a lot of cargo capacity if you only had 250t to begin with.\n\nThese kind of cranes had more sense:\n\n![image.jpg](http://static.businessinsider.com/image/50815a5e69beddda4400000d/image.jpg)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You can\u0027t unload most cargo in lakes ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nLol why not? The lake has shore.. And your ramp only needs to touch shore.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E But this \\*also\\* has a niche. Container ships\u0027 niche is massive cargo transportation from one place to another more distant place where using water isn\u0027t a big detour. This can\u0027t fill that. Trucks\u0027 niche is last-mile transport. This can\u0027t fill that. Trains do what container ships do, but over land and with more flexibility (because railyards are easier than ports). This can\u0027t do that; again, it simply doesn\u0027t have the capacity. The niche for this is medium quantities of freight, as well as oversized freight, at low speeds. It fills a niche kind of like barges, but over land and faster (less fuel-efficient, though).\n\nBut these can be confusing because until now transportation was like this. Many cities had ports and they move cargo between them by ships.\n\nBut the true is that almost all goods are manufacture in the edges of the cities and the big ones in open fields far from the cities where the terrain is cheap enoght to make huge factories.\n\nThey need to cross all the city traffic to reach the port. These produce more traffic and waste time for a lot of citizens which translate in lower country production. \n\nBut instead gather 100000 tons in one place, you can move 250, 500, or 1000 tons from point to point. Of course these does not count for all kind of goods, only for goods between big companies, not to the final consumer. Is a niche I know. but is a big one.\n\nThey can be very efficient in transport food.

The source Wikipedia cites is per ton-kilometer and gives \\*ranges\\*, and I\u0027m not sure how faithful the Wikipedia numbers are for that.\n\nI am not sure either, but I know that zepelling gain extra efficiency injecting (instead venting) hydrogen from the envelope into the diesel engines which increase a lot the diesel efficiency.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E If you bring up hydrogen fuel cells, I think I can bring up electric trains. They\u0027re more powerful than diesel anyway (the reason they aren\u0027t universal in the US is that electrification requires maintenance, and lots of US rail lines are through the middle of nowhere), and have zero emissions just like hydrogen fuel cells. Like hydrogen fuel cells, everything depends on how the (electricity/hydrogen) is produced. (note: a fuel cell is a poor choice if you\u0027re going to fuel it via onboard electrolysis; actual batteries are \\*much\\* more efficient for this.

In my country Argentina, many rails were abandoned, resurrect them cost a lot of money and there is many destinations who never had rails.. All the transport to the country interior is by trucks, and many places were abandoned or not exploited due lack of roads.\n\nMake a new infrastructure it does not justify either. This craft would be perfect for my country.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E A PV airship will not use fuel cells. That is a \\*terrible\\* efficiency idea. Fuel cells are bad as batteries. Electrolysis-fuel cell has really low efficiency, much lower than battery charge-discharge. So let\u0027s assume this is a sensible idea, which uses batteries.

There\u0027s a reason this hasn\u0027t been proposed by Aeroscraft.\n\nElectrolysis had a efficiency of 90 to 95%, fuel cell had a 60% of efficiency, but in this case you dont need to compress the hydrogen which it cost you 5% more to liquid, also the way than aeroscraft compress the lifting gas, it can recover that energy when it realese it (because it moves the same engine which compress it producing energy)\n\nHydrogen is a very efficient way to storage big amount of energy, and in this case you dont need a heavy tank, you use the same envelope.\n\nBatteries weight a lot, their energy density is awfull in comparison with hydrogen.\n\nIn fact there is already an airship concept using this:\n\n20000 meters of height, operation full time over its lifetime.\n\n[https://youtu.be/6alsthqayLo?t=2m54s](https://youtu.be/6alsthqayLo?t=2m54s)"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T23:46:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Also, you dont need them, these containers are designed to move the cargo between different transport methods.\n\nThis phrase really stuck out to me.

Right now we can no be sure if in 20 years we would not have a better solution. \n\n\u003E So, trying to get back to the point; \u0022costs\u0022 are not isolated to CO2 output, but general costs as a whole. ROAD breaks up like crazy, but the costs of everyone using flying cars (i.e. helicopters, or heck, hot air balloons) is far more than the costs of repairing the road.\n\nyeah of course, but it reach a point where the production cost and efficiency gained in some cases encourage to make the investment and save money for the future.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Unload directly on trucks will be hard because its sensitive to wind, might be posibe if you used multiple tie downs and winches, this would be pointless for containers but nice if you have to place an huge module correctly. The main benefit of this is that it can place oversize cargo pretty much everywhere.\n\u003E Wind represent some issues, one use who would be nice but would probably be too hard because of wind would be to pick up an module on a ship and move it somewhere. \n\u003E \n\u003E If the ship is in a bay it should work, this saves too.\n\nYeah there are all complicate manuvers and I will not bet to become in a standard producedure.\n\nBig airships are less affected by turbulance, but the benefic does not worth the risk added.\n\nI read this for airships:\n\n\u0022*As a rule of thumb, wind exceeding the top speed of the ship in flight puts it in danger, and wind exceeding half its top speed makes landing dangerous.*\u0022\n\nIn this case would be: avoid more than 120 knots in fly and 60 knots for landing.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E In the future we will probably get laser defences against missiles this will tip balance against heavy platforms who can carry the laser.\n\u003E In short airships might be an military thing, civilians can rent them as they can rent military cargo planes\n\nWhat laser? \n\nThey might have other benefic, even without lifting gas due a huge hole explosion, they may try a soft landing using its lifting body shape if their control surfaces still work.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Agree with hydrogen, the danger is way overblown, cabin and engines are below the envelope, you might want to make sure its better separated than on the helium version.\n\u003E Side note, all electric equipment on the production part of oil platforms has to be operate in an explosive air / gas mixture. I\u0027m involved in an project where the technicians uses pads to get information and report status, and yes the pads has to be certified for this. Heavy duty electrical engines has been so a long time.\n\u003E \n\u003E No need to separate, if in low attitude you land, high you bail out,\n\nBut it will be a hard to convince people than now hydrogen airships can be safe. Is not practical technology what keeps hydrogen airships out, is public fear. So if a vehicle like this is made one day, they will need to sacrifice one to show people how safe they might be.\n\nWhat is absurd that they dont provide certificates (at least in USA) for even freight hydrogen airships no matter how many safety mechanism they had.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E One interesting idea is an airship cruise, lots of interesting locations are inland, yes its plenty of trips but you have to change hotel every night, better if your hotel move during the night. For the cabins weight is an issue not room so if you can keep the weight down you could have suites. \n\u003E yes this would win on being conformable not on price\n\nI would love to fly on those, other possibility is a moving hospital.\n\nIt can have everything a hospital needs, like plenty of space for beds, Medical equipment, electricity day and night, the envelope can function to gather water from rain or dew, it can be purify with the fuel cell, the electrolysis also give you oxygen.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This phrase really stuck out to me.
