And there\u0027s probably a limited amount of electricity available to the first stage - we don\u0027t know if the Merlin engines (also a deliberately simple design) can even generate any. The first stage already needs to run a double-redundant copy of the entire rocket avionics and flight control that\u0027s usually housed in the second stage, and it probably has to do so from battery power alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the grid fins being the culprit of the bad landing, I don\u0027t think that\u0027s the case. Elon simply wanted to share a little extra info, and as you know, Twitter only lets you put down a few words each post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fins do not have the job to slow down he rocket, but rather to steer it. As the rocket hit the barge as intended, the steering presumably went largely right. Even with more fluid, the fins wouldn\u0027t have prevented the hard landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat most likely killed it was wave motion. Since the stage cannot hover (it cannot throttle down far enough to reach a TWR of 1 even with only a single engine), it needs to do a suicide burn and then kill its engine, and for that, you need to know exactly where the landing surface is. Unfortunately, even though the drone barge is able to hold its horizontal position fixed pretty precisely, it will still constantly rise and fall with the waves. So where do they aim the suicide burn? At the top of a wave, which would cause the rocket to drop down if the barge is lower than that? At the bottom of a wave, which will cause the rocket to hit the deck hard if the barge is higher than that? At the middle, where it is correct twice as often but also wrong twice as often? And not to forget, each wave is different, and overall wave intensity can change by the minute!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo depending on how the landing burn was set, and the sea conditions at the time, the most likely course of events probably involved the barge simply being higher up than the rocket expected. And possibly even meeting the rocket while still in an upwards motion, causing the two to slam together with more force than the landing system is designed to cushion. And maybe it wasn\u0027t 100% vertical yet either, which gives the \u0022landing on a slope\u0022 effect - whichever leg hits the surface first, causes the entire craft to fall over in the opposite direction.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Firov","CreatedById":57445,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-10T19:27:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo depending on how the landing burn was set, and the sea conditions at the time, the most likely course of events probably involved the barge simply being higher up than the rocket expected.

While we are thinking \u0022OMG they just flew that rocket through the eye of a needle from hundreds of KM away and just bairly missed sticking the landing. so close, they\u0027ll nail it next time\u0022 the rest of the uneducated masses will see \u0022OMG that rocket just crashed into that boat and they want to try that on land? Not anywhere near me they dont.\u0022 Sadly the panicked masses calling their representitives could cause much more problems for the company than the additional publicity would be worth unless the crash was particularly tame (aka landing almost stuck but the rocket toppled over after touchdown but no boom)\u003Cp\u003EPersonally after proving they can hit such a tiny mark as that I have no reservations about them attempting that over land. Keep it to unpopulated areas just for safety of course but that was an extremely precise landing and I have no doubt they can repeat it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what I was thinking, this isn\u0027t a failure, this is a partial success.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GigaG","CreatedById":8013,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-11T03:54:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wonder if we\u0027ll get any still pics of the aftermath even without any video.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut nice job, SpaceX, for getting another spacecraft into orbit successfully and getting the landing target right!
