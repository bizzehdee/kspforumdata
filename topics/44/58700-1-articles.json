That is never going to happen though, not only because giving authentication control to the public (even if distributed) is something that scares publishers silly, but also because the cloud is designed to gain control over the digital lives of customers. What you describe is the exact opposite, as costumers become less dependent on any central control. Power is money, so I can not see any publisher willingly giving that up.\u003Cp\u003EPeople tend to believe the cloud was invented to cater to their needs, but in reality it is the industry\u0027s way of 1) moving towards a model where they are providing a service instead of a product, so that the average end user is continuously paying where he would have paid only once before (see Adobe with their new CC model or Microsoft with Office) and 2) disabling the possibility any second hand sales, which is legal but viewed as a problem. Slowly but surely you are getting used to the idea that you are renting software instead of buying it. So far the general public is loving it, but remember that the first lines of coke are always free.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I try to buy everything DRM-free and outside of Steam/uPlay/et cetera, but nowadays that often is not even an option.

Not just because of the potential DRM (which will be bypassed somehow), not just because of subscriptions (which also will be bypassed), but because NOT EVERYONE HAS A GIGABIT CONNECTION. I get charged $130/month for half a megabyte per second peak download speeds, and it\u0027s down about 2-3 times a week for an hour or so at a time. This makes it the fastest, cheapest, and most reliable connection available. Most games on my Steam account have never been played because I haven\u0027t the opportunity to download 10 GB monstrosities. I have never been able to stream anything live above 480p quality. A lot of people in the world have far worse connections than me. How the hell are we supposed to function in a world that keeps everything online? For me, it is still far faster to drive twenty minutes to the store, buy a movie, and drive home than it would be to download it. Even if DRM is bypassed, and subscriptions averted through piracy or similar means, these products will still be inaccessible to me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe entertainment industry is worried about losing profit from a more expensive storage format?
