The Sea Dragon still used LH2/LOX for the second stage- it just did so with a Pressure-Fed rocket engine (which admittedly hurt its ISP, but did not make it \u0022abysmally low\u0022 by any means) and much wider engineering margins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bottom-line difference between a Big Dumb Booster and a \u0022smart\u0022 booster is, once again, payload fraction and cost-per-kg. A Big Dumb Booster might have a 1% payload fraction instead of a 3% payload fraction, but makes up for it with less than 1/3rd the overall cost for a rocket of that size/mass. That\u0027s the basic principle- not low ISP, not low reliability (in fact, a Big Dumb Booster can be made MORE reliable than a \u0022smart booster\u0022 thanks to much wider engineering margins). Of course, if you\u0027re also willing to sacrifice reliability, then you get something like the Aquarius (which also was a *small* rocket designed to take advantage of mass-production techniques...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Impaler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Impaler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is why SpaceX is on the right path, they are making the rocket higher performance and the manufacturing process as lean as possible so they have a good expendable rocket.

They are generally built to wider engineering margins, and are much closer to the Big Dumb Booster concept than anything utilized by NASA, the NSA, or Air Force- which is one of the reasons their rockets tend to get payload to orbit cheaper than American designs. It\u0027s ironic that you would mock the Big Dumb Booster concept, and then hold up the country that in real life comes closest to actually implementing it...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the note of re-usability, yes, Space-X is going in the right direction for chemical rockets. But if you want to focus on performance and reusability, the ultimate end isn\u0027t chemical rocketry at all (which is more or less a peak technology- the only significant improvements we can make, like Full Flow Staged Combustion, tri-propellant fuel mixes, and Air Augmented booster stages; all yield relatively minor net improvements in performance and cost after the various trade-offs they require...) The ultimate end for high-performance rocketry is THERMAL rockets- specifically Microwave Thermal rockets and spaceplanes in the short run (Microwave Thermal has ISP\u0027s up to 850-1000 seconds when using Liquid Hydrogen, and 2-3 times the maximum TWR of chemical rockets), and Fusion Thermal spaceplanes somewhere decades or centuries down the road...

Gyrotrons are regularly used in some high-tech foundries and other parts of the metalworking industry, and a scientists demonstrated the ability to run a small toy electric helicopter off Microwave Power using a gyrotron and a rectenna in the 1960\u0027s...)

However, I agree that it\u0027s a rather impressive number. The thing to remember about a rocket is that it\u0027s already built to survive substantial g-forces anyways: just normally rockets are very light and thus the total forces survived aren\u0027t that great in magnitude (for analogy: a needle can survive far more g\u0027s than a large wooden block, but the block can survive greater *magnitudes* of force...) However the Sea Dragon was *VERY* sturdily built, and unlike a boat, has very little mass besides the structural elements (which were quite heavy for a rocket) once the fuel is burnt-out. I have little doubt that a hollow metal tube the size of a battleship could survive a 328 km/h splashdown (that\u0027s a little over 91 m/s, for reference) if it didn\u0027t have *ANY* cargo or fuel mass weighing it down...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere *were* provisions for minor repairs to the structure after splashdowns (the Sea Dragon was designed for easy repair), however, and they did design a drag-skirt to reduce splashdown speed to something like 20 or 30 m/s- so they clearly weren\u0027t expecting to push the maximum structural tolerances on a regular basis...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for cargo-mass, the Sea Dragon would have been *quite* useful as a fuel-tanker or for launching large fuel-depots to LEO.
