Namely, that an \u0022average\u0022 value might be absolutely and totally useless. Basically, yeah, you win on average, given enough time, but unless the opportunity cost is very small, say $10, you just can\u0027t physically play enough games to get that infinite tail end on your side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEver since I learned of this possibility, I\u0027ve been wondering if it\u0027s possible to play this the other way. In every game of luck in the Casino, house always wins. No matter what strategy you use to bet in, say, roulette, the expectation value is always going to be in favor of the house. In fact, regardless of betting strategy, in a game of luck the expectation value cannot change! But this problem shows that it doesn\u0027t necessarily matter. Could there be a betting strategy which, while letting Casino win on average, still lets you get the money over any reasonably finite number of games? It seems that some betting strategies do work on this principle, but they still have rather short fluctuations. So while you can use them to get a bit of extra money in short term, you\u0027ll never make any significant amount.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope I didn\u0027t spoil too much for people still trying to solve it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Depth","CreatedById":81698,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T04:00:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_%28betting_system%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_%28betting_system%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a good way to get banned from many online casinos and will get you thrown out from many real life ones.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"neamerjell","CreatedById":86054,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T04:32:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis actually sounds a little bit like table top wargaming mechanics:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou roll to see if you hit your target, then if you did hit it, you roll to see how much damage you did.

The classic martingale, doubling up on losses so that every win brings you back into the black, is a great strategy for casinos - the martingale gambler often comes out slightly ahead, but the day he doesn\u0027t will cost him very heavily. The anti-martingale strategy in the OP is also great for casinos since it encourages gamblers to make bigger, more reckless bets. In a game of pure chance, the casino shouldn\u0027t care what system you use, in the long run they have their edge and will make lots of money. In truly random games like roulette, all systems are great for casinos because they all encourage the gambler to risk more money, since the gambler \u0027knows\u0027 he will make it back in the end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, games like blackjack only appear to be truly random, after a few hands the player has enough information to win in the long run, which is why the casinos will throw you out if they catch you counting cards.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bacterius","CreatedById":69384,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T11:59:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe martingale only works if you have unlimited money.

For martingale specifically, it\u0027s not long enough. If you happen to have 2\u003Csup\u003En\u003C/sup\u003E minimum bets worth of money, you can absorb n-1 losses. On n-th, game is over. In other words, your expectation for a single round of martingale is winning 1 minimum with probability of 1-2\u003Csup\u003E1-n\u003C/sup\u003E, or losing it all with probability 2\u003Csup\u003E1-n\u003C/sup\u003E. Situation changes if you manage to double your starting capital, requiring 2\u003Csup\u003En\u003C/sup\u003E consecutive wins. In other words, the odds of you successfully doubling your capital are 1 - (1-2\u003Csup\u003E1-n\u003C/sup\u003E)\u003Csup\u003En\u003C/sup\u003E. For large enough n, that expression goes to zero. So a way of making money it is not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, say you have a million dollars in your savings. And say all you want to do is win enough money to get yourself some drinks. You can pretty much do this whenever you want. Yes, there is a tiny chance that you\u0027ll lose your savings, but it\u0027s more likely that you die on the way to casino, so it\u0027s a reasonable risk. Yeah, collecting interest is more efficient with this sum of money, but we are talking about a principle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe above basically works for the same reason that the game in OP\u0027s post doesn\u0027t. Outcome of martingale is a loss in the long term, but it keeps winning in short, despite the game being weighted against you. But what\u0027s interesting is that while martingale brakes down pretty fast, given limited resources, the game in OP\u0027s post takes an absurdly long time to pay off if you have to pay each time you play. So the question is whether this behavior is something that can depend on the betting tactic. Can there be a betting strategy that allows you to keep winning for a longer time on a significantly smaller budget?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe answer is probably no, but I might be missing something. The idea is that game\u0027s average winnings cannot depend on the betting strategy. So in order for you to win small amounts in many games, the strategy has to allow for you to lose all that money in one go. And that means the game will be budget-limited, and you can\u0027t really deviate from martingale in any significant way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T18:15:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI went on a weekend bender in Reno during college. We used simple Martingale (double after every loss) and played craps. We played the field (2,3,4,9,10,11, or 12 to win), which loses about 56% of the time, but often pays out double on 2 and triple on 12, which reduces the house advantage to about 2.8%. Key to the field bet is that it 1) has nearly even odds and 2) plays on every roll of the dice (unlike most craps bets). We didn\u0027t have a large cash balance (about $150 pooled between us to start), so we were playing $2 minimum bet tables and playing the minimum bet. With our initial stake we could lose 6 times in a row without busting (probability 3%). We played this way for 2 hours and built up over $500 of winnings. Then we got greedy and moved to $3 and $4 bets and promptly lost the entire stake on a string of losing rolls when we couldn\u0027t double after a loss. We did continue to pursue the strategy with our remaining funds over the course of 6-8 hours, and eventually walked away with about $30 total in winnings over our initial stake (after removing dealer tips), which paid for gas for the trip. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is the even with a larger stake, there are maximum bet limits to prevent exactly this strategy from working. Typically these are $1000 for low minimum bet tables ($2 and $3). If you start with a $2 bet, you\u0027re only winning $2 for each winning roll. (Start with $2 and lose. Then bet $4 and win, you\u0027ve bet $6 and won $8, for a $2 gain.) If you can bet a maximum of $1000, you won\u0027t be able to recover your stake if you lose 9 times in a row, which happens about 1 out of 200 runs. Since you\u0027re only winning $2 for each run, it\u0027s pretty easy to rack up more than 200 runs in a night.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re just out to have a good time, though, play the longer bets: pass or come are close to even bets (1.4% house advantage per bet; 0.4% per roll.) You can still pursue martingale, but it\u0027ll take longer and you can enjoy the free drinks and rowdy atmosphere and even come away with a few dollars.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-13T18:37:07Z\u0022 title=\u002211/13/2013 06:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Mr Shifty\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"3_bit","CreatedById":52836,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T21:45:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Depth\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Depth\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_%28betting_system%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_%28betting_system%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a good way to get banned from many online casinos and will get you thrown out from many real life ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually thought of this myself.
