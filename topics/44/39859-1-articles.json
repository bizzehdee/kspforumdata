I can get a USB to SATA converter if necessary, but I\u0027d prefer being able to do it without spending any money. I\u0027ve looked up ways to do it, but I have only found how to link two internals, or two USBs, but not one of each.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am running windows Vista, on an ASUS motherboard.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kilmeister","CreatedById":65062,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T13:18:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat version of Vista?

Some present themselves to windows as standard disk which windows would let you convert it to a dynamic disk. But I think most USB devices report themselves as a removable drive.
