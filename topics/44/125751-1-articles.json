The twist is that the plague (without any remedy) appears on the ship and starts wreaking havoc on the survivors. The solution to this is closing everyone into stasis tanks, hoping that the cure will be found sooner than later. But story happens, and so one of the heroes has to disinfect a large (abandoned) part of the ship without any ethanol or formaldehyde at hand. So far I was thinking it could be achieved by sealing the section, disabling the heating and climate control systems and opening the airlock for an extended period of time, say, 30 days. \u003Cbr\u003E\nI know that this should be enough (in theory) to kill any bacteria if it was open space, but the ship is enclosed and radiation shielded.

Only the fusion reactor compartment and its coolant conduits are hot enough to kill pathogens, and these are unfortunately not an option. I should have been more clear on the reason for sterilizing the large compartment - the heroes need a place where they could place people awakened from stasis into quarantine to see whether they have already been infected. For this reason, it needs to be devoid of the pathogen (so they don\u0026#39;t get infected while in quarantine) and habitable over three days (the incubation time).
