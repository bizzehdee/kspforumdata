If you want to get frustrated, get frustrated with the politicians as NASA has been committed to the SLS since 2010.

It has no re-entry systems (no thermal tiles or the now abandoned plan for metholox cooling ports), no payload space/capacity. At best it\u0027s comparable to New Shepard, seeing as they do much of the same thing (or at least will once it flies)- taking off,\u00A0 going to altitude, and then coming back down to power land at a set destination.

The way SLS is now, with a stupidly high price, under-powered first stage, and a useless upper stage (ICPS has no business as an upper stage for an SHLV. Great for a mid-sized LV like Delta IV and still useful for an HLV like D IV heavy), is not useful to anything other than... Wait... It will come to me eventually...

There was only 1 burn which I\u2019ll admit meets the criteria I set (the LO capture burn),\u00A0though only Apollo 13 meets the criteria of using an engine not connected to the crew module at launch (by using the LM descent engine).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhats magic is docking large spacecraft and making sure they don\u2019t shear themselves apart due to the acceleration forces of a burn. The larger the vehicles the larger the forces at play- which goes\u00A0from mildly denting thick\u00A0metal frames and beams with something to the size of Apollo to tearing it like paper with bigger builds. It\u2019s something we simply don\u2019t have experience with. ACES honestly is the best way to get experience without being too overly ambitious. It\u2019s smaller sized but can be used to have payloads flown to it. Slowly maybe we can see multisegmented payloads. A kickstage attached, then something else like an upper stage. Slowly growing to a more complex vehicle of your scale. Life isn\u2019t KSP- we can\u2019t just jump from one tier level to the other without consequences.

The only reason to pretend it\u0027s a problem is to make it seem like the current architecture is the only way to do it. Nothing about the complex LoR architecture of Artemis is less dangerous than any such architecture in LEO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApollo S-IVb pushed the TLI stack at all of ~1.4g. Anything that can survive launch can survive those forces. LOI was under 1 g. Not a problem. We\u0027re talking about docking Orion to what would in effect be a large ACES. 5.4m ACES carries 68 tons of props. So that is in effect exactly what we are talking about to send Orion, plus a lander (Apollo LM was 16.4t, Orion is 26t), something close to ACES in capability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-09-13T22:33:03Z\u0022 title=\u002209/13/2019 10:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 13, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by tater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-13T22:32:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223671783\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022186560\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221568413176\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022150444\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022.50calBMG\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 minutes ago, .50calBMG said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tugs will be needed to put the modules into LO...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose are upper stages at that point- it becomes a tug (to me) when it docks and then is transported.
