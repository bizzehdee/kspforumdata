I\u0027m wondering if a company decided to do this if anything would stand in their way. I\u0027m also wondering how much something like this would cost and how long it would take. On the flip side, what if a company bought one of the original shuttles and got it space worthy again."},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T00:38:34Z","Content":"Given the amount of money and man-power required for such a thing to occur...i don\u0027t see why they can\u0027t build a new one!

I think if you were to build a shuttle certain improvements must be made. A proper abort system must be considered is one of my main concerns. That being said and I love the space shuttle, its not really necessary. The internatonal Space Station has proved that although the space shuttle was key to building it, a shuttle is not necessary. The russian segment were launched on proton rockets and then manned by soyuz. Soyuz are still being used. The most efficient way to get people to and from the space station is a capsule. Orion, Dragon, and CST-100, all can hold 5\u002B people. Cargo to orbit is done with Dragon, ATV, Cygnus, Progress, and more. So everything can be done with out the space shuttle and at a much lower price tag. So what I am trying to get at is, why would someone want to make a new space shuttle? The only viable use would be for tourism and that I am 100% behind. Still capsules would be more efficient. You can\u0027t leave LEO with a shuttle so going traveling past LEO off the table with a shuttle. So could it be done? Absolutely! Should it be done? Not really money can be spent much more efficiently elsewhere to space travel. Will it be done? Most likely no. The closest you will get to a plane in space is maybe the dream chaser and virgin galactic."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T01:22:59Z","Content":"I hear that the exact specs were destroyed...\n\nNo one should do it.

(It\u0027s cheaper to build a new rocket each time)\n\u003E [A crew carrying spaceplane may be of some value.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_Chaser)\n\nYes, dream chaser should work, however its just an pod who uses wings to land, main benefit is lower g load during landing an cross range.\n\nMain problem with the shuttle was that it should do everything. \n\nSome of the older designs for shuttle makes more sense. \n\nFirst the tasks it should do, drop the huge cargo capacity, it can be done cheaper with an reusable first stage. \n\nKeep an small cargo bay who can have various equipment. For an run to an space station you have an module for pressurized cargo rest of the bay is for unpressurized cargo, this might be stuff for external use on space station or secondary payload. Another setup is eva facilities and an smaller version of the space shuttles arm, this is for repair and assembly. Yes the arm will put requirement on the bay and back section.\n\nNow to launch this use an reusable first stage Falcon 9 style, second stage engines on shuttle and keep the drop tank, as the shuttle is smaller and only burn during the second \n\nstage the tank will be smaller. Now you have an reusable platform who just drop the fairing and the drop tank.\n\nBenefit of an shuttle design is that you can reuse engines on second stage, an combined dragon and second stage is not practical.\n\nIt might be an idea to have some main engine fuel in the shuttle too, escape system and circulate but not sure how practical this is.\n\nother option would be to put it on the first too second stage interstage so escape booster would return with first stage, something like dream chaser uses.\n\nYou would need another system to eject the tank. \n\nOther benefit is that you could use the first stage with an normal second stage for heavy payloads. An unpressurized version of this shuttle might make sense as an satellite launcher too because of the high degree of reuseability but the upper stage dry weight and limited cargo space might spoil this."},{"CreatedByName":"Tommygun","CreatedById":41293,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T09:56:10Z","Content":"With current technology a space plane does not make any sense other than as a research tool for future space plane technology.\n\nIf we get to a point where we can reasonably safely launch and recover a spacecraft on a daily basis at an affordable price, then there may be an opportunity for a space plane.\n\nIf you want to launch and recover somewhat close to a city, then a winded space plane may be more desirable.\n\nI\u0027m imagining something like Skylon that doesn\u0027t take off and land with roaring rocket motors.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-06T23:23:42Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2015 11:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tommygun**"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T13:46:10Z","Content":"It will depends how efficient and out of the box might be the design.\n\nIf skylon works.. that will be the design to follow.\n\nI personally dont see any benefic to launch these aerodynamic wing shapes with normal rockets, you get enoght drawback in the launch to make the land benefic pointless."},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T14:20:40Z","Content":"Replacing parts and space rating the whole craft again will be as expensive as building a new one, but with the costs, draw backs and legacy problems of the old one.

I consider a small shuttle to be nothing more but a winged pod. A bigger version like the NASA\u0027s space shuttle is one approach for a second stage recovery (not full recovery of course). I don\u0027t see why the basic concept is such a bad idea. Of course there were many problems with the final design, some of them as a rsult of decisions that didn\u0027t follow the initial idea to reduce the costs per launch. Too many capabilities and the real price of recovery are a big part of the problem. The originally expected price of a shuttle mission wasn\u0027t too bad, it just wasn\u0027t possible to get even close to those expectations.\n\nLike others mentioned, a reusable first stage with sane recovery costs could make the whole design a lot more economic. The shuttles SRB\u0027s \n\nturned out to be very expensive to reuse and landing equipment in the ocean isn\u0027t the best approach to minimise costs (salt water does bad things to your shiny high tech equipment...)\n\nThe external tank turned out to be not cheap at all, but I don\u0027t see how that part could be avoided on heavy shuttles without building something like a buran (which is arguably even less economical, cause I don\u0027t see a way to recover something the size of an energija). Maybe this gets less of a problem with a more specialised -\u003E lighter shuttle. But I won\u0027t bet on it and in the end, not even space x will be capable of reusing second stages within the next years (more likely the next decade).\n\nAnd finally, the shuttle\u0027s heat shield was an aspect that definetly needs to be worked on. If a similar design should ever be considered, the maintenace costs need to be reduced significantly. There is an interesting concept that has been tested by the DLR (german govermental aerospace organisation, partner/member of ESA) called SHEFEX. It\u0027s basic idea is to minimise the variants and shapes of panels used in a reentry system. The space shuttle used a vast number of very specific parts which resulted in high costs and very limited on board repair capabilities."},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T09:38:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The only reason I can see to have a shuttle is for if one day we decide to have a women carry a baby to term in weightlessness.

According to them, something was destroyed. But this doesn\u0027t prevent a shuttle. It just won\u0027t be the same.\n\nA bit vague, eh? For the Shuttle, the tooling and facilities were destroyed or converted to build the SLS. You could rebuild the tooling, but at that stage you might as well make the tooling for a completely new design.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E For Apollo, they just forgot about it...\n\nNo they didn\u0027t, it\u0027s an urban legend that \u0022blueprints were lost\u0022. The Apollo-Saturn or STS vehicles were made of thousands of components that are likely still in the archives of contractors and NASA somewhere. The thing is, even if you had the blueprints for each part, they would be useless because the industrial environment is too different. First, you\u0027d have trouble just finding a microcard reader or a working tape drive to read the files. And then we don\u0027t use the same manufacturing techniques or materials nowadays as we did in the 60\u0027s during Apollo, or in the 70\u0027s during Shuttle. You would have to manually convert blueprints to CAD files and redesign each part. Again, at that stage it\u0027s better to start from scratch.\n\nNow, to answer the OP, given that the Shuttle was a money pit for NASA, it would make no sense for a private company to operate one either.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-07T11:51:51Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2015 11:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31**"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T11:18:54Z","Content":"The main problem is economic viability.
