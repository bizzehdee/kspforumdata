Weird, huh?\n\nWell there is infrared and ultraviolet. First one gives the sensation of heat, the second one gives you tan and sterilized surfaces.\n\nIn your case, you used a makeshift filter that blocks almost 0% of infrared radiation, meaning the transmittance was almost 100%.\n\nIn simple words, you were comfortanly watching the photosphere deprived of visible rays so your eyes didn\u0027t feel the need to close their eyelids, while the heat rays were unshielded, entering your eye and giving you a retinal sunburn.\n\n**Go to your doctor.

One day you\u0027ll find yourself being unable to read. What you see is not exactly what the retina sends to the brain. You see the image brain has patched up for you.\n\nI urge you to go to the doctor to perform an emergency retinal examination using a slit lamp. This is not a matter of polite concern. I\u0027m urging you to go because, based on what I\u0027ve read about your viewing techniques, retinal damage is basically 100% certain.\n\nThere are certain emergency remedies to alleviate inflamation, but it has to be done urgently. It can not wait for a few days. It\u0027s a matter of your vision. You don\u0027t want such disability.\n\nYou\u0027re talking about dimming, and I\u0027m telling you it\u0027s not about visible light. Shields you were using have pathetic infrared absorption and you can\u0027t see that because people don\u0027t see heat rays.
