You seem to be jumping between jets produced by a stellar remnant black hole to the ones spewed out by active galactic nuclei, which are millions to billions of times more massive.

That theory is a swiss cheese and thanks for pointing out the possible holes in it.\u00A0 I thought i mentioned in there that very large jets shooting out from the center of galaxy creates new galaxy but jets happening inside spiral galaxy will produce cometary knots of smaller size that break down into star systems.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think Newton was right when he pointed out that energy/pressure cant be neither destroyed or created,only transformed/converted from one wavelengths to other,or from one medium to other etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe torus in the center of each spiral galaxy is the transformer that breaks down the concentrated pressure areas/elements.The bigger/heavier the element the bigger the amount of pressure it contains.And when it is ripped open in accreation disk it will expand. If you look at it through particle or aether model,result is rather same . Stuff gets unpacked in accreation disk and that stuff will demand more space for itself.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo that when jets get created and in the end point of that jet it will get packed together (if the jet is made from hydrogen as you pointed out then hydrogen fusion,followed by alpha process that is followed by triple alpha process).\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen the jet slams into itself ,like an outstretched rubber band folds into itself,thats when heavy elements get created,aka supernova ,small areas of pressure get concentrated into small space. Thats the only kind of \u0022supernova\u0022 i tend to believe. If it is the oldest star on the edge of an non-spiral galaxy then in 99% of times we are looking at an end point of astrophysical jet and all the interstellar medium next to it came from it. think Zwicky was wrong\u00A0 about \u0022the dunky matter\u0022,what are supernovae and neutron stars . I do suggest to take a look at the universe through this point of view where all white dwarves,red giants,magnetars/pulsars and neutron stars and their collisions are all end points of astrophysical jet at different stages. When they are on the same plane than us and pointing at us then we dont see the jet behind them . And that should also be taken into consideration when flipping through different images of universe - are they composition of different telescopes (radio and x-ray for example) then we might be looking at 2 different phases of jet\u0027s end point overlapped.Its like 2 images taken some time apart overlapped. And also where its pointing ,how much of information comes to our direction and how much of it might be going in some other direction.Like in case of pulsars we would need an enormous antenna to capture its full wavelength for it to stop being a pulsar because we only capture a part of the radiowave that got created by the spinning jet.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt gives such an logical explanation to most mysteries of space so thats why i think\u00A0 more people should take a look at this model.Like why red giants throw their atmosphere out non-symmetrically (jet entering triple alpha collision phase)\u00A0 or why neutron stars \u0022explode\u0022 non-symmetrically (jets starting point and end slamming together) etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\n5 years ago i started playing Kerbal and shortly after\u00A0 i started to learn alot about universe,history of rocketry etc.I\u00A0 watched almost all Scott Manly videos at some point lol .I went through history of space exploration,history of rocketry ,history of science etc.Took quite some time to get accustomed to electricity,history and both particle and aether model.Kerbal and its mods ,specially KSPIE helped alot.It takes 20 minutes to launch my game because of all the mods but it is worth it .Just to show that im no stranger to kerbal,only to it\u0027s community.Still many gaps to fill in my pool of knowledge so thats why constructive critisism and help with this theory is very much appreciated.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nI dont get to use internet much these days so it might take some time until i reply .And thats why this reply also took some time.Sry abot that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-20T22:51:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224262818\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022215090\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221679335768\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022227839\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jaak\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, Jaak said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you point out the bragging part ?
