S MARTIN / S MARTIN\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDECRYPTION - The Europeans are torn apart over public aid for the operation of Ariane 6. Berlin and Rome want to put an end to ArianeGroup\u0027s monopoly in heavy launchers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is a summit of European space ministers, accompanied by a council of the European Space Agency (ESA), which will be held on November 6 and 7 in Seville, Spain. In the background, the unprecedented European rocket crisis. Europe no longer has independent access to space. Ariane 6, four years late, will not fly before 2024. It is therefore not yet ready to take over from Ariane 5, which carried out its final mission last July.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVega C, the new version of the small Italian Vega rocket, is unavailable until the end of next year, since the failure of its first commercial mission at the end of 2022. And it is no longer possible to count on Soyuz, since the cessation of cooperation with Russia, in the wake of the aggression of Ukraine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRethinking European strategy\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHence the urgency to fundamentally rethink the European strategy in terms of space transport. And, in the short term, to do everything possible to make Ariane 6 a success, by agreeing on its operating conditions. These have given rise, for weeks, to a standoff between the 13 ESA member states out of 22, which finance the program, and ArianeGroup, the prime contractor for Ariane 6, as well as its subcontractors. . The industry is in fact calling for a reassessment of public support, in order to balance the operation of the new rocket. In short: a substantial annual subsidy so as not to lose money on the commercial market. ArianeGroup is asking for 350 million per year, more than double the amount granted in 2021.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso read|Space tourism, giant rockets, constellations... The rush for the stars is causing risks to explode\u2060\uE900\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, when Ariane 6 was launched in 2014, ESA and Cnes (National Center for Space Studies), to which the European agency had until now delegated project management of the Ariane rockets, had agreed to leave this responsibility of project management at ArianeGroup, just created by Airbus and Safran. In return, the latter had promised to no longer request public support for exploitation. \u201CIndustrialists have not kept this commitment and have requested public support from 2021,\u201D specifies Toni Tolker-Nielsen, director of space transport at ESA.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn 2021, we estimated the need for Ariane 6 at 140 million per year for a launch rate of 9 rockets per year.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nToni Tolker-Nielsen, director of space transportation at ESA\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRequest accepted due to a profound change in the market since 2014, with the rise of SpaceX, which slashed prices with the Falcon 9 launcher, and the arrival of high-speed internet constellations. Without forgetting the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201CIn 2021, we estimated the need for Ariane 6 at 140 million per year for a launch rate of 9 rockets per year,\u201D specifies the director of space transport at ESA. This help covers the first 16 missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rule of geographic return\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince then, manufacturers have had to deal with the return of inflation, the rise in energy prices and the additional costs linked to Ariane 6 delays. \u201CAs it is not possible to pass on the entirety of inflation on commercial customers, States are once again called to the rescue,\u201D summarizes Toni Tolker-Nielsen of the ESA. The fact remains that the 13 states do not want to sign a blank check. In particular France and Germany, the two biggest contributors to the Ariane 6 program, from which their industry captures the largest benefits. \u201CIndustrialists from these two countries share 50% and 20% respectively of the added value of Ariane 6,\u201D specifies the ESA. \u201CThere will be no new subsidy without compensation. It will be give and take,\u201D we summarize.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nESA requires an effort to reduce industrial costs. According to our information, ArianeGroup has accepted \u201Ca double-digit reduction in its costs.\u201D Negotiations are proving more difficult with the 600 European subcontractors. They are protected by the Geographic Return (GEO) rule, which states that each State contributing to a program receives a workload aligned with its financial commitment. This benefits its manufacturers, without ArianeGroup being able to choose them or negotiate prices. \u201CCertain price increases made by suppliers are not justified. They must make an effort adapted to their size,\u201D emphasizes Toni Tolker-Nielsen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso read|Francis Rocard: \u201CThe objective of landing men on the Moon in 2025 with Starship seems unrealistic\u201D\u2060\uE900\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ESA also requires new governance which gives it the right to review and audit Ariane 6. This is to ensure that all manufacturers respect a fair price policy. And that Ariane 6 is not sold off on the commercial market, to the detriment of institutional customers. The ESA, the European Commission, Eumetsat, which operates the weather satellites, and the States have already agreed to pay more than commercial satellite operators. The Europeans have adopted the same logic as NASA and the Pentagon, who often buy their launches twice as much, so that SpaceX is ultra-competitive on the commercial market. It is therefore via a massive and overpaid public order that SpaceX is in reality also subsidized. The American institutional market is in fact five times larger than the European one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPrice and competition\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, on the Old Continent, \u201Cthe institutional prices defined in 2021, which have not increased since with significant inflation, cover the launch costs, no more\u201D, specifies Toni Tolker-Nielsen, of the ESA. However, if the price charged to institutional clients increases further, they will be tempted to turn to American, Indian or Japanese rockets. In the absence of an equivalent to the Buy American Act, a federal law that came into force in\u2026 1933, European countries are not obliged to buy Ariane 6, which they nevertheless finance! A grotesque situation. Berlin has never been without it: in April 2021, an observation satellite was entrusted to SpaceX, to the detriment of Ariane\u200A5.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe German Spectrum mini-launcher. Isar Aerospace\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ESA hopes to reach an agreement on the operation of Ariane\u200A6 (subsidy, cost reduction, new governance) by next Monday. This new psychodrama around Ariane 6 makes it more necessary than ever to overhaul the space transport strategy. Germany, which dreams of taking leadership from France in heavy launchers, sees this as an opportunity to obtain the introduction of intra-European competition on this market. Which, in the eyes of several specialists, would create emulation beneficial to innovation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0France is not afraid of competition, it draws on decades of expertise in a complex and risky industry\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClose to ArianeGroup\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn mid-2021, Berlin has already obtained a competitive bid from Paris in the mini and microlauncher segment. ArianeGroup immediately reacted by creating a new entity, MaiaSpace, in start-up mode, with the mission of developing a mini-launcher, ready to fly in 2025. And starting point for a new family of rockets. \u201CFrance is not afraid of competition, it draws on decades of expertise in a complex and risky industry. But it requires its corollary: total freedom for the industry, which was not the case for Ariane\u200A6, whose difficulties can be explained by maintaining the geographical return,\u201D explains a person close to ArianeGroup.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso read|\u201CEurope\u2019s spatial disconnection\u201D\u2060\uE900\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAcross the Rhine, where it is repeated that the historic manufacturer has not kept its cost and deadline commitments, Berlin is counting on Isar Aerospace or RFA to take the lead. The German outsiders are developing mini-rockets which are expected to give rise to a range of increasingly powerful launchers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Italian rocket Vega E. Jacky Huart\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn its fight, Germany is joined by Italy. Avio, the manufacturer of Vega, has, on good authority, received the creation of MaiaSpace very poorly. \u201CA decision taken against Italy, aiming to do without Vega rockets,\u201D according to a person close to the Italian group. The latter is developing Vega E, a version 20% more powerful than VegaC, which is due to make its first flight in 2026. It will be a direct competitor to one of the two versions of Ariane 6. This encourages Rome to regain its independence commercial. So no longer go through Arianespace, which markets European rockets, revealed La Tribune at the end of October. In order to calm things down and get Avio on board in preparing for the future, he was asked to become a shareholder in MaiaSpace. Proposal declined at this stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAriane\u200A6 delays and difficulties\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor its part, the ESA has decided to rethink its role. The delays and difficulties of Ariane\u200A6 \u201Cshow that the next launchers will have to be developed in a radically different framework from the one we know today,\u201D predicted, in the spring, Philippe Baptiste, president of Cnes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShould rockets be taken out of the ESA framework? The idea is promoted by certain manufacturers. From a very good source, launchers should be considered as objects of sovereignty, treated at community level by the European Commission, and not by the ESA. Brussels has already equipped the Union with strategic infrastructure with Galileo (navigation and positioning) in order to free itself from American GPS, Copernicus, the world number one in Earth observation, and the future Iris2 constellation. However, there is no consensus on this path. Or should the ESA be transformed into a real EU agency, modeled on NASA, which buys rockets and manned capsules without getting involved in their design?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso read|The European space elite joins forces to put the Iris 2 constellation into orbit\u2060\uE900\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the verge of implosion, Europe\u0027s launchers must urgently put everything back together.

When the new heavy launcher was launched in 2014, the promise was to obtain a competitive rocket, capable of do without public aid.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe are failing on this point, but we are ensuring our autonomous access to space in the long term,\u201D explains the director of CNES, Philippe Baptiste. \u201CThe operation of Ariane 6 is guaranteed, which is very good news,\u201D said ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOpen to competition from 2025\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn exchange for this new financial effort, the States, first and foremost Germany, have imposed an opening to competition in the launcher market. A first call for competition will be carried out by the European Space Agency (ESA) from 2025 for small launchers, while the Ariane 6 succession will be put into competition a few years later.\u003Cbr\u003E\nREAD ALSO:\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith Euclid, Europe wants to unlock the secret of the invisible\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor ArianeGroup and its subcontractors, this is a great relief. Faced with inflation, rising energy prices, American competitive pressure and accumulated delays, the economic equation negotiated in 2021 no longer held water.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe States had defined aid of 140 million euros per year until the 15th flight for the ramp-up until the end of 2026. In Seville, they agreed to finance the operation of the rocket from the 16th to the 42nd firing , which will cover the operation of the rocket between 2027 and 2029. The annual amount will be between 290 and 340 million euros maximum.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAudits and private financing\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe ESA will carry out audits in 2024, to decide on the precise amount for its 2025 budget conference, the one where States set the programs they finance for three years. The future of the small Italian launcher Vega C will also be helped to the tune of a maximum of 21 million euros per year. In both cases, manufacturers are under surveillance to verify their cost reduction efforts.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn exchange for this support, which satisfies the French government, the main contributor to Ariane 6 with a share of around 50%, the ESA must lead its revolution and open the launcher market to competition. Germany, which is pushing small launcher projects from German companies like Isar Aerospace or OHB, was the main advocate, but it was supported by a large majority of ESA member states.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe want competition that attracts private money, to strengthen Europe\u0027s total budget in space, because the difference in funding also concerns the private sector between Europe and the United States,\u201D explained Anna Christmann, coordinator of German space policy.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe future heavy launcher will be put into competition\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn 2025, ESA will select small launchers following a competition where the winners will obtain a funding package of 150 million euros.\u003Cbr\u003E\nREAD ALSO:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CEuropeans must maintain a collective effort in space\u201D, believes the boss of CNES\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI hope that the candidates will gradually come together, it would be a shame to only have a competition between nations, while the market is narrow,\u201D notes Toni Tolker-Nielsen, director of space transport at ESA.

This is far from confirmed, but it is possible that this is the subcontractor Baptiste was referring to.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://europeanspaceflight.com/cnes-boss-on-damage-control-for-arianegroup-on-ariane-6-failures/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://europeanspaceflight.com/cnes-boss-on-damage-control-for-arianegroup-on-ariane-6-failures/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0The Ariane 6 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E manufacturer demands a 60% price increase.

A lot of these projects started a few years before anyone even knew reusability was feasible and cost effective. It would be incredibly expensive to change the design 50 or 60% through development, and money doesn\u2019t exactly grow on trees when it comes to space development funding. The bottom line for a rocket is that if it can get stuff into space, it is useful and worth being worked on. It isn\u2019t like military equipment where you can radically change a design or cancel it on a whim if changing strategy and tactical situations make the piece of technology in question obsolete.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
