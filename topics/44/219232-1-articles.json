I came up against the reality that it\u0027s only running at a small fraction of the designed cargo space I set it too. I could obviously just step back the cargo space, or ....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs it possible to have a combo ram/scram jet with the igniter being the rocket engines. And does a mass ammount of rocket engines lighting it help reduce the problem with lower ignition conditions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, the idea is a ram/scramjet with the rocket igniters running at the same time instead of seperately. The normal variance of airflow happen and at low speed you just run off of the rockets until you get higher and it naturally goes faster(keeping both active or, if possible, lower the thurst of the rockets to lower fuel flow.). This from what I can tell doesn\u0027t give massive thrust from the scramjet side but would it give higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E effectively to the rocket engines allowing them great fuel efficiency over the run? Would you have to lower the airflow/fuelflow of the rockets to do this? or could you do this full blast. The other possibility is that it would simply use more fuel overall. Or would it massively increase the thrust added to it? I haven\u0027t had any luck getting through the pressure in out equations to do the math on this yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample:(very overblown example)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a ship with absolute maximum mass of 108k tons. It has a normal flight takeoff of 71,280-86,400 tons. It has 144 raptor engines(300 thrust each, I think 312.5 lbs fuel per second, 360 chamber pressure? Over the real specs.) This gives 10 minutes of flight at 144 engines and 43,200tons thrust. If I added a bypass for airflow and a giant inlet the size of the entire array or engines and had a large area in the back for it to expand from could Increase the thrust/efficiency of the rocket engines? Has this been tried before? The ship has a Drag coefficient of 0 .5 because it\u0027s big and blocky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs it possible the massive amount of engines flamed on would keep a ram/scramjet ignited regardless of conditions and that it could slowly enhance the rocket engines as it goes up? The idea would be to potentially maintain the same fuel use while enhancing the thrust or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E or both.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould this help get better overall \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and hence range?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFYI cargo space is 17,280 tons with 432,000 ft3 at 80 tons /ft3. Body weight would be aiming for 4320tons for 21600 tons non fuel weight.

I\u0027m assuming this may be very unrealistic though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternatively I could up the engines to 216(50% increase) for 64800 tons thrust and 7.5 minutes of flight time at full burn. Not sure which would be needed. Assuming either works with the bodies bad aerdynamics.

Then later transitions to scramjet and then rocket. There are research documents proposing this.
