So close, actually that it may be right under our noses. Specifically, I\u0027m talking about the Saturn moon of Titan. The reason I suggest such a close target? Simple. During the Opposition of Saturn yearly.. There is a slight increase in UFO sightings as I found out during research regarding my sighting to make sure that I wasn\u0027t seeing the ISS or some other orbiting object. These UFOs could originate from the Titan moon. Some evidence (but not fully solid) to back up can be found in some of the Saturn Radio emissions which is eerie themselves if it isn\u0027t ET. ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUaE9hoWvpQ:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUaE9hoWvpQ:) 4:39. Saturn should appear.). The radio emissions have according to some people garbled text that says some spooky words. Now. If aliens were indeed to come from Titan. They would most likely be Aquatic-based ET that could possibly breathe Titan\u0027s atmosphere and also Earth\u0027s atmosphere. This seems unlikely, but it would explain the vast majority of UFO sightings around water. Perhaps the Aquatic ET are abducting fish? Maybe they need to refill water, similar to whales? However, this blows a deep hole in to the grays theory. What if the Grays and said Aquatic-ET are rival factions that battle for Titan as a outpost of some sorts? I\u0027ll make some points in how this theory could be deemed plausible and not so plausible.\n\u003E \n\u003E **PLAUSIBLE THINGS ABOUT THE TITAN THEORY:**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - 1. *Explains UFO sightings on open sea or UFOs seen leaving from under water.*\n\u003E - 2. *Explains UFO sightings around Saturn\u0027s Opposition.*\n\u003E - 3. *Could possibly explain the Saturn Radio Emissions if the source is not from Saturn\u0027s weather patterns as originally thought.*\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E *\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9*\n\u003E \n\u003E **IMPLAUSIBLE THINGS ABOUT THE TITAN THEORY:**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - 1. *Does not explain the Grays nor the vast majority of abduction stories regarding Grays and their home in the Zeta star-region despite no exosolar planets.*\n\u003E - 2. *Does not explain UFO sightings outside of Saturn\u0027s Opposition.*\n\u003E - 3. *Does not explain previous alien theories set in history.*\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E *\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9*\n\u003E \n\u003E I know it seems quite far fetched, but worth a thought. The anatomy of said aquatic creatures could be Humanoid or resemble something like a Squid with arms. \n\u003E \n\u003E Perhaps as of now, we are in fact in the middle of a intergalactic battle that\u0027s taking place right under our noses?\n\nIf there are aliens capable of easy interplanetary travel, reactionless drives, and near perfect stealth technology, Saturn being in opposition or not isn\u0027t going to make a difference to how easy it is for them to get to earth.\n\nAdditionally, Titan\u0027s surface is at -180 degrees celsius Its seas are liquid ethane, its soil is frozen butane and tholins. Anything capable of surviving on Titan would boil alive on earth. Anything capable of surviving on earth would freeze solid on Titan. Titan\u0027s atmosphere is also almost 100% nitrogen, with trace amounts of hydrocarbons.

I just got my science card revoked for saying that, but it\u0027s true. It was much too real to be a mere hallucination and it was corroborated by other people. Not to mention the environment itself was affected. Now that being said, I don\u0027t hear something at night and immediately scream \u0022g-g-g-g-ghosts!\u0022 I am MUCH more confident that there\u0027s a rational explanation and 99.999999999999% of the time there is one. But I will NEVER deny that the 0.000000000001% DID happen.\n\nI have much the same views regarding UFOs. When I see something odd in the sky, I don\u0027t immediately go straight to \u0022its aliens\u0022 but I DID have an experience that solidified my stance on them. \n\nSo I guess I\u0027m trying to say that I\u0027ll still ask for copious amounts of evidence when it comes to the unexplainable because that\u0027s the kind of person I am, however, as I\u0027ve had my own experiences, I\u0027m also willing to give the benefit of the doubt. \n\n------------\n\nSo now onto my UFO experience:\n\nIt was when I was just old enough to be left home alone (around 12-14ish years old). From my window, you can sometimes see airplanes landing at our local airport (its a really small airport, only puddlejumpers fly in and out). I didn\u0027t live in town at the time, so I\u0027ll admit, it wasn\u0027t the best view. \n\nOne night I was home alone and I looked out the window just as a plane was coming in. It was dark enough that you couldn\u0027t actually see the plane itself, just the flashing wing-tip lights. I watched it sink below the tree lines and disappear. Then, just a few minutes later as I walked past the window again, I saw another plane (or the same one, I dunno) take off from the airport.\n\nBut there was this red light following it. Disconnected from the plane, like a bulb attached to a string, and in fact that\u0027s what I thought it was: a streamer of some kind with a light on the end. It followed the plane EXACTLY. Same flight path, same rise and fall in altitude. Same twists and turns.\n\nThe plane flew in a circular pattern over the airport for a really long time, which isn\u0027t something that needs to happen as I said above, the airport is small. Just single-engine propeller planes, no jets and certainly no crowded airspace: usually just one or two planes arrive/leave a day.\n\nThen the plane landed.\n\nThe light didn\u0027t.\n\nThe light hovered over the airport for what seemed like ages. Then it shot across the sky horizontally until I couldn\u0027t see it anymore. Up until this point, I didn\u0027t really think aliens or UFOs I just thought \u0022that\u0027s odd.\u0022 But when it shot across the sky in the manner that it did, leaving a visible streak of red light behind it, the sheer SPEED that whatever it was moved at was what brought me to the conclusion that whatever I was looking at was not man made. Couldn\u0027t be.\n\nNothing we have can hover and then cover a distance that large in the span of a single second.\n\nThis experience, however grounded in superstitious belief and lack of any real tangible evidence, is single-handedly responsible for my interest in space.\n\nWhich kind of sucks, because whenever people ask me why I\u0027m so interested in sciences and how things work, the only real answer I can give them is because I\u0027ve experienced things that SHOULD be impossible. Science says ghosts don\u0027t exist, and I am a man of science. Science says Aliens have never been here, and I am a man of science.\n\nBut I can\u0027t deny what I\u0027ve experienced.\n\n--------\n\nSimilarily, I refuse to believe in a god because not only is there NO evidence of one, but being raised in religion I found that there was nothing to experience myself. I tried many many times to get some kind of confirmation of angels, demons, god himself and never once found anything that wasn\u0027t the doing of some person out there.\n\nSo, and this is very strange for me to admit, I maintain that science is the end-all, be-all of everything and more or less live by the facts and yet I accept that ghosts and aliens exist unconditionally because of my own experiences, however I absolutely REFUTE god every single time.\n\nSomething\u0027s wrong with me on that.

We were heading north from a race in Mexico, and since the race was over and we were just delivering the boat back home, there were only three of us aboard. I had a shift one night from about Midnight to about 4am or so, and I was the only one on deck at the time.\n\nMost of the shift had gone normally... not much to see at night out there. Some occasional splashing and such from fish and waves, but nothing unusual.\n\nAt some point, I found myself looking up at the sky off the coast, and noticed some red lights cruising northward, same direction as us. At first, it seemed normal... Camp Pendelton (a Marine/Navy base) is nearby, and I\u0027ve seen helicopters, planes, ships, etc all the time out there. I figured it was one of those.\n\nEvery once in a while, I\u0027d notice that it would stop and appear to hover over a spot of water, then shine what looked like a really bright reddish light into the water for a few moments, and then it would turn it off and continue on it\u0027s path. I figured it was a helicopter performing some search and rescue drills. That is, until it stopped again and turned the light on. It sat there for a few moments, and without turning off the light, appeared to zoom off, southward, very very quickly. Like, the speed a jet would take off. From an apparent standstill.\n\nI told my Dad about it (he\u0027s sailed in this area since he was a kid many many years ago) and he seemed to think it was likely an experimental aircraft from Pendelton. I don\u0027t know what I saw, but whatever it was, it sure wasn\u0027t concerned about us.\n\nAs much as I like to believe aliens have already visited us and are helping somewhat to progress our technology, I think that any race that advanced would know how to avoid being seen. I\u0027m a firm believer that most UFOs are experimental aircraft, but I have no doubt that non-terrestrial craft have been spotted before.\n\nEdit: Another note to make it a little weirder - I don\u0027t remember hearing any *whoomph whoomph* of helicopter blades or anything, though that sound should travel pretty far over (mostly flat) water.

Anything capable of surviving on Titan would boil alive on earth. Anything capable of surviving on earth would freeze solid on Titan. Titan\u0027s atmosphere is also almost 100% nitrogen, with trace amounts of hydrocarbons. It is unlikely that anything could breathe it, given the chemical stability of molecular nitrogen.\n\nYou make good points, I wasn\u0027t saying for sure that it was so. I\u0027m just saying it\u0027s something that could be considered.\n\nFor starters, let\u0027s call in the different UFO\u0027s that people have seen. People have seen the traditional original flying saucer and black triangle and various other saucer craft. Saucer shaped craft are still spotted today, along with the black triangle. This calls in to question; who is flying the saucer and who is flying the black triangle?\n\nPerhaps if aliens were to exist on Titan that somehow exist given your points, they may not be as advanced as we think and they use a old traditional saucer while the Grays use a newer, more advanced craft (black triangle)?\n\nIt\u0027s not impossible that there is alien civilizations that have not mastered the flying saucer or rather designed the right one.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E We sent a probe to Titan, we have been watching Titan with Cassini.

I mean, we\u0027ve seen some of the lake but not a whole lot."}]}
