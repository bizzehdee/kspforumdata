I read the definition, and I don;t see any mention of trojans, or in fact any co-orbital bodies, just \u0022neighborhood.\u0022 \n\u003E Better to say \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B5 must be \u003E100 or something.\n\u003E \n\u003E - - - Updated - - -\n\u003E \n\u003E They are in jupiter\u0027s neighborhood, are they not? They orbit the sun, right? What does the definition say? Nothing.\n\u003E \n\u003E Like I said, imprecise.\n\nThird time I\u0027ve said this, but \u0022clearing the neighbourhood\u0022 doesn\u0027t mean that nothing comes near to something\u0027s orbit, ever. It is a measure of whether something is likely to become gravitationally dominant over its orbit in less than a Hubble Time. The term \u0022clearing\u0022 is a little misleading, but the problem is mainly people refusing to find out what it actually refers to.\n\nLarger objects with smaller orbits and fewer things crossing them have a greater power to clear their orbits, and therefore have a greater Stern-Levison parameter, which is mathematically well-defined.\n\nEarth has things that share its orbit. There\u0027s the moon, which orbits around us. There\u0027s 2010TK7, which is the only known Earth Trojan. There\u0027s Cruithne, which is a quasi-satellite of earth, locked in an orbital resonance. Earth is gravitationally dominant over all of these bodies. Any earth-crossing bodies, asteroids such as Apophis, have their orbits perturbed by Earth, until eventually they will be forced into a stable resonance, or ejected from earth\u0027s orbit.\n\nThe Stern-Levison parameter is, in part, a measure of how quickly this is likely to happen.\n\nAs Pluto is far out, and also shares its orbit with a huge body like Neptune, it is extremely unlikely to become gravitationally dominant over its orbit.\n\nAlthough Ceres is very small, it will tend to have these effects on all of the asteroids that share its orbit. However, due to its small mass, the orbit-clearing effect is very, very slow, and will take over the lifetime of the universe to happen, therefore it is not gravitationally dominant.\n\nMercury, although small, has a small, fast orbit, so perturbs objects around it more quickly. It also doesn\u0027t have the supply of Mercury-crossing objects replenished as quickly as further-out planets, as Jupiter is less likely to throw stuff at it.\n\nAs for hydrostatic equilibrium, it is not based on pure \u0022roundness\u0022, as any object can be coincidentally quite round, it is based on the gravity and mechanical strength of the body. If the body is round because of coincidence or design, it is not in hydrostatic equilibrium, it is just round. Hydrostatic equilibrium occurs when the material of which the body is made is not strong enough to stop its gravity collapsing it into a sphere with less than a certain amount of aberration. For rock, ice, and gas, this value is measured in hundreds of kilometres. Under certain conditions, you could probably get a sphere of liquid mercury with a diameter of a few hundred to a few thousand metres, but that is extremely unlikely, and probably not stable over planetary timescales. Unlikely enough that we absolutely don\u0027t need to tear up the rulebook in order to account for it."},{"CreatedByName":"rtxoff","CreatedById":107622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T10:41:58Z","Content":"I really don\u0027t understand why this is still a subject, after discussing it already in a few threads one would think that this topic is over.

If that is what they mean, then use it in the definition. That\u0027s the *point* of a definition.\n\nI am arguing the definition is crap, and it unambiguously is. If you need to bring in any outside ideas to make sense of the definition, it\u0027s a bad definition. \n\nChange (1) to (my changes **bold**):\n\n1) A planet [1] is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around **a** **star**, (![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape **(add in the required maximum eccentricity to count, because math)**, and \u00A9 has **an S-L parameter \u003E1**.\n\nThere, was that hard?\n\n(note that you\u0027d still get people arguing that \u003E1 part, what about \u003E0.99, or another, arbitrary value. Such definitions are always arbitrary, it\u0027s for \u0022bookkeeping,\u0022 not because there is necessarily physicality involved, and that is fine, we what a manageable number of major bodies to concern ourselves with.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-17T17:06:58Z\u0022 title=\u002207/17/2015 05:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tater**"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T17:05:54Z","Content":"Tater isn\u0027t arguing that an S-L parameter of 1 isn\u0027t a good cutoff (well\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6at least not in that post).
