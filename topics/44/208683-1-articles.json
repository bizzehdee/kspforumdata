I suppose people assume that a handheld laser pointer consists of a tiny flashlight and a complex array of mirrors that turns the diffuse flashlight rays into a parallel stream of light. But that is not the case at all. The light coming out of a laser pointer did not originate from a tiny flashlight or other conventional light source.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do mercury lamps, lightning bugs, an old-fashioned TVs have in common? One thing: fluorescence. Numerous elements and chemicals have the ability to absorb energy (in the form of heat, electricity, chemical reactions, or high-frequency light) and then radiate it out as low-frequency light. Even your skin has this capability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLasers do use mirrors, but they use mirrors to trap light, not focus it. Lasers consist of a fluorescent material which is placed in a mirrored cavity such that only a specific wavelength of fluorescent light can escape. The material is then \u201Cpumped\u201D full of energy from an outside source, producing a perfectly parallel beam of escaping fluorescent light.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, you could certainly use mirrors to focus sunlight to provide the \u201Cpumping\u201D mechanism for a laser. But the laser itself needs to be made of some fluorescent gain medium material.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HvP","CreatedById":146104,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-22T15:37:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157695-sevenperforce/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022157695\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157695-sevenperforce/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@sevenperforce\u003C/a\u003E It sounds like you\u0027re describing light amplification by the stimulated emission of radiation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-22T15:52:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn\u00A0 other words, what you want is a solar sail (directly absorbing the momentum of the solar energy).\u00A0 Using the solar energy to pump a laser makes no sense.\u00A0 Even the laser bit makes no sense, you\u0027d be better off with high efficiency blue(ish) LEDs.\u00A0 You want the momentum, and coherence doesn\u0027t buy you any.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd as far as \u0022light powered rockets\u0022 the two possible uses are: lifting off a planet with abundant energy (so the rocket doesn\u0027t carry its engine and fuel) and interstellar travel (because the Isp of light is near infinity).\u00A0 The energy efficiency is so bad you\u0027d never use it to travel between planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-22T15:58:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe solar-powered beam energy transfer was possible in KSPI-E long ago for propulsion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy shouldn\u0027t it be irl?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-22T18:02:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224147661\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208683\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221655913160\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022133850\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022wumpus\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, wumpus said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn\u00A0 other words, what you want is a solar sail (directly absorbing the momentum of the solar energy).\u00A0 Using the solar energy to pump a laser makes no sense.\u00A0 Even the laser bit makes no sense, you\u0027d be better off with high efficiency blue(ish) LEDs.\u00A0 You want the momentum, and coherence doesn\u0027t buy you any.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd as far as \u0022light powered rockets\u0022 the two possible uses are: lifting off a planet with abundant energy (so the rocket doesn\u0027t carry its engine and fuel) and interstellar travel (because the Isp of light is near infinity).\u00A0 The energy efficiency is so bad you\u0027d never use it to travel between planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat seems a bit harsh. Laser boosted solar sails have a pretty impeccable pedigree in sci-fi - okay the coherence doesn\u0027t help you but the low dispersion over distance does.\u00A0 Similarly, beamed power for interplanetary flight - at least for the outward journey - sounds fine to me.\u00A0 Solar pumped lasers aren\u0027t terribly efficient, as you say,\u00A0 but on the other hand, there\u0027s plenty of room in space to build lots of inefficient lasers and make up with quantity what each individual laser lacks in quality. Or heck, given that we have some leeway because this is fiction, I can imagine us developing vastly more efficient lasers well before we develop other space\u00A0 propulsion systems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor clarity, when I\u0027m thinking about beamed power, I\u0027m thinking about using a laser to heat propellant at a distance. Much like a nuclear-thermal rocket except that the propellant is passed through a plain block of metal - which is heated by the beam - rather than a nuclear reactor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you haven\u0027t got fusion and fission is a no-no, then beamed power based on orbital solar pumped lasers seems like a reasonable, if infrastructure heavy, sci-fi propulsion system to supplement chemical propulsion.
