Like a ramjet, they consist of an inlet, a combustor, and a nozzle. The primary difference between ramjets and scramjets is that scramjets do not slow the oncoming airflow to subsonic speeds for combustion, they use supersonic combustion instead. The name \u0022scramjet\u0022 comes from \u0022supersonic combusting ramjet.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewell, we already \u0022have\u0022 a turbo ramjet engine*, why not a turbo scramjet**?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit runs at MACH 6, so must be really fast eh? of course! it goes hypersonic!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eanyway, its just like a turbo ramjet. put a scramjet in front of (an after-burning) turbojet and you\u0027re done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emy question is, will it work?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(yeah, about the * and **)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Pratt and Whitney J-58\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E**Boeing X-51\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Porkjet","CreatedById":92433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-31T09:21:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELockheed\u0027s trying to built something like that\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/lockheed/us/news/features/2015/sr-72/_jcr_content/center_content/image_3.img.jpg/1400599103878.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221400599103878.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENoone can say if it\u0027ll ever work\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-31T11:13:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell I think the only IRL \u0022turboramjet\u0022 engine is the Pratt \u0026amp; Whitney J58 that powered the SR-71 spyplane. And that adopts a relatively simple approach where the \u0022ramjet\u0022 is just the turbojet\u0027s afterburner.

That means you need to support (subsonic) ramjet as well as scramjet propulsion, making things even more difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd however you lay things out - as one engine like the J58, as two separate engines, or partly combined like the picture above, you\u0027ve still got the weight and complexity of turbojet machinery to lug about.
