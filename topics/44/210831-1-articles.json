I\u2019m hoping to reach out to anyone who may be able to shed some light on it. I had a thought come up and I don\u2019t exactly know how to talk about it but I\u2019m going to try. You are sitting at your desk playing Ksp. You have a long wait time for a transfer window. You could wait the remaining time or use time warp. You choose to accelerate the simulation to the point in time where the transfer window exists. Here comes the fun part. For that time the simulation was under time warp, you and the simulation were in two different frames of reference. To you, not much time has passed, but for the Kerbal, it has been years. So here is the big question, given the kerbals reference frame, would the Kerbal be able to tell it was accelerating through time? From the kerbals point of view the outside observer has not aged one bit and yet it has been years for the Kerbal. I am ignoring the fact that kerbals don\u2019t age as they experience movement through time by observing the motion of their solar system over time. Looking at the bigger picture, if we were the kerbals unknowingly accelerating through the 4th dimension, would we be able to tell? I don\u2019t think we would because we would be in an accelerating reference frame with nothing to compare our passing though time against. I would love to get some response from anyone who could even remotely follow my thought process. I know the mods have to approve this and if you read this far could you try and push it please? That would be great thanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-August\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xelo","CreatedById":218744,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-27T15:44:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf a hypothetical god ran a space program on earth would we be able to tell if they are moving in a slower time-frame?\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs a kerbal, to know the current \u0027time warp\u0027 you would have to measure god (the player) themselves as a reference.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo can they measure the player?

The reason is that our computer runs the simulation at a fixed rate relative to our time, but this rate can change relative to the kerbals\u0027 time.

I don\u2019t think that the stuttering would be invisible, because the kerbals do speed up when, for example, walking under time warp. If their consciousness slowed down to account for the time stretching, they would notice everything moving several times as fast, and their own actions such as walking would speed up as well. So some biological marvel is allowing them to either bypass Klanck time or make their brains do the same things on less cycles.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-27T21:01:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs this question isn\u2019t about KSP2 specifically, it has been moved somewhere more appropriate.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
