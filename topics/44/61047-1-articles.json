Not a pretty sight and it makes you develop a repulsion towards some kinds of animal meats when you need to prepare them for food. The smell is sometimes quite similar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dispatcher\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dispatcher\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGood luck finding anything that your body is able to digest and successful absorb the nutrients from. Life on earth is adapted to what it can \u0022eat\u0022. The ecologies of worlds at other stars would likely be so different that it would make no sense to eat any native life there; unless its on a dare.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrue, it is possible that the proteins, carbohydrates and fats on another world would be such that their monomers (aminoacids, sugars) would not be suitable as building blocks of our body or they could be downright acutely toxic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Tetrapeptide_structural_formulae_v.1.png/350px-Tetrapeptide_structural_formulae_v.1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022350px-Tetrapeptide_structural_formulae_v.1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this tetrapeptide, each aminoacid could be slightly different. It might even be the same aminoacids as we use, but chirally opposite. We use left-oriented aminoacids. Right-oriented would not be used by our metabolism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe wouldn\u0027t be able to use the tissue and it would be a pain in the ass for our enzymes and protein channels to transport it around. Even if modified aminoacid somehow gets stuffed by synthesis into our protein (let\u0027s say a structural one, or a DNA-related enzyme) the protein would be defective, a recipe for chronic disease at best. Painful death over several days would be likely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor most cases, I think the body would not be able to absorb the stuff and our poop would be large in quantity, milky and fluid in appearance.
