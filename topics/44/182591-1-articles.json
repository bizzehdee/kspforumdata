Issue is, it\u0027s been 60 years since 1969, and those involved in creating the Saturn V and Apollo hardware had started to die off from old age, and often dying off without sharing the notes and details as to what little changes and details they would apply to each part of the rocket to make it work. No 2 parts were ever installed precisely the same, especially in relation to the F-1 rocket engines. They simply were too complicated and each needed tweaking by these engineers to function precisely as they desired. So as a result of their passing, we lost the crucial information required to create those parts and machines and as a result the Saturn V is exceptionally difficult to recreate. Although a theoretical Saturn VI, created using brand new technologies and modern manufacturing methods, could be feasible. It was this line of thinking, and the thinking to provide the Ares V (SLS\u0027 former identity) a higher form of thrust, so engineers created the concept of the F-1B rocket engine. Based on the F-1, the F-1B redesigned the entire rocket engine using modern manufacturing techniques and standards. Allowing them to make a far superior engine in stability (as the F-1 had a tendency to either explode due to chamber pressures and the excessively large size of the engine bell) and also cause immense vibrations to the launch vehicle structure which was the cause of the Apollo 6 mission being crippled in orbit and Apollo 13\u0027s second stage center engine\u0027s early cut off as the vibrations caused damage to the fuel lines and to the engines themselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurious Droid does an excellent video covering the details as to why the Saturn V moon rockets are so far out of reach today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/ovD0aLdRUs0?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starman4308","CreatedById":122674,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-04T04:11:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcept possibly for some specialized manufacturing techniques (for which modern, often superior alternatives exist), we still have the technology.
