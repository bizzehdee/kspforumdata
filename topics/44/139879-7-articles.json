Essentially:\u00A0the reaction produces heat, but it only starts happening at a reasonable rate at high temperatures (200\u00B0C and up). So you still need to heat the reactor all the time because even though the reaction is exothermic, you lose\u00A0heat because you are constantly evacuating the heated products and\u00A0pushing fresh, \u0022cold\u0022\u00A0reagents into the reactor.

Isomerisation means the degree to which the long carbon chains\u00A0are branched. A hydrocarbon chain can consist of just a bunch of carbons in a line with hydrogens on the edges, but it can also be a line of carbons with a bunch of other lines of carbons branching off of it, kind of like a tree or a root system. High isomerisation means a lot of branching. (this isn\u0027t really a process parameter, but it also influences the type of product you get so I included it as well)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow as to how those parameters influence your process:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe type of catalyst\u003C/strong\u003E: catalysts are usually chosen for their activity. Intuitively, you\u0027d think that high activity is good: high activity means more cracking which means more means more long-chainers broken down to short chains. Problem is that while this is true, your catalysts don\u0027t stop there.\u00A0They\u0027ll crack everything they can get their hands on, including those nice new medium-length chains you just made. Therefore, current catalysts almost always have a trade-off: high activity means lots of stuff cracked but low selectivity (i.e. a lot of the stuff that comes out is too short and not usable) whereas lower activity means not that many long chains cracked, but more usable products. The currently used method is, if I recall correctly, to use a medium-activity catalyst, run a purification step, then another cracking and do another 2-3 consecutive\u00A0steps like that to try and turn a maximum amount of heavier fractions into usable ones. It\u0027s energy-intensive but it works. But this problem is also why researchers are trying to look for more selective catalysts that still retain a high activity\u00A0(like we looked for\u00A0in\u00A0my master thesis).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETemperature:\u003C/strong\u003E higher temperature means higher activity, more cracking (though again, often also less selective cracking) but also more coking. Coking is a problem where you essentially \u0022burn\u0022 the carbon chains and turn them into soot (\u0022cokes\u0022, in the jargon). These cokes then deposit onto the catalyst pellets and effectively clog up the pores into which the long chains insert themselves to\u00A0be cracked. So again, it\u0027s about finding the balance between activity, selectivity and coking. You can regenerate the catalyst by literally burning off the cokes, but this is also detrimental to the catalyst. The less regeneration needed, the better.\u00A0In short: high temperature means high coking, low selectivity and high activity. Low temperatures means less coking, less activity but higher selectivity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EExposure time (flowrate)\u003C/strong\u003E: As mentioned before: cracking catalysts tend to crack everything they get their hands on. So the longer a molecule spends in the reactor, the more chance it has to be cracked. by adjusting the flowrate and pushing the (gasified) long-chain molecules faster or slower through the reactor, you can favor a certain amount of cracking steps. In short: high flowrate: less cracking but also less overcracking and less useless methane produced.\u00A0Low flowrate, high cracking, but also more overcracking and more useless methane produced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EHydrogen fraction: \u003C/strong\u003E(hydro)cracking requires hydrogen: you break apart a C-C bond and stick a hydrogen on each end of the severed bond\u00A0to get C-H H-C. As with any chemical reaction, you can push the reaction to one side or the other by supplying an overabundance or shortage of one of the reagents (in this case, either long chain hydrocarbons or hydrogen gas). Lots of hydrogen means less coking and more cracking but, as always, also more over-cracking and methane production. Less hydrogen means less cracking but also more coking. You also need to take into account that hydrogen gas costs money and it also has a tendency to activate any sulfur or other impurities in the initial mixture. Sulfur gets turned into H2S-like molecules\u00A0and those absolutely murder\u00A0your catalyst. You can literally render an entire reactor useless in minutes if you run highly polluted oil through it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIsomerisation:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0A bunch of long-chain molecules which are just a single line of carbons stuck together are extremely hard to crack down the middle, they\u0027ll just fragment at the edges. As a rule of thumb: the more \u0022branches\u0022 a carbon chain has on a certain point, the easier it will break at this branching point. Because of this, the more modern processes of cracking are a two-step process: one reactor first branches (isomerizes) the long chains in the middle(ish) and the second reactor is the actual cracker, in which the long chains will be more easily be\u00A0cracked in the middle instead of at the edges,\u00A0because they have more branches down the middle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPetrochemistry is very much a story of percentages. It\u0027s almost impossible to get a nice, clean reaction A \u002B B --\u0026gt; C. It\u0027s always A \u002B B --\u0026gt; mostly C, but also a bunch of D, E and some F in various percentages. The trick is to try and get as much usable C as possible and minimise or somehow recycle the production of D, E and F.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo in answer to your question: the process parameters influence mostly the degree of cracking of the mixture.\u00A0And the degree of cracking influences whether you get short-chain gasses or medium to long-chain gasses/liquids.\u00A0Lots of activity = lots of gasses such as\u00A0methane, ethane and the like.
