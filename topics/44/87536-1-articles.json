But no matter how complicated the transfer to GEO ends up being, the point is that the moment in time chosen to start the whole affair shouldn\u0027t matter because the relative configuration between the Earth, the launch site, and the target spot in GEO never changes. There\u0027s complete time symmetry in this respect. Launching at any other time would make the whole deal look exactly the same, except rotated with respect to Earth\u0027s inertial frame -- but the point is that the target spot also rotated in that time in the exact same amount, so the whole series of maneuvers, as complicated as they are, would end up reaching the same longitude in GEO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty convinced by now that the reason for there being a launch window has nothing to do with the actual trajectory with respect to the Earth. Something else is involved here, and my only guess so far is that it has to do with the position of the Sun (which completes a revolution relative to the Earth in almost 24 hours -- that would explain why the launch windows repeat almost exactly every 24 hours, like in the SpaceX SES 8 mission example).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I found this in the Google Books preview of the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=hqhZKjLaYZUC\u0026amp;pg=PA153\u0026amp;lpg=PA153\u0026amp;dq=why\u002Blaunch\u002Bwindow\u002Bgeostationary\u002Borbit\u0026amp;source=bl\u0026amp;ots=Nav1EkeKuz\u0026amp;sig=kPCsoX4BsB4ZddikTOD3cRc7EjI\u0026amp;hl=en\u0026amp;sa=X\u0026amp;ei=2KhAVJHgA4nf8gH23YG4Cg\u0026amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage\u0026amp;q\u0026amp;f=false\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHandbook of Geostationary Orbits\u003C/a\u003E by E.M.

It defines the daily time interval allowed for launch and is usually a midday and/or midnight window, meaning that the direction from the Earth to the transfer orbit apogee is approximately aligned with the Earth/Sun direction, Figure B. The reason is that on a spin stabilised spacecraft the spin axis, which is aligned with the motor firing direction, must stay orthogonal to the Sun direction with a certain margin, for thermal reasons. A similar constraint may apply to a three-axis stabilised spacecraft, where a certain Sun-Earth geometry in a given part of the transfer orbit is imposed by the attitude control system.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould this be it ???\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/Lr65RFe\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Lr65RFel.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Lr65RFel.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-17T15:13:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: On second thoughts, this doesn\u0027t explain things after all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInclination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost real rockets aren\u0027t launched from the equator.

Think of it this way. Say they were trying to put the satellite directly above the launch point, keep it right over their space center for w/e reason. Theyd have to launch, and wait for the sat to orbit the planet, until it was just the right angle off from the target point. Then there would be a window where they could preform the burn. If they get in that window, they can make the burn and get to gso where they want.
