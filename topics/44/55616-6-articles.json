In terms of how civilizations evolve, what if becoming a space-faring race demands that we lose a lot of our \u0022jerk\u0022 tendencies to become a unified and cooperative race? Competition may simply make such a civilization impossible if we can\u0027t get over it. The things that come with that competitive edge: deception, apathy, aggression, etc, might be things that an advanced alien race wouldn\u0027t be particularly good at. So the very things that impede our progress, might also ensure we could survive an invasion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
