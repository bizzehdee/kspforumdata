That is a bit of a catch-22. I very much understand the decision not to send any instruments of this nature along and think it was the most reasonable thing to do, though if we see indeed see hard to explain structures or ones that are ambiguous we might need to send another mission that does have the instruments. I will make it clear that I am in no position to judge whether those structures are present, more knowledgeable men and women will need to look into that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI honestly doubt whether life could exist in such a place, but then again, I have been amazed by scientific discoveries before. I am hardly an expert \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis has got nothing to do with ridiculing people with new ideas.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is what people always say when they ridicule new ideas \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will repeat that I think this guy\u0027s ideas are out there, so I agree with most opinions here. He seems to be a crackpot. My point is, however, that even in science there is a lot of adherence to status quo. People even say that new ideas do not get adopted, but that the people adhering to the old ideas simply die out. This conservatism is sometimes justified, but also tends to slow down developments a bit more than necessary when looking at the evidence and facts. Every great step forward goes accompanied with a huge amount of resistance, skepticism and ridicule before it is accepted as the obvious truth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs fact finding methods go, science still has some improving to do when it comes to the culture among and between peers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"softweir","CreatedById":2795,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T19:32:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomething I\u0027d be interested to know is: what instruments could unambiguously detect life on a comet?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwi1960","CreatedById":81697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T19:49:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou say its implausible for life to exist on a comet?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe world was once thought to be flat.
