We are already starting down that path ourselves, with ever-increasing pressures on the courts to grant limited personhood to dolphins and the great apes. At risk of sounding like a broken record from a few days before, I think it is critical that we shed our racist and xenophobic past as we go into what is likely to be a post-human/trans-human era. Here\u0027s something I wrote several months ago-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWe are, quite likely, on the cusp of creating the first non-human intelligences. We know of two ways it will be possible-\u003Cp\u003EMachine intelligence- the first computers that are equal in processing power to the human brain should come online within a decade or two. After that, with the biggest roadblock to creating self-aware, sentient machines removed, the creation of a true machine intelligence becomes only a software problem. That may be understating it a bit, and it relies on the currently scientifically-accepted view of how intelligence probably works. But still, assuming the scientists are right, we are just around the corner from a computer that, running the right source code, will become the vessel of a truly sentient, self-aware, intelligent machine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenetic uplift- it is undoubtedly possible to modify the genome of a non-human animal to increase its intelligence; after all, the human brain is coded for in nothing but our DNA, so there\u0027s no reason that with, for example, some edits to the genome of the dolphin, we could create a creature that is MOSTLY dolphin, but has the intelligence of a human being or even smarter. It is certainly possible, and at the rate that the science of genetics is improving, we can even get started on creating such a creature very soon, if we chose to do so. Heck, we could start TODAY.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we likely stand on the cusp of creating the first non-human intelligences. True machine intelligence seems likely to be achieved within the next 100 years, and probably a lot sooner than that. If we can create an intelligence that is as smart as a human, there is no foreseeable reason we cannot create an intelligence that is SMARTER than a human. How will that superior intelligence view us? We want that superior intelligence to treat US with respect, and give us our freedoms and let us retain or legal personhood, don\u0027t we?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is why I feel it is extremely important to grant the most intelligent of the non-human species on this planet at least a limited form of legally-recognized personhood. I feel it is an issue that could be vital to the future human race!! After all, if we don\u0027t grant rights and personhood to those species that are just below us in terms of intelligence, how can we then expect any hypothetical superior intelligences to treat HUMANS as persons, and not \u0022just animals\u0022. It is IN OUR OWN SELF INTEREST to claim the moral high ground while we still can! If we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re going to make a super intelligence, we naturally will imbue it with moral judging power- after all, we have a strong incentive to create an intelligence that values life. If we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re going to imbue it with morals that include the respect for lesser beings (humans), it is only fair that we should demand the same behavior from ourselves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsider the view of an unbiased observer, when comparing naturally-evolved vs. intelligently designed entities, especially, say, humans vs. some hypothetical machine super intelligence. Wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t it be natural to group naturally emergent entities- those who owe their intelligence to the blind hand of Darwin- together in the same group, and set those who were actually designed with the purpose of intelligence apart? So humans would fall more easily into the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cjust an animal\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 category. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we need to set up legal protections for all sapient beings, regardless of what they are, both for the protection of non-humans AND humans.
