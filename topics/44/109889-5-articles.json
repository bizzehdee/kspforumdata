While colonization and interstellar travel are appealing, especially to those who are fascinated by space travel, as all of us are, the technology is centuries away, in my opinion. The Space Race resulted in some amazing engineering feats, and did result in some great technological innovations, our real focus in the 21st century should be developing technology to stabilize our own planet.\n\nThere is no realistic scenario where we colonize other planets, whether inside or outside of our own solar system, within this century. Yet all science points to significant and catastrophic man-made climate change on our own planet well before then.\n\nWhile interstellar travel may be possible, it is astoundingly difficult. If it is possible and profitable, I have no doubt that our species (or whatever evolutionary ancestors are around at that time) will pursue it and accomplish it. But focusing on manned interstellar (or even interplanetary) travel when we can\u0027t guarantee the survival of modern civilization in this century is astoundingly foolish.\n\nApparently, most nations do not take impending climate change seriously enough to create real solutions before it might be too late. Perhaps if the danger becomes real enough to enough people, there will be a rush to innovate and solve these problems. Interstellar travel (which is, I would estimate, tens of centuries away) will not solve these issues."},{"CreatedByName":"dansmithers","CreatedById":11592,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T21:12:34Z","Content":"Well, if Kurzweil is correct, we\u0027ll have manned\\* interstellar travel in less than 100 years\\*\\*.\n\n\\*for certain definitions of manned\n\n\\*\\*10 thousand year travel time notwithstanding"},{"CreatedByName":"baggers","CreatedById":143067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T04:47:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well, if Kurzweil is correct, we\u0027ll have manned\\* interstellar travel in less than 100 years\\*\\*.\n\u003E \\*for certain definitions of manned\n\u003E \n\u003E \\*\\*10 thousand year travel time notwithstanding\n\nIs a cryogenic coffin(\\*) and an automated pilot technically \u0022manned\u0022?\n\n\\* technologically assisted tardigrade-like cryptobiotic state.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nNote that it is a sort of travel that mean you write your last wills before.\n\nNot only because is dangerous but because you will never return, and all your relateds will be dead long before you wake up (apart the ones that sleep with you): better make your affairs in order.\n\n10.000 years is a very long times for humans: maybe nobody will remember your name on on earth, or even your mission.
