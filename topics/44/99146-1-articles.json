Basically, the station maintains an edge rotational speed to align with the transfer speed at the node. So if a traveller is coming up at a relative speed of 100m/s, the station changes the rotation speed to align with the incoming traveller, and \u0022captures\u0022 it at a low relative speed on its surface. Obviously, with this you would need precision maneuvering and timing since you only have one chance, so no humans need apply. The long travel time between nodes would be spent accelerating/decelerating the rotation to match the destination requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think it would work long-term because of perturbations though.

If you want to carry a few people and the supplies to keep them alive for the journey, we are talking about at least 20 tons (which is basically what Orion weighs). To that, you have to add the weight of the propellant for the transfer, and the extra propellant that you would need to refuel the cycler for station keeping and orbital adjustments.\u003Cp\u003ERotating stations don\u0027t make things easier, because we are talking about thousands of m/s of delta-v between the two orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 tons is the dry mass..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhich do you prefer? a deltav change of 3,2km/s on 22 tons dry mass or a deltav change of 5km/s on 2 tons drymass?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are talking of comfortable transfers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso we are talking on future, that is why the dry mass of the transfer vehicle is 2 tons and the dry mass of the space station is only 20 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout food for the whole trip, that is almost imperceptible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd remember that I dont know how the real shape and orbits are. If someone find the animation that I am talking about, we can take sides, maybe I will notice that the idea is trash or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo not sure of the deltaV changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the rotation speeds of the space station, if your space station radius is 10 meters, with 9m/s in tangent speed to get 1G on artificial gravity, if you have wires that extend to 2 km, the tangent speed there is 2000m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022*Aqua*\u0022 data-cite=\u0022*Aqua*\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E@AngelLestat\u003Cp\u003ENow I understand what you are up to. That station is used as a reusable \u0022hotel\u0022 or \u0022taxi\u0022 so that you don\u0027t need that much life support on the transfer vessels from and to the station. Using this principle you don\u0027t need a fully featured space cruiser everytime you send people over interplanetary distances which then will be abandoned at the end of the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if that makes a transfer cheaper over time. The station has to be resupplied and it\u0027s not really in an easy to reach orbit. The course correction is also pretty difficult (large mass, change in mass on docking, precision needed, etc.) Also machines wear down. How long can a space station survive like that? Afaik the radiation is a big problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace stations does not need to be resupplied, if they need, arejust small things, anything you will consume over your whole trip from station to station (which can not be recycle in this one) it will be carry in the transfer vehicles. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou dont need to carry water and oxygen because these can be recycle almost at 100% in the space stations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolar panels or anything to sustain an ecosystem is not needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou just need to carry your food and proppelent, human wastes can be use it to produce proppelent that will keep the station in perfect orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I need to look in the real idea to have an opinion if can work or not.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-11T16:14:16Z\u0022 title=\u002202/11/2015 04:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AngelLestat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
