You seem to have a fixed clock in the back of your universe that tickes for all observers at the same rate. Let me spell it out again:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you would send the command signal from earth to mars at the speed of light, you have to wait y amount of time for it to arrive. For a 3rd observer that speeds past mars, this amount of time could be compressed arbitrarily small. If he would go at the speed of light, the amount of time would compress to zero. Thats paradox free.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if you send the signal at 2x the speed of light, this 3rd observer could observe the rover-reaction before the command decision on Earth. This situation is possible as soon as the signal speed is more than 1c. And this third observer can now send you the \u0022future prediction\u0022 back. As long as it is faster than 1c, it is possible to reach you before your command decision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is even possible if you use 1.0000001 times the speed of light signals. The only thing that has to change is that the 3rd observer has to be faster. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EANY FTL communication will allow for time travel situations and paradoxes. Thats simply because in special relativity, what happens in the time interval t1 and the distance x1 can look like a different time interval t2 at distance x2 for someone with different velocity than yours. FTL travel and time travel are the same thing from different perspectives. There isn\u0027t one without the other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is like length and height.
