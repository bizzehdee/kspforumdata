Software does what it is programmed to do. While it is possible to create expert systems which use neural networks (computer logics simulating how the human brain works) and make better and faster decisions than humans in specific areas, they are always limited to this specific area. And no matter how good a program gets at inter-day stock trading, weather simulation or flying airplanes, it will never try to take over the world because it simply isn\u0027t programmed to do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe robots-take-over-the-world scenario is nevertheless prevalent in science fiction for two reasons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1. People are always afraid of everything that is new and always afraid of losing control, so it\u0027s a good device for a horror story\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 2. Authors are used to create characters from personalities and motivations. Software is an abstract concept, not a character. But you can\u0027t have an abstract concept as a villain in a story. So the authors turn the concept into a character and attribute personalities and motivations to things which shouldn\u0027t have any. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust look at classic \u0022AI villains\u0022. They all only work because the author attribute a motivation and personality flaws to them. Like HAL9000 for example. \u0022He\u0022 has a motivation (complete the mission) and a personality flaw (believe to be infallible) which turns him into a villain. Or GLaDOS. Motivation: Wants company of test subjects; personality flaws: sadistic and vengeful. They act less than machines and more like characters.
