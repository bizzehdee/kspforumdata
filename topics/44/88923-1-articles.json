Any proposal to actively manage that debris has fallen on deaf ears though, due to the EXTREME cost of most such plans... This is something I\u0027ve been thinking about a lot lately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what if we could actually PROFIT off that debris? What if we could use it as *reaction mass*? Thus, an idea was born...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELately, I\u0027ve been running a number of mods in KSP, one of which is a selection of parts from the Stanford Torus mod including a Mass Accelerator. Not satisfied with the performance of the part, I created my own version with realistic force (up to 11,760 kN/s- the same as the proposed electromagnets for \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarTram#Generation_1_System\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EStar Tram gen-1\u003C/a\u003E) and power consumption levels, as well as reducing the mass (from 25 tons to 10- closer to real world levels for an aluminum electromagnet coil of that size), cost (one ring was more expensive than the largest rockets- 185,000 Funds. I reduced that to 12,500), and improving the structural integrity-related stats so a coil of these wouldn\u0027t explode from their own force when properly braced and fired at close to full power...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI intend to re-release the re-balanced parts as a standalone \u0022mini-mod\u0022 in the near future, as the license (CDDL-1) is open source and explicitly allows modification and re-distribution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, the mass accelerators made it into a list of infrastructure projects I was/am considering for my collaborative community game:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97427-Announcing-Northstar-s-Collaborative-Kerbal-Career-Campaign-where-to-next?p=1509692\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1509692\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97427-Announcing-Northstar-s-Collaborative-Kerbal-Career-Campaign-where-to-next?p=1509692\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1509692\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo cut to the chase, one of the ideas I considered was setting up orbital \u0022Momentum Exchangers\u0022- basically space stations around Kerbin and the Mun that would have batteries and a stack of networked Mass Drivers. There stations would be used to fire payloads in opposite directions, taking advantage of Newton\u0027s Lwas to maintain a stable orbit (basically, they would fire one payload retrograde, then turn around and fire another prograde, or vice-versa). At first, I was just thinking of using them for crew capsules and landers I wanted to de-orbit, and payloads I wanted to boost into a higher orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then today, the thought occurred to me- why not use these mass drivers on debris as well? Not only would that DRASTICALLY increase the amount of reaction mass eligible for my mass drivers to work on, it would also allow me to shoot debris retrograde at g-levels that would kill a Kerbal (I\u0027m playing with Deadly Re-Entry enabled, and probably TAC Life Support in the near future- Kerbals can die if g-forces exceed certain levels), but also not worry about whether the re-entry trajectories were survivable (in fact, from a reoleplaying perspective, it would be PREFERABLE if the debris burned up before hitting the ground...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther, why not use this in real-life? The benefits would be much more substantial. Not only does it take a lot more Delta-V to get a kg of anything to orbit, the orbital velocities are MUCH higher. Which means, a mass driver that can shoot payloads retrograde at, say, 190% of orbital velocity to de-orbit them (on a retrograde re-entry trajectory) can give debris or crew capsules a LOT more velocity without sending them into stable retrograde orbits. And, an even MOAR POWERFUL mass driver, which actually shoots debris retrograde so fast as to send them on escape-trajectories from the Earth-Moon system (I should point out now, there is no theoretical maximum speed on mass drivers other than the speed of light- although the length of electromagnets required grows exponentially longer with each additional m/s of velocity you want to give the ejected mass...), well the potential benefits there are almost unimaginable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plan would look something like this- NASA or some other space agency would build a LONG and POWERFUL coil of electromagnets in a low orbit above Earth (due to the Oberth Effect, more energy is gained from reaction mass when you are moving faster- and LEO is also the cheapest orbit to reach). Since all this would be is basically a really long coil of aluminum wire, it would be easy enough to assemble on-orbit without super-complicated or expensive machinery (the mass driver wouldn\u0027t be extremely precise- a 1 or 2 degree variance in trajectories isn\u0027t going to matter a lot when de-orbiting debris). The longer the coil of mass drivers, the better, since this would increase the amount of energy that could be gained from each kg of debris/reaction mass, and reduce the recoil acceleration on the mass drivers (so as to not damage any control systems attached to the electromagnets, or payload waiting to be fired in the opposite direction).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA small ion-powered tug (to reduce fuel-mass you have to launch for it) would rendezvous with debris over the course of weeks/months, and tug these debris back to the mass driver over weeks/months/years (depending on the mass of the debris- although more massive debris could potentially provide more impulse to the mass driver, making it more valuable...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the debris arrived in the mass driver, it would be loaded up at the prograde end of the electromagnet coil, and fired RETROGRADE at as high a velocity as possible, so as to either de-orbit the debris or send it on an escape trajectory (or impact-trajectory with the Moon). Ideally, this would be done at periapsis of the mass-driver\u0027s orbit, so as to provide the most energy possible from the reaction mass/ debris.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mass driver would then load up a payload (which would usually have attached to the mass driver station BEFORE the firing of the debris) at the retrograde end of the electromagnet coil, and fire it PROGRADE (by reversing the direction of the electric current from the first firing- unlike in KSP, electromagnet mass accelerators don\u0027t have innate polarity) with enough velocity to return the mass driver to its original orbit. For payloads requiring particularly large boosts (such as an interplanetary mission), the mass driver could build up energy by firing several pieces of debris in succession (at each periapsis of its orbit), before firing the payload with enough velocity to consume ALL of the accumulated energy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bread-and-butter of the mass driver payloads would probably be small satellites bound for geosynchronous orbit- which would actually be a good thing, as the most economical/easiest payloads to accelerate this way would be those with a small diameter (as this would allow the same mass of electromagnet-wire to be used to build a longer coil). Although any payload would work- as long as it were thin enough to fit through the mass driver coil (obviously the larger the diameter of the mass driver, the wider a variety of payloads it could be used for), larger ones would actually reap more economic benefit- as the first 100 m/s of Delta-V in a mission always requires more fuel than the second or third... Even a tiny nudge of, say, 50 m/s to a Mars Mission would represent a lot more fuel savings (and thus launch-mass savings) than a push of 150 m/s to a large number of much smaller satellites (assuming the ISP of the fuel were the same). So not only is this scalable- the benefits are actually GREATER with heavier payloads...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only major obstacle to this I could foresee, aside from initial investment costs (the mass driver coil would have to be sufficiently large/powerful to save GEO satellites more launch mass than the fuel required to tug debris to the mass-driver\u0027s orbit), would be the high electrical power requirements. This could definitely be solved by having a high electrical storage capacity and low operational frequency (with something like solar panels providing the power to slowly charge the batteries or capacitors), but something like Microwave Beamed Power from a ground-based installation would probably be a much more cost-effective solution (not only would you have to launch much less solar panel and battery/capacitor mass to orbit- the same Microwave Beamed Power installation could also find additional use in launching small Microwave Thermal Rockets...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like a great idea, at least on paper, and gets \u0022free\u0022 momentum without violating any of the laws of physics- basically it steals momentum in the prograde direction from debris that don\u0027t need it (said debris then either re-enter, or shoot into much higher retrograde orbits, depending on the size of the push), and gives it to payloads that *DO* need it- like interplanetary-probes or satellites bound for geosynchronous orbit. The energy comes from electricity- which ultimately either comes from solar panels (or nuclear reactors) on the mass driver, or a rectenna and Microwave Beamed Power at a ground installation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know what you guys think of this idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EP.S.\u003C/strong\u003E This idea is similar to, but distinct from, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum_exchange_tether\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMomentum Exchange Tethers\u003C/a\u003E.

Using the mass driver to boost payloads is not going to make a dent in the construction and operation costs. At best it may fire once or twice a year.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is true that there is a lot of space debris, but that fact needs to be taken in the same way that you take the fact that there are a lot of asteroids in the asteroid belt. In practical application, despite the huge number of asteroids, you could fly blind at full engine power through the densest spot and the probability of hitting something would be borderline negligible. In fact, the probability of any two given asteroids being within viewing distance of one another is borderline negligible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace debris is the same. It is considered dangerous not because there\u0027s a huge inpenetrable cloud of it, but rather because a significant collision - even if it is as unlikely as winning the lottery - will instantly scrap your billion dollar spacecraft, creating more debris in the process that might scrap other billion dollar spaceraft (kessler syndrome). And that would really suck a lot, to put it mildly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, much like asteroids, the various pieces of debris have extremely divergent trajectories, and the proximity to Earth greatly increases the dV requirements for matching planes. So yes, you might have an ion powered tug that gets really good gas mileage... it might be able to match orbit with a dozen or so objects before requiring refueling. Do note though that xenon gas is excessively expensive. It costs a thousand times more per kg than regular RP1/LOX fuel, while its Isp is only ten to thirty times higher. So while you\u0027re saving on the number of refueling operations performed, you\u0027re not saving on fuel costs... in fact, the ion drive might be \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E expensive to run over time, depending on launch costs for fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now the biggest issue... a lot of space debris is really small. Like, a few grams and smaller. Flecks of paint, metal splinters, single screws, that sort of thing. So even if your space tug managed to catch ten of them, it would be completely negligible as reaction mass for the mass driver, and it would be completely negligible in terms of making a dent in the proliferation of space debris. You would have to focus on the really large pieces, of which there are a constantly decreasing number: their orbits decay, they collide with something and fracture into smaller parts, and there are nearly no new ones produced nowadays that debris awareness is fairly high. Derelict satellites are pushed into graveyard orbits with the last of their propellant upon decomissioning them. You could pluck these wrecks out of their graveyard orbit and use them as reaction mass, but that will not be cleaning up any actually dangerous debris (the stuff not in graveyard orbits).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be a real solution for the danger that space debris poses to spacecraft, a cleanup proposal needs to prove how it can be cost effective at dealing primarily with this giant cloud of really small objects that are near-impossible to detect and track, have completely unpredictable orbits, and are of absolutely zero value to retrieve. If the problem was as easily solved as \u0022send a spacecraft to rendezvous with the debris\u0022, we\u0027d likely be doing that already.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-30T08:02:30Z\u0022 title=\u002210/30/2014 08:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-30T12:03:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne solution I did hear of for space debris did include a mass driver system but not in the way NorthStar described it.
