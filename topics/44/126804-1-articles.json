That\u0027s between 3 and 4 floors (depending on how tall your house is), and especially if the lower tank is buried under ground not unreasonable. So your one cubic meter will now store (\u003Cem\u003Etheoretically!\u003C/em\u003E) about 98 kJ; you\u0027ll need about 10 of those.

The modern motor fleet uses 100,000s of tons of hydrogen bond energy equivilents a day.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe have to consider the two equivilancies. Lithium is abundant if you don\u0027t mind separating sodium and potassium from lithium in sea water. The ratio of sodium:potassium:lithium in the earths crust is 8000:266:1. There are only so many uses for sodium and potassium hydroxide that are economically useful. Of course one of them is to absorb C02, but then you have residual HCl you have to store. So lithium is expensive. Then there is platinum. Electrolysis is not efficient, needs alot of platinum or platinum treated palladium and generates alot of waste heat, mostly of little use because the heat is at sub boiling temperatures (unless you do pressurized electrolysis). Electrolysis does not work well heated either. At best hydrogen would cost as low as $5.30 the equivilent of one gallon of gasoline. Since gas is now running $1.90 a gallon hydrogen fuel cells are not feasible unless cities subsidize them. And there are good reasons cities would not do this. 1. It would be a tax on the grid, whereas electric cars and gas/electric hybrids would be less so. In fact in japan you see now electric power companies tapping into the hybrids ability to generate electricity to feed the grid during peak demand.\u00A0 2. It requires a whole new infrastructure. 3. Consider the optimal compliment of solar and wind power distributed globally to support the worlds needs, we would need 2 to 3 times that capacity to convert it all to hydrogen and then back to electricity or to power vehicles, and BTW that still does no give us the chemicals we need to build plastics or electronics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are some reasons why hydrogen is attractive. Wind power is often generated far from where it is used, and at peak supply the price of electricity often drops to zero (as in parts of North Central Texas). Another example is that European plan on building solar farms in Africa, but transporting electricity from Africa to Europe by any known means is inefficient and subject to disruptive acts over long distances. Hydrogen could be made in africa and piped to Europe almost invisible to disruptions and burnt cleanly where it is needed, including neighborhood fuel cells. Electric battery is no substitute for bond energy for long distance transportation such as on Jets. In some places solar power will not be possible for long stretches. Nuclear power plants can be used but often represent a third or less capacity because they tend to produce at a constant rate, if we increased nuclear energy we could feed all electric during peak demand and part electric and part hydrogenesis and lowest demand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLithium ion storage like solar panels are the most useful at the load, not the source, and are best coupled to each other, and while mobile are less mobile than hydrogen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe choice of storage has some dependency on function. You would not want a lithium ion battery running a transpacific wide-bodied aircraft, it would be kind of silly to use solar panels on a home to create electrolytic hydrogen and then convert that back to electricity. You might have a hydrogen/lithium-ion hybrid car that one might mandate in a highly polluted city, like Delhi or Beijing, but the politics there is decades to centuries away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-02T02:01:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNuclear batteries?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeriously.
