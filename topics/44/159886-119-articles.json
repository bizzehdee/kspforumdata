Changing inclination of the station would be interesting. I suppose you could send up some light Xenon thruster and push it\u00A0over weeks to avoid structural stress. I cant imagine too much of an issue using the ISS for staging. Instead of using that dock for commercial stuff like Bigalow you could attach a some module to fill any staging role not within the station\u0027s capability.

All we need is SLS, Orion, a lander and 2 modules on LOP-G. SLS exists in its entirety and merely needs a few final tests and then assembly for launch. Orion exists and is ready, with the exception of the LSS in the SM. LOP-G is stupidly simple compared to the rest of the systems on the list. It\u2019s a satellite bus with docking ports and xenon thrusters. According to google the average time to design a satellite is 4-7 years. That\u2019s with normal commercial funding- with NASA funding that could be trimmed 2-3 years. Development starting\u00A0soon after- the docking array should be ready a year or two later. NASA is actively looking for landers right now. With extra funding will speed up development. NASA knows what is needed to land on the moon- what the surface is like- the terrain and so on.\u00A0Even with the tug to surface plan, a lander is still needed so the time spent is irrelevant. We also don\u2019t know how long ACES can actually function as a tug, though it can reuse the boiled off propellant it can\u2019t use it to power it\u2019s engines- so any burns would have to be done via the onboard thrusters which would be vastly slower and less efficient. So there\u2019s a increase\u00A0in burn time and a drop in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E using gaseous fuels. Orion uses hypergols\u00A0which are more stable. So it can remain in orbit and not lose any efficiency while waiting for the crew during surface stays (possibly up to weeks! In later missions).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a result, NASA\u2019s current plan may not be \u201Cthe best\u201D, but it is a fast track to the moon using the tools at NASA\u2019s disposal. Though other vehicle and designs may exist (BFR/Starship, ACES, New Glenn, etc), they aren\u2019t ready for flight yet. SLS is less than a year away from LAUNCH day, not from a major development milestone- from leaving the ground with all of its equipment (minus LSS and that isn\u2019t even NASA\u2019s problem, that\u2019s ESA\u2019s for being slow). Going with other plans like a tug-to-moon concept would actually take longer as none of the tools are ready for flight in NASA\u2019s arsenal- and even if the above vehicles were ready by the end of 2019- they still wouldn\u2019t be considered by NASA for at least another 2-3 years- or after extremely intensive review and tests. NASA dumped a lot of money not just into the contracts to build, plan and assemble the SLS but to also test the SLS using every facility- test stand, and simulation program they have on hand- they have every faith in the vehicle. If NASA is going to choose another vehicle over SLS- it\u2019ll have to beat the SLS in these aspects AND manage to undergo the same tests and still come out proven, safe, reliable and sound. So whether anyone likes it- SLS is here to stay. Likely more than 2 launches as again- NASA isn\u2019t going to be ready and seeing as Musk has again changed Starship AGAIN, clearly it\u2019s in the same developmental cycle jerk that SLS was in 10 years ago. Built alongside Musk-time, the vehicle won\u2019t be remotely ready to replace the SLS by or before 2025, which at a lazy launch cadence of 1 per year starting 2021, that\u2019s still 4 launches of SLS before BFR/SS has flown once. New Glenn has no remote plans to be man rated- so that leaves Vulcan and ACES. ACES won\u2019t fly for a while after Vulcan has its first flight. Though currently in production, Vulcan still likely won\u2019t see its first crewed flights for a while after. But assuming the best conditions- flying crew in 2023 (first flight for Vulcan is slated for 2021- again assuming best case scenario and development is not delayed)- that still leaves room for 2 launches of SLS- and Vulcan unlike SLS- can only throw Orion into LEO- and no further with Vulcan Heavy Centaur. So NASA\u2019s choices are an expensive expendable vehicle that has a mission- funding, and a report card stating that every nut, bolt, sheet of metal, crease, fleck of paint and wire, is safe- vs- a vehicle that\u2019s stuck in a development he\u2019ll similar to SLS in early 2010 (Starship/BFR), a vehicle that currently has no plan to be man rated (New Glenn), and a booster that can\u2019t put Orion anywhere beyond LEO (Vulcan) and it\u2019s little upper stage that won\u2019t even be ready to fly for another 4-5 years, much less be considered by NASA for Artemis for safety concerns. Plus SLS is a political\u00A0poster child for senators and congressmen who decide how much money NASA gets. SLS gives NASA jobs to hand out and more importantly results. Commercial has rocked the LEO market to pieces. NASA has more developments BLEO than any other entity in the US- not just because they\u2019re older- but because they have the resources, financial and research based, to make big projects like Hubble, New Horizons, Curiosity MSL, upcoming Dragonfly mission to Titan and so on. NASA does not hold any limitation to deep space exploration (ok they do, but that\u2019s more ethical restrictions than authoritative control- see Space Roadster)- but the reason why there aren\u2019t many (if any) commercial probes BLEO is because of cost to develop and the hurdles that imposes. It\u2019s a massive tax on companies since you don\u2019t make money through RnD- the only thing you can gain is investment- and that can only carry you so far. Eventually a final product is needed and that\u2019s where companies fall through (cough Mars One cough), they simply can\u2019t produce and investors know that. Yes SLS is a jobs program- but it\u2019s also a program that\u2019s building the most powerful rocket set to launch within the next four\u00A0years with a crew onboard.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNASA is dumb- but NASA knows what it can, and cannot do- and what it does and does not have. It can build a satellite bus and a docking array, bring them together- dock and then send a lander to sit and wait for a crew. Which will transfer to that vehicle and then land, explore the moon and return. Only half of this equation is theoretical- LOP-G and the lander (which is needed no matter the approach). LOP-G being simple to produce and the lander being NASA\u2019s primary interest right now. With any other approach- new technologies will be needed- and new vehicles will have to be tested and developed. This approach minimizes development time to one stupid simple vehicle, and a vehicle that NASA\u2019s gonna need, no matter the approach.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd before anyone says it- \u201Cwhat about Mars\u201D- Deep Space Exploration vehicle. Using ion thrusters it\u2019ll be able to get to Mars and come back (maybe with a lander years later) with fuel to spare due to its efficiency. So complaining about \u201Cless efficient\u201D is a bit of a misnomer when you realize that you\u2019ve got excess in fuel economy\u00A0to begin with. Plus- LOP-G could act as a great place for the crew to stay at for quarantine. Far away from earth- using our most advanced medical technology- examining the crew for 240,000 miles away rather than landing them on a carrier with hundreds or thousands of others around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway thanks for coming to my TED Talk.
