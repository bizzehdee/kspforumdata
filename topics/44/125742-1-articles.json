The problem is that limits the amount of gas that can be heated and accelerated, and although it creates a higher ISP the thrust is much lower. In addition because it has a higher operating temperature it is rather restricted to heavier metals. The atm ISP is a much lower ratio og vacuum ISP and the engine irself is not safe for atmospheric use. THerefore as a launch engine its a nogo for just about every reason. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe drive you describe, much better designed is the VASIMR is a deep space engine. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs has been discussed before energy production densities in space are petty relative to land versions, exceptionally are oxidation reduction reaction which produce uncoverted heat-thermal expansions. The VASMiR with its 5 newtons of thrust is a 200 kw. That is essentially 40kw per newton, this will effectively limit any addon production of thrust to the electrical energy production density per unit mass. Since solar panels cannot be deployed during launch phase, batteries are not weight effective, you are left with piddly nuclear reactors for craft that would have to have nuclear during deep space flight stage. Therefore you still have risk. if you are considering tracking lasers and craft solar panels you are still limited to 50 kw per meter of panel. if you had 100 square meters per ship that is 5000 kw or 125 N, consider how many newtons the average launch engine produces. It would not even suffice to lift the panels.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SomeGuy12","CreatedById":103022,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T00:22:31Z","Content":"\nIt\u0026#39;s a heat exchanger.

Thats not your primary problem, a heat exchanger needs a to undergo thermal conversion to electricity. The most efficient method we have is steam conversion, each step in the process adds mass (steam generator, steam lines, return flow pumps, exchanger), slows down the process, produces inefficiencies, and reduces the maximum transfer rate. steam engine works on a cooldown zone on the low pressure side, so there is a maximum amount of hv you can add to the high pressure evaporator side before you exceed the cooling capacity on the low pressure side. And the big problem is that that the condensor plate needs to operate below 100\u0026#39;F. And your rocket works most efficiently below 30000 meters close to the speed of sound, if you examine the ideal gas equation, ambient thermal gas velocity plus mach one and your surface temperature for convectionsl heat exchanger is already up there.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you are going to heat the exhaust gas directly just remember light carries momentum if you target the exhaust gas you will slow down the differential building pressure and heat back into the nozzle, which will probably explode. Most modern engines drive the fuel through the nozzle to cool the casing down and preheat the gas to the decay point if you laser the gas at the nozzle it overheats and the engine explodes. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you are going to go this direction, by far a light oil burning turbine is a much much better choice and if you are going to go that route just put the platform on a ring of jet power engines with an electric fan driven exhaust gas removal system, get your thrust directly at least you can get the craft to 20 km and keep the launch boosters. You have turbofans out there that can produce 100,000 ft/lbs of thrust and work to 15,000 meters. You are even going to get remotely close to this level of thrust with a remote powered system, the conversion systems are too too slow.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-18T01:22:30Z\u0022 title=\u002211/18/2015 01:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T01:43:12Z","Content":"\nisnt the OP asking for a Microwave Thermal Engine?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SomeGuy12","CreatedById":103022,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T03:06:29Z","Content":"\nPB666, what are you talking about?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nLasers do need to be \u0022lensed\u0022 (lens and mirrors are 2 alternate ways to do the same thing).

You can add atoms to glass that make it pour less quickly. Howevere, i work with glass in the lab so i can tell you that if you dim the lights, we have burners that with pressurized air burn an almost invisible blue, the moment it starts to glow the reddist of reds ever it can be deformed. In the high pressure of a rocket engine at 700 to 800\u0026#39;C it would begin to start swelling and eventually ball out and open up, not quickly, but for optical purposes it would destroy the lensing effect.

In fact it is quite difficult because you have to control the temperature of the glass to keep it from imploding, it has to stay or below the fusing temperature. Bizarre as it sounds if i tried to push the glass it would shatter, but under vacuum the small of motion that the vacuum creates on all the glass molecules allows one to slowly bend the glass without breaking it.
