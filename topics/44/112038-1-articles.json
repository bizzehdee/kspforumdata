Are we talking about a single organisation/govermant or a tight cooperation of many nations and organisations? In that case it\u0027s pretty likely that they will jave a single goverment.\n\nIf it\u0027s founded by many competetive participants the situation would be drasticslly different. Although it\u0027s still questinable if any tenzions back home would have a significant impact over such distances. The outposts on mars would dimply need to help eachother in order to survive anyway.\n\nIt would also depend on how regular space flight is at that point, if there are more colonies and how hard it would be for nations on earth to have any impact on them. If just getting there to teact on a declaration of independence would be close to commiting financial suicide, goverments are not going to be able to threaten or control them much.\n\nEarth\u0027s influence would mostly depend on the question if a colony can survive on their on production and how independent they might be. It\u0027s not likely that a colony would become autonomous within decades and it\u0027s not hard to believe that some outposts in the most hostile enviroment are controled by the organisations that gurantees their regular supply.\n\nIn a very, very, very distant and highly fictional future when mars could be a mostly independent economy, it still depends if a cooperation with earth is of any use.

Just as you talk about the Decline of the British Empire I could point out two world wars crippling said Empire. Just as you Have pointed out American independence I WILL point out French Dutch and Spanish interference in that independence. And we could come to the conclusion that Empires fail under external pressure, and at the same time those empires help resist that pressure.\n\nSo perhaps empires are doomed to fail.
