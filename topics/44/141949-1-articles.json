So you now know they are out there because DT is never wrong, except that one time\u00A0it gave the answer 42. All sentients a knowledgable in game theory. And once a culture is space worthy,meither in thier own or adjacent systems aliens do not penetrate\u00A0systems unless for trade or conflict resolution.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, next premise, your culture has never detected any alien civilization or cultural artifact as such. As\u00A0per fact you dont know if some alien culture is 100 or 1000 light years away.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird premise your culture has the ability to detect sentient telecommunication in the next star system but no further, it has the ability to send probes to those sysytem but no further due to that limit of about 6 light years.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nForth it is\u00A0just on the verge of sending colony ships (handwaving) to about 10 ly in distance.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGame theory suggests that two players, be\u00A0it you or aliens will try to take steps so that thier share is the best, i think it would be valuable resources, since colonization is expansive.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first step taken in the game is that you probe proxima centauri, find a suitable planet to land on and probe the entiresystem with directed/highly focused\u00A0em radiation of various wavelengths to see if there is a response. With nobresponse the colony ships are en-route.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFifth applying uncertainty principle, while you are much more likely to close encounter colonizing sentients than homeworld sentients, for the sake of argument the next star system simultaneously does or does not have alien colonizers in progress until your colonizers reach the system. So in the instance below a rare contemporary attempt to colonize proxima centauri can be applied to any attempt to colonize but at low, say 1/1000\u00A0frequency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next step you are an alien attempting to colonize proxima centauri unaware or Earth or its intention, what is your\u00A0next move.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Upon seeing the ship try to avoid all contact, assuming\u00A0the star was approaching Earth you flee to another system. There are more fish in the sea for you.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Continue on with plans hoping Earth turns around and returns, realize\u00A0the errors of their\u00A0ways.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Try to destroy the ships transmitter covertly and then degrade the colony ship so that it looks like a failed\u00A0mission hoping that Earth morale falls and does not repaet.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Contact Earth and recommend a sharing treaty, after which the new planet is called new poland. (ominously named)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Share but no contact or treaty, let the best colonizer win. Sensing you noticed them and they did not notice you, you land on the other side of the planet, or a moon or some other satellite and attempt to mske it look like you have been their longer.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. Overt attack in which Earth is informed. \u00A0We\u0027re the king of this mountain!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow for the success\u00A0of alpha centauri there is a 80% chance of colonizing the next star from there versus the other sentient. As an Earthling you really\u00A0need this colony, as an alien its just another feather in the cap. For earth\u00A0Therefor it opens up almost double the available colonizable stars to you. For both,\u00A0Each sentient has other stars\u00A0it can colonize and based upon densities of aliens such choices will generally have no encounters.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd so this is a expansive game setup, there are no bad choices just higher and lower risk/reward scenarios.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a alien would you attempt to block a colony that is much more vital to them than to you, would you use covert or overt means, would you negotiate. As an Earthling, would you risk miffing a more well traveled and distributed species whike other colonization options are on the table, would you suspect\u00A0covert\u00A0operations are at play, would you have preemptove measures for looking for other colonizers, ongoing with your colonization mission (remembering the time component with different comoving soace times is plastic, no one could be quite sure who succesfully colonized first from great distance, so the only objective measures are local interactions to proxima)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is enough to get the argument of whether or not we make first contact or not.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-17T11:13:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting.\u003Cbr\u003E\n1 is the obvious downer here, you don\u0027t get an colony and earth will discover you in some time anyway.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2 and 5 is much of the same, except that in 2 earth abort the colonization, note that turning around without restocking is unlikely.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3 I don\u0027t get if you destroy the transmitter and capture ship and crew or destroys the ship, capture is an benefit in that you will learn a lot about humans and human technology but is harder to pull off.

To be interstellar colonizers must have master fusion energy so that also means they have mastered atomic physics, including weapons. Certainly as an Earthling you are not going to war on first contact proxima, but you might if you had 10 colonies, but as an advanced alien race why would you expose yourself when you could research the enemy covertly and find either his potential, for touchy-feely races or his weaknesses for roadkiller\u00A0races. The Earthling alien contrast is simply for the sake that we are starters and the aliens are most probably not, so its an unbalanced dance.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK, so now you have created a counter defense strategy whereby you survive, somehow by colonizing outside of their SOI and then counterstrike, but Earth will still remain dead.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe prospect of game theory then in space is not to alert others and gather intelligence as much as you can, only announce ones presence when neccesary. This is\u00A0not neccesarily always the case, because if you had 1000 stellar colonies you could just send termination ships to this system and all the plausible Earth colony\u00A0systems, but then if that were the case we would prolly already be dead, so we have to assume that whatever is out close by would give us half a chance before they eliminated us.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother prospect of course is the spritual species, something like the ancients in SG1 whereby they connect the sentients\u00A0that can get along into a network, although the show had its logical weaknesses, they tend not to realize that parasite species are never the predominant biomass in nature. One assumes\u00A0the strategy is to let species\u00A0to progress and then determine if they are suitable for the network otherwise isolate them so that they can never network themselves, and hope that a compatable sentient\u00A0evolves opin their system.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think a forward\u00A0looking IS sentient is prolly more concerned\u00A0\u00A0with what happens when andromeda merges with our galaxy and what will be the fate of the resulting galaxy once it has a supermassive black hole at its core.

Such a race might have a multipart lifespan that includes a single cell dormant stage capable of being frozen and regrown in a test tube for a generation before constituting a breeding form that then gives birth to a full sentient, just as a monarch goes through several life phases on its migration from mexico\u00A0to canada and back.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe flip side is if you are a race voted out of the network you might decide to take a longrange stealth existance to build up forces and attack exclusive sentient consortiums.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor earth i think any space agency realizing that there is a four year lag (assuming no but hoping for FTL communication) in communication, would hesitate acting on partial information, no contact, no treaties, generally avoiding, seeing if resources are available. Such a space agency would have directives in place for any alien encounters. A generational fusion power ship would probaly try to hide and use resources to create probes. With three stars it would be easy to hide, and use of probes that observe and return and do not communicate except when in laser range. They might choose to colonize other objects, since planets around proxima are likely to be inhospitable, they might construct\u00A0another one or two colonizer ships, then discretely leave after sending a message pribe back to Earth with all suitable info and a Silence directive. If their colony ship is too\u00A0old they might retrograde\u00A0all it motion so that the spent\u00A0hull falls into a alpha centauri. Alternatively they could creat a ruse sending a decoy to another system and then start sending unintelligible signals, like we are angry you setlled in our territory, grandstand rattle sabers and see if they leave, try to make peace \u00A0or respond.

Single\u00A0system species\u00A0are simply sterilized or contained, again if you are a Network. Single species are free to wipe other species out, but networks will simply contain demonstrating to others in the network there generally non aggressive intentions. Most networks work\u00A0relatively quick once a pest is identified to ascertain the extent of his colonization with sets of probes to all the potential home-worlds and then works to determine\u00A0the best strategy for containment or extermination. Generally extermination of nascent colonies will be require after neutralization of the communication network. They tend to use covert attacks, nudging asteroids off course, severing fuel lines by infrared lasers, this type of thing. \u00A0Of course if the sentient is developed enough and they are faced with overtly attacking more than one terraformed planet, they would call\u00A0in captured/implanted\u00A0cyborg diplomatic contingent to try to negotiate a nonaggression pact.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes and on Earth how many nations no longer exist, where are the Spanish \u00A0Moors?

Did imperial Germany negotiate in the end, or did a \u0027your it\u0027 general capitulate to the allies. The Tojo era Japanese tried to negotiate, IIRC, it was not an unconditional surrender. You see where your line of thought goes?

The decision has to be researched and studied to determine if a culture is worthy of a formal contact, and only thereafter would a great network or more advances single sentient system make contact and send diplomats. If they find your culture to impulsive, exhibiting many fatalistic tendencies they probably would elect to see if there were progressive elements therein to deal with, or chose to work covertly to contain your activities.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore as a player, you have to realize that you cannot force a civilization to make first contact, but you can compel them to by making offerings to communicate and show them your level of social sophistication. Then you will have to wait. There is a point that many contacts, they or you will want to reach out, knowing that they are aware of you so sidestepping the contact issue can no longer be done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDungeon fortresses are not immune to a series\u00A0of atomic weapons or antimatter bombs. Don\u0027t forget there is a lag of several years between what happens on a colony and word reaching a home-world, so you would not be able to create a dungeon planet with such a small lead time. If you were a well developed hostile then they would already be aware\u00A0of your capabilities when you attacked their colony the first time, and they would be doing even more research and developing a star map of all your colonies, if you appeared to have premeditated and unprovoked attack strategy, then one day simultaneously on all world a series of weapons would begin a process of detonation followed by a final antimatter like weapon that sends a 100g pulse waves through you planets. Its the loss of valuable space resources, but they will try to salvage what they can, but you are out of their way.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWere Columbus and Magellan\u0027s ships battleships? When i was playing spore if i was unprovoked attacked while traveling between systems, I simply sterilized the planets that attacked me, but if they did not attack they became my trading partners, unless they were to impulsive. The Grox got the volcanoes of comet strikes, i would capture their home-world colonies at the center, trophy piece. Sometimes, if a hostile paid a high price for items i would keep them around, but generally speaking only as long as it took to buy them all out or blast them away.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is strength in good trading partnerships and economics, Networks may be key optimal local exploitation of space given the great distances. This is because managing things cooperatively fro a great distance is hard, so fre standing management strategies which operate through cooperative trade agreement and defense strategies works best. If we look at the British empire or Soviet Union, either of which can be considered as stable centralized nearly global organizations. Stable but not for long, and eventually both succumb to more efficient competition. The crippling problem with soviets was autocratic central government lacked incentives for modernization and productivity improvements. The British empire extracted too much from the colonies and inefficiently distributed resources.
