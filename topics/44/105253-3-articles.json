I think you\u0027re comparing apples and oranges. There was huge interest in the first Apollo landings but even by the time of Apollo 13 very few people cared. At least not until after the infamous \u0022problem\u0022. And certainly far fewer people cared about the space shuttle program and the ISS than cared about Apollo. Science isn\u0027t supposed to be a popularity contest or a gladiatorial sideshow. The MSL and Philae landings showed that many non space-minded people can get excited about robotic missions and maybe even be inspired by them. Maybe not as much as boots on the ground on Mars might, but at the risk of sounding like a broken record, I\u0027d rather that the limited budgets that are available be focused on the highest scientific ROI rather than \u0022inspiring the masses\u0022 (whatever that means)."},{"CreatedByName":"Reddragon","CreatedById":66937,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T22:07:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This is sad by the way:\n\u003E Military expenditures 2014.\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/a67df2ec0ec59fe9f762a1389d2c5a47.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/a67df2ec0ec59fe9f762a1389d2c5a47.png)\n\nSaudi Arabia has a bigger defense budget than Russia?
