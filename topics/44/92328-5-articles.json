These ships don\u0027t have to go far, all they have to do is get to a suitable distance in orbit around earth to not be affected by the blast. How many ships, or how much of the population we could save, I don\u0027t know.....but it would really all depend on how much we can get done in the allotted time. It may even be possible to save the entire earth population if we used our time and resources wisely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce in orbit, these ships will become our new home until the earth recovers, which could be a long time. They will need to be as self sustainable as possible, but it may be possible to have return ships to go back to earth and bring back raw materials as needed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee, the truth is, in a doomsday scenario for earth, earth will still always be our best bet to recolonize, rather than colonizing another planet. It would take us much longer to terraform mars, than it would to recolonize the earth. And orbiting the earth, is going to be a lot less trouble than traveling to another planet. Once it\u0027s safe enough (as in the earths temps aren\u0027t too hot or too cold) regardless of atmosphere composition, we can colonize the earth much like we would on mars anyways.....we\u0027d just go back down there to build bases.....but these bases would have to be solely for energy and resource extraction, unless we have a way of also landing the main ship(s), then we\u0027d just land back on the earth and live inside of those instead. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETechnically, the moon could be a good prospect too. We could technically fit the entire planets population in an area the size of texas, with enough room for everyone to have the same living space as your average apartment or home. That means there\u0027s plenty of space on the moon for humans to wait out the disaster. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the real hurdle, will be organizing the effort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe may not even need space ships....if the devastation is only limited to the surface of the earth to a certain depth, our resources would probably be maximized by creating underground cities deep in the earth. it\u0027s like creating a space ship....except without having to expend the energy to lift it off. when it comes down to it, it\u0027s all about pure energy expenditure in the allotted time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut when you get down to pure energy expenditure, destroying or redirecting an incoming object might be an even easier task. I mean after all, if we could move the entire earths population into space......well then it would probably be easier to just create a massive ship that flies to the object and pushes it out of the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETexas for example, is about 700K sq KM (the land mass needed to save the entire human race comfortably). If the incoming object is only 580KM across, it could be much easier to deflect the object than to send the entire human race into space....and considering we\u0027d be saving the earth in the process, the savings would be even more tremendous over a protracted period of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s all do-able, as long as we use our time wisely. Even if we run into issues like material strength being unable to support the mass of an object.....well we just build smaller objects. if a ship can\u0027t hold under its own massive weight....well then you build smaller ships. technically, it would still take the same relative amount of energy to put 1 massive ship into orbit....or 1,000 less massive ones that equal the same total mass as the large one. we could build and fly thousands of ships designed to land on the object and push it out of the way, while also employing other methods in conjunction, depending on the effect they will have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe most dangerous thing is to think that we can\u0027t save the earth. many will try to convince people of the easier route....a \u0027small\u0027 colony ship with a few thousand people.....but that\u0027s just because they\u0027d rather save themselves and start over, than save everyone. they don\u0027t want to take the chance of failure, so they\u0027d rather let billions perish to save themselves. for some, it will be their dream to start over and lord over the few remaining humans in a lifeboat, so they will convince people to sacrifice the earth to live that future, or not even bother with a solution to saving the earth, even if it is very much possible albeit difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-11T14:24:01Z\u0022 title=\u002212/11/2014 02:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by trekkie_\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-11T15:04:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starman4308\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starman4308\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo you have a nuke powerful enough to redirect what amounts to a planetoid, massing 2.11*10^20 kg?\u003Cp\u003ECome on, at least try to run some basic numbers first.
