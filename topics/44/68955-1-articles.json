This is why you have to solve differential equations to find the answer. There\u0027s a derivation of escape velocity at Wikipedia which I think is the calculation you want, but it\u0027s not very illuminating: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity#Derivation_using_G_and_M\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity#Derivation_using_G_and_M\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now I have a question: If the \u0022escape velocity\u0022 of a black hole is the speed of light, does that mean an object falling from infinity would reach lightspeed at the event horizon? That doesn\u0027t feel right to me but seems to follow from the definition of escape velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FREEFALL1984","CreatedById":104993,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-15T11:18:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone considered how much the earth moves towards the moon? the moon is a not too insignificant mass, as the moon approaches, the earth will be pulled towards it at ever increasing velocity, which would cause the moon to increase its velocity even faster. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are of course an abundance of variables which would also effect the rate of fall such as relative position of celestial bodies and relative position during fall, but they\u0027re generally too insignificant to consider.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nikolai","CreatedById":23085,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-15T14:02:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FREEFALL1984\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FREEFALL1984\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHas anyone considered how much the earth moves towards the moon?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe orbital calculation does that, since the period and semimajor axis of the orbit are dictated by the \u003Cstrong\u003Emutual\u003C/strong\u003E attraction of the objects.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheDataMiner","CreatedById":45648,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-15T23:40:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can see the ads now:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimate Spacediving!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.83 days of free fall!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust think of all formations you could do with all that time!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It\u0027s Fun for the whole family!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESign up now for only $7,999,999,999.99\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FREEFALL1984","CreatedById":104993,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-16T08:44:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nikolai\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nikolai\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe orbital calculation does that, since the period and semimajor axis of the orbit are dictated by the \u003Cstrong\u003Emutual\u003C/strong\u003E attraction of the objects.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly I\u0027m no physicist, and I\u0027m not particularly good at maths. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIndeed the semimajor axis is determined by the \u003Cstrong\u003Emutual\u003C/strong\u003E attraction of the objects. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the movement of the earth isn\u0027t accounted for in any of these equations.
