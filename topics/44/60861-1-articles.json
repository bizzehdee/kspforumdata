This is well beyond most of the various points marked as the \u0027edge of the solar system\u0027, which are mostly to do with the interaction of the solar wind with interstellar medium. If Voyager was going to live long enough, Im sure we\u0027d get another dozen or so reports of it leaving the solar system whenever it hits some approximation of the edge of the SOI , but it\u0027ll run out of power long before that happens.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"relin","CreatedById":89684,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-23T20:22:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s still in the SOI, but it\u0027s no longer affected by the Sun\u0027s outgoing massive particles (solar wind).

In real life the moon and the sun constantly pull on satellites causing their orbits to shift, this requires small corrections else your satellites end up deorbited or in wonky orbits. Since station keeping is rather boring they cut it out in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat they mean when Voyager 1 has reached interstellar space is that it left the heliosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, the sun is constantly spewing out tons of gas at very high speeds. This is the solar wind. As the gas gets further from the sun it moves slower and slower until eventually it stalls against the pressure of the interstellar gas. Voyager has crossed that barrier where the solar wind stops and is now in interstellar gas.
