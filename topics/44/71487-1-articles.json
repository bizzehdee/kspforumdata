If sub-atomic particles have different physics than \u0022big\u0022 stuff, then the Universe should have different physics than the things that make it up, as we have different physics than the things that make us up. So actually, our universe can be actually a sub-atomic particle in a bigger universe. Did I just prove the theory of universes in other universes?

Most people assume that the problem is that stuff on vary large scales doesn\u0027t add up when considered from the very small scale, but the issue we\u0027re really having is that we aren\u0027t seeing what causes the very large stuff when looking on a very small scale and that messes with our statistical calculations and causes chaotic predictions when we don\u0027t know all of the details.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xcorps","CreatedById":96531,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-05T20:06:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the plus side, the Genesis project managed to capture a piece of the Sun. It\u0027s been analyzed at UCLA and is putting limits on the hypothesis of the formation of the solar system. It may not be all THAT long before we have a (more or less) accurate picture of how the solar system formed. In the meantime, we should expect a lot of long standing beliefs to be challenged and disproved. Like the fact that the Earth\u0027s (and other inner system) oxygen isotopes are anomalous to the rest of the system, when it was previously considered to be the other way around. Knowing where to begin looking helps understand what else you can look at.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-05T20:31:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe very big stuff and very small stuff have the same physics\u003C/strong\u003E, we just haven\u0027t figured out how to put them together consistently yet.
