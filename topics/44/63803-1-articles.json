You\u0027ll have to root your Android in order to really remove it, but I don\u0027t think you\u0027d be asking that here if you knew how to do that safely. You should be able to disable it on the app info screen, or just remove the credentials so it will run but won\u0027t connect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
