At any rate, it is way easier to convert everything to metric.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also a difference of convention in I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E. It may be defined as impulse per weight or impulse per mass. You will then get I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E in units of seconds or m/s respectively. Your computations are set up to look as if you have specific impulse of 4,000s, which is way too much. Even NERVA only has about 800s, and to get 4,000s you need an ion drive. SRB would have something closer to 250s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if you define I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E as impulse per weight, then the correct formula for delta-V is I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E*g*ln(m1/m0). The factor of g, which is Earth\u0027s gravity by convention, ensures that your delta-V comes out in m/s. Units are important.
