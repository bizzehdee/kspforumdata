They often lie within the transcription reading frame. The news is not new. Its been known for a long time. In addition there are siRNA found in these genes that either regulate themselves or other genes. So double coding is also known and characterized. There are site in the human genome that are over 500,000 nucleotides were a 350 bp site regulates three genes all from an extended distance.Mutations around this site are known to be associated with QTL variation at the site. Other QTL mutations occur in *gene deserts*. And last but not least, there are certain sites in the human genome that have a rather disturbed evolution. 6p21 is one of these sites, in Europeans 2 haplotypes are known to have the longest identifyable runs of homozygosity in the human genome, linkage disequilibrium to one of these sites and haplogroup mutations suggest it is 20,000 years old with a rate of recombination 10 fold less or more than the other haplotypes or other parts of the genome. This is particularly odd since the most conserved part of the haplotype represents some of the fastest evolving sites in the human gemome, with 5 genetic loci being the fastest evolving coding sequence loci in the human genome. There is a lot of stuff coded into the DNA that we know is controlling both expression and evolution of the genome itself, and we have known this since the early 70s. The IL2/IL21 locus is another site that has disturbingly slow recombination, and a site on chromosome 5 in Native Americans has also been identified that is half the length of the 6p site that also does not undergo recombination at a normal rate. \n\nBe wary what you read in Science, it does not have a stellar scientific reputation with regard to opinions or retractions, It is better to get information from field specific journals.\n\nWith regard to vaccines. Many AD mutations are increases and some are decreased. A fair number of Non-6p21 mutations are in apoptotic machinery, which goes to ways. Either they increase apoptosis of cells (such as beta cells in T1D, or lamina propria cells in GSE) or decrease apoptosis of immune cells such as killer cells or B-cells that cause the disease. If you go about promoting or inhibiting expression you can make disease worse."},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T15:53:15Z","Content":"yup yup : /"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T16:00:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \\*sigh\\* this is the problem with pop-sci reports\n\u003E There is no second code here.\n\u003E \n\u003E There\u0027s some proteins that bind specific DNA sequences.\n\u003E \n\u003E To specify a given amino acid, you have multiple choices of DNA sequence.\n\u003E \n\u003E In some cases, those choices are selected to create a sequence a protein will bind to.\n\u003E \n\u003E DNA is not just a code, it is a physical structure, and things physically interact with it.\n\u003E \n\u003E This isn\u0027t a 2nd code, this is a structural constraint for transcripton factor binding.\n\u003E \n\u003E This forum needs an ignore feature, or a down vote feature....

So, depending on the description, we can say \u0022there are double codes\u0022. We can easily spot one, and miss the other overlapping code. It could be protein encoding, and easy to spot the one, and miss the second protein encoded over the top, or read in the opposite direction. But AFAIK at least one overlapping encoding area has been observed: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlapping_gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlapping_gene)\n\nAn amazing thing to learn, and a rather rudimentary a concept.\n\nDue to either it\u0027s nature or it\u0027s necessity, DNA has in built compression/redundancy via this method.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E DNA is not just a code, it is a physical structure, and things physically interact with it.\n\u003E This isn\u0027t a 2nd code, this is a structural constraint for transcripton factor binding.\n\nI would have thought a proof on the structural requirements for the ordering of DNA would earn anyone, you including, a Nobel Prize. The entire consensus and observations currently attribute no preference for the DNA ordering due to atomic or mechanical forces. Only the mechanisms of reading/transcribing etc. The example of a double code, is an example of **ordering**, not of mechanical function and **not of physical constrains**.\n\nThough if I am wrong in my understanding of those systems, I\u0027m happy to hear more on the subject. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nPS, the article states on the \u0022new code\u0022 discovered, \u0022One describes how proteins are made, and the other instructs the cell on how genes are controlled.\u0022\n\nSo it appears it\u0027s talking about Gene expression, and not just overlapping encoding sites. Still, points stand. Gene expression is an observed fact. If it means we need to write in new details and change our understanding, do we choose to be dogmatic, or choose the evidence?
