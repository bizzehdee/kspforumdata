The software and required techs just isn\u0027t there yet. Talk to ManeTi about that...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince the Tesla thread tends to go off on a tangent in regards to self-driving and traffic laws, rules and regs (*whistles innocently*), I decided to start this this thread\u00A0for the discussion of self-driving and autonomous vehicle news, as well as general discussion of traffic and the rules of the road because that is directly related. Discussion of other vehicular technologies is also encouraged. It should also be noted that Tesla is not the only player in the self-driving game, just the most prominent. While mandated techs and changes to traffic laws tend to the political, we need to keep the thread away form political will and motivations and just focus on any legal stuff we would like to see changed, or the thread may be visited by a friendly neighborhood moderator!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI held off on starting this thread until I had some sort of news to put in it, and finally there is something noteworthy. But first, some techs that I think should be made mandatory at some point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo further the development of self-driving, all new vehicles should be at least capable of Drive-by-Wire (i.e. the vehicle can be controlled by a computer). That\u0027s not to say it should be active, but the capability should be there for down-the-road upgrades to autonomous or self-driving. Of course, the manual\u00A0 controls would still be there, and to satisfy the the technophobes\u00A0the DbW inputs could be unplugged from a relatively easy-to-access wiring connector. This would be something with a long lead time, say, within five years or so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0I believe it needs to be mandated (sooner than later, like, ASAP)\u00A0 that all new vehicles are equipped with Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB), since that tech is relatively mature and will prevent one of the more\u00A0common accidents: rear-enders due to driver inattention. Insurance rates will also benefit.

It, when active and not malfunctioning, will always reduce the severity of a crash but not always prevent it. AEB also enables smart cruise control with only extra software. Smart cruise (ICC in Nissan land) makes even human operated cars safer on the highway. Other techs that go along with those are blind spot warning and intervention, lane departure warning and intervention, and cross traffic alerts. Almost all of these technologies are on even modestly equipped cars and they only require a couple of sensors and software for the ABS module. Yes, most of these systems are run on your brake control module. Added weight is virtually nothing and cost of the 3 radars and 1 lane camera is the only reason they are not standard equipment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for drive by wire, almost all cars today are drive by wire except for steering. The transmission shifts (or doesn\u0027t for a CVT) by computer control only. Brakes can be entirely and fully operated by a computer, engine power is not directly controlled by the driver. You are being driven as much as you think you are driving. As they said in a technology class I had many years ago, \u0022you are no longer the dictator. You are only a voting member of the control system.\u0022 (also heard \u0022meat servo\u0022) Now steering is a handled a bit differently. On some vehicles (Ford F150, Nissan Rogue and Sentra to name a couple) the steering assist is handled by an electric motor that is actually strong enough to steer the vehicle by itself. On higher end vehicles (like the Infiniti QX80) when the vehicle is running the steering column is decoupled from the steering gear and steering is handled entirely by the computer with some software tricks and an electric motor to trick the driver into thinking they are in direct control. With a couple of cameras, a computer, and some real good software a QX80 (and many others) could drive itself. The hardware is already here and already installed on existing automobiles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would like to see a self drive system become universal for highway travel. Intermediate technology could be deployed along roads to help cars navigate until the software gets up to speed. Road crews and emergency vehicles could carry transmitters to alert self driving cars (you already likely have a telematics (cell phone) module that sends and receives installed). Rest areas near the beginning of driver-must-operate areas could be set up for cars to stop in for sleeping or inattentive drivers. These things would get the tech out there and on the road in large numbers and allow the whole concept to mature. And, none of that tech is sci-fi, it all exists and is in production in some form. If the system was universal (like other car techs, OBDII, CAN, etc) you would avoid problems that like Tesla has had.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-14T06:06:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nToo much to respond to here, but on my car, no computer is shifting the transmission for me.

They are not, in general, and training is nearly non-existent in the US. In the US we basically give out a drivers\u0027 license if you can sign your name (yes, an exaggeration). The longer people drive on a limited access high speed road the worse they get too (highway hypnosis and wandering minds because of monotony). Add in phones, radios, passengers, kids, french fries, drinks, smoking, and on and on. A large percentage of drivers can\u0027t be bothered to look out of the windshield for more than 2 seconds at a time. That is the reason all of these safety systems have/will become standard features. Car companies keep trying to make fool proof cars but they keep making better fools. To a certain degree this proves your point. The less drivers have to do the less they can do. But, people get in less (and less severe) crashes than they did before all the automated/safety systems started getting installed. So, it seems, removing as much human as you can from the control system is better for safety.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223756540\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022192351\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221584202912\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022137807\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mikegarrison\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, mikegarrison said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExpecting humans to be the failsafe backups for self-driving cars is a terrible idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is also a terrible idea to expect the average driver to be the primary system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI too drive a manual transmission(less than 10% of all passenger cars on the road in the US) and I pride myself on my ability to handle my automobile(manual trans drivers are 40% less likely to crash, old insurance stat from back in the \u002780s).

That\u0027s a bad place to be. But consider a situation on a highway where all the automated cars(and the equipped human driven cars) can send and receive a signal to each other about whats going on around them. A one or two car accident doesn\u0027t become a twenty car pileup. Also, AEB/FEB radars the car in front of the car in front of you so, reaction is better than what you as a driver can react to. An autonomous car highway system would not be perfect even with better tech than we have now but, I believe it would improve overall safety and fuel consumption. The added benefit would be pushing the tech to improve and the system would have to be able to deal with non-automated cars from the start so that tech would also improve.

I do think the automation in airplanes has made flying safer. But I also think it has left pilots less prepared to take over the flying. Of course there are some pilots who keep up their practice and training and such, just like there will be some drivers who head to the racetrack on the weekends even if they let the car drive them through the commute five days a week. But there are a whole series of crashes (not just the two recent ones) where flight crews failed to remember to do really basic things like control their airspeed, recover from a stall, or turn off a malfunctioning system and fly manually. And pilots have mandatory training, checklists to follow, co-pilots, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo while automating driving may save some accidents, it will lead to other failure modes. And it is a big mistake to expect that human occupants in the car will be able to go from thinking about what they are going to have for dinner that night or chatting about the latest gossip to suddenly diagnosing a failure in the car automation and making emergency input that will avoid a crash. This case in California is a great example -- the guy *knew* that previously the car had made strange lunges toward the center barrier in that same spot, but on the day of his fatal accident he was busy playing a game on his phone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you get in a bus or a taxi, there is no expectation as a passenger that you can or will be able to drive the vehicle. As far as you are concerned it is fully autonomous. Yet, you can still be involved in a crash. I think that this is a better model for cars than the model of incrementally improving \u0022active cruise control\u0022 but relying on the driver to still be watchful and ready to countermand the vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-12T00:06:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, self driving isn\u0027t just for cities and highways...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://cleantechnica.com/2021/03/10/farming-construction-autonomous-is-going-to-be-more-than-vehicles/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://cleantechnica.com/2021/03/10/farming-construction-autonomous-is-going-to-be-more-than-vehicles/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI swear the intro to the tractor video is trying to evoke the Cylon theme from the BSG reboot....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/iLQgzXOAu2A?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA car?
