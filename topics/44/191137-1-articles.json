Rather than using photon pressure, as with a lightsail, the lasers would be focused to superheat the air under the craft, causing plasma explosions that accelerate it upward against an aerospike nozzle. Its nose would form an inlet to compress air into the heating zone like a ramjet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Lightcraft.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022120.00\u0022 height=\u0022180\u0022 width=\u0022150\u0022 src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Lightcraft.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere have been several proofs of concept constructed and tested, with decent degrees of success. It\u0027s a neat idea. An orbital version would use a huge laser to track the ascending vehicle, which would carry onboard propellant to release into the heating zone as the available atmospheric reaction mass decreased. The vehicle would also carry a small amount of onboard chemical propellant for final orbital insertion once it was out of range\u00A0(alternately, an orbiting solar-powered laser array could be used in place of the ground-based array once out of range).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea of a spacecraft rising on a column of light, a sort of bifrost space elevator,\u00A0is common in science fiction:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022laserLaunch.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002266.67\u0022 height=\u0022400\u0022 width=\u0022600\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/images/spaceport/laserLaunch.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt got me thinking.

Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E might even work, but I\u0027d doubt it.\u00A0 You could use only vacuum optimized engines, but you could do that from air (and possibly mountain) launch as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d also wonder if the trip down might be more valuable.\u00A0 If you could kill all your lateral velocity in the \u0022right part of the atmosphere\u0022 (and then not care about parachutes or retrorockets) you might save more than 1000m/s worth of mass.\u00A0 I\u0027m also unsure of \u0022the right part of the atmosphere\u0022: is it the mesopause (lowest temperature, about 200K) or the stratopause (higher temperature 275K, but more than twice the pressure).\u00A0 I suspect the stratopause, considering that all that heat comes from adiabatic heating.\u00A0 If they reach nearly the same pressure, you will be cooler in the stratopause (don\u0027t know if they will reach the same pressure).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flibble","CreatedById":196830,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-27T08:53:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022
