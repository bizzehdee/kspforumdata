Both scenarios would have been risky: Atlantis would have had to speed up its launch schedule by a month, and the rescue itself would have required many many hours of station keeping, with two shuttles meters apart, while emergency EVAs were conducted and supplies transferred across. The Columbia crew would have had to stretch their consumables to last a month on orbit; they probably would have been required to spend 18 hours a day asleep in order to keep their breathing slow enough to keep the LiOH CO2 scrubbers from overloading.

Thiokol was building their SRBs in Utah, which necessitated breaking them down into segments that could be transported by rail. Aerojet\u0027s bid was to manufacture monolithic SRBs (no segments, no joints) at an existing facility in Florida within driving distance of KSC. But miraculously, Thiokol won the bidding. Why, you ask? Because the chairman of the Senate Space Committee happened to be the senior senator from Utah, Frank Moss. He threatened to kill the Shuttle funding unless Thiokol was awarded the contract. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, the entire Shuttle design was shaped by politics. When NASA originally started looking at reusable shuttle designs back in the late 60s and early 70s, they were looking at SSTO and reusable first stage designs with stub wings. When they went to the administration looking for funding, Nixon balked at the price and told them to see about sharing the costs with the Air Force. The Air Force wanted a reusable vehicle as well, but one of their requirements was for the vehicle to be able to launch, execute its mission, and then land at the end of its first orbit. This required a cross-range gliding capability of over 1,000 miles, far beyond what the stub-wing designs NASA wanted could provide. So, they settled on the large delta-wing configuration you see in the final Shuttle design. But, adding all that additional weight in wings and structural bracing, they could no longer support a SSTO, or even a reusable first stage design, so they went with the now familiar stage-and-a-half design with the disposable fuel tank and reusable SRBs. And then, after the design phase was completed and contracts were finalized, the Air Force pulled out of the project, choosing instead to rely on expendable boosters. (Which is why the Shuttle launch complex at Vandenberg was never completed.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, I think space exploration is much better handled by private corporations.
