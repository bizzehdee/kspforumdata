The airflow generated by backward-firing rockets would entrain airflow through the duct. At supersonic speeds, the external airflow would also be compressed by a ramjet-style intake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe combination of entrained air and fuel-rich rocket exhaust would allow external air to oxidize part of the rocket\u0027s fuel, which would allow oxidizer to be conserved until at high altitudes.

They might achieve something around double Isp, but have quite a large mass penalty due to large ductwork and thus, while they make an SSTO easier, it is not significantly so. Additionally their airbreathing thrust achievable can be quite limited due to the large ductwork eventually needed - at very large sizes, getting the through-flow and the exhaust to mix becomes very difficult, meaning either lots of small heavy engines, or a single large but lighter engine, that achieves much less Isp advantage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is compared to a SABRE, which weighs around four to five times as much, but achieves ten times the Isp, up to very high altitude and velocity, with plenty of thrust capability for the kind of vehicle targeted. Rescaling the SABRE may be difficult due to the variety of unique parts, but it is perfectly reasonable to do so, as it\u0027s a fairly straightforward engine overall, and doesn\u0027t have air-exhaust mixing issues. As such the combustion chamber is quite happy to enlarge or shrink.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Decent Weasel","CreatedById":74583,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-08T18:40:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh my god, you guys are so awesome \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
