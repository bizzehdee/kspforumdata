You won\u0027t be necessarily coming back exactly in the way you were. If you set yourself in an eccentric orbit around the sun, with an apoapsis outside Earth\u0027s orbit and a periapsis inside it, depending on how you could encounter it, you could bend your path effectively and get ejected at Earth\u0027s prograde vector while not coming from it\u0027s retrograde vector, thus gaining velocity. When you enter in an hyperbolic orbit, you will exit the object\u0027s SOI at the same speed you entered it, but you can use the object\u0027s gravity to pick up speed by changing your ejection orientation \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
