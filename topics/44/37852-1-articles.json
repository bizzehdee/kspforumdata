In order to have an object locked it must: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Have an atraction attitude, i.e., an attitude that, due to the gravitational gradient, is accelerated towards, and\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) A way to dissipated energy, e.g. a flexible structure that transforms some of the work done on it by the gravity gradient into heat, which is then radiated away from the spacecraft.

(You just make sure that the rotational position of the object is always hardcoded to be with its longest axis pointing toward the primary\u0027s center. Just like the game makes a time-parameterized equation for the linear position of the ship (at time=t it will have x=f(t), y=g(t) and z=h(t), for some functions f,g, and h), it could make a time-parameterized equation for the rotational position of the ship: at time=t it will have theta=F(t), rho=G(t), and phi=H(t), for some F,G,and H functions. But the hard part would be deciding whether or not you should set up equations that preserve existing constant rotation, or set up ones that cause tidal locking, when first going onto rails. The decision would be largely arbitrary since in reality any object would become tidally locked EVENTUALLY since there\u0027s no such thing as a 100% radially symmetrical object - imperfections will make there be *something* for the tide to act upon, and also they would make there be *something* to dampen the oscillations a little bit. It\u0027s just that this \u0022EVENTUALLY\u0022 might be longer than the duration of the solar system so it becomes a moot point. Trying to decide if an object is \u0022elongated enough\u0022 to put it on tide-lock rails instead of constant-rotation rails would be a sort of made up arbitrary decision.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Scientific Moustache","CreatedById":63546,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-21T10:44:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ebut it is impossible to achieve in KSP no matter how long and uneven your mass is. any satellite get s approximated as its mass at CoM\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OtherDalfite","CreatedById":8317,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-21T15:01:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Scientific Moustache\u0022 data-cite=\u0022The Scientific Moustache\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ebut it is impossible to achieve in KSP no matter how long and uneven your mass is. any satellite get s approximated as its mass at CoM\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you were to leave a very long, unbalanced craft up and you stayed focus on it at 1x timewarp for a very long while, you would eventually see this effect come into play.
