Lets say, the exhaust fumes masses as much as the rocket and the rocket is standing still.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the exhaust leaves the rocket with a certain force, half of that force is in the exhaust and half is in the rocket. Both move away from each other with the same speed. Both have then the same kinetic energy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the rocket is moving, then still exhaust and rocket move away from each other and the same speed (if both have the same weight).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBUT since the rocket was moving, the exhaust has less kinetic energy, because it is has the force minus the speed the rocket had before burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the rocket has the burn force PLUS the speed. So the rocket has more kinetic energy than the exhaust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis goes so far that the exhaust can be moving forward AFTER the burn, if the exhaust velocity is smaller than the velocity of the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets say, exhaust velocity is 5000 m/s. But the rocket before the burn is moving at 10.000 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, after the burn, the exhaust is STILL moving at 5000 m/s forward. While the (hypothetical) rocket (of same mass) is moving forward with 15.000 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(At higher velocities, this gets funky, because of Einstein, but these speeds we are not talking about and relativity effects are not computed in KSP anyway.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-24T15:49:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SSSPutnik\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SSSPutnik\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat doesn\u0027t gel with the wiki description of it...

Then Oberth showed that you don\u0027t get energy for free with the conservation of momentum, and everyone was happy again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcept that they decided to give a fancy name to the thing, which gave people the impression that there is something complicated or confusing about the Oberth effect. If you just accept that there is such thing as the conservation of momentum, then the Oberth effect becomes a trivial consequence of it. You gain delta-v from a rocket burn, and you lose kinetic energy to gravity. Because kinetic energy is proportional to the square of the velocity, you have more velocity remaining at a certain altitude, if you did the burn while moving at a high velocity than at a low velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
