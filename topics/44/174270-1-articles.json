J-2X has the lowest isp of the three replacements but still 27s better than J-2, and a thrust upgrade, but 600kg extra mass. We could rescale it for the same efficiency but lower mass and thrust, but then we\u0027re making a new engine (which would be possible but not ideal). RS-25 is the heaviest and has the most thrust, let\u0027s say we rescale it to 50% giving 1100kN and 1750kg, which is worse than J-2 mass-wise, although it has better efficiency. And RL-10, if you sacrifice half of your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E (5 engines, 550kN) gives you about 1400kg in mass for 465s.

The full scale RS-25 would only be used for being available, as it is also not the best, although it is still great and semi-readily available. However, IIRC it is not restartable. A 50% RS-25 is a better option, and if you are going to the effort to make it that small you might as well add restart capability and remove unnecessary gimbal (lowering the mass) so the actual RS-25 50% Delta-V would be higher, maybe 4700m/s instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt that point, the RL-10 may look worse due to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E problems that 5 present and the space problems that 10 presents (and more failure points, but also engine out capability), however the extra 50-150m/s might be worth the cons, because they are available now rather than the 50% SSME which is not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlus, I checked, and boiloff between the two split TLI burns on a 5x RL-10 setup isn\u0027t actually that bad - Centaur currently boils off at about 17% per day (and they are aiming for 0.1% with ACES so that is definitely improvable), so for 2-3 extra hours in orbit that\u0027s a 2% reduction in fuel, and assuming that directly correlates to delta-V (it doesn\u0027t but it\u0027s close enough) and only half of the fuel mass is effected (the split burn) gives the 5x RL-10 4771m/s, which is better than the 50% SSME.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd you might not even need five, given the mass reductions elsewhere and the fact that you have 400m/s more Delta-V than the actual S-IVB you could probably go down to four, or even three if you were feeling adventurous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, this is not counting politics. From purely a \u0022MAKE SATURN V SMALL AND LIGHT\u0022 perspective, RL-10s seem like a pretty good choice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack to the second stage, actually the RD-120 might be better than the SSME if only slightly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as the first stage goes, not doing all of the math, just a table.
