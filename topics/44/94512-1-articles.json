And say because your delivery people are kerbals, they didn\u0027t attach any kind of retro thruster or parachutes or such on the package, therefore the thing will freefall down all the way to Earth. So, if you are dropping such a package from the ISS, what kind of shielding would you need to keep the package intact, what would it look like, and what kind of damage would it do to its destination?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor this scenario, imagine the package is a 30cm wide cake weigh about 1.5kg. Cake does not need to retain full shape on arrival, just need to look something resembling a cake more than a mush of sweet mess. You are allowed to use whatever technology needed to achieve this purpose of keeping the cake intact(maybe even hard sci-fi), but not using anything active to slow the speed of the package before impact, including parachute/thruster, etc. In other words, aero/lithobraking only! Sounds like a lot of space bubble wrappers!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdea came from another talk with my friend, where he jokingly demanded me for a birthday cake. So I joked about delivering it from orbit. Now I am interested how that could possibly happen. The reason for the \u0022lithobraking only\u0022 clause, is because I also want to deliver as much damage as possible from the act of sending the cake over. And the reason for \u0022keeping the cake intact\u0022 clause, is because I imagine it would be hilarious when the survivors open the capsule crashing through the sky just to see a cake inside saying \u0022happy birthday\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave fun with your imagination, and happy holidays everyone!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pixel of Life","CreatedById":45646,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-25T21:06:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003ENevermind, I completely misunderstood this whole thing\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut little wings on it and mount skis under it, then land it on a ski slope or something.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-25T21:12:37Z\u0022 title=\u002212/25/2014 09:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainKorhonen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MBobrik","CreatedById":59889,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-25T21:25:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CaptainKorhonen\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CaptainKorhonen\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003ENevermind, I completely misunderstood this whole thing\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut little wings on it and mount skis under it, then land it on a ski slope or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eput four of them around it so that it lands like a maple seed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-25T21:27:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIMO last second \u0022suicide burn\u0022 with massive TWR is the best for non-human delivery.
