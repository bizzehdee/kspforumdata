The granules you see there - which are roughly the width of Brazil - are the tops of huge vertical currents in the sun\u0027s convective zone; Benard cells. I think this is really cool, but I haven\u0027t found a ton of information on them. Does anyone know just how tall the individual convection currents are?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
