One\u0027s first impulse is to say \u0022Good!\u0022, because the existing stockpiles are largely the result of nuclear weapons production in years past. But it\u0027s an excellent material to power radiothermal generators , since it has a reasonable half-life (87.7 years), a high decay energy, and is an alpha emitter (thus needing less heavy shielding). Note this picture of a pellet of the oxide glowing under its own heat. There are a number of proposed deep space missions that will only launch if they can use Pu-238 that no one seems to have. Russia sold about 16 kilos to the US in the early 1990s, but just a few years ago they backed out of a deal for another 10. No one\u0027s sure - or no one\u0027s saying - if that\u0027s because they would rather hold on to it themselves, or if they don\u0027t really have that amount left any more. To give you an idea, the proposed Europa mission to Jupiter would need about 22 kilos.\u003Cp\u003EThere are efforts to restart Pu-238 production, but as you would imagine, this is not the work of a moment. As opposed to helium, which is sitting around in natural gas underground, you\u0027re not going to be mining any plutonium. It has to be made from neptunium-237, which you only get from spent nuclear fuel rods, and the process is expensive, no fun, and hot as blazes in every sense of the word. Even if the proposed restart gets going, it\u0027ll only produce about 1.5kg per year. So if you have any plans that involve large amounts of plutonium - and they\u0027d better involve space exploration, dude - you should take this into account.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if they can use other, more abundant forms of nuclear fuel...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-08T15:09:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERTGs have been used for civilian purposes; the soviets used them to power dozens of lighthouses and navigation beacons in remote areas.

Few metres of concrete with steel rebar and lead plates protects from gamma, neutron, alpha and beta radiation. If you have only alpha rays, a plastic bottle will keep everything inside.
