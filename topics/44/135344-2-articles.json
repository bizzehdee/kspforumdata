Like colonies and stuff. Those will all(?) die for a variety of reasons. There will be a few ships that are supposed to be 100% efficient. Those will probably last until the point at which humans on Earth all die out, and maybe some time after, but not forever, as detailed in the next paragraph.\u00A0You see, everyone on Earth is getting more and more powerful with each new invention. Look at us today. The late 2010s. Compare today to the late 1910s. Compare it to the 1500s. Compare it to the 11500s BC. Everyone has access to more and more physical power as time goes on. That includes those who oppose mainstream human society. Can you imagine, a thousand years from now, a bunch of extremely mainstream-human-society-opposing\u00A0people (not gonna write the word here because I don\u0027t want to end up on some crime\u00A0watchlist) explode the Moon or something, or change Mars\u0027 orbit so that it will hit Earth? You see, even the bad people. I predict that in less than\u00A0two\u00A0hundred years, someone is gonna send a large\u00A0asteroid to hit Earth. They\u0027d be just like today\u0027s extremely\u00A0mainstream-human-society-opposing people possessing \u0022objects of mass wrecking\u0022\u00A0(again, crime watchlists). And there won\u0027t be anything we can do about it.

There is almost no life on Earth designed to last centuries or millennia in an enclosed space. Either way, there will be no machines that can maintain a friendly environment for centuries or millennia, you need a planet for that, and given the circumstances, I doubt there would be one. If we send a starship to any other star, it will probably not make the journey without problems, and if it does, it can\u0027t seed another planet effectively enough. If you want to make a stable environment for life to survive for geologic timescales, I suspect you need \u003Cem\u003Eevery single living thing\u003C/em\u003E from the original environment to be there for\u00A0a copy of it to be effective. We can\u0027t do that. DNA will not last the time it takes to get to another star, even without the obvious pummelling by cosmic rays and such.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack to Earth, even if there are no catastrophic intentional destroyings (yet again, an euphemism because I don\u0027t want to end up on crime watchlists), there are problems with overpopulation, and garbage, and food, etc. We keep filling up land with farms, and then eventually, people. If a little land gets covered up by glaciers in a cooling event, this won\u0027t stop anything, sea levels will have fallen and more land will be available for farms and eventually people. If a little land is lost to the sea in a warming event, this won\u0027t stop anything either, it\u0027s worse. There\u0027s a whole continent that would\u0027ve\u00A0just opened up to farms and eventually people. First, people cover all the available land with farms. They\u0027ll proceed to urbanizing it. Then high-rising it. We now face a problem. As more and more farmland on Earth is replaced by cities, there\u0027re more and more people and less and less to feed them. There will be riots and revolutions. And they\u0027re not going to change a thing. Most people are going to starve to death. The ones who have water and food won\u0027t die out. Yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s happening to all the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Egarbage\u003C/em\u003E? It\u0027s being either put underground or into the oceans. Excavating is expensive, so it\u0027s probably the latter. The oceans become dead. Nothing can live in them. Not even sea plants or algae. And that is Earth\u0027s next problem. Those marine lifeforms produce about 70% of Earth\u0027s atmospheric O2. We lose them, we lose about 70% of Earth\u0027s atmospheric O2. We can\u0027t breathe 6% oxygen. Especially not with so much other stuff in the air, stuff from our garbage, stuff we\u0027ve emitted with machines, stuff the dead stuff has emitted, etc. In terms of composition, Earth\u0027s\u00A0atmosphere is going to look more like Titan\u0027s does today. Lots of nitrogen, some methane and oxygen. As most of us know, methane mixed with oxygen is bad. Like, inside-a-rocket-engine\u00A0bad. Whatever survived the disappearance of most of the atmospheric O2, the poisoning of the oceans (and therefore the precipitation, and therefore most rivers and lakes and \u003Cem\u003Eusable water\u003C/em\u003E) is not going to survive being burnt to a crisp in the next lightning storm\u00A0and poof, suddenly\u00A0the atmosphere\u0027s on fire over a quarter of the planet. This will boil water in some of these areas. Making clouds.\u00A0Generating more thunderstorms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe oceans are gonna be mostly gone eventually because of this. The surface temperature is gonna be like a hundred\u00A0degrees Celsius. An atmosphere of nitrogen and water vapour, a small bit of oxygen, maybe about as much carbon dioxide, a bit of methane in there.\u00A0You can only survive if you are an anaerobic deep-sea\u00A0microbe living in the Arctic Ocean. Things will cool down in the next few million years, but life on Earth will be starting with microbes and is going to have a billion or less years to live because of the Sun.\u00A0Not enough time to evolve into anything large.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR: Everything you can think of is probably going to have some impact,\u00A0I don\u0027t think our species will get through the next ten thousand years, and life on Earth is very, very, very close to its near-end from which it can never fully recover before it definitely dies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-31T05:40:43Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2016 05:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Findthepin1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003En\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-30T23:55:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t really see much that could wipe out humanity atm apart from either cosmic threats or we evolve and or no longer \u0027human\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther things on the list could maybe kill 99%, but some would survive and start it all again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"daniel l.","CreatedById":57763,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-31T00:47:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would like to think that we wont die out, We become sufficiently paranoid of the risks that we do everything we can to avoid them, I\u0027d like to believe that we will avoid natural disasters by becoming a multi planet species, Death will no longer exist because of new medical procedures and digital transcendence, And ultimately we will if there has to be an end we will alter ourselves beyond the point that we could be called human, But will we die out in a tragic manner?
