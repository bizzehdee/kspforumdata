Although negotiations are ongoing to pass FY 2014 appropriations, it is possible no agreement will be reached, requiring a shutdown of ordinary operations. If a FY 2014 continuing resolution is not passed before 12:01 AM on October 1, NASA can only engage in activities related to the orderly shutdown of operations and performance of excepted activities. As a required part of a shutdown, employees who will not be performing activities excepted by law will be furloughed and unable to work for the duration of the shutdown, unless recalled for an excepted activity. According to our executed shutdown plan, all employees were notified by September 30 whether they were excepted/on-call or non-excepted in the event of a shutdown. If you have questions on your status, please consult with your supervisor.\u0022\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://nasawatch.com/archives/2013/10/nasa-furlough-p.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://nasawatch.com/archives/2013/10/nasa-furlough-p.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone know whether it\u0027s really happening?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-01T08:59:52Z\u0022 title=\u002210/01/2013 08:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by czokletmuss\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Canopus","CreatedById":57774,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-01T09:15:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the United states are shutting down right now.
