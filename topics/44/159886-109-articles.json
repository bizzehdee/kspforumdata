Since it\u0027s looking more and more like Block I will be the main variant of the SLS (at least for the next 4-5\u00A0years or so), most, if not all, of the shuttle legacy parts are going to be depleted by the time Block IB comes into service. Stuff like the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E casings and the old SSMEs have replacements lined up if course, and for the SSMEs in particular, I believe they\u0027re already in production, but the original plan had the Block IB flying for several years using this extraneous STS hardware, and a full switch to new SLS hardware only occurring with the Block II.\u00A0Now it\u0027s looking more like IB will\u00A0maybe fly one or two\u00A0times with the old STS stuff before they\u00A0run\u00A0out. Basically: the transition date\u0027s moved up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn interesting possiblity this opens up is an \u0022early switch\u0022 so to speak. NASA may decide that it\u0027d be more efficient to design Block IB to fly with the more advanced replacements from the beginning, instead of switching halfway through. This is speculation, but such a plan might allow some optimization of the Block IB design work. The remaining shuttle hardware would either be used up on the final launches of the Block I or placed back into storage. The new, better-performing hardware would be used to give Block IB a bigger \u0027kick.\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, many of you may have read that neat little discussion a few pages back about the advanced boosters plan made\u00A0when Block IA was the successor to Block I. Still, let me restate what happened with that just to make it clearer.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe original plan for the SLS was an upgrade path called Block IA. Block IA was essentially Block I, but with the solids replaced with an advanced booster design. The first of the two contenders for those boosters was Rocketdyne\u0027s proposal. They proposed to replace the SRBs with an F1 derivative powered by RP-1 strap-on tanks. The second\u00A0proposal was that of Orbital ATK. They proposed to stick with solids, but use a better, more powerful design they christened the \u0022Dark Knight,\u0022 named such due to its distinctive black appearance thanks to its more advanced materials.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe primary advantage of Rocketdyne\u0027s proposal was power. The F1-B strap-on would undeniably make the SLS Block IA the most powerful rocket ever made.\u00A0SLS performance issues would cease to be an issue. There were disadvantages however, namely in the fact that it would require significant modifications to the launch infrastructure at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, including (but not limited to), the pad, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, and mobile launcher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe primary advantage of Orbital ATK\u0027s proposal was backwards compatibility. For the same reason Rocketdyne\u0027s proposal would\u0027ve been difficult, ATK\u0027s would\u0027ve been easy. The disadvantage was that the Dark Knights, while significantly more powerful than their predecessors, weren\u0027t going to meet the requirements for SLS Block II.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUltimately, it was a moot question. After some deliberation, NASA decided that neither proposal would be used then, and that the Block IB development path would be easier than that of the Block IA. The advanced boosters upgrade would be deferred indefinitely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the Dark Knights out of the running,\u00A0Orbital ATK could still capitalize on their engineering\u00A0work. Their new engine design was solid (pun not intended), but there was room for refinement. As part of their work on OmegA, they made a new \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E design, one that shared an old name, but is undoubtedly new. They called it CASTOR-1200.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill with me? We\u0027re almost done. Okay, so, now that the SLS is looking into the advanced boosters again, Orbital ATK (now part of Northrop-Grumman) submitted a new proposal for the Booster End-of-Life Extension (BOLE), and it\u00A0knocks the Dark Knights out of the water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022e1KCzWu.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/e1KCzWu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe new boosters would allow a payload performance of roughly 45 mT to TLI with the SLS Block IB, which is basically on-par with the\u00A0Saturn V! Needless to say, this would be a \u003Cem\u003Esubstantial\u003C/em\u003E increase in the Block IB\u0027s performance (and, IMO, another nail in the Block II\u0027s coffin).

What I\u0027m trying to articulate though, is that I\u0027m willing to speculate that Block 2 configuration you linked would not meet the 130 mT requirement.\u00A0I\u0027ve heard credible rumors that the dropping of the 5th RS-25 and the J-2X upper stage early on in the SLS program meant that some sort of supplement would be required in the future in order to beef up Block 2. Thus, they may be re-designating what they were recently\u00A0calling Block 2 as Block 1B enhanced (since it doesn\u0027t make that figure), and pushing out the \u003Cem\u003Enew\u003C/em\u003E Block 2 further into the future, with a new upper stage or side-mounted LRBs so that it \u003Cem\u003Edoes\u003C/em\u003E meet the 130 mT payload requirement. Y\u0027know, if it\u0027s ever built.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s just speculation, but it would explain\u00A0why the BOLE document\u00A0referred\u00A0to the SLS configuration with their boosters as Block 1B enhanced instead of just calling it Block 2. That seems too intentional to just be an oversight or mistake.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-04-15T19:58:35Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2019 07:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by jadebenn\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-16T13:01:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedOther\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed6861000330\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026amp;module=system\u0026amp;controller=embed\u0026amp;url=https://twitter.com/NASASpaceflight/status/1117865513185611776\u0022 style=\u0022height:509px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom interview with Bridenstein:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedOther\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed7190224255\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026amp;module=system\u0026amp;controller=embed\u0026amp;url=https://twitter.com/SciGuySpace/status/1118134923146211328\u0022 style=\u0022height:533px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nightside","CreatedById":150244,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-16T13:08:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had to look one of those acronyms up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPPE: Power Propulsion Element\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhat do we know about this thing?
