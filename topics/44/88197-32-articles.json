However, assuming that there is a valid, real efffect here; if it is so tiny, then it\u0027s unlikely to have any practical use so far as I can see (solar sails and ion engines would likely be more useful). If it\u0027s a case of it being an effect that can be amplified in some way with teh right setup, that may be more interesting.
