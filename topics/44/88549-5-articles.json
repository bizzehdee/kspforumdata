Lately I\u0027ve become convinced that the \u0022uncanny valley\u0022 also applies to scientific accuracy in sci-fi movies. The closer a movie comes to being scientifically accurate, the more people respond negatively to every detail that isn\u0027t exactly perfect. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsider, if you look at sci-fi movies like Star Wars or Star Trek, people rarely complain that they\u0027re horribly inaccurate. The most you get is people occasionally mumbling that, \u0022lasers don\u0027t work like that\u0022, in an effort to look clever. However, these minor complaints never impact the reviews or ratings despite the fact that these movies are so scientifically inaccurate that a reasonably bright 2 year old could come up with a list of scientific flaws as long as my arm. Indeed, it\u0027s insulting to science to apply the \u0022science-fiction\u0022 label to them at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn comparison, movies like Gravity, which are vastly more accurate in every way, have professional scientists (thank you Neil deGrasse Tyson!), critics, and KSP players blasting it for comparatively minor orbital mechanics inaccuracies, which were acknowledged by the writer/director as being intentional to make the story work at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of simply accepting that certain liberties were taken to further the story, these people get absolutely stuck on these scientific inaccuracies, and actually start hating the entire movie, whatever other merits it might have.

Star Trek showed an optimistic future where humanity had largely evolved beyond greed, hatred, and shortsightedness. That\u0027s what made it Star Trek. There were still external threats, sure, (see Romulans, Dominion, Borg, etc), but Humanity met these threats as a united species, along with fellow Federation members. Even DS9 was mostly optimistic in that respect, and it was by far the darkest of the true Star Trek series.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want dark and gritty sci-fi, then watch the new Battlestar Galactica, but that\u0027s not what Star Trek is, and it\u0027s not what it should strive to be.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-11T01:23:28Z\u0022 title=\u002211/11/2014 01:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Firov\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T06:58:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PakledHostage\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PakledHostage\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell I\u0027ll let you all know what I think when I see it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just got home from the theater...

The Federation ideal is that money is not a thing, we don\u0027t accumulate resources for power and prestige, etc. They joke in Voyager for example that in some cities there are professional pick-pockets that steal your wallet because that is part of the expected culture of that city. They are cited as \u0027usually\u0027 giving them back. The problem though is that in Star Trek, the vast majority of scenes you see are all in Federation property. Their starships, starbases, Headquarters, etc. One thing that the Federation embraced was that EVERY ship was a potential diplomatic ship to a new species and therefor needed to exemplify the facade of the Federation. They all look nice on the interior and exterior, their uniforms are snazzy, etc. We get to see the converse to this in other species and in how their ships are dirtier, blockier, etc, their civilizations are clearly less refined, and so on. It helps to show how the Federation is this wonderful utopian ideal. Albiet one with some external enemies, but that doesn\u0027t keep it from being a utopia. What keeps it from being a utopia is the fact that the Federation ideal doesn\u0027t apply to all of the Federation. Effectively the main colonies that exist (and anything in the Sol System of course) exists on the Federation ideal. No money, just the nigh infinite resources of the replicators. However they do hint at replicator rations as a currency. Which makes sense! They are very clear that the Federation does NOT have infinite power, and therefor you cannot have every citizen of Earth wanting to get a space ship so they can have fun in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom the little info I have on the subject, even in the utopian areas, you basically get this daily allotment of replicator rations and there is some system that converts them into what you want. IE: Food might cost 0.1 rations, a tricorder might cost 3 due to the much higher energy costs to synthesize the dense metals and such. They never explicitly call this out because of course, the Federation has no money after all. There is some indication that you can save up the rations and that you can go into debt, but that there isnt too much consequence for doing so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery clearly though, once you leave the immediate \u0022core\u0022 of the Federation and the homeworlds of the major members of the Federation (Vulcan as an example) this drops off quite quickly. You have planets in effective poverty that need to trade goods with other civilizations for resources, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have always been fine with the existence of such worlds, but what I have always thought was a little interesting was how heavily \u0022out of sight out of mind\u0022 the Federation gets about these worlds. They will protect them and give them some resources and whatnot, but rather then prevent them descending into this frontier-survivalist state in pretty much direct contravention with Federation ideals, they just let it happen and more to the point place the burden on THEM to get to the utopian ideal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is somewhat amusing is I believe (and I could be quite wrong on this part) that this is one of the things that pisses the Romulans off about the Federation. Is that the Federation gets all high and mighty and yet is clearly being a hypocrit. However, the Romulans are not this perfect Federation we have seen, so of course they are wrong and bad. Not to say they aren\u0027t. They are space Rome after all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mazon Del","CreatedById":32991,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T18:01:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nli2work\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nli2work\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt deserves all the praises heaped on it.
