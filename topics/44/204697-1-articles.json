Your engine bell has to fit into the vehicle\u0027s interstage, and you must be able to actually build one - all without performance gains getting eclipsed by extra mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-05T14:56:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, there will be a balance between added mass and expansion ratio gains.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProbably you can calculate both wrt nozzle length and find where they intersect for maximum efficiency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-05T23:32:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe the actual question was what ambient pressure you should assume. I\u0027m pretty sure mostly engineers just assume vacuum. The slight amount of pressure actually present at the altitudes where second stages are used is so close to vacuum that it makes no practical difference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
