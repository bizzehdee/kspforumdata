Otherwise, it can\u0027t generate power. To spin a turbine, you\u0027ve got to move the heat out of the reactor and into a fluid, and then you\u0027ve got to allow that fluid to expand through the turbine, and then you\u0027ve got to do something with that fluid. Usually that means condensing the fluid back down by cooling it with some outside heat sink so you can run it back through the loop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpace doesn\u0027t have any readily-available heat sinks, though; any heat rejection has to be done via radiators, and that is limited by surface area (not to mention mass). If you\u0027re in space and you\u0027re using liquid hydrogen as a propellant already, then you should just be running the liquid hydrogen through the reactor and using it as your working fluid, then venting it through the engine as your engine exhaust. If you\u0027re doing that, though, you should just skip the turbine altogether and boom, you\u0027ve got an ordinary nuclear thermal rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there any use for adding something further? Maybe. The limiting factor on the efficiency of a nuclear thermal rocket is typically the temperature of the reactor. You don\u0027t want it to melt, after all. The temperature inside the RS-25 is actually higher than the temperature inside a nuclear thermal rocket for this reason; the NTR is just more efficient because it doesn\u0027t need to use any of that heavy oxygen in the reaction. In theory, I could imagine a design in which the waste heat from an NTR is pulled off by a propellant preheating loop which turns a turbine before sending the preheated propellant into the engine, and that turbine somehow sends electricity into the propellant downrange of the reactor, heating it up beyond the melting point of the reactor before it is exhausted. But that\u0027s a LOT of complexity for not a lot of utility.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224373576\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224134\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221710776113\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204885\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022darthgently\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nJust now, darthgently said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDepending on temperatures, that could be (nearly?) an ion engine.\u00A0 Sort of, right?\u00A0 Not sure, but would plasma be involved?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you can get up to around 5000 K, most of the hydrogen molecules will be disassociated into neutral hydrogen atoms, cutting the exhaust molecular weight in half and thus increasing exhaust speed and specific impulse.
