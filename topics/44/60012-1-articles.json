The original NASA shuttle design (the \u0022DC-3\u0022 design by Max Faget) was a small shuttle that would have had very little cross-range capability. It would have rode a reusable first-stage booster. There would have been no solid rocket boosters, and since the first stage would have required its own thermal protection system there would have been little or no ice buildup problem. But when they brought the budget proposal to the administration, Nixon got sticker shock and told them to go see if they could share the project costs with the Air Force, who was also in the market for a reusable spacecraft at that point. The Air Force wanted to be able to launch the vehicle into a polar orbit from Vandenburg AFB in California, deploy a satellite, then land at the launch site after one orbit to minimize the vehicle\u0027s exposure to anti-satellite weapons. This required the 1,000-mile cross range capability, which dictated the large delta wings to provide increased lift, which pushed the reusable first-stage off the table and led to the cascade of design compromises that led to the shuttle design we all know. Ironically, after the Challenger accident, the Air Force decided that the shuttle design (which they had essentially dictated to NASA) was too unreliable and expensive to operate, so they dropped their involvement in the shuttle program and started the EELV program, which developed the Atlas V and Delta IV rockets that are still in use today. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other political disaster in the shuttle program was the SRBs. When the contract for the SRBs was put to bid, Aerojet proposed monolithic boosters (one piece, no jointed segments) that would have been constructed and serviced at their existing facility that was a short drive from KSC in Florida. Morton Thiokol proposed construction and servicing of the SRBs at their facility in Utah, which required that the SRBs be produced in segments that could be transported by rail to and from Florida. They were more complex and much more expensive. But, in closed-door negotiations with NASA, the head of the Senate committee on Space Science, Frank Moss (who just happened to be the senior senator from Utah) made it abundantly clear that the funding for the shuttle program would die in committee if Morton Thiokol didn\u0027t win the contract.

When the contract for the SRBs was put to bid, Aerojet proposed monolithic boosters (one piece, no jointed segments) that would have been constructed and serviced at their existing facility that was a short drive from KSC in Florida. Morton Thiokol proposed construction and servicing of the SRBs at their facility in Utah, which required that the SRBs be produced in segments that could be transported by rail to and from Florida. They were more complex and much more expensive. But, in closed-door negotiations with NASA, the head of the Senate committee on Space Science, Frank Moss (who just happened to be the senior senator from Utah) made it abundantly clear that the funding for the shuttle program would die in committee if Morton Thiokol didn\u0027t win the contract.

O-Rings, but read on). Unlike Columbia, the Challenger disaster was due purely because of horrible management on NASA\u0027s part, and could have been avoided by simply postponing the launch for a day or two. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SRB\u0027s had been designed and tested around specific launch conditions, including the temperature. On the day of the Challenger disaster the temperature at the launch pad was well below the minimum rated temperature of the SRBs. The MT engineers recognized that the O-Rings were well outside of their rated safe temperature and expected that they would be brittle enough to crack, and as such, completely unsafe to launch. The engineers obviously urged NASA to wait until a warmer day to launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENASA management knew about all of this as they had the SRB design specs and had consulted with Morton Thiokol about the launch temperature that day, but in the end they decided that since the SRBs hadn\u0027t failed yet, it was completely impossible for them to ever fail, no matter the launch conditions. This is a distressingly common thought process in NASA it seems. Anyway, with that in mind they decided to disregard not just the original design limitations of the SRBs but also of the engineers who actually built the things and launch anyway. As a result of NASA\u0027s management, Challenger and her entire crew were lost .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile large monolithic boosters could probably have handled a launch that day due to the lack of O-Ring seals, the fact of the matter is, they shouldn\u0027t have launched that day at all, and they knew it beforehand. As such, it\u0027s not entirely fair to claim that the SRB\u0027s were inherently unsafe. Anything can, and likely will, fail if you try to use it well outside of it\u0027s original design limitations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
