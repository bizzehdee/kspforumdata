They don\u0027t operate at high pressures, but they still produce furiously radioactive daughter products that can reach the environment just like they can with uranium. The chances of such event are very small, but the point is that it\u0027s not true they don\u0027t exist for thorium.\u003Cp\u003EThey require U-235 or Pu-239 as boosters.

Recently (think it was 2008 or 2009) they developed a neutron emitter that is much easier and safer to use. I think it uses an isotope of strontium or something. I was looking around for it but couldnt find it (I think you understand that it isnt exactly a hot topic.) And what I was pointing at is that whilst a U235/Pu239 reactor must be constantly stabilized, a Th reactor must be constently unstabilized. It is inherently safe because it requires activation energy. If you ruptered a tank then everything could spew forth. Especially the xenon could be a problem. But this is where the LFTR comes in. If the vessel breaks it would drain out and then solidify. We then know where the problem is and a Fukushima like messup would be prevented. the proliferation concerns come when the Th is breed into U233. That is weapons grade material. The only thing that we should be thankfull for then is that it isnt easy to use because of the U232.

Yeah, those poopie heads.\u003Cp\u003EAnd when you search for proponents, you\u0027ll find weird preachers that talk crap about uranium and glorify thorium because they\u0027re conspiracy theorists and \u0022it\u0027s all about how USA wanted bombs\u0022.

The bias with thorium is great and grand. I have the book Super Fuel by Richard Martin. It is like a Manifest Destiny of energy production. And ya, I did sum it up as the reason we have Uranium and not Thorium is because of the bombs, but in reality it came down to politics and how, sadly, the side supporting Uranium had more charisma and other things (like positions in the NAVY which forwarded the development of nuclear submarines.) And yes, it is said that we are still using GEN-I and GEN-II reactors when the designs are already at GEN-IV\u002B for uranium and several incredible designs for Thorium.

Recently (think it was 2008 or 2009) they developed a neutron emitter that is much easier and safer to use. I think it uses an isotope of strontium or something. I was looking around for it but couldnt find it (I think you understand that it isnt exactly a hot topic.) And what I was pointing at is that whilst a U235/Pu239 reactor must be constantly stabilized, a Th reactor must be constently unstabilized. It is inherently safe because it requires activation energy. If you ruptered a tank then everything could spew forth. Especially the xenon could be a problem. But this is where the LFTR comes in. If the vessel breaks it would drain out and then solidify. We then know where the problem is and a Fukushima like messup would be prevented. the proliferation concerns come when the Th is breed into U233. That is weapons grade material.
