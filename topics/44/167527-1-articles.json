There are vastly more details, like not every journal is as reputable as the next. Just submitting it doesnt mean you will pass peer review. Just because it passes peer review it doesnt mean it wont be wholly rejected by the scientific community. Some journals might not accept work from a non-professional or non-qualified private person, others might.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, this bit is really important - if your hypothesis offers nothing that can be tested, no experiment that shows your hypothesis to be more accurate than current theory, then it is worth very little. It still might be interesting but it will be of very poor scientific value.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFact is, this happens every day, new science is constantly being generated, tested, shared, probed, reviewed, debated, and slowly, via all the various scientists working in a particular field, science that survives rigorous testing and provides enhanced prediction gradually gets absorbed into the larger body of accepted knowledge. Only VERY rarely is there one big discovery that sends ripples all through a field of science, hits the \u0022civilian\u0022 news or papers and gets talked about in public. This is another reason why people with BIG IDEAS!! are often rejected at first sight, because there just is no way that every tom, dick and harry are having field-breaking revelations in the car on the way to work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nREAL science. REAL research. Is boring. Monotonous. Unexciting. Oh wow, you discovered a sliiiiightly better way to look at this one type of cell from one specific sub-type of a certain species of plankton. Real research scientists churn out many, many articles over their careers, its a routine, day-to-day thing, and they slowly but surely improve our understanding of the world, even without any EUREKA moments or Nobel prizes. Theres a reason they only give out a handful of those per year.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat example with the plankton up there? That really would be worth writing up and posting to a journal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR - you write up all your data, all your findings, all your ideas, in as clear a way as possible so that people can take it away and test/repeat it, and send it to a journal who may, or may not, publish it. The scientific community takes it from there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS: for the love of god \u003Cstrong\u003Etell us what it is, Im dying!\u003C/strong\u003E It might be subject to criticism, but anyone who is rude or unnecessarily vehement or personal in their criticism \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eis the one being a poor scientist\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E, not you.
