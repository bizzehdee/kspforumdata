Mr banach consipres with mr tarski and come up with this mathematically interesting thing.

It has some pretty nasty consequences.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the same time, it is quite intuitive and leads to rather intuitive results. So it has become normal to use it, but, as far as I am concerned,\u00A0usually it is being announced specifically as being used for such and such theorem or theory. The video not stating it, left me a bit puzzled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, that doesn\u0027t really make his video bad. Since he had to concentrate the whole discussion into just 20 minutes of video, he chose to present the proof the Banach-Tarski paradoxon (which by the way was quite nice, since while leaving out all of the details, it was very clear). But he had to leave out so much, like the explanation why the result is no problem at all. I guess it falls under the same category as the video of Numberphile, where he extended his notion of convergence to Cesaro convergence, without stating it: It is not wrong, but...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jonfliesgoats","CreatedById":168077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-14T20:33:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s actually hard to find a well-produced video about the axiom of choice. \u00A0Here\u0027s a decent presentation by a TA at Cornell. \u00A0He has a thick, Indian accent but his presentation is accessible to the lay person.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/v8HtGwoPpMs?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022459\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
