Hypothetically how hard would it be to convert a standard rocket engine, say a Merlin Vacuum engine, to use an aerospike instead of the large nobium nozzle currently in use?\u00A0 If it could be done, would the resulting engine be use able from sea level to orbit?\u00A0 If so, this would seem to help make F9 second stage return much easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-13T07:01:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegardless of the difficulty of conversion, I doubt it would improve reusability prospects. An aerospike engine has less specific impulse than an equivalent engine with a bell optimized for its intended pressure regime. In other words, an aerospike at sea level is worse than a dedicated sea level nozzle, and an aerospike in space is worse than a dedicated vacuum nozzle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis means that the stage \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E drops, which in turn means it has to use more fuel to push the same payload to orbit, and that in turn means it has less fuel reserves for a potential return and landing. This effect is magnified by the fact that the Falcon 9 as a whole is quite biased towards the second stage in terms of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E distribution, so that the first stage doesn\u0027t go as fast and can be recovered sooner. You might as well keep the more efficient vacuum engine and make use of the larger reserves of fuel that it gives you to make recovery easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean, I get why you suggest this - using the MVac to land propulsively is probably not going to work very well at all, due to flow separation at sea level in the ridiculously overexpanded nozzle. An aerospike would get around this. But I\u0027m not convinced that the disadvantages in other regimes make it worth going for it. It would probably be easier for SpaceX to eject the nozzle prior to landing, and build a new one for the next flight. You wouldn\u0027t have 100% reusability, but probably still greater than 95%, and that can easily be worth it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-13T07:02:13Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2017 07:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-13T11:01:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm not an actual rocket engineer, but it sounds like a completely new engine to me.
