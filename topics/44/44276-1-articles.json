Your idea of why sounds as viable as anything I\u0027ve ever heard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tend to think we cannot ever know the answer to such things, simply because they are beyond our perceptual boundaries. What I mean by that is best explained from a personal experience and how I have reflected back on it over the years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn college I had a biology class that included a lab. I was lucky in this lab to have been one of the few students to have spotted an amoeba in the microscope. Pretty much the entire class took turns making observations of it, while the Teaching Assistant stepped in periodically to keep the scope focused with the amoeba in the center. If memory serves, we stimulated it with light, we even put a tiny needle point or something like that in there. What really amazed me about this thing was that, it was able to respond to our \u0027signals\u0027 (the light).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis made me realize that, while an amoeba can perceive my indirect actions and respond to those actions (as can many organisms with less extensive sensory, perceptual and \u0027cognitive\u0027 apparatus than ourselves) this simple fact of being able to perceive manifestations of humanity obviously does not mean that the amoeba can \u0027understand\u0027 a human. An amoeba is nothing but a little bag of chemical factories running on genetically determined fixed action patterns, cruising through its liquid environment in response to signals of where to find food and avoid predators. It has nothing like a \u0022nervous system\u0022 much les a complex central nervous system. Nonetheless, I had seen it for myself, an amoeba had a very limited capacity to respond to my actions, despite its scale of existence being thousands of times smaller than my own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suspect the same scaling issues must apply to we humans and the Universe itself. The 16 billion light year bubble that we can see with our \u0027sophisticated\u0027 telescopes seems enormously vast to us (as I\u0027m sure the amoeba\u0027s petry dish must seem to \u0027her\u0027). But what lies beyond that bubble? What lies within/beyond those black holes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour explanation seems as viable as any; but the main point I\u0027m making is, it may be that we are simply physically incapable of perceiving or understanding what is beyond these boundaries of our perception and thinking. If the \u0027entity\u0027 or process that is beyond those boundaries of our current abilities to perceive is so massive and complex that our universe appears to be little more than a petry dish to it, then short of us evolving into a different animal with new means of perception (cyborg anyone?) we may never really be able to comprehend it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-29T15:26:13Z\u0022 title=\u002208/29/2013 03:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Diche Bach\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T15:23:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe search for meaning is understandable, it\u0027s your brain trying to make sense of the world around you.
