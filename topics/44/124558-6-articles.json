We can tell this by the fact that we are not running out of steak. The amount of sequestered carbon is not increasing. We can tell this by the fact that atmospheric CO2 levels are increasing as we burn more fossil fuels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course it is.
