The \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAU_definition_of_planet\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EIAU\u0027s definition of planet in 2006\u003C/a\u003E left much to be desired. Determining from afar whether an object even fits the parameters set out by the IAU can be difficult, and the parameters themselves are tough to define exactly. Numerous alternative definitions have been proposed, such as any object orbiting the Sun and in hydrostatic equalibrium (round). However, the hydrostatic equilibrium definition runs into problems of its own. For example, how round is round enough? And even more troubling, there\u0027s the fact that lower strength materials, like ice, will assume a round shape at a lower mass than higher strength materials like rock and metal. For example, Vesta, the second largest body in the asteroid belt, has a mass of 2.6x10^20 kg, but is very much NOT a round body. Meanwhile, Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, is very much spherical but only has a mass of 1.1x10^20 kg- less than HALF of that of Vesta! Personally, I find the hydrostatic equilibrium proposal very unsatisfying for this reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEver since the IAU\u0027s definition came out in 2006 and throughout the subsequent controversy, I have been perplexed- why hasn\u0027t someone simply suggested a \u003Cem\u003Emass range\u003C/em\u003E for planetary bodies? Mass is easily measured through gravitational effects, and its the most basic property of any astronomical body. Some may counter that setting a mass range is \u0022arbitrary\u0022, but the whole debate of where to draw the line between planet and non-planet is about nothing more than where to draw an arbitrary line anyway. ANY definition of planet we come up with will be arbitrary. At least if we decide a planet is a planet based on mass, then we reduce the problem down to just a single number that is usually quite easy to measure. That single number is also the most basic of all astronomical properties.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, our own solar system neatly allows for a clear line to be drawn between planet and non-planet based on mass. The mass of Mercury, the least massive of the current eight planets, is 3.3x10^23 kg. The next most massive known body orbiting the Sun is Eris, at 1.7X10^22 kg- about 1/20 the mass of Mercury (Pluto weighs in at about 1.3x10^22 kg, just a little less than Eris). (In contrast, Earth weighs in at 6x10^24 kg.) So, we could draw the line at 10^23 kg for the planet-vs-dwarf planet line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is important to note that several moons weigh in excess of 10^23 kg (Titan, Ganymede, and Callisto). But since they do not orbit the Sun, they would not be considered planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, it doesn\u0027t have to be 10^23 kg, that\u0027s just one suggestion. You could try to put the dividing mass around the range where objects assume a spherical shape (10^20 kg?), but you run into the \u0022problem\u0022 that you\u0027d have non-round bodies that are considered planets, and round bodies that are considered non-planets, so if your goal was to segregate round and non-round bodies, you\u0027d fail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, does anyone know what the reasons are that a simple planetary definition based on mass has not gained more traction? It seems far and away the most sensible way to define planet vs. non-planet, and I can\u0027t understand why it\u0027s not floated around more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-02T17:41:26Z\u0022 title=\u002210/02/2014 05:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dkmdlb","CreatedById":70275,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-02T18:15:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t think that the origin of the body or its position in the solar system is relevant?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-02T18:28:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo lets say we base it on mass....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPluto and Ceres can\u0027t be planets without the moon being a planet as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes a nebula count as a planet all together they are pretty massive?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course they don\u0027t orbit the sun, and the moon orbits an object that isn\u0027t the sun (although we could easily stray into a debate about what constitutes a double planet).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut double planets... what if both of them are below your mass threshold... but combined they are above it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat makes mass more important to you than shape?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, I also wonder... how round is round enough?

If you make orbital simulations of the solar system, Mercury and Saturn belongs in the same class, things which have to be taken into account. Pluto is so lightweight and so far away that it is probably impossible to make simulation which have smaller computational errors than error from neglecting gravity of Pluto. On the other hand, from geological point of view Mercury, Pluto and Moon are much more close to each other than Saturn.
