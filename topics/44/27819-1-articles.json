It was unique in that humans had the capability to fight each other on a massive scale but did not have the capabilities that meant war would lead to mutually assured destruction. As civilisation advances and the energy scales available to us increase, the damage that we can do to one another will continue to increase but the incentive to do so disappears because no matter what one side can throw out in attack, the other side can do enough damage to make the cost of doing so too high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Cold War is the perfect example.
