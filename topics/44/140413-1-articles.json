The atmosphere is a bit more of an obstacle as it is in KSP, since you have to accelerate to Mach 25 instead of \u0022only\u0022 Mach 7. So real rockets like to get the heck out of it early on, and then spend a long time burning horizontal. They will usually pass apogee and lose a few kilometers in altitude before they manage to get their perigee above the planet\u0027s surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: compare \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.stack.imgur.com/l2jdj.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis graph\u003C/a\u003E of an Ariane 5\u0027s altitude during ascent.

During this phase it uses some of its propellant to counter act the falling and the rest goes into orbital energy. You can actually see this behaviour on most modern LV\u0027s with low thrust upper stages where the first stage boosts it up to a higher apoapsis which means more time for the upper stage to circularize.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dino1984","CreatedById":137690,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-24T10:40:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, thanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne more thing - can anyone tell me what orbits will those sats have and how they will be released?

Much like most geostationary launches, the launch vehicle places them into a transfer orbit, and the satellites fire an \u0022apogee motor\u0022 to circularize themselves when they reach the correct altitude. By using their maneuvering thrusters, they can then introduce subtle disfferences in their orbit that makes them drift apart over time until the correct separation distance has been achieved. Kind of like a reverse rendezvous maneuver, really.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe constellation will consist of 24 active satellites (plus some spares) in three groups of 8, each group in its own orbital plane offset by about 120 degrees (a third of an orbit) from the others.

There, it fires its RCS system and raises the perigee the remaining five kilometers, making its orbit perfectly circular at 23,000 km as well.
