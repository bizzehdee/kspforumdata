To figure out what \u0022should\u0022 work in space warfare, all we can do is extrapolate from what we see in the real world.

I took a typical grain size for real particulate matter called \u0022sand\u0022 (which is what your real world example is), and calculated how many of those grains exist in a 50kg bag of same (a \u003Cem\u003Egiven\u003C/em\u003E for any traveller discussion, that\u0027s canon), then provided densities of that sand in space, dispersed over a couple different radii as examples. We could alter the parameters of the sand, say go with a smaller grain size, but we just interact with more, but smaller grains. We could then calculate the optical depth of out sandcaster cloud. We can also mess with how it is deployed (farther away from the launching ship, the cloud could be smaller, as long as it subtends the same angle as your ship to the shooter).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, it is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E a beam traveling through 2\u002B km of sand\u002Batmosphere, it is a beam traveling though maybe 40 meters of sand with say 0.003 grains of sand per cm of path length. In this example, AT MOST, the beam will interact with 12 grains. Not 12 grams, 12 individual grains. At this same low density, the 2 km path length (not counting atmospheric effects)of a sandstorm example would result in the same beam interacting with 600 grains. Of course real sandstorms have more than a single sand/dust particle for every 333 cubic cm, so the beam would interact with vastly more grains. I\u0027ve seen real sandstorms described as holding millions of \u003Cem\u003Etons\u003C/em\u003E of sand while being on the order of 100km across.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe could then find out what the density of a real sandstorm actually is, and go for that in space (minus the (large) atmospheric effects)). Great. Let\u0027s use a higher density of sand... but we are \u003Cem\u003Eonly allowed 50kg of sand\u003C/em\u003E, because that is a \u003Cem\u003Egiven\u003C/em\u003E. So any attempt to make the sandstorm analogy work either requires more sand than we are allowed by canon, or our 50kg must be placed in a very small volume of space near our ship. Neither works, as we\u0027d be stuck deploying the sand into a volume not substantially larger than the canister it came in. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what \u0022theoretical\u0022 and extrapolating \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E.

Looks like delivered power (simulations and tests tend to standardize on a 5km range, and look at a 100cm^2 target area for the beam) is about 1/2 to 1/3 of transmitted power in both a maritime and desert environment. The latter includes dust, but not a \u0022sandstorm.\u0022 This shows how profound even nominal atmospheric effects are on laser weapons. At 5km in space, this would be mostly diffraction and jitter limited, instead (there is a small particle density, obviously). A huge difference, right off the bat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheir description of dust vs water vapor or other aerosols suggests that the dust is a problem because the beam doesn\u0027t vaporize it, but heats the particles which heat the surrounding air, causing thermal blooming. In space, the particles are heated, but there is no air to heat and cause the blooming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterestingly, they also did simulations from a 5km altitude firing DOWN through maritime and desert conditions, and the delivered power ration is somewhat better, as you would expect (shorter path-length through the higher density air/dust near the surface). They approached 60% of the power delivered to the target in that regime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general in the atmosphere (sea level), propagation efficiency plummets after 3-5km (the latter with adaptive optics). By 12-15km, it\u0027s well under 20%, and effectively zero for non-adaptive optics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout question, atmospheric densities of gases and aerosols over kms would seriously hamper laser weapons, but you need reasonable path-lengths though those areas. If a ship needs to haul around thousands of tons of gas/dust/sand to have the system work, it doesn\u0027t make much sense. It would also pose a navigational hazard (hitting it with any decent closing velocity would scrub your hull for you).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-15T17:04:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I thihk that there is nothing in space worth fighting for.

The problem is that even modern-day hi-tech warfare requires decision making at speeds no human can even dream of achieving so it comes down to the computers.

So, as I see it - a container of relatively-light drones (missiles if you like) is delivered into a designated area then they spread and start searching for enemies.

USN testing and simulation shows that weapons (that are still effective, BTW) lose 50% of their transmitted power just from the AIR, and that the primary effect of dust is thermal blooming (an atmospheric effect).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the real world, terrestrial laser tests have 100% of the laser path length inside the atmosphere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce agin, in the sand caster case, the \u0022sand\u0022 (it might be highly variable in composition) cannot possibly interfere with the laser for more than a few meters.
