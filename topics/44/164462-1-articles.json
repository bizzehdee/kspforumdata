One group wants to stealthy insert a human spy into the enemy\u0027s planet, and I want to explore the possibility of doing this by disguising a small spacecraft as an asteroid / comet and having it enter the atmosphere and apparently breaking up. In fact, the break-up is the ejection of a rocky outer layer so a heavily stealthed atmospheric craft can then get to the surface (preferably at an\u00A0oceanic coastline)\u00A0safely in an unpopulated area. I know this is way beyond current human tech capability!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my key questions are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.

Perhaps you should read those topics for additional info, but the consensus is that there is no stealth in space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven with our current technology, if we spot a spaceship we could easily\u00A0differentiate it from a space rock by it thermal signature. Basically anything artificial will be warmer than asteroids and stand out\u00A0in infra red. There is a possibility of active cooling and directional thermal radiation, but that would highly depend on your story setting and the capabilities and resources of the spied-upon side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother issue is that couple of hundred thousand km is very close and anything lighting their engines that close would register on sensors, especially if you have two warring sides that are concerned with each other and monitoring their neighborhood. If your spy containing ship is detected (but not recognized as a spy ship) and tracked, any change in velocity not consistent with ordinary orbital movement would,\u00A0without doubt, be instantly suspicious.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore the Chelyabinsk meteor hit Earth in 2013, it was undetected, mostly because it came from an unusual direction (roughly from the direction of the Sun). Perhaps\u00A0you could use that in your story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter atmospheric entry, anything dropping from the sky will experience significant forces and heating. While that may be survivable, it can not go unnoticed. What happens then? Your spied upon nation will go out to try to\u00A0find\u00A0the meteor. Once they do find it they will realize it\u0027s a spaceship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrajectory calculation can easily be done and you could perform your trajectory correction maneuvers behind a nearby moon to hide the exhaust, but it will still change the trajectory and if tracked it will be obvious that something is going on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom the storytelling you might want to have a system breakdown period that offers a window of opportunity for spy insertion, or have the spy ship approach from a non monitored direction (not in plane of ecliptic). That makes the maneuver a lot more complicated and expensive, but more realistic for stealth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KiwiTyke","CreatedById":180661,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-16T10:09:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks Shpaget, I have been browsing the other forums since joining up and will persist!

Spaceships are detected mainly by their thermal signature emitted from radiators, engines, exhaust plume, etc. A design mentioned in the linked article discusses a stealthy ship that minimizes its thermal signature by using liquid hydrogen/helium as single-use heatsinks - it is boiled to absorb heat from the ship itself, then expanded in an expansion chamber (to lower its temperature), the resulting gas being used as a cold-gas thruster. The ship itself is shaped like a long, thin cylinder, one end constantly facing the sun, to reduce sunlight reflection.

If anything, you want to coat your ship with something reflective - so you dont absorb as much incident radiation\u00A0and lowering your emissivity. (NB: \u0022reflective\u0022 does not necessailry mean \u0022silvery\u0022, it could mean \u0022white\u0022 or any number of other shades, like that grey reflective tape you get on safety clothing) but in any event, \u0022holding your heat in\u0022 will only get you so far.

Spent heatsink is ejected overboard at its boiling temperature (22K for hydrogen, 4 K for helium). The main exception is the propulsion system, which does release puffs of gas at high temperatures, but this is mitigated by the exhaust gas being cooled by expansion in the nozzle. The main point is, it does not try to \u0027hold the heat in\u0027, but rather release it by boiling a cold liquid, using the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthalpy_of_vaporization\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eenthalpy of vaporization\u003C/a\u003E to cool down without raising the coolant\u0027s temperature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, the process is not very efficient on the heatsink, as noted. A 1kW source of heat needs 8 kg/hour of liquid hydrogen to cool down to 22 K.

Even if your heatsink was stealthy (which I have my doubts about) you wont be able to shunt all of your heat into the coolant. Yet more rules of thermodynamics mean it is impossible to cool said surface to the temperature of the cold coolant, only to an intermediate temperature, so straight of the bat, the skin of your ship is way hotter than 22K and there is nothing you can do about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dont have the maths, but I cant see creating ginormous clouds of hydrogen as stealthy. Not for nothing but clouds of cold hydrogen are already specifically looked for with even todays tech. What happens when hydrogen gas is ionised by solar radiation for example?

One group wants to stealthy insert a human spy into the enemy\u0027s planet, and I want to explore the possibility of doing this by disguising a small spacecraft as an asteroid / comet and having it enter the atmosphere and apparently breaking up. In fact, the break-up is the ejection of a rocky outer layer so a heavily stealthed atmospheric craft can then get to the surface (preferably at an\u00A0oceanic coastline)\u00A0safely in an unpopulated area. I know this is way beyond current human tech capability!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my key questions are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.

It needs to look and behave as much like a dead rock as possible. So, could you (theoretically) calculate the orbital mechanics to sufficient accuracy that you could simply launch secretly from around 300-400,000km and assume it\u0027s going to be OK?

The pessimist in me tell me we still won\u0027t\u00A0have a permanent presence outside of low earth orbit, but that\u0027s another story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat this means is that there won\u0027t be constellations of thousands of satellites pointed outwards to spot anything in detail. There\u0027ll be sensors tracking spaceships going to and fro from known destinations, but most will be pointing inwards at Earth to detect cheap launch vehicles from being used in nefarious ways.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing methods detailed below, you can keep a spaceship undetectable until it gets close to Earth. Staying above the planetary plane and using eccentric polar orbits will avoid the bulk of the sensors. There\u0027s no simple way to get to the ground because re-entry is a very violent event that reveals a lot of information about what is coming in. The radio reflection on the re-entry vehicle can distinguish between a lumpy rock or a smooth metal container. The trajectory reveals whether it is a chaotic fragmentation with the g-force meter jumping up and down, or the human-survivable descent of a reentry vehicle. Either way, we\u0027ve had the sensor technology and dozens of spy satellites watching the atmosphere from above watching for nuclear re-entry vehicles for decades. It\u0027ll be hard to escape their gaze.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour best option is to manoeuvre your stealthy spaceship near a automated cargo pod and either latch on to it or hide inside of it. These will exist because in 50 years, we will still be dependent on Earth-based manufacturing for high technology components, which needs rare metals obtained from asteroids to run. Once you are in the lower atmosphere, deploy wings and fly away from the landing point before the recovery team swoops in.

While that may be survivable, it can not go unnoticed. What happens then? Your spied upon nation will go out to try to\u00A0find\u00A0the meteor.

Spaceships are detected mainly by their thermal signature emitted from radiators, engines, exhaust plume, etc. A design mentioned in the linked article discusses a stealthy ship that minimizes its thermal signature by using liquid hydrogen/helium as single-use heatsinks - it is boiled to absorb heat from the ship itself, then expanded in an expansion chamber (to lower its temperature), the resulting gas being used as a cold-gas thruster. The ship itself is shaped like a long, thin cylinder, one end constantly facing the sun, to reduce sunlight reflection. A combination sun-shield and concentrating lens (here using \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_lens\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Efresnel lens\u003C/a\u003E), both to shield the ship from the sun\u0027s heat (keeping it cold enough to be stealthy), and use it to power a solar-thermal rocket, using the gas from heatsink boiloff as coolant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe solar thermal rocket pulses the propellant ejection, instead of letting it flow freely.

Why would you want your ship to absorb incident visible radiation? That will just raise your temp and people are not going to be looking for you by shining torches!\u00A0Vantablack is very black, but it will still emit IR if its hot enough - Good absorbers are by definition\u00A0good emitters. If anything, you want to coat your ship with something reflective - so you dont absorb as much incident radiation\u00A0and lowering your emissivity. (NB: \u0022reflective\u0022 does not necessailry mean \u0022silvery\u0022, it could mean \u0022white\u0022 or any number of other shades, like that grey reflective tape you get on safety clothing) but in any event, \u0022holding your heat in\u0022 will only get you so far. Once your\u00A0heat sink is tapped, you will have to radiate every erg of generated heat, or die. And big heat sinks are themselves hard to hide.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe laws of thermodynamics also make pretty much every mechanism that you describe less-than-perfectly-efficient, meaning that with the cold of space as a backdrop, your stealth gains are incremental at best. I think \u0022harder to detect\u0022 is achievable and closer to the truth than \u0022nearly invisible\u0022, just like contemporary radar stealth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, your expanded-gas cooled exhaust. Expanding the gas does not actually get rid of any energy. The gas is now cooler so is emitting less intensely in\u00A0the IR spectrum, but now the cloud is much larger, so the radiation it does emit is less intense but coming from a larger source. And large clouds of gas can be detected in numerous other ways. Not to mention that the base of the nozzle and the attached combustion chamber will of course be at operating\u00A0temperature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe decoys approach is a good idea, the greatest weakness in detection is likely the capabilities of the sensors looking for your. When you cannot disguise your own signature, you attack the sensors, passively (decoys, chaff, flares, drones) or actively (jamming, dazzling, physical assault).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm not certain, but I strongly suspect that an approach to a planet with the sun behind you, would render your IR signature enormously difficult to detect (point-of-view limited of course). Attaining this position undetected would have the usual difficulties though.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVantablack\u0027s purpose is to not reflect any incoming radiations. 99.99% absorbance means 0.01% reflectivity, or better.... the heat you absorb, mostly from sunlight, is them passed by a heat exchanger into a liquid hydrogen heat sink.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe heat sink boils, taking the heat you absorbed away with it. LH2 boils at 22K, so just like an ice cube stays at 0C until it has completely melted, LH2 will stay at 22K while it evaporates.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want even lower temperatures, use liquid helium at 2-4K and use a heat pump to move the absorbed heat from the helium into liquid hydrogen.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSupercooling the vantablack this way prevents it from emitting nearly anything. If it doesn\u0027t reflect or emit anything, how do you detect it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe perfect gas law gives a linear relationship between pressure, mass (moles), volume and temperature. If you expand a gas inside a de Laval nozzle, pressure drops and volume increases while mass stays constant. Consequently, temperature must drop. A real-world example of this effect is... real-world nozzles. The highest temperatures are near the throat, so that\u0027s where we see the active coolant loops concentrated. The lower half and the rim are much cooler. If we used a ludicrously big nozzle, the gasses will expand and expand to undetectable temperatures.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApproaching from the sun against a well-designed sensor is a bad idea.

Even if your heatsink was stealthy (which I have my doubts about) you wont be able to shunt all of your heat into the coolant. Yet more rules of thermodynamics mean it is impossible to cool said surface to the temperature of the cold coolant, only to an intermediate temperature, so straight of the bat, the skin of your ship is way hotter than 22K and there is nothing you can do about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dont have the maths, but I cant see creating ginormous clouds of hydrogen as stealthy. Not for nothing but clouds of cold hydrogen are already specifically looked for with even todays tech. What happens when hydrogen gas is ionised by solar radiation for example? And what happens to the light of background stars shining through a gas cloud? Hard to detect, sure, but a lot easier to detect than the nothing that was there before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd one other thing - were you intending on using expelled heatsink as your sole propulsion? Because you wont get much thrust or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E from it if we are talking a few hundred kilowatts (lets face it, if you need to lose much more, the amount of heatsink required quickly gets untenable). You will need a hot engine to get anywhere with any speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd of course, once you are out of coolant (gotta admit I hadnt considered your method before) you will be 110% boned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll those techniques would help, but I think \u0022nearly invisible\u0022 is still out of reach.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027re working well within the confines of basic thermodynamics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn example would be the infrared telescopes being used to observe very cool stars. They have reserves of liquid helium on-board that they use to flush the CCD sensors and reduce the noise level until the stars are detectable. Once the helium is all used up, the CCD heats up and those stars become invisible, like what happened on the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitzer_Space_Telescope\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESpitzer Space Telescope\u003C/a\u003E: \u0022\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003EWithout liquid helium to cool the telescope to the very low temperatures needed to operate, most of the instruments are no longer usable.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027re only trying to do the same on a much larger scale - instead of just cooling a small CCD sensor, we\u0027re cooling the entire hull of a spaceship using hundreds of tons of liquid hydrogen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour assumptions about thermodynamics are quite wrong. The only way that the spaceship\u0027s hull heats up is if the incoming radiations are not conducted to heat exchanger fast enough. That\u0027s a design problem, not a physics problem. Thankfully, Vantablack is just vertically-aligned carbon nanotube, which makes them thermal superconductors in the horizontal direction. Heat transfer rates will be incredible.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, you need the maths to make those claims. A large cool hydrogen is exactly what the far away galaxies are. Why isn\u0027t the sky entirely lit up end-to-end in the infrared spectrum? Because those \u0027gas clouds\u0027 are simply too faint. And, even if stable H2 molecules manage to get ionized by sunlight (when actually 15.84eV is needed, 183815K temperature), they\u0027d just point out that a hydrogen-propelled rocket was used within this hundred thousand kilometer volume within the past few minutes.

The heat that the Vantablack surface absorbs is absorbed by a liquid hydrogen heat sink. The liquid hydrogen boils. The boiling hydrogen is then expelled.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe transition from liquid to gaseous state consumes energy. This energy is the heat we are handling. The scientific term is heat of vaporization. For liquid hydrogen, it is is 450kJ/kg.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis means that each kilogram of liquid hydrogen onboard will absorb 450kJ of heat and boil away. The Vantablack, the gasses and the remaining liquid are all at 22K, which is about the boiling temperature of liquid hydrogen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are several extra steps in the hydrogen steamer design made to maximize the amount of heat the hydrogen steals away before it is ejected. One of them is heating the gaseous hydrogen even further. By concentrating sunlight onto a heat exchanger, we can turn it into propellant for a rocket. Hydrogen gas heat capacity rises from 14kJ/kg/K\u00A0to 22kJ/kg/K as it is heated from 22K to 3000K. This is a lot of extra heat we can absorb. The hotter the component we need to cool down, the more efficiently the hydrogen is used. A\u00A0hull surface absorbing sunlight\u00A0needs to stay cool at 22K, so we can only use the 450kJ/kg vaporization energy as the heat sink. A crew habitat at 300K allow for a additional heat capacity of (300-22)*14: 3892 kJ/kg for a total of 4342kJ/kg. A hot laser operating at 700K allows for a total waste heat absorbed of 10MJ/kg. Even nuclear reactors can be cooled: at 2000K, over 36MJ/kg can be absorbed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best thing is that your 2000K superheated hydrogen gas\u00A0can then be run through a rocket nozzle and expanded until it is a very cool but fast propellant stream, no warmer than your hull surfaces.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me give you an example:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA thin cylinder with a cold frontal area of 10m^2 absorbing sunlight at 1.37kW/m^2, a 5 crew habitat emitting 1kW of waste heat at 300K, a life support system emitting 10kW of waste heat at 500K and a 1MW reactor powering all the systems at 1300K.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow much hydrogen do we consume? 1.37*10/450\u00A0\u002B 1/[(300-22)*14\u002B450] \u002B 10/[(500-22)*14\u002B450] \u002B 1000/[(1300-22)*16\u002B450] = 0.0304 \u002B 0.00023 \u002B 0.0478 = 78.5 grams per second. If we have 1000 tons of liquid hydrogen on-board, the ship can run undetected for five months. If we take that\u00A0hydrogen at its different temperatures and quantities and run it through a 3000K nuclear rocket engine, we can absorb 3.8MW of propulsive power without needing any more hydrogen.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope this answers some of your questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223150085\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022164462\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221502923411\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022158888\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SinBad\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, SinBad said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsave the hiding for after reentry. come in fast and hot. fast and hot enough that interception during re-entry is near impossible. then hit the deck (under the radar) over a large ocean and do a few minutes at high speed to get away from the projected landing site. then you can slow down and start using more terrestrial stealth solutions. but at some point you are going to have to land and hide or dispose of the craft. thats probably the fiddly part as the farther it is from eyes, the farther you have to travel overland. the farther you need to go, the higher the need for a vehicle, which you either need to bring with you (making your craft larger) or have arranged to be waiting for you by some local agent, complicit or otherwise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif you want to be fancy you could re-enter at noon and use an ablater material that will emit the same spectrum as the sky, or do it over a storm (also good cover for sonic booms).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe point is, they know something arrived, but they don\u0027t really know what, or where it is. after all, you have a whole planet to get lost in. even better if there is a high population that is used to strangers visiting from other cities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBallistic missile trackers and interceptors are designed to handle MIRVs turning at over 10G, in multiple directions, simultaneously.
