Stage separation uses a series of charges and electronics that are integrated with the top of the stage. My copy of the Saturn V Flight Manual (Snowball Publishing) says this:\n\n\u0022Ordnance for first plane separation consists of two exploding bridgewire (EBW) firing units, two EBW detonators, and one linear shaped charge (LSC) assembly, which includes the LSC (containing 25 grains per foot of RDX) with a detonator block on each end. The EBW firing units are installed on the S-IC/S-II interstage slightly below the S-II first separation plane. The leads of the EBW firing units are attached to the EBW detonators which are installed in the detonator blocks of the LSC assembly. The LSC detonator blocks are installed on adjustable mounts to provide for length variations of the LSC assembly and the circumferance tolerances of the interstage. The LSC is routed from the detonator blocks around the periphery of the interstage. The LSC is held in place by retaining clips and encased by covers which are secured by clips and sealed to environmentally protect the LSC.\u0022\n\nKSP just lumps all this together into a single component called a decoupler, for convenience."},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T13:30:39Z","Content":"Yes, real rockets typically use explosive bolts, because they are the less failure-prone method of separating two parts that were previously meant to be firmy attached.

A couple of Soyuz missions have had some hairy re-entrys because 1 or 2 explosive bolts failed to fire, causing the service module to stay attached until the attachment points were ripped off by the aerodynamic load. \n\nSpaceX tends to use mechanical latches instead of pyros for obvious reusability reasons."},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T14:33:04Z","Content":"Though you would have to independently confirm this, I am pretty sure I saw a vehicle with a screw and spring arrangement too. Large screws/threads kept the parts together, until they were unscrewed via motor and compressed springs pushed the parts apart.\n\nEdit: I have found this, though this is off of a micro satellite. I think I saw them used on bigger craft too.\n\n![image_gallery?uuid=4aea0be3-22c4-4a36-b6a7-9eca1b7ee11b\u0026groupId=163813\u0026t=1347276572472](https://directory.eoportal.org/image/image_gallery?uuid=4aea0be3-22c4-4a36-b6a7-9eca1b7ee11b\u0026groupId=163813\u0026t=1347276572472)"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T15:48:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yes, real rockets typically use explosive bolts, because they are the less failure-prone method of separating two parts that were previously meant to be firmy attached.
