The news reports are slow and hardly accurate so I will do my best to provide accurate details as I receive them and clear up some of the misguided info being disseminated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fire started on Saturday 9/17/16 at approximately 5:20PM local. Cause is still undetermined but the rumor on base is arson as there was no lightning producing storms in the area. There are two main rumored motives for arson currently circulating (AKA what I\u0027ve overheard while eating meals\u00A0at the BX): delay/destroy WorldView-4, or further damage SpaceX. The latter is not as common but boy do the people that think that have vivid imaginations. I\u0027ve heard crazy stuff ranging from\u00A0\u0022ULA can\u0027t handle the competition and saw an opportunity to take SpaceX down\u0022 to\u00A0\u0022I saw Tory Bruno himself hiking in that area on Saturday...just sayin.\u0022 Personally, I suspect something much less sinister (but still stupid)\u00A0like someone tossing a lit cigarette butt out the car window on their way to work. I see it happen two to three times a day and it seems the most logical explanation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs of 4:45ish this afternoon my supervisor told me that he was told by the 30th Space Wing commander\u00A0that the fire has grown to just under 6,000 acres and continues to burn in a northwesterly direction almost directly towards SLC-3 where AV-062 and WorldView-4 are inside the MST. It remains 0% contained and the fire line is currently 1.2 miles away and moving towards the SLC at an approximate rate of 100 feet per hour. Simple math says that if it continues at that rate the fire will reach the SLC-3 perimeter in about 63 hours. The firefighting crew consists of about 560 people from various agencies (one of whom is my uncle from Cal Fire that coordinates the S-2 retardant drops).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow here\u0027s what the news gets wrong: The launch of WorldView 4 was NOT TECHNICALLY DELAYED BY THE FIRE. Rather, it was delayed by the lack of necessary personnel to staff the launch. Weather briefings are GO across the board with the winds keeping the smoke and ash mostly south of the pad and blowing out to the southwest. Some firefighter we talked to explained it with some firefighter jargon but the gist of it is that due to convective patterns wildfires tend to burn in a direction somewhat orthogonal to the horizontal component of the velocity vector of the wind. So that\u0027s how the wind is mostly blowing southwesterly but the fire is mostly burning northwesterly. If that\u0027s actually why, I haven\u0027t got a clue. But the winds here are generally blowing to the southeast and fire is generally burning to the northwest so I can\u0027t argue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll do my best to keep this updated with current info but I don\u0027t frequent the forums as often as I used to.

For all launches a there are USAF firefighter and hazmat teams standing by in the event of a catastrophic failure. Launch can not and will not proceed without them in place.\u00A0When the wildfire broke out they were re-tasked with containment and thus can\u0027t be on launch duty. In my humble\u00A0non-firefighter opinion\u00A0the 26th is an EXTREMELY optimistic launch date. However, if they are able to bring in more Cal Fire or\u00A0US Forestry Service dudes they may be able to spare the required launch personnel which is what I HOPE happens.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rybo","CreatedById":154876,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-20T16:38:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EUpdate as of\u00A09/20 at 8AM local\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fire doubled in size overnight and\u00A0is now just over 10,200 acres. South Base is no\u00A0longer accessible to anyone except firefighting and other emergency\u00A0personnel.\u00A0It is now less than 1 mile from SLC-3,\u00A0It has burned all the way to the\u00A0SLC-6 (ULA pad where the Deltas launch) perimeter, and\u00A0it\u0027s about a third of a mile from\u00A0SLC-4 (SpaceX pad). It is my understanding that they have a Falcon 9 in their processing facility but luckily, SLC-6 is mostly vacant. SLC-8 is also threatened, but protecting it is a much lower priority. For those that may be curious, SLC-2 that has the Delta II for already erected for JPSS-1\u00A0is on North Base west of the runway and is not threatened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooking on Google Maps I measured the distance from where it looks like the fire is to SLC-3\u00A0and it looks like it is between 4,500 and 4,800 feet away. It jumped Bear Canyon Rd and Spring Canyon Rd overnight but firefighters dug a massive trench which has slowed\u00A0most of the fire line closest to SLC-3 from advancing. Hopefully it doesn\u0027t jump it like it did the previous lines.\u00A0Overall containment is estimated to be 15-22%.\u00A0\u00A0Airborne firefighting efforts resumed around 7am as soon as it was light enough to safely do so and will continue until there isn\u0027t enough daylight with an emphasis on the lines and trenches\u00A0protecting the SLCs.

The wind is\u00A0generally calm but somewhat erratic with the fringes of tropical storm Paine beginning to push into SoCal.\u00A0Unfortunately the rain coming with Paine are expected to stay well south of VAFB and there is no rain in the forecast in the foreseeable future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have also confirmed that some of the facilities at SLC-3 are some of the facilities mentioned in the news as being on generator power. The spacecraft and rocket remain healthy but most of the WV-4 folks I\u0027ve talked to are sweating bullets. Scratch that...they are sweating\u00A0M1A1 Abrams shells. And understandably so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, if any of you live in the area and have access to Vandenberg AFB with an appropriate DBIDS or CAC card, the 30th Civil Engineering Squadron is accepting food and snack donations for the firefighters.

Growth has continued but I don\u0027t have an official acreage number yet.\u00A0I don\u0027t have confirmation but rumors are that fire has\u00A0started to burn\u00A0down into the valley just southwest of the pad. This is considered an extremely high risk area because the hydrazine storage tanks are buried underground just northwest of the SLC-3 fence about 800-1000 feet away. There are 3 towers with IR sensors on top that are pointed at the tanks that can be seen here:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.google.com/maps/@34.6397972,-120.5901545,58m/data=!3m1!1e3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.google.com/maps/@34.6397972,-120.5901545,58m/data=!3m1!1e3\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0My best guess is that if the fire burns into that valley the IR sensors will get saturated with heat and\u00A0no longer provide accurate information on the status of the hydrazine tanks. I will try to find out if if the tanks have anything in them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother rumor (and my primary concern) is that the air intakes for the SLC-3 facilities will quickly be overwhelmed by the smoke and particulate matter. Many parts of the inside of the MST are clean rooms, specifically the bottom floor where the flame bucket and the RD-180 nozzles are, the 4th or 5th floor where one of the avionics service bay access doors is, and the 14th-17th floors where the payload and fairing mates to the centaur. There is also a comms room underneath the pad we call the meat locker (temperature is kept around 58 degrees F) that is a very low level clean room. The umbilical that connects to the payload prior to launch\u00A0runs throughout the entire length of the tower and terminates in this room and is connected to several large sets of equipment called \u0022test sets\u0022 or \u0022racks\u0022 used to command and communicate with the spacecraft. Lack of adequate airflow also results in heat buildup which can be detrimental to both the rocket and the spacecraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonal side note...the smell of smoke has been present since Sunday on North Base, but it got MUCH stronger today. Went to lunch at Sissy\u0027s in Lompoc and had some ash on the car when I left which is the first time this has happened to me since it all started. I usually eat at the BX or the Pacific Coast Club though so that\u0027s probably why I haven\u0027t seen ash until now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57622-scotius/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002257622\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57622-scotius/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Scotius\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Winds are variable to the southeast.

The IR image from last nights overflight is haunting.\u00A0I expect that Justin Ray will be given a copy sometime today\u00A0to publish to Spaceflight Now.\u00A0Firefighting crews were complemented late yesterday afternoon with about 400 new personnel from various agencies. I don\u0027t remember the exact number but somewhere around 1,200 total emergency personnel, of which about 1,000 are directly involved with fighting the fire. Big progress was made late last night and early this morning and all of the major fire lines are holding very well. Winds today are expected to be stronger (15-20mph) and shifting to the northwest which is expected to help the fight.\u00A0As mentioned before, fires tend to burn orthogonal to the wind (still not sure I understand how or why, but I trust that the firefighter that explained it to me knows more about it than I do).
