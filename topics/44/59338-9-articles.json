However, there\u0027s a difference between highly rational neurotypicals and those on the spectrum. Many engineers are highly social, and being that way is often a huge asset to your career. You can only get so far on pure technical abilities, you have to be able to network, and if you ever want to manage or lead other engineers then you need those soft skills.
