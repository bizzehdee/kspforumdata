Effects on agricultural are not heavily mentioned but electricity is still necessary for food mass production (of the level needed to maintain the needs of the millions of survivors) and of course with how people are supposed to obtain the food is also an issue. Rationing? Are these millions of survivors migrating from the cities really going to peacefully stand in line for days just to get something that can barely feed their family? Thus start the food riots, which devolve into crime or wars, and thus society collapses. One might argue that \u0022thanks\u0022 to the famine, eventually the number of mouths will drop to a level that the food production system can feed without issue, but those potential famine victims will not go quietly into the night.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#3498db;\u0022\u003EThe next is about food security on the individual level. This is why the southern hemisphere is in danger of collapsing as well even if the nuclear war is limited to the northern hemisphere. Money will still exist in the southern hemisphere which makes trying to feed people even more harder. For most of its history capitalism hasn\u0027t exactly been great at adjusting to help those in need when their numbers skyrocket to become the majority.

This isn\u0027t an overview of food security itself as much as it is an explanation of how to interpret food self-sufficiency graphs (which often are just percentages with no explanation).

Dresden had modern buildings yet the number of casualties was still high.

In a nuclear exchange between Pakistan and India, yes, the damage to structures would be different from Nagasaki and Hiroshima, but the death toll would be far higher, economic effects just as devastating as the WWII air raids on Japan, and whether people would really be up for getting behind the same people who will probably be held by many as the initiators of the war (the ruling national government) for an \u0022Arduous March\u0022 style movement towards recovery is dubious. Thus, my position is not that the physical damage from nuclear weapons will cause societal collapse, but that the non-kinetic effects will eventually lead to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------------------------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI apologize to you two for suddenly disappearing from the conversation.
