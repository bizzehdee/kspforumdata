(From the traveling objects point of few, it stands still and the universe travels past it in the opposite direction) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets start from there. Imagine a rod and a barn. If you lay the rod besides the barn, you can see that it is longer than the barn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe barn has a front door and a back door. Imagine both doors open. If you throw the rod through the barn, and make a picture of the barn at the right moment, the rod now seems to completely fit in the barn. Thats because from the barns (and cameras) point of few, the rod is moving and thus appears shorter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut from the rods point of few, the barn is moving, so the barn should be shorter. But that would mean that the rod couldn\u0027t fit completely in the barn. How can that be? We have a picture that proofs that the rod fits in there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo make it harder: Imagine the front door of the barn open, and the back door closed. We invent a mechanism that closes the front door (event1) and opens the back door (event2) at exactly the same moment. Now we throw the rod, and it travels inside the barn. At the right moment, when the rod nearly touches the back door, we open it (and therefore shut the front door, both events happend at the same time). The rod can travel through the barn without crashing into a door (or a door crashing into the rod). This is only possible because the rod fits inside the barn, because it is shorter due to relativity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut from the rods point of view, the BARN is way shorter. How can it be that the rod traverses the barn, even though we have the open-shut mechanism? Well, from the rods point of view, the back door opens (event2) long before the front door closes(event1). When the back door opens, the front door is still open, and the long rod reaches out of both doors at the same time. Only some time later, when the end of the rod is completely inside the barn, then the front door closes. So from the rods point of view there has to be a time delay between the events. Event2 has to happen earlier than event1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo from length contraction alone, we see that different observers (barn and rod) disagree about what is instantaneous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has nothing to do with different runtimes of signals from the back to the front door. A camera that films the barn from above can have exactly the same distance to both of the doors. If the camera stands still, and makes a photo at the right time, the photo shows Event1 and Event2 happening simultaneously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the camera is traveling in the same direction and speed as the rod, and it makes a picture when it is exactly over the barn (so that both doors are at the same distance) then it may catch Event1 on Photo. Or Event2. But not both events in the same photo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere has to be no additional \u0022magic\u0022 to cause this disagreement about simultaneity.
