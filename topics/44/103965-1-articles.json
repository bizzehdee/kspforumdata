Makes me want to replicate them in KSP.\n\n**1. Manned Spacecraft Staged Reentry (published 1966)**\n\n[https://www.google.com/patents/US3289974](https://www.google.com/patents/US3289974)\n\nThis is a really cool lifting body reentry idea where a sub-sonic aircraft is partially enclosed in a lifting body heat shield structure. On re-entry, astronaut get in the aircraft, have the heatshield structure facing all the re-entry heat, then detach it from the aircraft and fly toward nearest air port. Wired has an [article](http://www.wired.com/2013/03/a-novel-1964-plan-for-a-piloted-earth-orbital-spacecraft-with-staged-reentry/) about this and why it was invented.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![US3289974-0.png](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pages/US3289974-0.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![US3289974-1.png](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pages/US3289974-1.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**2. Variable geometry manned orbital vehicle (published 1970)**\n\n[https://www.google.com/patents/US3534924](https://www.google.com/patents/US3534924)\n\nAnother re-entry vehicle that attempt to overcome the problem of low-speed control in lifting body design. This one has folding wings that will fold out once suitable speed is reached, to improve gliding capacity and help landing. Appropriate propulsion system may be installed as needed, as noted in the patent.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![US3534924-0.png](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pages/US3534924-0.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![US3534924-1.png](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pages/US3534924-1.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**3. Spacecraft for interplanetary/lunar travel (Published 2006)**\n\n[https://www.google.com/patents/US20060163434](https://www.google.com/patents/US20060163434)\n\nA big spacecraft utilizing an inflatable rotating ring habitat to simulate gravity. I quite like the compact design of this one. I assume it will be assembled in orbit as that part is not explicitly mentioned anywhere in the patent that I noticed.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![US20060163434A1-20060727-D00000.png](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/US20060163434A1/US20060163434A1-20060727-D00000.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![US20060163434A1-20060727-D00002.png](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/US20060163434A1/US20060163434A1-20060727-D00002.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**4.

It is an inflatable module that can house several smaller spacecrafts inside a pressurized, habitable environment to allow astronauts to do maintenance of small spacecrafts without having to do EVA in cumbersome spacesuit. The image shows that it can hold up to 4 Orion capsules (I assume from the look, though it is also suspiciously looking like KSP MK1-2) inside its space.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![US20120318927A1-20121220-D00000.png](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/US20120318927A1/US20120318927A1-20121220-D00000.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![US20120318927A1-20121220-D00004.png](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/US20120318927A1/US20120318927A1-20121220-D00004.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Darnok","CreatedById":85708,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T10:57:02Z","Content":"I like this carrier... it is going to be one of few first things I will do in 1.0 ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nMore threads with interesting patents, pretty please ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Deutherius","CreatedById":125381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T13:20:03Z","Content":"I haven\u0027t read the patents, but the first thing that popped in my head when looking at the carrier: \u0022Inflatable...

They has a lot of research on inflatable technologies.\n\n[Here](https://www.google.com/patents/US7309049) is a patent for their orbital debris shield. It is, in my understanding, somewhat like scale armours, with multiple layers slide out as the module expand to provide full coverage.\n\n[Here](https://www.google.com/patents/US20080296435) is a patent for their special shear-thickening fluid reinforced fabrics. These fluid when in normal operation will act as normal fluid, but on impact will suddenly thicken and restrain whatever hit it, providing another layer of protection after their outershield layers. Has been used for other things, but Bigelow plans to use it in space.\n\nEdit: I noticed that I wrote it as if they were using the fluid separately as a layer of armor. That is not what they do. They actually treat their armour fabrics like kevlar or nextel ceramic fabrics with the fluid instead. The reaction still happen on the nanoscale level though, strengthening the fabrics while keeping it flexible as opposing to using more layers. Pumping such fluid is a friggin pain as the more pressure you put in, the more difficult it is. \n\nThey also have other patent for radiation shielding and thermal management for inflatable modules if anyone is interested. Quite interesting to see the little technologies that didn\u0027t get advertised in the media, but so important for development of many things.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-12T16:33:43Z\u0022 title=\u002204/12/2015 04:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RainDreamer**"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T14:58:05Z","Content":"special shear-thickening fluid: why this sound equal to a non newtonian fluid?"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T15:12:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E special shear-thickening fluid: why this sound equal to a non newtonian fluid?\n\nOobleck Armor!"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T15:14:21Z","Content":"Well yeah, shear thickening fluid is a form of non-newtonian fluid.

This has been used in application of body armor before [to great effect](http://paultheengineer.com/print/shearfluidpaper.pdf). The patent is not about the fluid though, it is about the application of the fluid for the fabrics of their inflatable module, and any fluid that is suitable for the job in space can be used.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-12T15:17:48Z\u0022 title=\u002204/12/2015 03:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RainDreamer**"},{"CreatedByName":"Deutherius","CreatedById":125381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T17:40:38Z","Content":"While proving itself against bullets, stopping micrometeoroids can be several orders of magnitude harder.

It is, after all, meant to be used along with other shielding layers in the errant case something did made through the shields.

Spacecraft are not cars. They are full of all sorts of nasty substances. Fuels, coolants, liquid oxygen... things that are dumped away in service modules before the barebones capsule returns. Moving something like an Orion, with service module attached and after the reaction control rockets have been activated, into a pressurized environment would be extraordinarily dangerous. The astronauts would probably have to wear protective suits not dissimilar to full spacesuits. Look at the precautions necessary just to stand beside a returned x-37b, and that\u0027s when its tanks are empty!
