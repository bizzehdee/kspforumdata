We already know we can replicate the brain. That means in the process we would replicate the portion of the brain that enables consciousness. So linking your brain to that artificial brain would pretty much make you aware of both instances at the same time. You would be aware of yourself in your body, and in the machine. Then you simply just disconnect the body, and you are finished. It\u0027s sort of like setting up hard drives in a raid format.\u003Cp\u003EConsciousness really is only a form of memory the way I see it. As long as you have the memories of being transferred over, you are you and you wouldn\u0027t experience the whole death portion of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn example of what your talking about could technically happen every time you go to sleep. However, it doesn\u0027t mean you are dead lol. The only reason why you are able to say it\u0027s you is because you are left in the same place and in the same body. What would happen if you just randomly wake up, with no memories. Are you the same person? Are \u0022you\u0022 technically dead since you are no longer aware of yourself in that consciousness. Even if you memories are restored, how do you know, you didn\u0027t already die and it\u0027s just a copy of yourself, like a restore function of an OS. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis really then gets a bit confusing because you also have to ask, what is death then? Is there even such thing as truly dead? Well I suppose once your body is entirely decomposed, ya lol, you will be as dead as you can possibly be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically your brain, memories, and all that, is \u0027you\u0027. Copying it, is still \u0027you\u0027. It\u0027s simply just another instance of yourself. However from then on they become a different person because they begin having different newly formed memories. However, as I said earlier, you can get rid of this idea if you raid the 2 together, they both are aware. Hmm .. not sure if anyone watches Naruto here, but a good example would be like the Paths of Pain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe term \u0022link\u0022 though is what I am having trouble on.

It can also be set up as a back up drive. Both drives are simply a mirror of each other, if one fails, the other is still available. Having the machine brain and you brain set up in some sort of raid format would mean you can be aware of yourself in both instances. If one was to be disconnected, you are still left with the exact memories and all that before that disconnection. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis does mean though you could build an army of yourselves and be aware of each and every single one of them as long as they are connected by some sort of wireless network.
