A 1kg mass moving at 1ms has 0.5 J of energy. But if the mass is moving at 1000m/s it would have a whopping 0.5MJ.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow factor in this EM drive. Suppose it works as advertised and for simplicity converts 100% of the provided electrical energy into kinetic energy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay we stand next to the drive and feed it 50 joulles. That\u0027s enough to speed up a 1kg drive by 10 m/s. So we see the drive accelerate from stationary to 10m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow lets put it on a train moving 1000m/s. You again feed it 50 joulles. Now this is only enough to accelerate it by sqrt(2*500050J) - 1000m/s ~ 0.5 m/s. So now that same amount of energy is only enough to accelerate your drive by half a meter per second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis leads to a paradox. If you stand on the train next to the drive it\u0027s supposed to accelerate to 10m/s relative to you. But if you stand on the station it is supposed to accelerate by 0.5m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is because the kinetic energy of an object is entirely dependant on the reference frame you choose to use.

In the case of that rotor it is assumed that the drive gives equal thrust regardless of the reference frame. This means you are generating more and more energy the faster it moves. So you can always pick some arbitrary speed where the drive is generating more energy than it consumes. If you have some form of exhaust you don\u0027t have this paradox since the missing energy is carried by the exhaust. Even with a photon drive the photons will redshift depending on the velocity, thus ensuring that no free energy is created.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-17T12:41:16Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2015 12:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ralathon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sean Mirrsen","CreatedById":3873,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-15T10:14:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ralathon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ralathon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis leads to a paradox.

Relativity works both ways. Drop the EMDrive, and use the other way we have of converting electricity to kinetic energy directly - a Gauss rail. Set the Gauss rail to deliver 500 joules of energy to its payload - you\u0027ll have the same paradox in regards to how much acceleration it should result in. A reactionless drive, even if \u003Cstrong\u003Ereaction\u003C/strong\u003E-less, still provides the \u003Cstrong\u003Eaction\u003C/strong\u003E. It produces a force with no counterforce, but in the context of differing frames of reference, all it does is convert one type of energy to another.\u003Cp\u003EA different kind of reactionless drive would not create a force, instead directly affecting velocity - however such a drive would cease affecting its velocity the moment it ceased operating, it cannot \u0022coast\u0022 - lacking both reaction and action, it supplies no force. (if you ever played Star Control, the Arilou Skiff has this kind of drive) Therefore you wouldn\u0027t be able to use such a drive to build up a high velocity - unlike a merely \u003Cstrong\u003Ere\u003C/strong\u003Eactionless drive, it would require greater energy input for a greater total \u0022deviation\u0022 from normal conditions. This one you could, perhaps, theoretically use to create infinite energy, but since such an effect even I have trouble wrapping my mind around the logistics of, I suspect that what its limits would be is completely unknown. If the conservation laws are indeed all-important in the universe, the effect would be limited in such a way as to prevent it ever threatening them. I don\u0027t know what that would take, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: Hm. Now that I think about it, perhaps the problem is that the latter device could still alter its velocity if it were moved by something else - the lack of preferential reference frames would create that exact kind of situation, with a direct change in velocity rather than constant thrust. The drive accelerating itself to 10 m/s relative to its \u0022at rest\u0022 position could impart its momentum to a different object via collision (for instance), which would allow it to accelerate again... although wait, no, it would just mean that the object and the drive would eventually start moving in the same direction with the same speed, because the drive can\u0027t cease operating without the object imparting its momentum right back at the drive. Hm. Me is confuse.

Photon drive works just like a chemical rocket. With a chemical rocket, you have to have much higher thrust early on, because you have to push all these heavy fuel tanks. So you are burning extra fuel to accelerate fuel. Once you are going fast, you are using part of the kinetic energy of the fuel to help push your ship. So while you do get more power out of your engines than chemical energy of fuel ought to provide, that energy isn\u0027t free. You had to pay for it up front.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhoton drive is much the same, except relativity is involved. If you have some supply of energy E, then once you got up to speed v, your total energy supply is actually \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B3E, where \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B3 = 1/sqrt(1-v\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2/c\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2) is the Lorentz boost factor. This extra energy is what lets you run photon drive at higher power (from perspective of \u0022stationary\u0022 observer). But again, it wasn\u0027t free. Energy, in quantities you need to operate a photon drive, is extra mass. And your photon drive had to work extra hard to get that m = E/c\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 up to speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is some additional relativistic weirdness going on. If from ship\u0027s perspective, we maintain constant thrust, we maintain constant proper acceleration. Say, exactly 1g for convenience. (Yes, big photon drive.) From perspective of stationary observer, however, our acceleration is merely g/\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B3\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B3. A stationary observer would conclude that this decrease in acceleration is due to two factors. Ship\u0027s mass has increased by a factor \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B3, because relativistic mass works that way, but also ship\u0027s drive appears to operate at lower thrust due to red shift and/or time dilation, depending on your perspective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s important to note that while yeah, relativity does, in fact allow for thrust to decrease at \u003Cem\u003Eextreme\u003C/em\u003E relativistic speeds, simply adding a constraint that energy is neither created nor destroyed, allows us to derive energy usage of such a drive.

It\u0027s being lucky, at best.\u003Cp\u003ENah. Photon drive works just like a chemical rocket. With a chemical rocket, you have to have much higher thrust early on, because you have to push all these heavy fuel tanks. So you are burning extra fuel to accelerate fuel. Once you are going fast, you are using part of the kinetic energy of the fuel to help push your ship. So while you do get more power out of your engines than chemical energy of fuel ought to provide, that energy isn\u0027t free. You had to pay for it up front.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhoton drive is much the same, except relativity is involved. If you have some supply of energy E, then once you got up to speed v, your total energy supply is actually \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B3E, where \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B3 = 1/sqrt(1-v\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2/c\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2) is the Lorentz boost factor. This extra energy is what lets you run photon drive at higher power (from perspective of \u0022stationary\u0022 observer). But again, it wasn\u0027t free. Energy, in quantities you need to operate a photon drive, is extra mass. And your photon drive had to work extra hard to get that m = E/c\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 up to speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is some additional relativistic weirdness going on. If from ship\u0027s perspective, we maintain constant thrust, we maintain constant proper acceleration. Say, exactly 1g for convenience. (Yes, big photon drive.) From perspective of stationary observer, however, our acceleration is merely g/\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B3\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B3. A stationary observer would conclude that this decrease in acceleration is due to two factors.

This still leaves an outside margin of probability that EMDrive does have some sort of a Q Thruster type of interaction with some exotic virtual particle, which in turn passes momentum to aether. This still raises a lot of questions, however. First, why haven\u0027t we seen this in particle accelerators, where we use far more powerful resonant chambers to accelerate particles?

The interstellar medium is so largely devoid of baryonic matter because of the latter\u0027s tendency to clump up into discrete, collectively massive objects, and thus most of what would otherwise constitute a diffuse but far thicker medium is bound up into clumps of many orders of magnitude higher density. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, at least as far as I know, we have yet to detect similar clumps of dark matter on scales below several kiloparsecs (i.e, objects such as \u0022dark stars\u0022 or \u0022dark planets\u0022); if such objects were to exist, I would expect them to largely dominate gravitational interactions between baryonic structures on a much smaller scale due to the fact that their combined mass-energy exceeds that of the former by more than a factor of six.

Therefore it is highly unlikely it can be interacting with dark matter; there\u0027s simply too much evidence that microwaves and dark matter don\u0027t interact for the inconclusive results seen so far to overthrow that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout wishing to be snarky, I thought that dark matter doesn\u0027t interact electromagnetically by definition - otherwise it wouldn\u0027t be dark?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T06:29:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aethon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Aethon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUsing water waves in a resonant chamber to simulate the EM Drive.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis thing seems to move due to \u0022leakage\u0022.

It\u0027s still possible for it to interact very, very weakly (tiny coupling constant) or to have an indirect (exotic) decay path to something that does interact electromagnetically. And if it does interact via the weak force (there\u0027s a tiny bit of evidence for this, thus the popularity of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) then at high enough energies (above the electroweak unification) it would interact electromagnetically since the weak and electromagnetic forces merge. Unfortunately the only places you get those energies are very shortly after the hot big bang or inside the event horizons of black holes, so studying them is difficult (to massively understate the issue).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
