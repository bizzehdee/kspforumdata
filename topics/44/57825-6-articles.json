It too has suffered 2 fatal accidents, resulting in the loss of all crew. It also experienced a few minor failures (SSME failure during ascent, fuel cell failure in orbit, etc), though due to sufficient redundancy these didn\u0027t cause any injuries. That said, a few of these failures did result in the mission being cut short.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I do think it\u0027s going to be interesting to see what SpaceX can do with their Dragon spacecraft.

There is nonetheless some difference to the case of the shuttle I think: the shuttle was developed (i.e. the science by the project itself, especially the research on the semi-reusable starting and airplane-like landing, was already done) and it was then very expensive to launch, so creating cheaper replacement afterwards might have been a better choice and if executed correctly maybe had no disadvantages. It\u0027s understansable that justifying a complete restart to congress and public would be hard, but assuming the above would still been the correct choice, making it a sunken-cost-fallacy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAgain, the LDEF and the Spacelab weighed a bit more than a couple of kilograms.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrue, but how much of that mass was really needed\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BF You could bring back the data and samples only, and burn the rest by deorbiting it. If you spend 500 million less each mission, which is less than half of the shuttles launch costs, on bringing the lab into orbit, then the cost of the lab itself might not be that relevant anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs for the disrespectful comments, don\u0027t you think that:\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo still would rather ride in the soyuz, better to return with broken bones than to return as vaporised molecules.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs disrespectful for those who have lost their lives both on Soyuz and the Shuttle program?

If I had to choose how to get back to earth safely and my options are a broken leg with probability of 50% or death with a probability of 5%, I would gladly choose the former. Such decisions might seem disrespectful towards humans if mentioned explicitely, but they happen a lot in real life, be them often more subtle or not.
