Depending on the mission you can do a LOT with a single launch. My Senior Design project (for an aerospace engineering degree) was a Mars Sample Return Mission (unmanned) we could fit absolutely everything we needed into a single Ariane V launch. \u00A0The lander and the orbiter were two totally separate spacecraft all for a low cost of 3.12 Billion dollars.

Most of Protons failures were in the early years of the Proton when launch failures were more common than they are now (though they still have one failure in some form about once a year).

That was also a 5kg sample. Most humans don\u0027t weigh 5kg. I\u0027m a small human and I weigh about 80kg (though I could stand to lose 25kg). Humans also require a lot more support for things like air and water and generally not being dead. In the project we could get away with an Ariane V because there was very little supporting equipment required and the payload mass was extremely small. You could certainly send human ashes to Mars with something like our project but I feel like that somehow wouldnt count.

Elon says numbers and things that while are not outright lies often take about twice as long as he said to happen. SpaceX will go to mars at some point (I hope that it will be in the 2020s with people) but will most likely be in the 30s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. During the 60s NASA got about 4.5% MAX of the federal budget (which was lower back then) (and about 2x what they currently get when adjusted to 2014 USD). \u00A0SpaceX is not totally relying on governmental money to do this (yes they have contracts with the government and got some money to make the rockets in the first place but not all that much)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Please dont bring Politics into this. what the candidates will or wont do is largely irrelevant. NASA has had HUGE effects on technology and science and thus is not likely to be totally dismantled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Rockets fail all the time. another failure will not doom SpaceX just like all the Proton Failures have not doomed that rocket. Also The government will continue to buy launches for them if they think the pricing is right for the risks they are taking. if they want a surefire launch they will go with ULA. If they accept the risks of SpaceX and want to launch on a not quite perfect vehicle at a MUCH lower cost (60 Mil vs 120 Mil for comparable Masses to orbit)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Depending on the mission you can do a LOT with a single launch. My Senior Design project (for an aerospace engineering degree) was a Mars Sample Return Mission (unmanned) we could fit absolutely everything we needed into a single Ariane V launch. \u00A0The lander and the orbiter were two totally separate spacecraft all for a low cost of 3.12 Billion dollars. (which over the ~8 year lifespan of the mission (from start of design\u00A0to landing) \u00A0is not a ton) .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. We dont know what SpaceX\u0027s mars plans really are. \u00A0We will find out in September when they announce more of the MCT and BFR architecture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7. SpaceX does the (seemingly) impossible.
