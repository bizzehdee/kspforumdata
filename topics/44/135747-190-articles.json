It isn\u0027t. The largest cost is the manpower that operates the launch service, and SpaceX is already\u00A0about as cheap as it can be on that side (unless they start outsourcing to India, which I doubt). Even with reuse, they will still have to maintain that huge factory in Hawthorne (which is actually scaled for mass production, not reuse).

F9 is designed to be an economically competitive choice. STS was designed to get support from Congress. Re-using F9 stages is an opportunity to reduce costs. If it doesn\u0027t work out economically/practically, SpaceX doesn\u0027t continue the reuse avenue, and just flies expendable F9s. When the STS wasn\u0027t easy to turn around, well, what are you going to do? Tell Congress you need to design a new vehicle? Build new orbiters for each launch?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a really quick and dirty breakdown of labor costs at SpaceX by type (manufacturing, engineering, overhead), just look at the careers page at SpaceX\u0027s site--the vast majority of positions are for manufacturing, so one should not just say, oh, SpaceX overhead isn\u0027t reduced, therefore reusability is DOA economically; okay, so what? (Yes, there are differences in wages and costs other than wages per position, and turnover probably doesn\u0027t occur at the same rate, but as a first level approximation, it ain\u0027t bad). Sure, maybe 20% of departments at SpaceX don\u0027t need to see increased labor costs w/ increased flight rate, but that 20% might have 50% of the labor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n20-30% in cost/price reduction w/ reusing first stages doesn\u0027t seem like a wildly inaccurate claim. It won\u0027t happen for several years, and the launch rate might need to reach some minimum first before it approaches that territory, but it\u0027s probably a reasonable guess. Unless we know Musk\u0027s assumptions (we don\u0027t) we can\u0027t judge very accurately the validity of the choice. Betting the company to save 20%\u00A0might not\u00A0make sense for established players, but betting the company for 20% if the company is a start-up has a better expected value. Reduced prices by 20% on top of 50% compared to competitors might sway customers who are on the fence already. But all of this without data is just faffing about. :-) Nibb is absolutely right: SpaceX is taking a gamble--if it pays off, others will soon follow suit, if it doesn\u0027t maybe SpaceX will vanish or be bought-out.

F9 is designed to be an economically competitive choice. STS was designed to get support from Congress. Re-using F9 stages is an opportunity to reduce costs. If it doesn\u0027t work out economically/practically, SpaceX doesn\u0027t continue the reuse avenue, and just flies expendable F9s. When the STS wasn\u0027t easy to turn around, well, what are you going to do? Tell Congress you need to design a new vehicle? Build new orbiters for each launch?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a really quick and dirty breakdown of labor costs at SpaceX by type (manufacturing, engineering, overhead), just look at the careers page at SpaceX\u0027s site--the vast majority of positions are for manufacturing, so one should not just say, oh, SpaceX overhead isn\u0027t reduced, therefore reusability is DOA economically; okay, so what? (Yes, there are differences in wages and costs other than wages per position, and turnover probably doesn\u0027t occur at the same rate, but as a first level approximation, it ain\u0027t bad). Sure, maybe 20% of departments at SpaceX don\u0027t need to see increased labor costs w/ increased flight rate, but that 20% might have 50% of the labor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n20-30% in cost/price reduction w/ reusing first stages doesn\u0027t seem like a wildly inaccurate claim. It won\u0027t happen for several years, and the launch rate might need to reach some minimum first before it approaches that territory, but it\u0027s probably a reasonable guess. Unless we know Musk\u0027s assumptions (we don\u0027t) we can\u0027t judge very accurately the validity of the choice.

It isn\u0027t.

Even with reuse, they will still have to maintain that huge factory in Hawthorne (which is actually scaled for mass production, not reuse).
