SciAm is still probably a better option if you want something deeper than Discover that is still reasonably kid friendly. Science is probably not going to be the best option unless your kids already have a deep interest and you\u0027re trying to nurture it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might also consider National Geographic. They tend to be more multidisciplinary than you might expect, though I tend to pick up their specials when they happen to coincide with my interests rather than their normal monthly issues, which might bias my perspective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would also recommend looking at Smithsonian\u0027s Air \u0026amp; Space magazine. Obviously it is more focused and has more of a history point of view than scientific, but could foster an interest in engineering. IEEE Spectrum is another pretty decent option for engineering. It tends to be reasonably technical, but still covers things that are of general interest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
