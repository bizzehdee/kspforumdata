That\u0027s why there ever was one Mriya and even that one mostly transported smaller things, cargoes that a pair of Ruslans would have handled just as well.

Customers don\u0027t like if their expensive satellites explode, let alone get dropped in the ocean either. If anything the bigger issue is whether the hardpoint is capable of carrying the requisite mass to haul even low density supersize cargo. Wikipedia says 250 tons, or on par with the Mriya. That would have to include the pod, but otherwise should be ok.\u00A0 Range might be severely limited compared, though. Only 1200nm to launch point so double that to 2400nm for point to point. That\u0027s barely enough to cross the Atlantic via the shortest route. And that was with a supposedly quite aerodynamic if heavy payload attached.

Mainly it has to do with MZFW. Boeing planes are generally designed to carry more payload weight than they need for passengers, which makes them a lot easier to convert to freighters. Airbus freighters have mostly competed in the package freight business, in which payload volume is more limiting than payload weight. (Think cardboard boxes mostly full of air and Styrofoam.) Boeing has mostly captured the general freight market (for denser cargos).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"monophonic","CreatedById":76902,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-02T08:54:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224098202\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022207074\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221646149607\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022137807\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mikegarrison\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 hours ago, mikegarrison said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause one of the world\u0027s richest people decided to fund it as a personal project.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA lot of niche markets tend to be served by people\u0027s personal projects. A lot of those projects never turn any profit either. That\u0027s all the more reason a niche market might get served by a repurposed project from another niche. I doubt the An-225 ever recouped its development costs either. Of course China just might decide they want to one up the Mriya and build an even larger cargo plane just to show they can. I don\u0027t see much market for multiple airframes at that size, so that would be it for any other ideas.

Mainly it has to do with MZFW. Boeing planes are generally designed to carry more payload weight than they need for passengers, which makes them a lot easier to convert to freighters. Airbus freighters have mostly competed in the package freight business, in which payload volume is more limiting than payload weight. (Think cardboard boxes mostly full of air and Styrofoam.)

But still only the 747 (that I\u0027m aware of) can have the nose door that allows loading very long items. Outside dedicated transport aircraft obviously. I was interested only in the (very) niche loads that are too long even for an An-124 yet wide and/or tall enough that a 747 cannot swallow them. Maybe 1-2 of those per year at most? Usually they travel by sea but every once in a long while someone needs one in a hurry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, I know I am overly interested in these weird corner cases and such... That\u0027s the privilege of not being actually involved in the business in any way. I can fulfill my morbid curiosities at will without letting reality get in the way. Note that I am not advocating doing any one thing or another at all. Just musing about what might come to pass should someone decide to fork out a pallet or three full of cash.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
