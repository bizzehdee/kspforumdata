It takes a sort of philosophical understanding to answer, and an opinion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay you are Mr. Photon who just got emitted from the surface on the Sun. You are moving at c. According relativity, when you move at C, everything you observe(which will be moving past you at c) will have it\u0027s time stretched to infinity, and the space(x, distance, length) contracts to 0. This means that you can see where you, Mr. Photon, will hit and die already. But, because you\u0027re not moving because time is infinity so no time is actually passing, you go no where.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, Mr Photon starts his journey at t = 0, and ends his journey at t = 0. No time passes, so has he crossed a distance? Lorentz contraction will tell you no. He started his journey at point A, and ended at point B. However, the distance to point A and B is 0, because the space between them has contracted so much. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat does this tell us? It tells us that Mr. Photon simultaneously sees every point on the path along his journey, and is also destroyed in that moment. No time has passed. Nada. t = 0 still. This is why things don\u0027t move at the speed of light. If Mr. photon were moving at .99999999999999999999999c you would have almost the same thing happen except that at some point you actually reach point b(and that it\u0027s a non zero distance, but VERY small, away) and that t1 does not equal t2 so a minute(again VERY small) amount of time would pass. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, Mr. Photon traveling at c does see everything whilst simultaneously dying because space and time is not anywhere close to how we think of it in his reference frame.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this is a slightly better explanation, whilst being equally unsatisfying. My response to that is, get used to it.

There are similarities but they are fundamentally different things. As you have stated E=mc^2, so we know that Energy is interchangable with in effect. However, this does not mean that photons carrying energy suddenly become massive. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI appreciate your questioning of my knowledge of fusion, yes I know very well what it is. You are correct, some energy from the sun is lost in the form of photons. However, the majority of the mass lost by the Sun is alpha and beta radiation. The Sun emits billions of particles every second and not all of them are photons. The point that all mass that leaves the Sun through photons is completely incorrect. Some of it is carried away as particles, and the rest is converted to energy in the form of photons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I\u0027ve stated above, what energy is lost is carried away as energy, not as mass. I appreciate your use of Einsten\u0027s equation. Go find a phone with a 12.16 Wh battery and find the mass to within 16 sigfigs to see if there is a difference between fully charged and empty. I would love to be proven wrong. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, this is the amount of energy contained within a mass. Now that you are using a molecule and not a phone that is presumably at rest, I can quote you the entire equation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E E = (M^2c^2 \u002B p^2c^4)^(1/2)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will note that because there is a p, we cannot have particles in motion in this equation and that term would go to 0, giving us Einsten\u0027s famous E=mc^2. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, because there is momentum in particles moving between energy states we have to take into account the total energy of the system. Most of the places where you say mass should be replaced with energy. Photons carry energy and momentum. This is fact, we have proven it. Does a laser feel any heavier when you shoot it at your hand? There should be at least 10^20 photons hitting your hand every second but this doesn\u0027t mean your hand gets more massive. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout gamma rays - they carry a lot of energy and momentum. p = h/lamda, their wavelength is on the order of 10^-15. Thats a damn small wavelength and a pretty large momentum for a single photon to carry. This allows the gamma ray to smack into other particles and allow them to emit an electron, and an oppositely charged electron, a positron. The gamma ray merely transfers its energy to these new particles, not its mass. That\u0027s like saying if were to punch my big brother that I would lose part of my fist inside of him.

This allows the gamma ray to smack into other particles and allow them to emit an electron, and an oppositely charged electron, a positron. The gamma ray merely transfers its energy to these new particles, not its mass. That\u0027s like saying if were to punch my big brother that I would lose part of my fist inside of him.

Your analogies are really bad. The gamma ray didn\u0027t smack the electon out of the \u0022other particle\u0022. The electron and the positron were pair-created out of the photon. The photon lost its energy (and mass) in the process, while the positron and electron gained that energy (and mass).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Consider the mass defect in nuclear fission. Your original atom has a certain nuclear binding energy. This nuclear binding energy is automatically a part of the mass of the original nucleus. If you split the nucleus, you release a bit of the binding energy. The fission products (including any stray neutrons, electrons or alpha particles) have LESS binding energy and automatically they have LESS mass. How do you explain that. If \u0022E=mc\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2\u0022 does mean that you could interchange a certain amout of energy for a certain amount of mass and reverse, by REDUCING its binding energy, it should have PRODUCED Mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn reality, \u0022E=mc\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2\u0022 isn\u0027t an \u0022exchange rate\u0022, but it means that the Energy \u0022E\u0022 IS automatically the mass \u0022m\u0022. The fission products have LESS binding energy, and hence LESS mass. The Energy that was binding energy is converted to kinetic energy of the fission products, and gamma photons. If you calculate the relativistic mass of the fission products and of the photons, no mass is lost. The whole process conserved energy AND mass, because both are one and the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me give you a thought experiment, that is hopfully convincing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI claim that the \u0022relativistic mass\u0022 is real. The concept of \u0022invariant mass\u0022 may make certain calculatons easier, but it isn\u0027t more fundamental, because sometimes there is no clear distinction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, mass and energy aren\u0027t two different things that can be exchanged, increasing one quantity while decreasing the other. This is a rampant misunderstanding. Mass and Energy are the same thing, and every amount of energy is automatically a certain amount of mass. By decreasing the energy of a system, its mass will decrease. The lost energy had to go somewhere, and the lost mass went the same way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsider a positron-electron plasma. If the observing time is small enough, this plasma is stable (they will annihilate eventually, but only after a small amount of time). We have 1 kg of plasma. We contain it into a 0.1 kg box. From the outside, we don\u0027t know what is inside. What will we get, if we measure the invariant mass of the box? If we are at rest with the box, and we put a force of 1.1 N on the box, it will accelerate with 1 m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2. So the invariant mass seems to be about 1.1 kg (the mass of the empty box plus the mass of the plasma)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the positrons and electrons in the box annihilate over time, they \u0022become\u0022 gamma photons. Assume the walls of the box are perfect mirrors for gamma photons, so after some time, there are only photons left in the box. But from the outside, we can\u0027t know what is happening inside the box. We only see a box. What will we get, if we measure the invariant mass of the box after the whole plasma is annihilated? The same as before! The box still seems to have the invariant mass of 1.1 kg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom the inside, we can explain that by the photon pressure on the walls. By accelerating the box, a red- and blushift of the photons will produce a different photon pressure at the opposing walls of the box, so they produce a resistance against the acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut from the outside, we don\u0027t see and know that, and we don\u0027t care. From the outside, the box seems to have always just an invariant mass of 1.1 kg, it doesn\u0027t matter what happens inside. So the invariant mass of an object can be just the \u0022relativistic mass\u0022 of the photons in disguise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may say: The plasma lost mass, it was converted to energy, and now the photons have this energy. But what does that even mean, if the whole system behaves just as if it still had the original mass. Heck, even the gravity from the box doesn\u0027t change!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this is the case for every system. It doesn\u0027t matter how energy is converted, it always carriers its equvialent in mass. By adding 16 Wh chemical energy to my battery, it will get heavier. (The energy source, maybe a burning piece of coal, will get lighter). By compressing a mechanical spring, it gets heavier. By inducing a current into a superconducter, it gets heavier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t any new physics, or just something a guy tells you on the internet.

This mass defect in the system may be simply calculated as \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACm = \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACE/c2, and this was the form of the equation historically first presented by Einstein in 1905. However, use of this formula in such circumstances has led to the false idea that mass has been \u0022converted\u0022 to energy. This may be particularly the case when the energy (and mass) removed from the system is associated with the binding energy of the system. In such cases, the binding energy is observed as a \u0022mass defect\u0022 or deficit in the new system.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe whole idea that mass and energy can be coverted into each other is just a missunderstandig, rampant because some people are to fanatic with there \u0022invariant-mass-purism\u0022, bad high-school teachers and bad didactic choices by college professors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe question if a photon has a mass or not IS just a semantic one.

This is how E=mc^2 is derived. I don\u0027t know how you can say that E=mc^2 is just some stand alone equation that Einstein just came up with. This equation is how he did it. E=mc^2 does not work for massless particles, such as photons, and that terms to 0. This gives you E= pc which you have already stated what this means. This is where it comes from.
