So, to address a few of your points... First, even if we were to have only just started to monitor the CO2 rates this year, we could still get a pretty good idea of levels in the past. When ice freezes, it traps little air bubbles inside of it. These air bubbles contain various gasses, and by examining ice cores retrieved from glaciers we can get an accurate approximation of atmospheric composition back to the formation of said glacier/ ice sheet.
