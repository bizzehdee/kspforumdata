It has a methane cycle analouge to earths water cycle and there are many other factors and analogyies which argue it may host complex probiotic life. Some reasons I found in my research (source - wiki, I know it is not the most reliable source, but I just found it and need someone smart enough here to discuss this)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) The\u00A0Miller\u2013Urey experiment\u00A0and several following experiments have shown that with an atmosphere similar to that of Titan and the addition of\u00A0UV radiation, complex molecules and polymer substances like\u00A0tholins\u00A0can be generated. The reaction starts withdissociation\u00A0of nitrogen and methane, forming hydrogen cyanide and acetylene. Further reactions have been studied extensively.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2)\u00A0In October 2010, Sarah Horst of the\u00A0University of Arizona\u00A0reported finding the five\u00A0nucleotide bases\u2014building blocks of\u00A0DNA\u00A0and\u00A0RNA\u2014among the many compounds produced when energy was applied to a combination of gases like those in Titan\u0027s atmosphere. Horst also found\u00A0amino acids, the building blocks ofprotein. She said it was the first time nucleotide bases and amino acids had been found in such an experiment without liquid water being present.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) On April 3, 2013, NASA reported that complexorganic chemicals\u00A0could arise on Titan based on studies simulating the\u00A0atmosphere\u00A0of Titan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4)\u00A0Laboratory simulations have led to the suggestion that enough organic material exists on Titan to start a chemical evolution analogous to what is thought to have started life on Earth. Although the analogy assumes the presence of liquid water for longer periods than is currently observable, several theories suggest that liquid water from an impact could be preserved under a frozen isolation layer. it has\u00A0also\u00A0been theorized that liquid-ammonia oceans could exist deep below the surface.\u00A0Another\u00A0model suggests an ammonia\u2013water solution as much as 200 kilometres (120\u00A0mi) deep beneath a water-ice crust with conditions that, although extreme by terrestrial standards, are such that life could indeed survive.\u00A0Heat\u00A0transfer\u00A0between the interior and upper layers would be critical in sustaining any subsurface oceanic life.\u00A0Detection of microbial life on Titan would depend on its biogenic effects. That the atmospheric methane and nitrogen might be of biological origin has been examined, for example.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5) It has been suggested that life could exist in the lakes of liquid methane on Titan, just as organisms on Earth live in water.\u00A0Such\u00A0organisms would inhale H2\u00A0in place of O2, metabolize it with\u00A0acetylene\u00A0instead ofglucose, and exhale methane instead of carbon dioxide.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6) Although all living things on Earth (including methanogens) use liquid water as a solvent, it is speculated that life on Titan might instead use a liquid hydrocarbon, such as methane or ethane.\u00A0Water\u00A0is a stronger solvent than methane.\u00A0However, water is also more chemically reactive, and can break down large organic molecules throughhydrolysis.\u00A0A\u00A0life-form whose solvent was a hydrocarbon would not face the risk of its biomolecules being destroyed in this way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7) In 2005,\u00A0astrobiologist\u00A0Chris McKay\u00A0argued that if methanogenic life did exist on the surface of Titan, it would likely have a measurable effect on the mixing ratio in the Titan troposphere: levels of hydrogen and acetylene would be measurably lower than otherwise expected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8) In 2010, Darrell Strobel, from\u00A0Johns Hopkins University, identified a greater abundance of molecular hydrogen in the upper atmospheric layers of Titan compared to the lower layers, arguing for a downward flow at a rate of roughly 1025\u00A0molecules per second and disappearance of hydrogen near Titan\u0027s surface; as Strobel noted, his findings were in line with the effects McKay had predicted ifmethanogenic\u00A0life-forms were present. Same year, another study showed low levels of acetylene on Titan\u0027s surface, which were interpreted by McKay as consistent with the hypothesis of organisms consuming hydrocarbons.\u00A0Although restating the biological hypothesis, he cautioned that other explanations for the hydrogen and acetylene findings are more likely: the possibilities of yet unidentified physical or chemical processes (e.g. a surface\u00A0catalyst\u00A0accepting hydrocarbons or hydrogen), or flaws in the current models of material flow.\u00A0Composition\u00A0data and transport models need to be substantiated, etc. Even so, despite saying that a non-biological catalytic explanation would be less startling than a biological one, McKay noted that the discovery of a catalyst effective at 95\u00A0K (\u2212180\u00A0\u00B0C) would still be significant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n9) As NASA notes in its news article on the June 2010 findings: \u0022To date, methane-based life forms are only hypothetical. Scientists have not yet detected this form of life anywhere.\u00A0As\u00A0the NASA statement also says: \u0022some scientists believe these chemical signatures bolster the argument for a primitive, exotic form of life or precursor to life on Titan\u0027s surface.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n10) In February 2015, a hypothetical\u00A0cell membrane\u00A0capable of functioning in liquidmethane\u00A0in Titan conditions was modeled. Composed of small molecules containing carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen, it would have the same stability and flexibility as cell membranes on Earth, which are composed ofphospholipids, compounds of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and\u00A0phosphorus. This hypothetical cell membrane was termed an \u0022azotosome\u0022, a combination of \u0022azote\u0022, French for nitrogen, and \u0022liposome\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n11) Despite these biological possibilities, there are formidable obstacles to life on Titan, and any analogy to Earth is inexact. At a vast distance from the\u00A0Sun, Titan is frigid, and its atmosphere lacks CO2. At Titan\u0027s surface, water exists only in solid form. Because of these difficulties, scientists such as\u00A0Jonathan Lunine\u00A0have viewed Titan less as a likely habitat for life, than as an experiment for examining theories on the conditions that prevailed prior to the appearance of life on Earth. Although\u00A0life\u00A0itself may not exist, the prebiotic conditions on Titan and the associated organic chemistry remain of great interest in understanding the early history of the terrestrial biosphere. As a prebiotic experiment involves not only observation through spacecraft, but laboratory experiments, and chemical and photochemical modeling on Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL\u0027DR \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what do you think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-11T05:51:18Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2016 05:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by RenegadeRad\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EDamn autocorrect\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-11T06:31:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe will only know when we send a lander there with the proper experiments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-11T08:04:53Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2016 08:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RenegadeRad","CreatedById":161008,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-11T07:22:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222626216\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022141592\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221465626685\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u00227272\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nibb31\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n50 minutes ago, Nibb31 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe will only know when we send a lander there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is not the real Nibb31!

Actually, any polar molecules are useless at these temperatures. Life is a delicate balance of bonds that are strong enough to hold things together, yet weak enough to be pulled apart with the right enzymes. Take DNA to cryogenic temperatures of Titan, and you couldn\u0027t replicate it no matter what sort of complex chemistry you throw at it. The bonds are simply too strong at that temperature, and anything that could pull them apart freezes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, Titan\u0027s temperature is just right for non-polar solvents, just like Earth\u0027s is just right for polar solvents.

Right of the bat, we are dramatically limiting the kinds of compounds we could possibly use for life on Titan. Is that a critical problem? No way to know, but I\u0027d bet this is the sort of thing that would increase amount of time needed for life to evolve. So will temperature, by the way. There is absolutely no way of getting around the fact that metabolism on Titan is going to be painfully slow. Meaning a long time, by Earth standards, between generations of anything living.

So even if we know that life exists her on Earth and either does or did exist on the Red Planet, we\u0027d still not be any wiser about life out there. If we find life on Titan, we\u0027ll know with absolute certainty that life evolved independently on two very different bodies in this Solar System.

On earth you have a polar solvent and non-polar solvent. Polar solvents are mostly limited to above the freezing point of salt water. Non-polar solvents can really exist at any temperature above the freezing point of methane gas, there are non-polar solvents for all seasons. Life is strung between the two,literally.

Titan, basically is strung together because of it distance from the sun, in a volatile substance trap for things that are liberated from passing comets and from planets of the inner solar system (like mercury, venus and mars). If there was substantial heat coming from its core it would evolve more gas. So I think life on titan would be hard to find and fragile. Human life on titan.

In a glycerol for example, enzymes can be kept active in freezer for years at around -20\u0027c, not frozen but also active at such a low rate they are essentially stopped. To preserve cells you can keep them alive in DMSO at below -50\u0027c for a long time, and in liquid nitrogen essentially forever. The biggest problem for cells are the membranes, which are largely non-polar in nature. Basically below -50\u0027C everything stops. Life requires complexity, but below -50\u0027C all the complex components are essentially stopped, not active, and limited to diffusion at slow rates, redox reactions (the back bone of energy production in living organisms), the overwhelming majority would take millions of years to complete.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a zone between 10\u0027C and around -10\u0027C where you can have super organisms, such as found in the ocean. This is because they live off of reduced oxidation and they tend to accumulate oil (very difficult to burn at such low temperatures).

Because of the low rates of oxidation they tend not to age, and tend to grow extremely large, but that -10\u0027C is a critical point because of the rate of metabolism gets too low, such organisms become prey to warm blooded air-breathing creatures with large stores of insulating fat. below -20\u0027C the cryoprotectants required become so profound that systems cannot function, DNA cannot replicate, all kinds of bad things.

Enzymes do this by lowering the transition state energy maximum that would otherwise be overcome by alternative reactions or slower rate or higher temperature. Without self replicating catalysis of the system there can be no life. To have it you have to have a system that can do this. As far as I know, no such low transition energy tolerant system exists. Thermodynamics is the driving force, but kinetics makes it possible. What are the energy drivers. ADP ---\u0026gt; ATP and NADP (NAD) -------\u0026gt; NADPH (NADH).\u00A0 These absolutely do not have to be the drivers, but the problem is that at very low temperatures you cannot have the energy per bond that you can get at higher temperatures. The particular problem is the H: moiety, without it one would find it excessively difficult to polymerize. But at those energies you do not have the ability to overcome the kinetic barriers. The only two enzymes that we know of are RNA and protiens, both need an environment containing water. Of the two proteins are most potent, anyone who studies X-ray crystallography knows that enymes are surrounded by water and frequently are involved in the transtion state themselves, many of the most potent enzymes have metal cofactors in the binding site, and rely on the transition state oxidation states and complex non-covelant bond structure to achieve catalysis in which water participates in those reactions. The potency of these reactions elevates rate, and also elevates the rate of evolution. In Eucaryotes this is particularly important because the electron transport chain is a major source of mutations that drive evolution and a major impetus for recombinative replciation versus simple fission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is an idea in evolution that the rate of evolutionary diversification occurs fastest in the tropics. The driving force of evolution is light and permissive heat, for example one way animals survive in cold climate is to go into dormancy. The thermodynamic potential created by wavelengths that create transition state radicals is what drives very precise energy flow from hv into conversion of O-H bonds X-H bonds. This then is the major driver of the rest of the ecosystem. If you look at the lowest boiling point alcohols, around -100c. But these do not crystallize like water, but go through an amorphous transition state at very low temperatures, for example at\u00A0 below \u221278.5\u0027C (the temperature of dry ice), 100% ethanol becomes thick like honey. So that our lowest potential OH bond now diffuses at an incredibly slow rate even before reaching. However at very low diffusion rates its difficult to transfer energy. Therefore the ability to use X-H bonds or build X-H bonds at such temperatures is limited.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, you might find something, a reaction or an interaction below -50\u0027C but it won\u0027t be complex, you wont find systems, and whatever you find, compared to Earth, would be unevolved, because it lacks two driving principles, thermodynamics (hv in sunlight) and permissive kinetics. The thermodynamics of titans limits the energy of bond formation, and the kinetics limits the rate life evolves. The fact that Titan is relatively small, means that its interior and mineral crust is probably rock solid and cold. Not the conditions that would predict life.

Unfortunately, it is used as a general term referring to relative changes that are not well defined or quantitated. In this review we provide a definition for the redox environment of biological fluids, cell organelles, cells, or tissue. We illustrate how the reduction potential of various redox couples can be estimated with the Nernst equation and show how pH and the concentrations of the species comprising different redox couples influence the reduction potential. We discuss how the redox state of the glutathione disulfide-glutathione couple (GSSG/2GSH) can serve as an important indicator of redox environment. There are many redox couples in a cell that work together to maintain the redox environment; the GSSG/2GSH couple is the most abundant redox couple in a cell. Changes of the half-cell reduction potential (E(hc)) of the GSSG/2GSH couple appear to correlate with the biological status of the cell: proliferation E(hc) approximately -240 mV; differentiation E(hc) approximately -200 mV; or apoptosis E(hc) approximately -170 mV. These estimates can be used to more fully understand the redox biochemistry that results from oxidative stress. These are the first steps toward a new quantitative biology, which hopefully will provide a rationale and understanding of the cellular mechanisms associated with cell growth and development, signaling, and reductive or oxidative stress.\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EPMID:11368918\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCatching the species before they leave the mitochondria is also important.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOMIM:\u003Ca href=\u0022http://omim.org/entry/133540\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://omim.org/entry/133540 \u0022\u003C/a\u003E All 6 presented with the congenital severe phenotype that included severe failure to thrive, severe mental retardation, congenital cataracts, loss of adipose tissue, joint contractures, distinctive face with small, deep-set eyes and prominent nasal bridge, kyphosis, and cachectic dwarfism.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERCC6\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERCC6\u003C/a\u003E does both.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe can contrast with the environment outside the cell in Seawater of 300 to 500 mV a difference of 1/2 to 1 volt in potential.

Redox state of glutathione in human plasma. Jones DP1, Carlson JL, Mody VC, Cai J, Lynn MJ, Sternberg P. Thiol and disulfide forms of glutathione (GSH) and cysteine (Cys) were measured in plasma from 24 healthy individuals aged 25-35 and redox potential values (E(h)) for thiol/disulfide couples were calculated using the Nernst equation. Although the concentration of GSH (2.8 \u002B/- 0.9 microM) was much greater than that of GSSG (0.14 \u002B/- 0.04 microM), the redox potential of the GSSG/2GSH pool (-137 \u002B/- 9 mV) was considerably more oxidized than values for tissues and cultured cells (-185 to -258 mV). This indicates that a rapid oxidation of GSH occurs upon release into plasma. The difference in values between individuals was remarkably small, suggesting that the rates of reduction and oxidation in the plasma are closely balanced to maintain this redox potential. The redox potential for the Cys and cystine (CySS) pool (-80 \u002B/- 9 mV) was 57 mV more oxidized, showing that the GSSG/2GSH and the CySS/2Cys pools are not in redox equilibrium in the plasma. Potentials for thiol/disulfide couples involving CysGly were intermediate between the values for these couples. Regression analyses showed that the redox potentials for the different thiol/disulfide couples within individuals were correlated, with the E(h) for CySS-mono-Gly/(Cys. CysGly) providing the best correlation with other low molecular weight pools as well as protein disulfides of GSH, CysGly and Cys. These results suggest that E(h) values for GSSG/2GSH and CySS-mono-Gly/(Cys. CysGly) may provide useful means to quantitatively express the oxidant/antioxidant balance in clinical and epidemiologic studies.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile there is a thousand papers on the topic.

But more importantly, if the body consider the cells defective or infected, the immune system cannot often distinguish the two (a partial impetus for autoimmune disease - as a result you will read about ROS involved in autoimmune disease, and may be an impetus for anti-DNA antibodies in lupus), the ROS route of cell death is advantageous because it places infecting cells (i.e anaerobes and facultative anaerobes) at risk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt should be noted that one paper postulated that because the rate of metabolism for heat production is higher in colder climates, that is the reason why mammalian cold climate species evolve slightly faster (this has been observed in human mitochondria, with slowest rates of evolution in Africa (L5 branch) and fastest rates of evolution for people who passed through temperate or arctic climate, B and D1-4 branches), resulting in the purifying selection/directional evolution arguement), but by the same token, tend to go extinct more quickly. Contrarily there is the potency that replicative machinery makes no mistakes and is completely protective from ROS. My own unpublished studies revealed that the number of mutations at rarely mutated sites increased with land travel distances from L5, the highest being the route through Beringia to South America, with a mean DT between L0k lineage of greater than 2.6 million years (about 10 times faster than expected and there were several lineages of comparable age) for the 3 of 20 bins that contained sites evolved most slowly in eutheria. In each of these bins there where 100s of mutations detected, the fastest rate of change was in the Arctic peoples, thus it appears the ROS activity and direction and purifying selection all acted on evolution of mtDNA.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nComp Biochem Physiol A Mol Integr Physiol. 2002 Aug;132(4):739-61.\u003Cbr\u003E\nProc Biol Sci. 2009 Oct 7;276(1672):3447-55. doi: 10.1098/rspb.2009.0752.

Since we don\u0027t have water we don\u0027t have replication enzymes, so we can\u0027t really compare DNA replication fidelity, and in any case at those temperatures they are pretty much not moving.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuoting myself in context\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat are the energy drivers. ADP ---\u0026gt; ATP and NADP (NAD) -------\u0026gt; NADPH (NADH).\u00A0 These absolutely do not have to be the drivers,\u003Cstrong\u003E but the problem is that at very low temperatures you cannot have the energy per bond that you can get at higher temperatures.\u003C/strong\u003E The particular problem is the H: moiety, without it one would find it excessively difficult to polymerize. But at those energies you do not have the ability to overcome the kinetic barriers. The only two enzymes that we know of are RNA and proteins, both need an environment containing water. Of the two proteins are most potent, anyone who studies X-ray crystallography knows that enymes are surrounded by water and frequently are involved in the transtion state themselves, many of the most potent enzymes have metal cofactors in the binding site, \u003Cstrong\u003Eand rely on the transition state oxidation states and complex non-covelant bond structure to achieve catalysis in which water participates in those reactions\u003C/strong\u003E. The potency of these reactions elevates rate, and also elevates the rate of evolution. In Eucaryotes this is particularly important because the electron transport chain is a major source of mutations that drive evolution and a major impetus for recombinative replication versus simple fission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe key word is In Eucaryotes, not in eucaryotic organelles, but\u003Cstrong\u003E in eucaryotes\u003C/strong\u003E themselves\u00A0 systems replicate by a complex process that eventuall results in some sort of embryogenesis. The point however is that single cell organisms can live in communities that share the same function, and lethal mutations do occur that cause death. But just as there are many mitochondria in each cell, the healthy cells can replace themselves. More importantly there is only 16384 \u002B/- 10 nt of human mtDNA, there is 3x10^9 bp of DNA, and although the rate for free radicals is higher the genome is tolerant about about 10 to 100 mutations per generation before something really\u00A0 risky damage is done, if you had anywhere near the rate of mutation that occurs in the HVR of mtDNA, our genome would be cooked. One of the major proteins built do defend the mt is the ERCC6 which is made by the nucleus and shipped into mt. So not only is the nucleus just defending itself, its defending the mitochondria also.\u00A0 During periods in which cells are rapidly mutating such mutations increase, such as in spermatogenisis in males. But that and other forces limit the finite lifetimes of eucaryotes, particular those with higher metabolisms. Specifically by the time a male is in his 60s (lower for chimpanzees), the spermatazoa have accumulated sufficiently large enough mutations as to make reproduction risk for multiple diseases (autism, schizophrenia). Mitochondria in the cell do die, and they do release free radicals in the process, and thus there is a defensive system, but during periods of environmental stress this can increase, such as migrating into an enviroment that requires more per day calorie consumption due to thermal losses. Compensatory mutations are expected and observed in the human mitochondrial DNA.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus when I say system, i mean system, not your favorite child organelle. The system undergoes recombination as a consequence of the finiteness of life that the system produces. The system has created a process (i.e. the eucaryotic organism) that relies on one step of meiosis during germ-cell replication. No goalpost has changed, this is how eucaryotes cheat death, at least until lineages go extinct, by sharing recombinant DNA between diverse future generations. But in cheating death, they have to die and in fact apoptosis is built into all stages of life. Bacterial can also share, including mitochondria is some species but not most higher mammals, but that is not germane to the argument, because for bacteria its more or less opportunistic. There are very few higher eurcaryotes that are parthenogenic, where has fissile replication is the standard organism replacement scheme in bacteria.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe great oxygenation event was a game changer for life on earth. It is not plausible on a non-photosynthetic world. It drives the ability to produce energy in process like endothery. The types of energy produced that can be devoted to new evolutionary process greatly increases. Genes undergo duplications, take on new functions, etc. The nervous system developes, the primary function of the system is taxis and muscle activity. Things like eating, swimming, again not possible without a thermodynamic potential between food sources and products. So on Titan endothermy, taxis, etc pretty much out of the question. Taxis is driven by ATP, again not available. So you get down to the components that make life complex, not available. Species that cannot burn oxygen, for example anaerobes, still exist in large numbers, but in the biosphere these are delegated to restricted areas of the ecosystem were metabolism is very slow. And so now you are down to the rates of life of things that live on top of petroleum formations that have division times in the 1000s of year range . . . . evolutions stops.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-14T03:15:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease don\u0027t make the discussion personal.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
