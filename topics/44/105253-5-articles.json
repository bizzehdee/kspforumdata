As cool as manned spaceflight is, it\u0027s foolish to think we will solve the looming problems at home (which are significant) by traipsing around the solar system planting flags. Especially right now, when such programs would be hugely expensive.\n\nSpace exploration is important, because it furthers our knowledge of the universe and gives us insight into Earth\u0027s past. That knowledge can help us learn to live intentionally and sustainably on our home planet. But space exploration should be done as efficiently and cheaply as possible. Right now, that means robotic probes. In the future, spaceflight might become cheap enough that manned missions are an efficient use of resources, but that day may be far off.\n\nEdit: Don\u0027t get me wrong, I still think Space X is cool."},{"CreatedByName":"SciMan","CreatedById":12748,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T05:37:33Z","Content":"Ok, regarding the \u0022eggs in one basket\u0022 thing.

Unfortunately it doesn\u0027t look like that\u0027s going to happen anytime soon.\n\nThink about this for a minute. To escape the \u0022if Earth dies, we all die\u0022 trap, space colonies would have to be so self-sufficient they can recreate ALL critical components of their colony from in-situ resources. It isn\u0027t just oxygen, water and power. Those will hold you for a few years, but not even the wildest ISRU plans have us building replacement CPU chips and new spacesuits for growing children! A colony that can\u0027t make more self-sufficient colonies will still die.\n\nIt\u0027s such a huge problem humanity can\u0027t even define all the variables yet. At our current tech level, manned interplanetary spaceflight on a massive scale is actually one of the easier pieces of this puzzle. We know how, it\u0027s just too expensive for us right now. Modern civilization is so interconnected that everything affects everything else. One tiny, simple example: Take a look at the list of ingredients on a multi-vitamin. We need all those chemicals and trace elements to survive. Many of the chemicals are automatically produced inside our food, of course. But all recycling has losses and the raw elements have to be replaced. So just for the materials required to make your daily vitamin pill, the colony needs extraction and refining capability for boron, cobalt, chromium, calcium, chlorine, copper, fluoride, iodine, iron, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, selenium, sodium, sulphur, and zinc. And of course the easy ones, like oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon.\n\nRight now, the only (theoretical!) way a single colony could extract the elements we need from Mars\u0027 surface is one of the ways they enriched uranium in WWII: A combination of a cyclotron and mass spectrometer called a calutron. A physicist once told me that a multistage calutron that was 10x-100x bigger than those could separate the individual elements from vaporized samples in small-but-useful quantities (grams/day). But the three \u0022little\u0022 ones they built in WWII required 14,700 tons of silver and copper. So 100x bigger than that...built on Mars or shipped to Mars (ha!). Oh, and it would require gigawatts of power to run, so first we need a metropolis-sized power plant on Mars.\n\nMaybe soon we\u0027ll be able to make engineered bacteria to concentrate the elements we need. A few of those are in lab-prototype stage, but definitely not all we need. Still, There are bacteria and fungi at Chernobyl that get their energy from the radiation, too. That\u0027d be a really useful trait for a vat of tiny Martian manganese miners.\n\nSee what I mean? It all gets overwhelmingly complex very quickly. The more I learn about it, the less I think it\u0027s possible without advanced nanotech or gengineering.\n\nI want it just as bad as you do, though. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nPS If you think this was bad, look into how much water\u0027s needed to make computer chips. Even a small plant uses a million gallons a day! And they aren\u0027t particularly exceptional. A lot of our industrial processes are based on the assumption that megatonnes of pure water are instantly and cheaply available. Essentially, every process to create every manufactured material will have to be reengineered from scratch. That problem alone would cost decades and billions of dollars to solve with current tools. So we\u0027ll end up waiting for the nanotech, or some other miracle.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T21:49:35Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 09:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Beowolf**"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T23:00:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...And this is the answer to the Fermi Paradox.\n\nHow about an system with two habitable planets, put Venus outward or make Mars Earth sized, better do both. \n\nImpacts ejects will probably make biochemistry pretty equal. \n\nYes its rarer, but not insanely so, an gas giant in the Goldilock zone with multiple earth sized moons would be even easier to travel between.
