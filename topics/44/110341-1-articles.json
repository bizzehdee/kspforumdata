And I just realized that my grade 10 physics knowledge is scarcely capable of helping me here. I\u0027m disregarding the transfer and Europa orbital injection burn, and starting off already in a 60 kilometer orbit at 1,405 m/second.\n\nMain issues, I\u0027m not sure how to work out the landing, and the ascent, aswell as I have no knowledge of the actual rocket science part of all this.

Unless you are using NERVA, Orion (not the WIP ship), solar sails or ion drives. Once you have the mass required to go from LEO to LEO (Low Earth Orbit, Low Europa Orbit) figure out whether it would be cheaper/easier to do orbital assembly or a single launch. Don\u0027t forget probe mass!\n\nI have year 11 physics experience. The report I am currently writing involves projectile motion and drag.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nThat has some stuff already done for you. Don\u0027t forget N-body physics!\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122428-Yes%21-We-ARE-going-to-Europa%21](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122428-Yes%21-We-ARE-going-to-Europa%21)"}]}
