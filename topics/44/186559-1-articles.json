This is not tipping it upright, then a short static fire, then launch 5 days later. It\u0027s a full testing regime of the first time they actually stick all the core stage parts together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA low-budget version is what we have seen with the SpaceX Hopper. Sticking a real engine on something, then trying to fire it. There will be dry runs (many) to check GSE stuff, then eventually they run props through the engines without firing them, then they do a fire at some duration (unsure if they jump right to a full burn, but that seems unlikely). Since they are not hardware rich, they are likely extremely careful (also, they are NASA, so extremely careful), hence it takes months.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPrevious (all overly optimistic, BTW) NASA timelines for SLS milestones had shown the Core Stage delivered to Stennis (edit:was right the first time) in December, and Green Run completion, with delivery to FL some 6 months later. Both milestones had a 2-4 month schedule risk associated with them.
