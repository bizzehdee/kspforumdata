With this car you can say \u0022I need a bike\u0022 and swipe it across the terminal at the bike dispenser and now you are renting a bike. Drop it off at any dispenser. Same with cars.

They just put their own cars in the way. With a plane, your options are much more limited. Any police agency for a major city is going to be tasked with protecting it from assorted dangers, such as a flying car loaded with explosives. However unlikely this is, they are going to want to be able to say that if there is something like a major baseball game going on, they can take care of the issue. I find this moderately unnecessary, but that doesn\u0027t mean they won\u0027t use it as an example and thus get their AA weaponry. Remember, for some reason police agencies are managing to acquire military grade MRAPs (mine resistant armored personnel carriers). How often have these been needed in the USA? So rarely enough that quite frankly, they don\u0027t need them. If things get to the point where you need a vehicle like that, you should bring in the National Guard or something.
