And that is exactly what they are doing, dismantling the social pact that created a healthy middle class in the 80\u0027s to increase the income difference between the very rich and everyone else.

But if you look at the resources charts from the first oil crisis, you might ask yourself how is it that we have already used more oil than there was supposed to be in the first place. The answer is, we now look into more places to get it, and we are prepared to invest more effort to get it. Iron is not running out any time soon, as in the next few centuries.

Well, some people once doubted that they would be able to support one billion (I kid you not). So I\u0027d say they will be able to support much more than that. Just because they will have to. At no point in all of the history of our species has the total population of Earth actually diminished over any period of time.

Millions (and billions) will die of hunger and thirst. The biosphere will degrade to some point. We will continue to be poor stewards of our planet in general. But when the boop really starts to hit the fan, we will suddenly get creative and find some way to survive. And not only survive, I doubt very much that we stop growing our population. It\u0027s just how we are. And even now we can see some of the solutions: nuclear power, farming the sea (you can make flour out of algae), renewable energies (up to some point), and increasing in the efficiency with which we use stuff (we are becoming good at that in Europe). Even the dream of fusion energy will some day come true, I believe, and then energy stops being the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if we solve the issue of energy... well, what\u0027s stopping us from increasing the usable amount of land by digging underground farms, for example? I don\u0027t like that future too much, but I\u0027m afraid the Earth is going to have much more than 10 billion people pretty soon, and the barrier of 20 will go down soon after. Someone calculated once that the world\u0027s peak sustainable population would be in the hundreds of millions. One thing is for sure: all the Malthusian bullcrap has always been proved wrong, and soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we will kill a lot of species, but I very much doubt we will kill ourselves.

Yes it has an political cost. This cost is larger than the cost of not doing something. Some rolling blackouts in January tend to focus peoples minds. Until then easier to just burn more coal.

An 10.000 year old problem, doing things globally even out most of the bumps. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd you has areas who lack food because of war like Somalia, and mismanagement as North Korea. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd Malthus was not wrong, rather he would been right 200 year before his birth. At his time the industrial revolution was underway, increasing production by magnitudes. Anyway birth rates are dropping worldwide, not just in the west, Russia has an real issue with this, China will, birth rates in the Latin and Arabic countries is also way down, most places below replacement.

Perhaps nuclear fuel \u003Cem\u003Eas we measure it now\u003C/em\u003E would run out in a few decades if we instantly switched to 100% nuclear power. But that is like saying oil would run out as soon as the first oil field runs out: most of the usable ore is still undiscovered. And that doesn\u0027t take into account alternative fuels like thorium, which is perfectly viable an much more plentiful. In the real world, if a serious transition to nuclear power was started today, it will probably take millennia to go through all the fissile material in the accessible areas of the Earth\u0027s crust. But I can\u0027t give you accurate numbers, because nobody has bothered to measure it properly. Just the quantity in the highest concentration in the areas where we currently extract it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, your comments about Europe and my country in particular: do you seriously think the problem is anything but political? Our government is committing economic suicide, and it actually makes perfect sense: it matters to them exactly nothing that more than 20% of people is unemployed, as long as them and their families and friends keep getting richer and they manage to get voted into office again, even if they have to wait 4-8 years while the other guys in the opposition have a shot at doing the same thing and calling it something different. And that is exactly what they are doing, dismantling the social pact that created a healthy middle class in the 80\u0027s to increase the income difference between the very rich and everyone else.
