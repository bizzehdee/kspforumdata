Doesn\u0027t look like a detachable capsule; it\u0027s just a cone-shaped flight deck which does make sense from a design standpoint since it allows forward facing visibility without the awkwardness of a cupola-type design if you\u0027re planning on putting a docking port/airlock on the front of it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bits of the movie that took me out of it the most and seemed most contrived weren\u0027t actually any of the tech designs; they all seem pretty realistic.

Kind of similar to how in 2001 the little EVA pods, cool as they are, serve almost no functional purpose since the astronauts take them a few hundred meters from the ship and then propel themselves out of them back towards the ship. You might as well have just opened the hatch and propelled yourself around on your own.

Secondly unless the reactor is ungodly heavy by spacecraft standards it won\u0027t have shielding all the way around like a marine reactor.

This seems to be the case in the movie as the reactor is located all the way at the back of the ship next to the engine, while the crewed section is on the other end of the ship. So presumably just above the reactor is the shadow shield. Notice how the Hermes on DA by francisdrakex had these funny looking radiators arranged in a triangular pattern?
