Can you please expand?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are, of course, plenty of competent people in climate and atmospheric sciences. They have their share of nutjobs, too, and lately, it\u0027s been popular to make some of the more exagerrated and less reliable claims into sensationalist news.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of it is best illustrated with some toy models. Lets pretend, for a moment, that Earth was a perfect sphere of constant albedo and had the uniform temperature across the surface. Things are obviously way more complicated, but it\u0027s a good picture to start with. Earth is roughly 200 times further from Sun\u0027s center than Sun\u0027s own surface, and Earth is going to receive solar radiation with cross-section area \u00C3\u00E2\u201A\u00ACR\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 and radiate in IR from its total surface area 4\u00C3\u00E2\u201A\u00ACR\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2. In other words, it radiates energy from 160,000 times greater surface area than area of Sun\u0027s surface from which it receives radiation. Since radiation of heat goes like T\u003Csup\u003E4\u003C/sup\u003E, Earth is roughly (160,000)\u003Csup\u003E1/4\u003C/sup\u003E = 20 times cooler than the Sun. This is in the ball park. If you do all of the algebra correctly and take albedo into account properly, you end up with a temperature that\u0027s a bit low, leaving room for various atmospheric effects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, spectrum of radiation we receive from the Sun and spectrum Earth radiates back into space have almost no overlap. See the graphic I posted on the last page. So we could envision, in our toy model, a shell around the Earth that is perfectly transparent to Sun\u0027s radiation, and completely opaque to Earth\u0027s. Since energy flux in has to be equal to energy flux out, the total IR radiation outside from this shell has to be equal to the Sun\u0027s total radiation going in. So this shell will now have the 1/20th of the Sun\u0027s surface temperature. However, it radiates out and in. So Earth now receives twice as much radiation and has to radiate twice as much. To double the radiation output, Earth\u0027s tmperature has to increase by a factor of 2\u003Csup\u003E1//4\u003C/sup\u003E, or by roughly 18.9%. Taking Sun\u0027s effecive photosphere temperature, that would make for over 50\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C increase. That\u0027s a lot. And this is basis for a lot of fearmongering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings are quite a bit more complicated, however, because we don\u0027t just have one layer of dense, IR opaque material. We have an atmosphere. First, note that adding another IR opaque shell makes absolutely no difference. The outer shell must still radiate the same amount, and the inner shell(s) end up in thermal equilibrium with an outer one. So the temperature of each shell is 1/20th of Sun, and Earth is still the same 18.9% hotter. What\u0027s interesting here is that we can have as many shells as we like, spaced any way we like, and onlly the shell closest to the Earth is going to matter. So radiation and re-radiation in upper atmopshere is pretty much irrelevant. We also know that this 18.9% jump isn\u0027t just going to happen right next to the surface. It can\u0027t, because we have air currents carry heat between layers of atmosphere as well, so things are going to get more interesting. But lets look at something else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, lets suppose that shells are not 100% opaque. Lets compare two simple models. In one we have just one shell that\u0027s 75% opaque, in another we have two shells at 50% each. Note that the total is still 75%. For a single shell, denote Earth\u0027s radiation as x and shell\u0027s radiation as y. We know that .25x \u002B y = Sun\u0027s total. And Earth is going to recieve the total \u002B y = x. So now Earth has to radiate 8/5 the energy of the original model, and that means temperature is increased by a factor (8/5)\u003Csup\u003E1/4\u003C/sup\u003E or about 12.5%. For the two spheres, .25x \u002B .5y \u002B z = total is going out, total \u002B y \u002B .5z = x is what Earth receives, and x/2 \u002B y = 2z is what outer shell receives. So we get x = (3/2) of total, which gives us temperature increase of 10.7%. So multiple layers of partially opaque shells are much better than a single shell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is one more thing I pointed out. Upper stratosphere has an inverted temperature distribution. Lets see if we can model some of that. The reason for that inverted layer is the UV radiation absorbed by upper stratosphere, which doesn\u0027t reach lower stratosphere. Since we are playing with toy models, lets say that 1/2 of the Sun\u0027s total output, which I\u0027ll now abbreviate as t, is going to be in UV that is absorbed by the outer shell. Again, that outer shell is opaque in IR. So Earth recieves x = t/2 \u002B y, while the outer shell still has to radiate the total t = y to the space. So Earth ends up being only (3/2)\u003Csup\u003E1/4\u003C/sup\u003E or 10.7% warmer in this model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, if we allow the UV-absorbing portion of the atmosphere to radiate that heat in IR, Earth ends up being somewhat cooler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe overall system is far more complciated, of course. In these toy models I completely neglect the air currents carrying heat between the layers. And because there are changes in pressure, atmosphere can actually function as a heat pump. This is most severe in troposphere, and ends up being a dominant effect on the temperature down here. This is why I started out my previous post by pointing out that IR absorption beyond troposphere makes very little difference.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-22T05:23:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom a long-term perspective, the Earth doesn\u0027t have too much to worry about. If we continue consuming fossil fuels at the current rate until our oil wells start running dry, the CO2 buildup will reach a point in which a runaway greenhouse effect will be achieved, causing the polar ice caps to melt. The increase in temperature will eventually cover much of the earth in thick clouds of water vapor which will deflect sunlight coming in. This cloud cover will remain for quite some time as the heat already trapped within will slowly seep out, but eventually (perhaps hundreds of thousands of years later), the clouds will thin out as the Earth cools again. It may go into an ice age, and if it does, it will eventually thaw and become warm again. If there is still too much CO2, it will overheat again, and go through another cycle. This process prevents the Earth from heating too far. There would be many extinctions from this, but the Earth would remain covered in life, and new evolutionary paths would open up. Humans would most likely survive but may go extinct.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Maxwell Comp","CreatedById":85545,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-22T06:47:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs there any form of climate modeling software that is (somewhat) easy to use and \u0022all batteries included\u0022?
