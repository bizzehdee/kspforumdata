One cycle with the gyros on could increase a swing by upwards of 5-6cm, but when you turn off the gyros and move them around, it basically loses this ability and only increases swing momentum by 1cm per cycle, if that.

If there is a change in angular momentum (amount or direction, doesn\u0027t matter), that means there has to be a corresponding torque. \u003Cp\u003EIf the gyros are off, they have no angular momentum and so a change in the gyro-axis doesn\u0027t mean a change in angular momentom (at least not in the same way as before). So there is no corresponding torque (or at least a very different tourqe).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn oscillating torque on the machine can produce a swing motion, as long as the machine is connected through wires with the ceiling.
