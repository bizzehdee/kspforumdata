If you keep making the reactor larger, the surface area of the plasma container grows slower than the inner core.

My guess is that light from the reaction and neutrons, as you keep making the engine bigger and bigger and more powerful, would grow proportional to engine power output. Since engine power output grows faster than the surface area of the inner part of the engine, eventually there would be too much neutron impingement and light for the materials to handle and the superconducting magnets would probably quench and the whole thing fails. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you\u0027d want to do \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneutronic_fusion\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eaneutronic fusion\u003C/a\u003E to minimize the neutrons, since light is much easier to shield against than neutrons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at the readily available fuels, you\u0027d use either hydrogen/boron or hydrogen/lithium. The lithium one is almost double the power output so it would be preferred if you had mastered the technology to make these things. Variations in the design would run \u0022fuel rich\u0022 where unreacted hydrogen gets heated up and is allowed to escape the engine with the hot stuff, this would give you more thrust at the expense of ISP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Does anyone know a way to rough out what the power/mass limitations would ultimately be? Even to get a guess? Figuring out the ISP is easier, you just take the velocity of the fusion products and divide by 10. It\u0027s about 7% C with Hydrogen-Lithium, so about 2 million. So running at maximum ISP, if your spacecraft were 50% fuel, you\u0027d have a dV of 13594 kps. The limiting factor is acceleration - this kind of performance doesn\u0027t help if you have to spend years to burn all your fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get sci-fi levels of thrust, you need megawatts of fusion power per kilogram of engine. \u0022Sci-fi\u0022 means around 1 G.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I think it might be possible, actually. Plasma acts to protect the engine material from the core producing all that energy, so you don\u0027t actually touch it, and you might be able to tweak your reaction to produce less neutrons. You might also have gaps in the engine bell to reduce surface area exposed to light and neutrons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome rough figuring : assuming the engine is 20% of the mass of your spacecraft, you need 500 megawatts/kilogram of engine expressed in the plasma stream escaping your engine. This sounds a bit much, at 0.1 G it would be 50 megawatts, etc. The best engines on earth can do around 10 kilowatts/kilogram, but jet engines have to touch the fuel mixture they are burning and they have to mechanically spin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The limiting factor isn\u0027t magnet mass, because the engine is very large compared to the surface area of the fusion core. It isn\u0027t heat radiator mass, because you would use negligibly light droplet radiators. You might even be able to use a series of \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v3/n6/abs/nphys595.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eplasma mirrors\u003C/a\u003E to reduce the amount of energy impinging on your solid, physical mirrors that you have to replace if they are damaged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s see. Maybe the way to get a rough estimate is to say : ok, 1/3 of the mass of the engine is the part that deals with the heat. How much heat can you shed and/or resist per kilogram? If 1% of the engine\u0027s power output reaches the engine components themselves, then to hit 50 megawatts/kilogram you need to shed 1500 kilowatts/kilogram. That may not be possible. You might be able to do 15. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the futuristic engine of the future, when it\u0027s blasting out a star-bright plasma exhaust, accelerates the spacecraft at 1 centimeter/second. You gain 864 m/s a day and need 43 years to burn all your fuel, assuming your spacecraft is 50% fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-11T14:06:36Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2015 02:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SomeGuy12\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-11T14:32:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SomeGuy12\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SomeGuy12\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo, apparently, trialpha has a method to confine the plasma where they accelerate particle beams of more plasma that are then bent inwards by massive magnets to surround the hot core where the fusion reaction takes place.

Nothing of what you said has any relevance to the discussion. The type of fusion I am describing, you extract electricity directly from the moving charged particles produced by the nuclear reaction. No conversions. Antimatter produces very difficult to deal with products, trashing performance because the products are not electrically charged, so you need a gigantic, massively heavy engine to get any thrust at all. Antimatter may end up being exclusively for interstellar travel, where you need the additional dV and can afford to wait for years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for it being a long way off - no ..... I\u0027m talking about what engineering can do, not what will be plausibly done in the foreseeable future. Fusion is basically just as long a way off as nuclear thermal. I mean, we could build and fly nuclear thermal rockets probably 2 years from now if there was a pressing need, but they have never been flown and there is no plans to do so in even 50 years.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-11T14:50:21Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2015 02:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SomeGuy12\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
