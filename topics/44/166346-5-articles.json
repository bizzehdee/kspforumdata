The overwhelming majority of potential cancer treatments (and all the expensive IP behind them) wash out along the way. Pharma\u00A0companies know this,\u00A0as you might expect. The amount of work needed to de-risk a new drug compound to the point where a pharma company is going to look seriously at it\u00A0is non-trivial. Then, assuming that they are interested and take a license to any patents protecting your compound, the chances of you actually seeing any significant returns from that license are slim.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot a great way to run a Mars colony.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-01T21:03:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223184439\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022159887\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221506882354\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u00227272\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nibb31\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Nibb31 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are aware that government colonization rarely ends well for the governments.

By contrast, asteroids full of rare earth metals are like treasure chests littered across the abyss, if certain ideas are to be believed. I presume it\u0027s cheaper to do refinement on-site in the beginning, then carry only the refined products home (I guess somebody would pay well for the slag, ice and gravel too, but maybe not in the long term). Another benefit, you don\u0027t have to drag the goods out of a gravity well before taking them home to Earth. On the other hand, you\u0027d have to leave a lot of \u003Cem\u003Ereally \u003C/em\u003Eexpensive mining/refining equipment tethered to the mined-out asteroid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*As for what counts as suitable, I think convenience of travel and presence of useful metals would be the biggest prequalifiers.

Finding a suitable asteroid would be a time-consuming matter, but developing the required technology for remote prospecting sounds like pocket change compared to \u0022sustainable colony on Mars\u0022 amounts of money. Also, the prospector probes could presumably be launched on existing or near-future ships. Perhaps somebody will get on with that task within a few years?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
