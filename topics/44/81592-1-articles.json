I know hard starts and combustion instability are two major problems, but what are the other most common rocket failure modes, and what kinds of steps do today\u0027s rocket designers use to prevent them from occurring? In particular, what causes rockets to have a drastically higher failure rate than, say commercial aircraft? I\u0027m assuming it\u0027s the high energy requirement for achieving orbit vs just flying and the fact that most rockets have a production rate similar to test aircraft, but I\u0027m not sure. Is there any way to further reduce the failure rate of orbital rockets to bring it closer to that of most standard aircraft?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-13T09:43:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERockets release insane ammounts of energy.

This means that, even if the rocket never fails, mathematically the rating can only go so high over so many flights.

That\u0027s right! Combustion instabilities. (Catastrophic turbopump failures are another result, but it\u0027s the uncontrolled combustion that does the greatest and fastest damage.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would encourage you to look at an AIAA \u003Ca href=\u0022http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/3.26741?journalCode=jsr\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Epaper \u003C/a\u003Ewritten by a colleague of mine on launch vehicle failures.

As long as there have been rocket engines, engineers have been trying to control the intricate instabilities of the combustion process and its sensitivities. Even today, though, when something goes wrong after ignition anywhere in the fuel train, the typical response is to shut down the effected systems BEFORE an instability occurs. Sometimes this means you continue on other engines, sometimes it means the RSO hits the big red button and you\u0027re out the better part of a billion dollars. This is all to say that, looking at a history of launch failures, many cases in which rockets deliberately shut down were the result of efforts to avoid instabilities, trading them for a more controlled (and de-escalatable) failure mode instead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
