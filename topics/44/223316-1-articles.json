the space race was actively doubted by the military, who were not once asking for proper reinvestment.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Korolyov\u0027s participation to the lunar program was forced, distracting him from his dream of life, the expedition to the Mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOriginally, in 1920s-early 1930s, Korolyov and Glushko were just two of several tens of groups, developing rockets of more-or-less same level, never exceeding several hundreds of kgf thrust (~Aggregat-1\u0026amp;2).\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey were arrested due to the struggle between the teams in the institute, and the opponents in the known collective denunciation were pointing at the fact, that the only results of their eight-year activities were a 200-kg winged missile with 30-kg payload, and a small glider with a small rocket drive, so the funds had been spent on nothing.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt was also\u00A0playing a role, that (unlike for other development teams) their patron was marshal Tukhachevskiy, a big fun of then-hi-tech in army, so they were funded and raised as his protegee.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt the same time, this means that they were in low orbit at then-scandalous scam of the \u0022dynamo-reactive guns of Kurchevskiy\u0022, when Tukhachevskiy was actively promoting recoilless guns and cannons everywhere, including tanks and heavy artillery, as a cheap replacemenr for the normal cannons.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOf course, this strange idea failed, after having eaten a lot of budget money and delaying the upgrade of artillery.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, when the scam was stopped, all Tukhachevskiy\u0027s protegee were hit by recoil. Especially the most known ones. Especially spending\u00A0 money without results. Especially conflicting with the solid-fuel department, who were providing actual results. (Though, the solid-fuel tops were executed a little earlier, due to the struggle between the teams and the parties.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn 1940s Glushko had developed a 1.5-tf rocket engine for a glider, which became 1.1-tf after making it human-rated by another engineer.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI.e. corresponding to Aggregat 3\u0026amp;5, when Walter Thiel\u0027s Aggregat-4 engine was already 25..28 tf.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should not think that on the German\u00A0 side the things were going much wiser.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe whole\u00A0 Aggregat series (which fruited into V-2) was starting from the idea of a long-range 14\u0022 artillery shell with a rocket engine, which would throw it farther than powder.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOriginally the Aggregat-1 was to be stabilized by rotation, without gyroscopes or so, but on realizing that the rotation will prevent the fuel sucking, they decided to rotate the warhead, leaving the booster motionless.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter making the rotating warhead mockup and exploding the first and the only A-1 on start, they screwed the rotating warhead, and put the amateur \u0022gyroscope\u0022 in the middle, launching the two and the only Aggregat-2 just once.\u003Cbr\u003E\nRealizing that the shell is failed, they began Aggregat-3 (\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; the in-war imprisoned Glushko is nearly here) shaped as a an aircraft bomb with an alcohol\u00A0 booster inside. As they were trying A-3 and A-5 launches from He-111, we can presume that the idea of the shell turned into idea of rocket-propelled long-range bomb.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn failing the vertical launches of A-3, they turned to big rockets like A-4 (as big as a railroad carriage can contain, the fin span is 3.2 m), which were succesfully eating the German money on the sick (20% sorted out on the plant, 40% of launched had exploded), useless (1-2 human casualties per A-4) rocket program. That\u0027s because they hadn\u0027t imprisoned von Braun in time, lol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVon Braun himself is a strange, murky persone, closely associated with another one, even murkier one, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Kammler\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHans Kammler\u003C/a\u003E, who was the head of secret weapon development and KZ camps development, but mistically lacks any attention.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Aggregat series was developed not by von Braun alone, but by the whole department of arms, where von Braun was not the boss.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe key components like the engine (by Walter Thiel), the C\u0026amp;C, the aerodynamics were provided by other people.\u003Cbr\u003E\nVon Braun\u0027s role looks more like a curator, than like a real engineering developer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis kinda developed A9/A10 project looks like a scam. While he was doing aerodynamic experiments with the models. the A10 engine was a pure fantasy, changed from six A-4 28-tf engines around the single nozzle to a 200-tf alcohol engine (the practicallyreached top limit of the alcohol engines is RD-103, 45-tf), so we can assume that beyond a couple of failed launches of winged A-4b, there was no serious development behind A9/A10.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe A11 and A12 stages for his space rocket \u0022were using\u0022 the same never-developed super-engine, so they are just a pure scam, sold to Americans to prevent the\u00A0von Braun\u0027s extradition to the British, who were glad to ask him about the London bombing.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll components of Saturn/Apollo were developed by the American companies, so the von Braun\u0027s role looks totally PR, and this in turn returns us from the romantic dreams to the real roots of the American lunar program, which are concentrated as Project Horizon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile in the far, snowed Russia.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter making the R-7, an ICBM useless as ICBM, Korolyov was putting all efforts on killing the hypergolic rocketry, which efforts had fruited into separation of the Yangel and Makeev rocket bureaus, and raising the Chelomei\u0027s bureau in ballistic missiles, and thus into dismissing the Korolyov\u0027s bureau from the military development and losing him leading position in space launches, he started developing N-1 (another cryogenic non-ICBM ICBM, without any possibility of further development) and the Martian ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe whole department in\u00A0 bureau was developing the TMK (Heavy Martian Ship) under the Tikhonravov\u0027s leadership.\u003Cbr\u003E\n(Btw, Tikhonravov came into rocketry before Korolyov, he had developed the very first working semi-liquid engine in 1920s).\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs ~5 t of canned supplies was looking too heavy for the crew of 3, they were developing a whole on-board space farm, with kitchengardens and animals.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA ten of agricultural plants would be farmed under the solar light, rabbits and some others would be herded to provide meat, chlorella vats would refresh ing the air, etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut as Mars is 1.5 times farther from Sun than the Earth, the sunlight is weak. So, they added a huge parabolic reflector to insolate the garden.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut on the Martian orbit the ship will be rotating every hour, so the garden would be shaded. So, they made the mega-mirror truss mechanically rotating.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut the motor needs energy. So, they added 15 t of fuel to rotate the mega-mirror truss.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother part of command was developing 100-t Martian rovers with 6-m wheels, and other things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus, the Korolyov\u0027s team was wisely spending the budget funds on the highly realistic designs, and competing with Yangel and Chelomei were doing all daily dirty work of ballistic and cruise missile development.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMeanwhile almost all rocket engines were being provided by the Kosberg and Isayev bureaus, but for some reason the heavy RD-253 was possessed by Glushko.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKhrushchev had formulated the lunar objective very clearly and simply: \u0022We\u0027ll not give away the Moon to the Americans\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis can be treated as a PR flag planting, but all further development show that the most sober and insightful Soviet leader was meaning the practical aspect, to prevent the monopolization of the Moon by the opponent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus, once Proton and E-8 crafts had provided the ability to destroy any American lunar base before it could become operational (see the underdeveloped Death Star destruction in SW), the lunar program was immediately stopped, and the Korolyov\u0027s fantasy space program as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, the \u0022Space Race\u0022 was existing only in the heads of PR journalists, and another moon would not affect it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-01-30T06:43:06Z\u0022 title=\u002201/30/2024 06:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jan 30\u0022\u003EJanuary 30\u003C/time\u003E by kerbiloid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
