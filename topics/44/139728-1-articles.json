It seems to me that Venus is not your normal terrestrial planet, but actually a cross between something Earth-like and a gas dwarf. Venus wasn\u0027t able to become a gas dwarf because of its distance from the Sun and small size.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, I dunno. \u00A0I think it more likely that Venus was a fairly nice place until it suddenly had a planet-wide rash of volcanism, some of which might well be continuing today (possible hot lava flows detected last year). \u00A0But that all begs the question: \u00A0where does Venusian volcanism come from? \u00A0It doesn\u0027t seem to work like it does here, where it\u0027s mostly tied to plate tectonics. \u00A0Also, Venus doesn\u0027t seem to have much of a magnetic field so the workings of its core have to be rather different from Earth\u0027s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, ProtoJeb21 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, the design of our Inner Solar System seems a bit common in our stellar neighborhood. The Gliese 581 system has a Mercury analogue (Planet e), two Venus analogues (Planets b and c), an Earth analogue (Planet g/Zarmina), and a Mars analogue (Planet d).
