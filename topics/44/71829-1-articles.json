Quantum Mechanics just doesn\u0027t work that way. There are a whole bunch of conserved quantities which have to keep going. You can have a neutrino encounter a W\u003Csup\u003E-\u003C/sup\u003E boson and continue on as an electron. Or a photon splitting off into a positron and an electron.

What happens when an atom absorbs a photon? My understanding was that the photon disappears and the atom is placed into some kind of excited state. It\u0027s either spinning faster (if it absorbs a microwave photon), vibrating faster (infra-red photon), etc. etc. Energy is conserved, other quantum numbers are conserved but the photon has gone. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVarious processes can happen to that excited atom and some of them involve emitting another photon but the original photon has gone. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m approaching this as a chemist rather than a physicist so it\u0027s quite possible that I\u0027m missing something.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-13T01:26:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou do understand the concept of indistinguishable particles, don\u0027t you? As soon as you explain to me how you want to tell the difference between not being able to detect a particle because it stopped existing and between being unable to detect it because it tunneled out of the ion trap, we can continue discussing this particular line of reasoning.\u003Cp\u003EAnd again, there is no such thing as two protons colliding and you being able to say that they were disintegrated. A collision between two protons can happen \u003Cem\u003Ewithout a single valence quark being struck\u003C/em\u003E. With exactly the same shower produced. More importantly, that\u0027s always part of the process. Heck, the very distinction between valence and non-valence quarks gets really hazy at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is precisely because composition of the proton doesn\u0027t matter. A proton is 99% just vacuum fluctuations. What\u0027s important about the proton is that it has a \u002B1 baryon number, \u002B1 electric charge, spin 1/2, and whatever energy and momentum it happened to carry.

He\u0027s in grad school specializing in quarks and the force holding them together. He said his professors now consider the whole concept of \u0022particle\u0022 to be obsolete and merely an illusion. They don\u0027t even think in quarks. They see the universe as probability fields, each representing a single property, bound by forces represented by other probability fields.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis changed because those particles aren\u0027t nearly as permanent as we thought. It isn\u0027t just electrons that move around, what you and I were taught were individual properties of a particle can move around independently too! So the photon that left Andromeda isn\u0027t necessarily the same one that hit my retina. At times, due to vacuum fluctuations, there wasn\u0027t a photon at all. Those properties represented by the photon mixed with something the vacuum did to form an entirely different \u0022particle\u0022 for a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027ve even \u0022split\u0022 an electron in a lab!
