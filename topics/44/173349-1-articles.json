by J.F. Woodward for more than two decades. It consists of a piezo stack that produces mass fluctuations, which in turn can lead to net time-averaged thrusts. So far, thrust predictions had to use an efficiency factor to explain some two orders of magnitude discrepancy between model and observations. Here, a detailed 1D analytical model is presented that takes piezo material parameters and geometry dimensions into account leading to correct thrust predictions in line with experimental measurements. Scaling laws can now be derived to improve thrust range and efficiency. An important difference in this study is that only the mechanical power developed by the piezo stack is considered to be responsible for the mass fluctuations, whereas prior works focused on the electrical energy into the system. This may explain why some previous designs did not work as expected. The good match between this new mathematical formulation and experiments should boost confidence in the Mach effect thruster concept to stimulate further developments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBTW, I appear to have misread or misremembered the thrust levels tha thave been replicated; it\u0027s 2 microNewton not 2 mN.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Steel","CreatedById":49317,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-01T16:19:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223341559\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022173349\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221522592900\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022174016\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zeiss Ikon\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Zeiss Ikon said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat quote may need to be retracted soon.\u00A0 Humanity apparently \u003Cem\u003Ealready has\u003C/em\u003E a reactionless thruster that has been shown to work, has a theoretical basis that holds up to peer review, and appears to be scalable to a level that would, at the minimum, support generation type colony ships traveling at above .1 c and probes traveling at .4 c.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022has been shown to work\u0022 is a strong statement.

The problem is that stress-energy tensor is the gauge charge of the local symmetries\u00A0of space-time, which means there is an associated conserved flow. To put plainly, you can\u0027t just increase energy/mass of an object. That energy has to flow towards or away in a continuous manner, and the flow itself has inertia according to the energy/mass it carries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause people\u0027s brains tend to swell and overheat when trying to reason about mechanics of quantum fields, there is a fantastic simplification here. The conserved current acts just like any other current. Even a liquid flow. So lets forget all about relativity and quantum mechanics. Try to build a classical propulsion system where you change the mass of the oscillating object. Lets say, a bucket of water. We\u0027ll pump water in, push the bucket away, pump water out, and pull the bucket back in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWait, that can\u0027t possibly work!\u00A0But why? Because the water flowing into/out of the bucket is the thing that carries mass. As it flows through whatever plumbing back towards you so that you can fill the bucket again, it cancels out all the thrust you may have generated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA relativistic \u0022thruster\u0022 on the same principle suffers from exactly the same problem. The energy that flows into the charged particle before you push it away has to flow out at the far end. Then that energy has to flow back to the front end, presumably, as electrical current. And that electrical current will have exactly the same momentum as what you got out of the push in the first place, because it\u0027s exactly the same amount of energy just sloshing about inside your \u0022thruster\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, just like in the classical sense, you can chose to abandon that water. If you can fill the bucket from a store, and simply expel the water in the back before pulling bucket in, you will get net thrust. But it will be exactly the same net thrust as if you just expelled the water out the back. If you don\u0027t reclaim energy in the relativistic version, with charges, the energy is expelled in the only way massless energy can exist, as photons. So you ended up building a photon drive. Best case scenario, 300MW per 1N of thrust, but odds are, it will actually be extremely inefficient, and you\u0027ll get a lot less thrust than that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-02T04:28:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt really doesnt matter, when the thrust is P/30MW instead of a P/300MW it roughly means that the drive is ten times less useless than a photon drive.

So in principle, a linear gyro does not violate conservation laws, and in vicinity of a massive body, a linear gyro is just as good as reactionless drive. Not to mention that linear gyro allows for generation of artificial gravity on a ship, which is all kinds of nifty. Unfortunately, conditions under which you have excess momentum in the system not associated with movement of center of mass are scarce, and building a device that can function as a linear gyro is definitely an unsolved problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2)\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6ssbauer_effect\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EM\u00F6ssbauer Effect\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0allows for recoil-free transfer of momentum in a periodic lattice.
