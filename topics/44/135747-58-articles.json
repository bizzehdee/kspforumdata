In engineering, you design something to meet a set of requirements. You make trade-offs on some points because other points are more important. Yet the requirements for the Falcon 9 as a low-cost mass-produced launcher and as a robust reusable launcher are contradictory. The Falcon 9 was designed from scratch and optimized to be cheap and mass-produced. It has relatively cheap and light tanks and the factory is geared to mass-produce up to 400 engines per year, which is nearly one new Falcon 9 rocket every week.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, they are bolting additional stuff onto a cheap disposable rocket to make it reusable, which it wasn\u0027t optimized for from the start. The result is the bolt-on legs, the high CG, stretched tanks, and additional hardware added at the top of the stage that makes it even more top heavy. The other result is manufacturing overcapacity that is going to idle and lose money if they start massively reusing core stages. The Falcon 9 is a very clever design as cheap launch vehicle, and it has done a lot to lower the cost of access to orbit, but I\u0027m not sure that it\u0027s the most robust design to base a reusable rocket on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you were designing a reusable booster from scratch, you would integrate all of this stuff into a design that is optimized for different trade-offs than a disposable booster. You could afford to make it sturdier and more expensive, because you would only build them in small numbers. You could afford more expensive tooling for a conical shape because the trade-off in cost would be worth it. You wouldn\u0027t need to constrain the width to road tunnels for to lower mass-transportation costs, because transport from the factory to the launch site would be exceptional. It would be designed from the start with landing in mind, with a wide footprint and low CG, instead of bolting legs onto tall thin tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, this is a bit like turning a bicycle into a motorbike.

Yes, it\u0027s hard, but I think they might be making it harder than it needs to be.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like to look at it this way: perhaps they\u0027re bolting things to a bicycle in order to learn how to build a motorbike from scratch? The reuse technologies SpaceX is shooting for did not exist prior. So they built a cheap mass launch vehicle that makes them money. With that money, they can then develop these technologies. But what to test them on? ...Hey, why not that cheap mass launch vehicle they already have!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the technologies are fully developed and proven, they can then build a new launcher that\u0027s designed from the ground up to make use of them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T13:29:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nibb31\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nibb31\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI agree, but this is where SpaceX\u0027s approach reaches its limits. In engineering, you design something to meet a set of requirements. You make trade-offs on some points because other points are more important. Yet the requirements for the Falcon 9 as a low-cost mass-produced launcher and as a robust reusable launcher are contradictory. The Falcon 9 was designed from scratch and optimized to be cheap and mass-produced. It has relatively cheap and light tanks and the factory is geared to mass-produce up to 400 engines per year, which is nearly one new Falcon 9 rocket every week.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey are cheap because is a private company which really cares about how to optimize cost.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a goverment company is like: ok, I will use the best of the best and make 100 test on each part from my area so if something happens they dont point to me.. The money comes from above.. so there is not problem.. This same thing is applied to the politicians, there are only in danger if they force to someone to work with less budget than the average. So every body just spent a lot to avoid responsabilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI remember you that the structural safety margins in falcon 9 are 40% above flight loads, higher than the 25% margins of other rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo when you said cheap tanks or cheap things.. it has nothing to do with the actual quality of the components. It has to do with good production procedures.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
