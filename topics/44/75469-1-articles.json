I can ask around to see if there have been any serious breakthroughs with HTSCs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in either case, SCs would make for very poor shielding. The problem is that they only shield up to a critical field strength. There are some cryogenic SCs that can hold a strong mag field at 2K or so, and that\u0027s what they use in accelerators, but HTSCs are crap at it without exception. A high energy charged particle will exceede critical fields locally, force a transition to normal state, and just keep going. SC will probably provide better shielding than same material in normal, non-superconducting state, but not by enough. Your best bet in shielding from charged particles is still Compton Scattering, and that just scales with density. So grab a chunk of led, or depleted uranium if you can afford it, and build your shielding out of that. (Now that \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E my area.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
