Remember the pilot is worth more then the plane, something the ****\u0027s didn\u0027t realize. in WW2 the US would only allow the pilots so many missions, when they were done they would train the next generation. Better pilots = more kills and less loss. the **** didn\u0027t do that. They lost the good pilots in combat. but up until the 1943 they had better planes, but more losses.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T06:39:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei dont think gatling guns work the way you think they do. the feed system is mechanically linked to the gun barrel assembly, so its synced up to the gun rotation. they fire as soon as a round passes the firing position, the barrel lined up with the aircraft centerline (the gun is offset for this, and to make room for the nose landing gear). the firing rate actually ramps up till the gun reaches its maximum rpm, and down again as it slows. its one of my major pet peeves that every movie and video game gets this wrong (they dont \u0027charge up\u0027, that would lead to jamming). there are fire rate settings, but i think sop is to just used the lowest setting, which is still pretty damn insane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou want weird, look at russian gatling guns. they are gas powered so they have much more aggressive spin up rates than the a-10\u0027s hydraulic system, and they can operate to 10k rounds a minute. what makes em really wierd is they require pyrotechnic cocking charges to initiate the spin (which limits the weapon to a set number of firings). i think they may also require breaks to stop the gun\u0027s rotation, less they eat all the ammo/melt and explode.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-14T06:42:08Z\u0022 title=\u002201/14/2014 06:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Nuke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"toric5","CreatedById":58046,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T15:22:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Enot to mention that the earlier planes they were mooted on had problems with the guns recoil slowing their speed to below stalling.
