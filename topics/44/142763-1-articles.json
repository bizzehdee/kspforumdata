And because a lot of churches have us as the only people made by god, this can cause problems. So my qustions is...will churches collapse? Or what can potentially break up...features like world panic or something like that. I heard before some time Christian Church say it is possible to have life on other planets. But still I think this can collapse many churches and religions.\u00A0What u think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nToonu\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Ups, I\u0027m sorry, I found this is in wrong forum section.
