You can have an entangled state of three photons of which exactly one is left-handed photon, and other two are right-handed, with no way of knowing which is which. In that case, measuring a right-handed photon collapses the other two into a conventional entangled pair of one left and one right, while if you measured first one to be left-handed, you immediately know that both of the others are right-handed, and it\u0027s no longer an entangled state.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn fact, this is part of what quantum computing relies on. All of the qubits of a general purpose quantum computer are in a complex entangled state with each other until you read off the answers. Even the simple QCs we\u0027re using now, like the quantum annealing computers are technically in entangled states. These states don\u0027t cover the full spectrum of entanglements possible with thousands of qubits, but they are still a subset.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thing you can do is \u0022amplify\u0022 entangled states. Calling it \u0022amplification\u0022 is a bit forced, but that\u0027s primarily to distinguish from copying, which would violate the no-cloning theorem. So if I give you a photon in some superposition of left and right polarizations, it\u0027s not possible to create a second photon in exactly the same state that is NOT entangled to the first. That would be cloning and would allow us to find out the exact state of the photon through multiple measurements of the copies. But an entangled copy is fine. You can place a second photon in the state that has exactly the same weight of left and right polarizations but is also entangled to the first. So if first is measured to be left-handed, so will the second and vice versa. This is used in all sorts of schemes in both facilitating and breaking quantum encryption. For example, it\u0027s not possible to listen in on a quantum channel without it getting detected, but it is theoretically possible to create amplified entangled \u0022copies\u0022 of the quantum key which can be analyzed after the original message is received to produce a copy of the key which lets you intercept communication. In practice, this can get very complicated, so I don\u0027t think anyone has been able to demonstrate a physical setup that can break quantum encryption.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s mathematical formalism for all of this. Essentially, any combination of pure states is treated as a coordinate in the state vector describing the system. Various operations and measurements are described with matrices. Operations with two photon entangled states are described with 4x4 matrices. For 3-photon entangled states you need 8x8 matrices. So things get very complicated very fast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
