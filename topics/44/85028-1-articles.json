The general effect would be just as magnemoe described, essentially the object would behave on earth as it would in a weaker gravitational field.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if this effect is extended to more than just one object, there might be some paradigm-shifting cosmological problems that physicists would need to work out, but I\u0027m certainly not knowledgeable enough to speculate on what those might be.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-20T11:10:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESuch an object basically exists - a helium balloon!
