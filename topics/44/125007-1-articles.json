Ozone, O\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003E, is an allotropic form of oxygen. It\u0027s a colorless gas, or if it\u0027s cold enough, a beautiful deep blue liquid or solid. It\u0027s manufactured commercially (it\u0027s useful in water purification and the like) by the Welsbach process which involves an electrical glow discharge in a stream of oxygen. What makes it attractive as a propellant is that (1) its liquid density is considerably higher than that of liquid oxygen, and (2) when a mole of it decomposes to oxygen during combustion it gives off 34 kilocalories of energy, which will boost your performance correspondingly. Sanger was interested in it in the 30\u0027s, and the interest has endured to the present. In the face of considerable disillusionment. \u003Cp\u003EFor it has its drawbacks. The least of these is that it\u0027s at least as toxic as fluorine. (People who speak of the invigorating odor of ozone have never met a real concentration of it!) Much more important is the fact that it\u0027s unstable \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC murderously so. At the slightest provocation and sometimes for no apparent reason, it may revert explosively to oxygen. And this reversion is catalyzed by water, chlorine, metal oxides, alkalis \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACand by, apparently, certain substances which have not been identified. Compared to ozone, hydrogen peroxide has the sensitivity of a heavyweight wrestler. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince pure ozone was so lethal, work was concentrated on solutions of ozone in oxygen, which could be expected to be less dangerous. The organizations most involved were the Forrestal Laboratories of Princeton University, the Armour Research Institute, and the Air Reduction Co. Work started in the early 50\u0027s, and has continued, on and off, ever since.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe usual procedure was to run gaseous oxygen through a Welsbach ozonator, condense the ozone in the emergent stream into liquid oxygen until you got the concentration you wanted, and then use this mixture as the oxidizer in your motor run. During 1954-57, the Forrestal fired concentrations of ozone as high as 25 percent, using ethanol as the fuel. And they had troubles. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe boiling point of oxygen is 90 K. (In working with cryogenics, it\u0027s much simpler to think and talk in absolute of Kelvin degrees than in Celsius.) That of ozone is 161 K. On shutdown, the inside of the oxidizer lines would be wet with the ozone-oxygen mixture, which would immediately start to evaporate. The oxygen, with the lower boiling point, would naturally come off first, and the solution would become more concentrated in ozone. And when that concentration approaches 30 percent, at any temperature below 93 K, a strange thing happens. The mixture separates into two liquid phases, one containing 30 percent ozone, and the other containing 75 percent. And as more oxygen boils off, the 30-percent phase decreases, and the 75-percent phase increases, until you have only one solution again \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC all 75 percent ozone. And this mixture is really sensitive! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, after a series of post-shutdown explosions which were a bit hard on the plumbing and worse on the nerves of the engineers, some rather rigorous purging procedures were adopted. Immediately after shutdown, the oxidizer lines were flushed with liquid oxygen, or with gaseous oxygen or nitrogen, to get rid of the residual ozone before it could cause trouble. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was some sort of a solution to the problem but not a very satisfactory one. Twenty-five percent ozone in oxygen is not so superior to oxygen as to make its attractions overwhelmingly more important than the difficulty of handling it.
