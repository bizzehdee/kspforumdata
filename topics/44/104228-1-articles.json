After some searching I came across [this blog entry](http://mathscinotes.com/2010/10/solar-eclipse-math/) with a derivation for calculating the shadow size of the Moon on Earth. I went in and plugged the numbers to see if I was doing it right and ended up with the proper result (273.14km). So I then went and tried it for Mun and Kerbin. Interestingly, it gave me a negative number:\n\nrSun = 261600000m\n\nrMun = 200000m\n\ndSun = 13599840256m\n\ndMun = 12000000m\n\nrKerbin = 600000m\n\nangle = 0.019238 = arcsin((rSun - rMun)/(dSun - dMun))\n\ndUmbra = 10396700 = rMun/sin(angle)\n\n-38607.73 = 2\\*(dUmbra - (dMun - rKerbin))\\*tan(angle)\n\nSo! My first question - is this equation even valid for Mun/Kerbin? If so, what does the negative result mean?"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T04:10:05Z","Content":"The calculation appears to be correct.
