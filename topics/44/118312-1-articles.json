Specifically, nitrogen dioxide is the gas that gives it that red/brown color. Which means that they are still running tests with highly toxic fuels, like hydrazine variations and nitrogen tetroxide. And that means enormous environmental damage to the area. Smokestack or not, nitrogen dioxide gets captured by humidity in the air and percipetates very easily as acid rain/fog. Same goes for a number of other chemicals I\u0027d expect in that plume, and they have even worse effects on environment and health.\n\nKhimki is so appropriately named. \\*sigh\\*"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T19:26:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s \u0022fox tail\u0022 in the plume.
