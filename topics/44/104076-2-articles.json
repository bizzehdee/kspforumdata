The beauty of commercial introduction to spaceflight is that it is now forcing the industry to revaluate the status quo. Efficiency, Reusability, low cost, all will bring down the overall cost of spaceflight and maybe one day in my life time space travel will be as regular or almost as regular as commercial airlines. You can say a lot about Elon Musk but what he has done forced the industry make changes. If they land on that barge tomorrow and he lowers his cost even more there is no telling what will be next for the rest of the space industry. If he can further undercut all they other major launch vehicles either they will need to change or SpaceX will be the only way to get to and from space.

There are several unproven technologies here though, so there is a certain risk with the project: inflatable ballutes, detachable engines, and the entire BE engine.\n\nThe in-flight recovery by helicopter or airplane has been tried and tested since the 50\u0027s. I\u0027m not sure it has been done with something as heavy as two engines though. I wonder if they will require the USAF to be on stand-by for the recovery ops or if they will charter their own chopper.\n\nI like the 6-booster arrangement, which probably allows 0, 2 and 4 booster arrangements too, and maybe growth for an 8 booster configuration.

The rocket has partial reusability while still posting the same stats as it would if flying expendable. SpaceX, on the other hand, needs to reserve up to ~30% of their expendable payload to LEO in order to return the first stage alone ([source](http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2013/10/musk-plans-reusability-falcon-9-rocket/)).\n\nThe Vulcan rocket here however does not have to reserve any fuel for a boostback and landing maneuver, and does not require as much extra dry mass in support equipment. No duplicated avionics, no grid fins, no oversized RCS thrusters and tanks, no landing legs, no reinforced hull structure, and so on. It can fly like a fully expendable rocket does... and then ejects its engine block, which makes up about 65% of the cost of the entire rocket (as stated by ULA\u0027s infographic).\n\nSpaceX recovers more - the entire first stage is valued by Elon Musk as about 75% of the total cost of the rocket - but has a lower payload fraction. Because of the Vulcan\u0027s higher payload fraction, the cost per kg to orbit on the Vulcan is lowered in comparison to the Falcon 9 when both fly in reusable configuration. As such, the extra money ULA spends on rebuilding the stage is amortized by the extra money earned from the high payload fraction, and not passed on to the customer. It\u0027s a pretty interesting model, and should be quite competitive."},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T07:39:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Why are we already replacing Atlas V and Delta IV?

Grid fins or RCS won\u0027t make much of a difference there. It\u0027ll have a small RCS system for re-entry orientation (unless they use the spent stage to properly orient the engine block pre-ejection), but other than that it\u0027ll be a ballistic object going down its flight path passively.\n\nThe mid-air retrieval isn\u0027t as difficult as you think; the concept\u0027s quite old, in fact. They don\u0027t even have to snag the engine, they just have to snag the parachute. Which is a really big, easy to hit target. The thing that makes it difficult is that the engine block will be so heavy that it\u0027ll require a fairly special helicopter to be able to carry it. And helicopter range is limited, so it will absolutely need a support ship on site that the helicopter launches from and lands back on with its captured payload. Maintaining that support ship and helicopter is going to cost non-trivial money. Still, ULA thinks they can pull it off and be cost competitive, and they\u0027re usually very conservative, so... \\*shrug\\*\n\nLargely I\u0027m disappointed that the whole shebang is still so many years away. They\u0027ll only start on reusability after the Vulcan successfully flies. So that means it\u0027ll be the 2020\u0027s before we get to see any actual, hot helicopter-on-engine action, and get more details on how ULA is planning to conquer the challenges involved. Until then, we can but speculate."}]}
