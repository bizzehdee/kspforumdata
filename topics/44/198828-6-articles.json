Note that Mini Mag was specifically designed to get around the big geopolitical problem with Orion, namely the fact that it\u0027s powered by a large stack of fission bombs.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMini Mag is relatively low thrust - according to the reference designs on Project Rho, a fully loaded Mini Mag ship has a thrust to weight ratio of about 0.1 (assuming my scribbled calculations are correct).\u00A0 So, no good for lift-off from Earth, doubtful use as a second stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould possibly be used as a lunar \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. The most useful reference design in that context was for a ship with a burnout (dry mass of ship plus payload) mass of about 250,000 kg.\u00A0 Engine thrust is stated to be 642 kN, giving us a thrust to weight ratio (in lunar gravity) of about 1.5.\u00A0 Given that the delta-V obtainable from a fully fueled vessel is 100 km/s, I think (although I haven\u0027t done the calculations to check) that a partially fueled Mini Mag, should be capable of landing on the Moon and taking off again, but a fully fueled one would be too heavy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\u0022So we are talking a mini-mag spaceship with detachable reusuable, refillable boosters as shuttles for aired worlds.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003ENot quite sure what you mean here. If you\u0027re talking about using detachable, reusable boosters to turn a Mini Mag ship into a shuttle, that doesn\u0027t seem plausible. Or rather, it might work but you\u0027d need do use a SpaceX style mission profile with lots of tanker flights an on-orbit propellant transfer.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBear in mind that the dry mass of that reference design is 150,000 kg or 150 tonnes. That\u0027s the bare metal ship with no propellant or payload.\u00A0 That sounds plausible with a Superheavy class booster. The reference design wet mass though, is about 732 tonnes. Good luck getting that to orbit in one go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there\u0027s the problem of getting the Mini Mag back down again (if you\u0027re planning to use it as a shuttle). It strikes me as being a complete nightmare to design a thermal protection system for, and also as being approximately as aerodynamic as a brick (and that\u0027s probably being unfair to bricks). Therefore, getting a Mini Mag back from orbit is probably going to rely heavily on propulsive descent.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich means you need to stick those detachable boosters back on and then refill them too.
