This doesn\u0027t mean however that they will stay the same distance from a magnetic source. It means that it will try to move (and rotate) towards a position where the magnetic field is the same as when it was cooled. When you cool it close to a magnet, or even better an array of magnets, the trapped flux has quite a complicated shape. So the superconductor will only really find a similar pattern in the same place as it was when it was cooled. The earth\u0027s magnetic field however is quite uniform, so there would be little or no force pushing it back to where it was cooled down. There would be a small force trying to rotate the superconductor to the same orientation though, so you could use it instead of reaction wheels. A big enough slab of superconductor would be rather heavy, so it\u0027s easier to use little electromagnets instead, these are known as magnetorquers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a decent looking wikipedia article on magnetotorques, which might be interesting to you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also a wikipedia article on flux pinning, but it is very wrong.
