The arctic is rather important for the climate of Canada and North Eastern US, such events can cause freekish winter weather, a few years of unprecedented warm (insect problems, crop failures, depleted reservoirs) followed by years of unprecedented snowfall and icestorms (power failures, road closures, airport closures). This year for example there are the Albertan Ft. McMurry fires which have suffered from unusually warm dry air this year. Fires this early that far north are very unusual, of course year in and year out unusual things will happen, but this happened during a year of extremely unusual high temperatures in that region of North America, with extremely high temperatures averaging across the world. This may, in the grand scheme of things, be how prairies begin, the removal of trees by fire, the culturing of soils by fire resistent plants. So if there is an increased fire tendency across the NW N. America, the consequence is the alteration of the ecology.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-17T03:26:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, but proponents of melting polar ice have cited increased arable-ness of the far north to be a great thing, and also the opening of northern passage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s why increasing sea level would be the only thing to break their mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-17T11:58:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222586055\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022139886\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221463455615\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002298447\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022YNM\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, YNM said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, but proponents of melting polar ice have cited increased arable-ness of the far north to be a great thing, and also the opening of northern passage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s why increasing sea level would be the only thing to break their mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou mean northwest passage for a couple\u00A0of weeks\u00A0every other year.
