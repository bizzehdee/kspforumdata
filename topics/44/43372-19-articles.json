Humans are really good at making this possible. \u003Cp\u003EBut I was under the impression that mammalian fetuses had been observe to fail to develop in microgravity. I can\u0027t find that article again, though. What i can find is that various systems behave differently in microgravity, even at scales where gravity should be a trivial force. For instance, osteoblast formation is hindered in micogravity. The stem cells responsible act differently. I\u0027d imagine that would have severe consequences for fetal development, and who knows how many other systems act differently? On the other hand, cockroaches have bred successfully in space so maybe its less of a problem than I thought.
