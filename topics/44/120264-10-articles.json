When the suggestion is made that a powerful laser would burn through, you argue that we need to characterize the laser better vs the real life targeting laser. True enough. The same is true of the sand defense. You need to characterize it such that it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven with just the targeting laser, to be effective as a defense, the sand must equal the properties of the thickness of sandstorm that defeats the targeting laser. That\u0027s a given, right? If a low power laser penetrates XX meters into a roaring sandstorm (we\u0027d have to define the penetration as \u0022retains 30% of transmitted power\u0022 or something, obviously), then we need to shield a craft with XX meters of an identical mix of aerosols/gases (including density).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe should all agree that this is true, right, I\u0027ve just moved your sandstorm---and just the part the beam interacts with---to space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow all we need to do is find the density of that volume of sandstorm, then figure out how wide we can make a cloud of that depth/density along the side of the ship between us and the target. Is that 50kg? If not, then traveller sandcasters are toast for targeting lasers (much less HELs). If it is possible with just 50kg, then they might have some efficacy vs HELs, and the calculation becomes substantially more complex. If the needed mass is more than 50kg, but not ridiculously high, then they might be effective in RL (worth the mass), but the traveller canon is clearly nonsense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WedgeAntilles\u0022 data-cite=\u0022WedgeAntilles\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETater, you\u0027ve asked me the same question about twenty times now.\u003Cp\u003EWhat was that saying about doing the same thing over and over, and expecting a different result???

Plus I don\u0027t believe a ship-based laser battery could dramatically overheat a warship designed for space superiority/dominance: the volley of hyper-velocity tungsten annular blast warhead shells fired from the lased vessel\u0027s mass drivers would tear the lasing vessel in half well before the heat became an issue. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, in terms of hull integrity, those lasers could possibly burn their way through and do some damage in the meantime, but I suspect lasers that burn holes and lasers that just heat ships up to overload their cooling systems will likely be two different kinds of lasers: one fired from ships, the other fired from ground or large \u0022stationary\u0022 orbital installations. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I suspect lasers would be restricted to point defence and sensor blinding/EW duties, though I could see atypical wavelength lasers being used to irradiate crew members, or disable electronic systems like some experimental lasers do now. I might even go a step further and speculate that future armour systems will be what dictate which weapons systems end up being the best primary armament.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScoundrel, \u002B1 on the sandcaster comments. This ones about lasers, tough... I\u0027m hardly an expert in lasers either, but I think the basic physics of the thing are heavily tilted against kinetics here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s all a question of range, really... let\u0027s examine it a bit further, and let it be the last time I do this, at lest in this thread... let\u0027s suppose two otherwise identical hypothetical warships, one equipped with a 1MW 10km/s railgun (that\u0027s one 100kg round every second, and you will notice I am being generous with the muzzle velocity by about a factor of two or three), compared to a 1MW laser weapon, like the ones the US Navy wants on their next-gen ships (a bit of a power jump, but 100kW systems are already existing prototypes based on commercial-grade lasers): \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, the size of each weapon system. This are all wild guesses here, of course, but the railgun prototype of the US Navy is apparently already in the MW order of magnitude, and it is going to be fitted on ships. On the other hand, ~10kW laser systems are going to be installed on Humvees (actually, the new one whose name I can\u0027t remember right now, but similar size), including power systems. The 100kW laser system on the Ponce is also more like a CIWS in size than the artillery-looking railgun that doesn\u0027t include reloading or power systems on the pic, and the laser trailer from Boeing is also supposedly in this power class, and includes cooling and power systems. Let\u0027s say the 1MW hypothetical laser is slightly larger than the 1MW hypothetical railgun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, as you note, we must compare efficiency, because laser are notoriously inefficient. They don\u0027t really \u003Cem\u003Ehave to\u003C/em\u003E, since some diode solid-state lasers get upwards of 80% efficiency in the lab, but all real-life examples have been nowhere near that, and I don\u0027t really know about the fiber lasers that this weapon systems use, so thus I happily concede that a laser will be an extremely inefficient thing, depositing more ehat in the warship than in the target. \u003Cem\u003EHowever\u003C/em\u003E. Railguns are also notoriously inefficient, creating \u003Cem\u003Ea lot\u003C/em\u003E of heat through friction with the rails, as well as the high-power pulsed nature of their operation that makes for inefficient transmission of power. All in all, still the railgun is probably getting the upper hand here, so I will allow that the laserstar has to have much larger radiators, probably up to twice the size of the other ship (let\u0027s remember the power to use the weapon is coming form somewhere, and that somewhere will be lucky to be 50% efficient, so the railgun battleship also needs some serious radiators), with the corresponding increase in mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, that works out to a mass advantage to the railgun battleship. Right? Well, let\u0027s spend it in ablative armor, and we have that laserstar by the balls, don\u0027t we? We will just close to where we can hit it, and fill it with holes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut. \u0022Close to where we can hit it\u0022 isn\u0027t going to be as easy. Remember, we said the ships are otherwise identical, so they can accelerate at the same rate, or a very similar one, so none has a decisive movement advantage. The only advantage is that one is armored, and the other one isn\u0027t, or not as much, or that one has a slight wattage advantage on weapons output, it\u0027s quite irrelevant. So space being what it is, they will only do battle if they want to, and they will close at the rate any one of them chooses. We might get into complicated space tactics here, but let us fix a closing rate \u0022on the order of km/s\u0022. Could be snail pace (favours the \u0022sharpshooter\u0022), could be fast interplanetary trajectory (favours the \u0022tank\u0022). It doesn\u0027t really matter much. Because see, \u003Cem\u003Ethe laserstar has an effective range a few orders of magnitude higher than the railgun battleship\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s really easy to work out. If the railgun is moving at 10km/s towards a \u003Cem\u003E1km\u003C/em\u003E cross-section target that can accelerate at a measly \u003Cem\u003E1m/s, for ten seconds\u003C/em\u003E, it will miss, 100% of the time, at ~1,100kms (actually, a bit less). So we can call that it\u0027s effective range. The 1MW laser system, with a reasonable visible-light wavelenght and a 1m primary mirror in its \u003Cem\u003Eturrets\u003C/em\u003E, can have an effective range way higher than that (I don\u0027t want to go there, but the railguns is going to have to be spine-mounted on account of mass and momentum transfer, while the spine-mounted laser can easy have several turrets)... \u003Cem\u003Eand you won\u0027t be able to fire at it anyway\u003C/em\u003E. Why? Well, the spot size at 1000kms for such a laser is on the order of 1m^2 (I did the math for reasons, a while ago it\u0027s short of right considering I did it for another kind of lasers). That\u0027s 1MW of power in a spot of one square meter, which turns out to be 0.1kw/cm^2... not really too .... right? That may be able to ablate, but it\u0027ll sure take its sweet time if it tries to go through armor. What\u0027s there to worry about! We have armor!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, turn that spot into a sensor, and the thing will be blinded faster than you can say \u0022photodiode\u0022. Even synthetic aperture radars will be happily burned away at that range, even if they can\u0027t be seriously fouled up by ECM, at such power levels. And you know, at 10,000kms, that is the same megawatt, but over ten square meters. Definitely not going to touch your fuel tanks or radiators, but you are already blind across the electromagnetic spectrum, so who cares? The ship is effectively dead in the water if it can\u0027t target it\u0027s fancy railgun or know which direction to run. And even at 100,000kms the 100m beam spot will be already something than optical sensors built to spot warships against space just won\u0027t be able to handle. Once the target is blind, the laserstar can then slowly match velocities and close in, staying outside the range of the railgun (and as off-axis form the railgun as it can, in case the enemy has some unopened sensor port in reserve), while it slowly melts away the radiator system to neuter the blind, armored hulk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you are ready to board the overheating hull to rescue the enemy survivors, we expect our laserstar captain to jokingly congratulate the enemy on his choice of weaponry. The losing side would then proceed to develop their own flavour of laserstars, but with fancy 10m optics which turns them \u003Cem\u003Ejust as effective at ten times the range\u003C/em\u003E, meaning the next battle will be decided at 100,000kms. And thus a new arms race ensues, over who can blind who the farthest, until the lasers start to miss due to light-lag at much more advanced tech levels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.

In whipple armor, you recognize that your armor is going to turn to plasma at the point of contact with the projectile... but the projectile is going to turn into plasma too, so you try to get that point to be far enough from the next layer. This way, the energy is spread over a wider surface, and invested in vaporizing a larger area of that second layer, and so on and so forth.

This ones about lasers, tough... I\u0027m hardly an expert in lasers either, but I think the basic physics of the thing are heavily tilted against kinetics here.\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s all a question of range, really... let\u0027s examine it a bit further, and let it be the last time I do this, at lest in this thread... let\u0027s suppose two otherwise identical hypothetical warships, one equipped with a 1MW 10km/s railgun (that\u0027s one 100kg round every second, and you will notice I am being generous with the muzzle velocity by about a factor of two or three), compared to a 1MW laser weapon, like the ones the US Navy wants on their next-gen ships (a bit of a power jump, but 100kW systems are already existing prototypes based on commercial-grade lasers): \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, the size of each weapon system. This are all wild guesses here, of course, but the railgun prototype of the US Navy is apparently already in the MW order of magnitude, and it is going to be fitted on ships. On the other hand, ~10kW laser systems are going to be installed on Humvees (actually, the new one whose name I can\u0027t remember right now, but similar size), including power systems. The 100kW laser system on the Ponce is also more like a CIWS in size than the artillery-looking railgun that doesn\u0027t include reloading or power systems on the pic, and the laser trailer from Boeing is also supposedly in this power class, and includes cooling and power systems. Let\u0027s say the 1MW hypothetical laser is slightly larger than the 1MW hypothetical railgun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, as you note, we must compare efficiency, because laser are notoriously inefficient. They don\u0027t really \u003Cem\u003Ehave to\u003C/em\u003E, since some diode solid-state lasers get upwards of 80% efficiency in the lab, but all real-life examples have been nowhere near that, and I don\u0027t really know about the fiber lasers that this weapon systems use, so thus I happily concede that a laser will be an extremely inefficient thing, depositing more ehat in the warship than in the target. \u003Cem\u003EHowever\u003C/em\u003E. Railguns are also notoriously inefficient, creating \u003Cem\u003Ea lot\u003C/em\u003E of heat through friction with the rails, as well as the high-power pulsed nature of their operation that makes for inefficient transmission of power. All in all, still the railgun is probably getting the upper hand here, so I will allow that the laserstar has to have much larger radiators, probably up to twice the size of the other ship (let\u0027s remember the power to use the weapon is coming form somewhere, and that somewhere will be lucky to be 50% efficient, so the railgun battleship also needs some serious radiators), with the corresponding increase in mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, that works out to a mass advantage to the railgun battleship. Right? Well, let\u0027s spend it in ablative armor, and we have that laserstar by the balls, don\u0027t we? We will just close to where we can hit it, and fill it with holes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut. \u0022Close to where we can hit it\u0022 isn\u0027t going to be as easy. Remember, we said the ships are otherwise identical, so they can accelerate at the same rate, or a very similar one, so none has a decisive movement advantage. The only advantage is that one is armored, and the other one isn\u0027t, or not as much, or that one has a slight wattage advantage on weapons output, it\u0027s quite irrelevant. So space being what it is, they will only do battle if they want to, and they will close at the rate any one of them chooses. We might get into complicated space tactics here, but let us fix a closing rate \u0022on the order of km/s\u0022. Could be snail pace (favours the \u0022sharpshooter\u0022), could be fast interplanetary trajectory (favours the \u0022tank\u0022). It doesn\u0027t really matter much. Because see, \u003Cem\u003Ethe laserstar has an effective range a few orders of magnitude higher than the railgun battleship\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s really easy to work out. If the railgun is moving at 10km/s towards a \u003Cem\u003E1km\u003C/em\u003E cross-section target that can accelerate at a measly \u003Cem\u003E1m/s, for ten seconds\u003C/em\u003E, it will miss, 100% of the time, at ~1,100kms (actually, a bit less). So we can call that it\u0027s effective range. The 1MW laser system, with a reasonable visible-light wavelenght and a 1m primary mirror in its \u003Cem\u003Eturrets\u003C/em\u003E, can have an effective range way higher than that (I don\u0027t want to go there, but the railguns is going to have to be spine-mounted on account of mass and momentum transfer, while the spine-mounted laser can easy have several turrets)... \u003Cem\u003Eand you won\u0027t be able to fire at it anyway\u003C/em\u003E. Why? Well, the spot size at 1000kms for such a laser is on the order of 1m^2 (I did the math for reasons, a while ago it\u0027s short of right considering I did it for another kind of lasers). That\u0027s 1MW of power in a spot of one square meter, which turns out to be 0.1kw/cm^2... not really too hot, right? That may be able to ablate, but it\u0027ll sure take its sweet time if it tries to go through armor. What\u0027s there to worry about! We have armor! We can just hold on until we get close enough for our railgun to connect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, turn that spot into a sensor, and the thing will be blinded faster than you can say \u0022photodiode\u0022. Even synthetic aperture radars will be happily burned away at that range, even if they can\u0027t be seriously fouled up by ECM, at such power levels. And you know, at 10,000kms, that is the same megawatt, but over ten square meters. Definitely not going to touch your fuel tanks or radiators, but you are already blind across the electromagnetic spectrum, so who cares? The ship is effectively dead in the water if it can\u0027t target it\u0027s fancy railgun or know which direction to run. And even at 100,000kms the 100m beam spot will be already something than optical sensors built to spot warships against space just won\u0027t be able to handle. Once the target is blind, the laserstar can then slowly match velocities and close in, staying outside the range of the railgun (and as off-axis form the railgun as it can, in case the enemy has some unopened sensor port in reserve), while it slowly melts away the radiator system to neuter the blind, armored hulk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you are ready to board the overheating hull to rescue the enemy survivors, we expect our laserstar captain to jokingly congratulate the enemy on his choice of weaponry. The losing side would then proceed to develop their own flavour of laserstars, but with fancy 10m optics which turns them \u003Cem\u003Ejust as effective at ten times the range\u003C/em\u003E, meaning the next battle will be decided at 100,000kms. And thus a new arms race ensues, over who can blind who the farthest, until the lasers start to miss due to light-lag at much more advanced tech levels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
