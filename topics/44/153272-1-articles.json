About time they finally found an atmosphere! According to the Hubble observations, there seems to be quite a lot of Water Vapor an Methane. Very weird. I believe it could either be caused by an oceanic planet with life beginning to evaporate, or a one Earth-like world becoming a volcanic Venus. With that amount of Methane, though, things get complicated. Could GJ 1132b have a light purple haze? That would be really cool - an Eve analogue just 39 light years away!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-10T21:57:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMe again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThough i am fascinated by everything spacey i allow myself the hint that this is based on a pre-print server paper (arxiv) and not (yet) suitable for a citation.

If the planet has 1.6 Earth masses it would hold onto water vapor even at 600K, especially if it had a lot of water to begin with.
