The only exceptions would be if you used liquified fuels. low orbit decay rates are pretty predictable. The other thing is if you can collaborate with another struggling space program, you can join payloads in space."},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T16:29:30Z","Content":"I expected this to happen, but not anything like this soon-they hadn\u0027t even formally selected a rocket.
