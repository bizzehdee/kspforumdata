Imagine just a quantum well with an electron inside. The walls of the well are infinitly high, so the electron is completely traped inside. From the electrons wave-function, we know its probability of presence in the well. Let\u0027s say there is a 10% chance of finding it near the right wall, a 10% chance for it to be near the left wall, and a 80% chance to be in the middle of the well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe now measure the exact position of the electron, and we find it to be near the left wall.

Did it start traveling from the right side? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe answer to this question would be: It didn\u0027t \u0022travel\u0022 from somewhere to this positon in the quantum well, it just had a specific probability to be at this position. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is the exact same thing for tunneling. The particle wasn\u0027t \u0022inside\u0022 of the barrier, and then travelled \u0022outside\u0022 of the barrier. The particle didn\u0027t had a defined position like \u0022inside\u0022 or \u0022outside\u0022 at the first place. And if you can\u0027t say that if was \u0022inside\u0022, then it doesn\u0027t make sense to talk about a speed in which it travelled \u0022outside\u0022. It just happend to have the probability to be all over the place, and even if the probability to be \u0022inside\u0022 is very high, it can still be found \u0022outside\u0022, without the need to actually travel outside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you draw a lottery ticket, you wouldn\u0027t talk about the \u0022speed\u0022 or \u0022time\u0022 it takes for your ticket to change from a loosing number to a winning number.

You know how the stationary wave-function looks with some electrons tunneling and some electrons being reflected. But now let\u0027s take a single electron shot there - now we have the time-dependent wave-function (electron density wave) that has the mean position and mean impulse properties of the electron (and the stationary wave-function of the stream can be described as superposition of large number of such functions with different time variable values). What happens to this wave when it reaches the barrier?

Imagine just a quantum well with an electron inside. The walls of the well are infinitly high, so the electron is completely traped inside. From the electrons wave-function, we know its probability of presence in the well. Let\u0027s say there is a 10% chance of finding it near the right wall, a 10% chance for it to be near the left wall, and a 80% chance to be in the middle of the well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe now measure the exact position of the electron, and we find it to be near the left wall. What would you think is the right answer to the question \u0022with which velocity travelled it to this position\u0022?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you think about this question in this context, you will see that it is nonsensicle: To talk about something like this velocity, we would have to define a prior position of the particle at a certain point in time.

Did it start traveling from the right side? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe answer to this question would be: It didn\u0027t \u0022travel\u0022 from somewhere to this positon in the quantum well, it just had a specific probability to be at this position. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is the exact same thing for tunneling.

It just happend to have the probability to be all over the place, and even if the probability to be \u0022inside\u0022 is very high, it can still be found \u0022outside\u0022, without the need to actually travel outside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you draw a lottery ticket, you wouldn\u0027t talk about the \u0022speed\u0022 or \u0022time\u0022 it takes for your ticket to change from a loosing number to a winning number. Thats because it didn\u0027t change from a loosing number to a winning number. The attribute of loosing and winning isn\u0027t defined for the ticket before the measurement (before the lottery show).

For example electron tunnelling is fundamental to electrical transport in metals, as it is also in an electron tunnelling microscope and photons can similarly do between fibre optic couplings. So although you are correct in measuring the position of a electron in a well that is very close it is either in one or the other and there is no transport, the electron must transition the well during transport in metals or an STM. An Scanning tunnelling microscope is probably the most prominent example of such transport actually taking place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason for asking is that there has been such examples suggesting FTL during tunnelling. ie \u003Ca href=\u0022http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10701-011-9539-2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10701-011-9539-2\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ibeinsane","CreatedById":106685,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-29T20:21:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alchemist\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alchemist\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAbout the tunneling there can be such way to estimate the velocity in the barrier:\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s take the experiment of a stream of electrons flying against a potential barrier with higher energy than the kinetic energy of the electrons.

If you visualize it different (like in the simulations above), there is no question about any FTL-jumps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe paper that you linked is (in my opinion) just a media-effective misinterpretation of data. In every experiment (conducted by the author of the paper), particles that travelled the same path but without barrier (=without tunneling) arrived faster at the detector. The dectetor for the tunneling-path reacted slower in ALL cases. He has to use a very crazy backwards logic, to interpret that as FTL signals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe logic of the Author Nimtz is as follows: If you compare the location of the wave maximum directly infront of the barrier with the maximum of the wave a little time later after the barrier, and divide this distance by the correlating time, you get a velocity higher than c.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is the same logic, that says that a laser-dot on the surface on the moon can travel FTL, if the laser (here on earth) is waved back and forth. It is true that the dot is FTL, but the dot isn\u0027t an actual thing that contains energy or information. The dot is just an illusion, created by photons hitting the surface with the right timing. The objects containing energy and information are the photons from the laser, and they never travel FTL. In a similar way, a black dot on a computer monitor could appear to travel FTL if the pixels are flashing with the right timing. But there isn\u0027t any actual FTL travel involved, the black dot isn\u0027t a \u0022thing\u0022, it is just an illusion created by the flashing pixels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack to Nimtz Paper: If the barrier has the behaviour to reflect more of the late part than the early part of a wave-packet, than it obviously could appear as if the wave-maximum travelled FTL.

There appears to be FTL action, but once you consider actual communication, you see that you cannot actually send a message across. In a nutshell, if you have long distance, then the barrier serves as a very fine energy filter. Anything with energy above the barrier will travel at sub-light speeds. Things that are well bellow barrier energy will decay exponentially at a rate which makes the exit amplitude zero. And only part of your signal that\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Ejuuust\u003C/em\u003E right will make it through. And once you\u0027ve filtered just one energy, you run into the Heisenberg uncertainty problem. Effectively, the part that made it across \u0022faster than light\u0022 was the part that was that delocolized to begin with.

This is a probability function, not a particle wave and therefore would indicate finite ability to measure a particle within a forbidden zone within the barrier. The obvious issue with this is that the real and imaginary parts of the function separate in the barrier which would indicate something strange is happening, without actually solving the equation in this area it looks from the visual representation that the real and imaginary phase are (almost) out of phase, making the probability of finding a particle within the barrier very small? You would ask what mechanism allows for the particle to be measured at either side of the barrier with equal kinetic energy but not the same probability of being able to measure it within the barrier if the Ek (and velocity) is constant throughout?

It does show the particle wave. The particle wave can be negative (as seen in the video), and has real and imaginary parts. To get the probability function from this, you have to take the complex particle wave and multiply it by its own complex conjugate. (Or you take the magnitude of the complex wave, and square it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe resulting probability function can\u0027t be negative, and has only real parts.

The idea and experiments exist for decades now. Everybody agrees about the data: It is not shown that information or energy can be transported faster than light through tunneling. And if that sort of FTL travel would be possible, there would be no experimental problems in providing that data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESaying that there is FTL travel because some velocity is higher than FTL is meaningless.
