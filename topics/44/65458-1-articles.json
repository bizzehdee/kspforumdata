Later on, large particle beam stations might be built in a low-ish solar orbit, pushing against the magnetic sails used by such ships, reducing fuel requirements, or shortening the trips by accelerating them further than they otherwise would go. Those ships would be multiply redundant, and each carry a few 100 frozen colonists along with tens of thousands of frozen embryos. Such colony fleets would only be sent to planets known to have an atmospheric composition and temperature suitable for human life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing I wonder about: How do you keep a starship powered for the journey? You might have to keep it powered for over a century after all. I\u0027m thinking either some sort of fission reactor with a purification plant, or a fusion reactor.

At such tremendous speeds, the diffuse gas and dust of the interstellar medium becomes a hail of deadly projectiles.
