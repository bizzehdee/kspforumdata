A few months before Apollo 11, test data indicated that heating rates on the landing gear were much higher than anticipated. At approximately the same time, the LM flight crew expressed a desire to have the option of using either the probe mode or the pad mode for landing. The probe mode is the primary procedure for LM touchdown and consists of descent-engine shutdown initiation after probe contact with the lunar surface but before footpad contact. The pad mode is considered a backup landing mode in which engine thrust is terminated after footpad contact. Inclusion of the pad mode resulted in even higher predicted heating rates for the landing gear. Consequently, the Apollo 11 landing -gear thermal-insulation weight was increased to 31. 03 kilograms (68.4 pounds), as shown in table II.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/LM_Landing%20Gear1973010151.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/LM_Landing%20Gear1973010151.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linkxsc","CreatedById":67350,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-29T22:14:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI thought that the gold stuff was kapton insulation.
