Still the rocket equation is a cruel mistress. When you go for SSTO you prety much have to count the dry mass of the launcher agianst the potential payload. Lightening the tanks through better material science or improving the TWR of the engines shifts more of that weight to potential payload. Still no mater how light you manage to make the tanks and engiens they are going to be a non zero mass that your haveing to lug all the way to orbit. We can do better now than back in the 60s but its still more cost effective to strap an uperstage engien for the final push to orbit by a non trivial margin.
