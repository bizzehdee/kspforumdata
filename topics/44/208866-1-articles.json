Look at the evolution of each, and see what fits better. \u00A0 \u00A0Sticks started first because they were simpler. \u00A0 The yokes came along later as the planes got bigger, and \u00A0moving the control surfaces required more effort from the pilots, and the yokes made them easier to control. \u00A0Sticks stayed in smaller planes as they took up less room and seemed to allow for faster reactions. \u00A0When powered controls came along, the controls in newer generations of planes stayed the same, generally, as the older planes of the same types, as the pilots were used to those styles. \u00A0 And that continued on\u2026\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, that is making a lot of generalizations, and there\u2019s a whole lot of \u201CWell Actshullys\u201D in there, but I think you get the concept. \u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo consider the role your craft will have. \u00A0 Cargo hauler? \u00A0Then you probably don\u2019t need a stick/yoke at all. \u00A0 The vast majority of its movement will be computer controlled, with little input from a pilot. \u00A0 \u00A0A small auxiliary stick should suffice. \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nIs this a warship? \u00A0 Perhaps, but the notion of its range being measured in years says it\u2019s not a small fighter/interceptor, but a capital ship or auxiliary, maybe even a high speed high capacity bomber. \u00A0 So this ship wouldn\u2019t need a stick, and even a yoke on a capital ship wouldn\u2019t \u00A0make sense. \u00A0 Again most things would be computer controlled, and pilot inputs would most likely not be in the form of an analog stick, but a control panel. \u00A0 Again, a small auxiliary stick would suffice for slow speed finesse work. \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo for the specifications for this \u201Cmagical\u201D ship we have specified, it doesn\u2019t make sense to me to have a control input system any different than what you\u2019ve seen in Star Trek or The Expanse. \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs to the \u201Cmagical\u201D comment. \u00A0 You have described a ship that seems to be able to do anything, and do it well, without any drawbacks. \u00A0 \u00A0 I\u2019m ok with the range and acceleration, some sort of fusion torch drive, gotcha. \u00A0 Atmospheric operations, meh, I\u2019m more of the thought that a ship designed for mainly long term vacuum operations really shouldn\u2019t be coming into atmo, but that\u2019s a personal choice, so I\u2019ll roll with it.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the maneuvers like an airplane is where I draw the line. \u00A0 \u00A0You have a large ship that is capable of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E with a massive \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and for the sake of discussion basically an infinite fuel source. \u00A0 That alone is a helicopter capable of interplanetary travel. \u00A0 Why do we need to add wings?

Look at the evolution of each, and see what fits better. \u00A0 \u00A0Sticks started first because they were simpler. \u00A0 The yokes came along later as the planes got bigger, and \u00A0moving the control surfaces required more effort from the pilots, and the yokes made them easier to control. \u00A0Sticks stayed in smaller planes as they took up less room and seemed to allow for faster reactions. \u00A0When powered controls came along, the controls in newer generations of planes stayed the same, generally, as the older planes of the same types, as the pilots were used to those styles. \u00A0 And that continued on\u2026\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, that is making a lot of generalizations, and there\u2019s a whole lot of \u201CWell Actshullys\u201D in there, but I think you get the concept. \u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo consider the role your craft will have. \u00A0 Cargo hauler? \u00A0Then you probably don\u2019t need a stick/yoke at all. \u00A0 The vast majority of its movement will be computer controlled, with little input from a pilot. \u00A0 \u00A0A small auxiliary stick should suffice. \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nIs this a warship? \u00A0 Perhaps, but the notion of its range being measured in years says it\u2019s not a small fighter/interceptor, but a capital ship or auxiliary, maybe even a high speed high capacity bomber. \u00A0 So this ship wouldn\u2019t need a stick, and even a yoke on a capital ship wouldn\u2019t \u00A0make sense. \u00A0 Again most things would be computer controlled, and pilot inputs would most likely not be in the form of an analog stick, but a control panel. \u00A0 Again, a small auxiliary stick would suffice for slow speed finesse work. \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo for the specifications for this \u201Cmagical\u201D ship we have specified, it doesn\u2019t make sense to me to have a control input system any different than what you\u2019ve seen in Star Trek or The Expanse. \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs to the \u201Cmagical\u201D comment. \u00A0 You have described a ship that seems to be able to do anything, and do it well, without any drawbacks. \u00A0 \u00A0 I\u2019m ok with the range and acceleration, some sort of fusion torch drive, gotcha. \u00A0 Atmospheric operations, meh, I\u2019m more of the thought that a ship designed for mainly long term vacuum operations really shouldn\u2019t be coming into atmo, but that\u2019s a personal choice, so I\u2019ll roll with it.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the maneuvers like an airplane is where I draw the line. \u00A0 \u00A0You have a large ship that is capable of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E with a massive \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and for the sake of discussion basically an infinite fuel source. \u00A0 That alone is a helicopter capable of interplanetary travel. \u00A0 Why do we need to add wings?

For realistic travel over large distances, the human operator/pilot would be more like the captain of a ship.
