I can see it become white as the burn goes on... is that condensation solidifying ? I understand it is cooled by the LH2, and that the chamber temperature is very high... What are the results of this temperature difference ? Doesn\u0027t the LH2 become gaseous during the process ?"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T23:56:37Z","Content":"I would like to add this video.

Pretty much no materials can survive those temperatures for a 8minutes burn like this one. So what happens here (and happened in the space shuttle) is that you make small pipes inside the nozzle. The cold (very freaking cold) LH2 comes from the tank and passes through these pipes before going into the combustion chamber, and that cools off the engine. this is why liquid fuel engines are often very complex with a lot of piping and plumbing\n\nNow, that makes the outside of the nozzle crazy cold, and condensation forms on its surface, and then it solidifies into ice."},{"CreatedByName":"RandomRyan","CreatedById":142844,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T09:04:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yeah, I\u0027d also like to know why it turns white.\n\nMach Diamonds."},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T12:05:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Mach Diamonds.\n\nAre we talking about the exhaust being white or the nozzle being white here ? \n\n(Cause as far as i know shock diamonds in the exhaust won\u0027t make the nozzle white ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) )"},{"CreatedByName":"RandomRyan","CreatedById":142844,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T09:37:34Z","Content":"sorry i accidentally read why as what and not the nozzle\n\n(i thought he was talking about the thing down there)"},{"CreatedByName":"okan170","CreatedById":268,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T23:23:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yeah, amazing sounds coming from that beast!
