Sorry in advance, i need to stop doing this...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf something in here sparks your interest, let me know! (Also, feel free to put this in any mods you\u0027d be willing to make.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHiggs manipulation: Manipulates the Higgs field to cause something to fall \u003Cem\u003Ein the direction of where you want to go.\u003C/em\u003E Incredibly useful for slower-then-light travel and gravity manipulation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlcubierre drives: You probably already know... creates a bubble of space time around your ship while compressing space in front of your ship while bloating it behind your ship. It\u0027s a sneaky way of getting around that whole \u0022LITESPEED BARIYUR!111\u0022 thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhysical law manipulation field: One of the most interesting technologies ever conceived. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://phys.org/news202921592.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESince physical laws are not the same everywhere\u003C/a\u003E, it can probably be changed. multiple ways to use it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWay #1: create a bubble where the speed of light is greater then is commonly known, then move that bubble with you. alternative to the alcubierre drive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWay #2: create a flat circle (NOT 2-DIMENSIONAL, THAT WOULD BE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS) where gravity doesn\u0027t exist altogether. when matter goes in, it gets torn to bits i.e converted to energy. Instant matter-energy conversion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWay 3#: Go to space. Go out to a \u003Cstrong\u003Every\u003C/strong\u003E distant location. (Intergalactic). Put a PLMF around your ship when you turn around to go back to Earth. Make the lightspeed value 1 million times the normal speed of light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlowly decrease that value on the way back. You will always be going faster than the bubble\u0027s speed of light (since you\u0027d be trying to move at it while it\u0027s decreasing), and that would make you go backwards in time. When you arrive back at Earth, it will be in the past.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuantum entanglement communication: A way of instantly sending a message to anywhere in the universe. simply preserve some photons inside a ball that have been entangled to an identacle ball of photons. Find a way to manipulate the photons on one ball, and you have FTL communications!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETeleportation: Manipulate space and time to make two locations in space and time \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe same thing\u003C/strong\u003E so you can literally be in 2 places at once! You can then step off the other side if you wish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVacuum metastability bomb: Destroys an entire universe by making intense amounts of energy. Feared by all.

Which would collapse the quantum states of the entire universe (racing out at the speed of light from the point of occurence) into an altered state with this new more perfect quantum vacuum. The issue being is that any matter hit by this would be torn apart at the subatomic level. Most of the universe would probably remain in terms of mass distribution, but atomic distribution would be wildly altered. Supposedly this doomsday scenario was based off of something a real scientist thinks could happen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
