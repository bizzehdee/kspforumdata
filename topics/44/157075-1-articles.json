apparently combustion chamber pressure doubles when switching to close cycle. \u00A0 \u00A0I don\u0027t know enough about rocket engines, but i suspect power increases at least that much - sounds like a real kick in the pants...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-27T23:30:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do we know about SABRE / Skylon ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt doesn\u0027t exist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-27T23:36:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nits the heat, the precooler tricks the engine into thinking its operating in a cryogenic atmosphere, so it drastically raises the performance ceiling. the rest of the engine is some serious thermodynamic mastery. nothing is wasted, hence the bypass ramjets, which help to reduce intake drag. their performance likely goes up with speed but then again so does drag. none of this matters above mach 5 as thats where the intakes close and the engine goes into rocket mode. if you could improve performance of the engines to get it to mach 6 or 7 that means less time in rocket mode and less oxidizer to carry. a second gen design might use bypass scramjets or something instead, but again drag will also go up. i dont know what the max theoretical airspeed for an air breathing engine is, but theres probibly a long way to go still before a hard limit is reached. the doubling of chamber pressure is probibly due to more efficient burning of lh2/lox, since its not full of nitrogen to rob heat from the exhaust products.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-27T23:39:22Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2017 11:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Nuke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ImmaStegosaurus!","CreatedById":160589,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-28T01:11:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222970107\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022157075\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221488238216\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002270807\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, regex said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt doesn\u0027t exist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYet.
