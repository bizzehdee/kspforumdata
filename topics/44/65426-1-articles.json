Sure, if you build a craft with 2000km/s of dV you can get to Mars and back pretty quickly. But you will need a lot of fuel for that, and to push that fuel you need more rocket engines, which in turn eat more fuel. That\u0027s when you crash headlong into the Tyranny of the rocket equation. You\u0027ll probably end up with a completely impractical ship the size of the moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I have played.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI say its shocking because it proves that things aren\u0027t that far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd plus, there is no limiting factor, there are MULTIPLE limiting factors. Now get your facts straight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have Isp, mass ratio, and the fuel you\u0027re using (determines the actual SIZE of the ship).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, XTs are Shuttle external tanks, and I mean quite a few, at least five, powered by an engine with 1500 to 3000 Isp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETWR matters because in this scenario it is constant acceleration, with a TWR of 10/322. 0.3048 meters per second per second. Not fast, but like an Ion engine it builds up over time, so you get there quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KASASpace","CreatedById":71352,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-11T23:09:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022guto8797\u0022 data-cite=\u0022guto8797\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso we must think of something passenger wise. The reversing maneuver would be quite... harsh. Either engines on the fron (which would also increase Delta-V need), or turning the ship around, it would mean that the passengers would have to be strapped on to some kind of safety device (even more delta-v costs).
