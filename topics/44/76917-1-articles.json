It is correct, but it does not explain where the forces are acting, only what the effect of those forces are (conservation of momentum)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a force that accelerated that gas, there was an equal and opposite force on the rocket/spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you had an electromagnetic coil gun, the magnets would be pushing off of the projectile, and vice versa.

In the case of a liquid fuel engine, where the fuel ignites at the very narrow base of the nozzle/in a combustion chamber, the gas pushes off of itself (just a bunch of balls bumping into each other) The stuff going backwards initially leaves the rocket without directly exerting any force, while the stuff going forward hits the rocket nozzle/wall of the combustion chamber, and pushes the craft forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will conceed that I should have specified that the gase pushes against the walls of the combustion chamber in addition to the nozzle, and the combustion chamber can be quite large and distinct from the nozzle in a solif fuel rocket like so:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/SolidRocketMotor.svg/504px-SolidRocketMotor.svg.png\u0022 alt=\u0022504px-SolidRocketMotor.svg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere the expanding gas is produced far outside the nozzle, the force is not just applied to the nozzle, but also to the interior wall of the \u0022top\u0022 or \u0022front\u0022 of the rocket.
