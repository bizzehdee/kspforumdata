The Delta IV is a bit larger in size but has a bit more than half of the payload capacity of the projected payload tonnage of the Falcon Heavy. This may have been discussed before, I\u0027m not sure. My pondering is, why does the Falcon Heavy, despite it\u0027s size and similar staging, have more payload capacity than the Delta IV heavy? \n\nIs it because the Falcon Heavy uses RP-1/LOX as its fuel as compared to the LOX/LH fuel mixture of the Delta IV? If so then what is the purpose of using the LOX/LH fuel mixture in the Delta IV when you can seemingly get more payload capacity from using RP-1? \n\nI think this topic is pretty good for discussion, and I\u0027m curious as to why scientists would engineer a vehicle with such a fuel mixture when you can get more payload capacity from using RP-1. Maybe its just me ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) thanks in advance!"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T14:51:00Z","Content":"Part of it is that the payload comparison is quite misleading; it gives LEO numbers, while neither Delta IV heavy nor Falcon Heavy are primarily designed for LEO missions. Payload to GTO (where Falcon Heavy is likely to put most of it\u0027s payloads) gives the ratio as about 3:4, and payload to direct GSO (as with most Delta IVH missions) is roughly equal. The other part is that Delta IVH doesn\u0027t make terribly good use of it\u0027s LOX/LH2 booster stage; the engines were designed for simplicity and low cost rather than performance, and only use hydrolox because that\u0027s where most of the US rocket engine expertise was in the post-shuttle era."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T16:04:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Is it because the Falcon Heavy uses RP-1/LOX as its fuel as compared to the LOX/LH fuel mixture of the Delta IV? If so then what is the purpose of using the LOX/LH fuel mixture in the Delta IV when you can seemingly get more payload capacity from using RP-1?\n\nHow do you define \u0022get more from using RP-1\u0022? This isn\u0027t simply an issue of filling a different fluid into the tanks, you know. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nThe rocket equation doesn\u0027t care about \u0022amounts\u0022 of something. It cares only about mass fractions. Liquid hydrogen has an extremely low density. That means in order to get a given *mass* of fuel, you need a huge *volume* to hold it, and therefore huge tanks. That\u0027s why the Delta appears so large.\n\nThe Falcon Heavy uses a propellant that\u0027s much more dense. That means it needs less tank volume to hold a given mass of fuel. In fact, due to being of similar size to the Delta, it manages to hold significantly *more* fuel by mass. If you compared the weight of a fully fueled Delta IV Heavy and a fully fuelled Falcon Heavy, the latter is much more massive. Wikipedia says 733,000 kg (Delta) versus 1,462,836 kg (FH). The Falcon is literally twice as heavy.\n\nBecause it has so much more propellant mass, the Falcon Heavy can lift a greater payload into low Earth orbit.\n\nBut there\u0027s a reason the Delta IV uses liquid hydrogen: it\u0027s a much better fuel. LH2/LO2 combustion (also called hydrolox for a shorthand) is by far the best (sane) rocket fuel that exists in the world, by efficiency. The RS-68A engines on the Delta get an Isp of 365s (ASL) - 414s (vac)... and that\u0027s for a fairly cheap, low-effort engine. If you really put engineering effort to it, you get something like the Space Shuttle\u0027s engine, the RS-25: Isp 366s (ASL) - 453s (vac). Now compare the Falcon Heavy that must make do with kerosene-burning Merlin engines... no matter how well you build those, they just can\u0027t compare. The Merlin 1D manages an Isp of 282s (ASL) - 311s (vac).\n\nThis is also the reason why the Falcon Heavy\u0027s performance takes such a sharp nosedive as soon as you try to go beyond low Earth orbit. The extreme Isp advantage and low weight of the hydrogen-fueled DCSS (Delta Cryogenic Second Stage) just walks all over the heavy, kerosene-fueled Falcon upper stages in space. SpaceX took a Merlin and bolted a large vacuum bell onto it, calling it Merlin 1D Vacuum (\u0022MVac\u0022), but that still only improves the Isp to 340s... simply not competitive with dedicated hydrogen vacuum engines which can get as high as 465s.\n\nIn other words, if you really wanted to take full advantage of the Falcon Heavy\u0027s 50 ton to LEO capability, you\u0027d want it to lift a 50-ton hydrogen fueled spacecraft instead of trying to throw something smaller by itself."},{"CreatedByName":"Kartoffelkuchen","CreatedById":108501,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T16:34:41Z","Content":"Well..SpaceX will probably lower the performance data of their Falcon Heavy anyway, they did that with every of their rockets."},{"CreatedByName":"SciMan","CreatedById":12748,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T17:01:07Z","Content":"Agreed, the Falcon Heavy is great for lower-altitude uses, but starts running out of performance when trying to push \u0022inert\u0022 mass (satellites, not other rocket stages) to high orbits.\n\nA Kerolox rocket is great for getting out of the atmosphere, as it\u0027s quite a dense fuel which avoids aerodynamic drag losses.\n\nMeanwhile, Hydrolox is much better suited for upper stage use, because once you\u0027re out of the atmosphere, the only things that matter are thrust, mass, and specific impulse.\n\nExtrapolating from that ends up explaining why SRBs are usually only found on the lowest stages of a rocket, and why ion engines are used on deep space probes.\n\nHmm, wonder what would happen if SpaceX decided to switch to a Methalox upper stage of the same mass as the Kerolox upper stage currently on the F-H.\n\nMethalox has a lot better specific impulse compared to Kerolox, without the severe cryogenic problems (boil-off, etc) or very low density of Hydrolox.\n\nI\u0027d bet it would improve the payload capacity to GTO, not sure about LEO performance but it would probably not improve quite as much, instead just end up not needing as much propellant mass."},{"CreatedByName":"MrZayas1","CreatedById":95654,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T17:10:54Z","Content":"So, is there a real reason that SpaceX didn\u0027t change to use hydrolox in their upper stage to gain more DeltaV?

The internal bracing probably wouldn\u0027t change all that much, and the plumbing would be nearly identical.\n\nOf course I don\u0027t know what thrust scale that engine is intended to have, but if it\u0027s too big, surely the experience gained in making a big rocket engine scales down to making a smaller one, right?\n\nI know that problems happen when attempting to scale UP a rocket engine (combustion instabilities, POGO) but if they already took care of that on a large engine the smaller one should be easy, right?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-22T17:30:11Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2015 05:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SciMan**"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T17:24:40Z","Content":"Also simplicity.
