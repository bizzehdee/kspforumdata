F=ma. The newton is defined as the force that will give a mass of 1kg an acceleration of 1 m/s. A Joule is defined as the amount of work done when a force of 1 Newton acts for a distance of 1 metre.\n\nI work a lot with enthalpies. Enthalpy is given in J/kg. 1 J/kg means there is enough energy in that one kg to cause a force of 1 Newton to act for a distance of 1 metre. Everything works nicely.\n\nNow let\u0027s try in Imperial.\n\nForce is given in Pounds-force. One lbf is the force due to gravity on the earth\u0027s surface on a mass of 1 lb.\n\nWork done is given in any number of units, but most commonly foot-pounds, the work done when a force of 1lbf acts over a distance of 1 foot.\n\nNow let\u0027s go to my enthalpy problem. In Imperial, enthalpy is given in BTU/ton. One BTU is the amount of energy needed to heat 1lb of water by 1 Fahrenheit. One ton is 2000lb.

I honestly have no idea, and it would take me a good couple of minutes to work out.\n\nImperial systems are completely full of stupidities like this.

As a side note, I\u0027m an American and most of my fellow countrymen that I consider to be relatively good at math also agree that the metric system is excellent (admittedly a very subjective statement). \n\nHere is a quick list I put together just for this thread featuring the imperial units I\u0027ve grown accustomed to as an American:\n\nYards - used often to communicate the range to targets in marksmanship and hunting applications, and also the unit of measurement on a football (American football) field, which I\u0027d bet is a major contributor to many Americans\u0027 sense of distance, their spacial frame of reference for ranging things.\n\nMiles - much different than a kilometer, my father told me \u0022hey son, you see grandpa\u0027s shop up the road there?\u0022 \u0022yeah\u0022 \u0022that\u0027s 1 mile from us.\u0022 From then on I\u0027d look down that stretch of road, and think \u0022that\u0027s about a mile\u0022.\n\nMph or miles per hour - the speed limit signs everywhere. Put me in a moving vehicle, and by now I can make a great guess as to my speed in mph.\n\nFeet, and inches - we have these \u0022yard sticks\u0022 laying around in school, often made of wood. And then we have a lot of 12 inch rulers, usually wood or plastic. From there a sense of scale is developed using those units. Especially in American carpentry and home building, these units are used, and the tape measure is central.\n\nAcres - typical US unit for measuring real estate. I\u0027m actually buying a house right now that is on a half acre of land.\n\nAgain, I love the metric system, and wonder so much why it hasn\u0027t completely overtaken things. At the same time, I don\u0027t think Megan is wrong or any less intelligent for continuing to bake her cakes using units of measure like cups, tablespoons and ounces. It could be considered American culture rather than \u0022American stupidity\u0022."}]}
