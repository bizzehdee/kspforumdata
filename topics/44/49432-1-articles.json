Instead of the LM engine, they could have taken along a modified LM similar to the Soviet Lunniy Korabl with only the Apollo LM\u0027s ascent stage short-fueled and small landing struts, since Phobos\u0027 gravity is so small. A Mars aerocapture would have been used to put them into Mars orbit. The S-IVB stage would contain the propellant necessary to return to Earth. The journey there would\u0027ve been pretty cramped in the CM, but on the homewards trip, the spent stage would become a wet workshop.

If such a mission was planned, it sounds like it would use a fly by of Venus to alter trajectory for the return trip foregoing actual capture to Venus orbit. That means, you don\u0027t have to expend any fuel to return from Venus to Earth. Everything is done by Venus\u0027 gravity. Furthermore, you don\u0027t have to wait for a return window. Instead, you are flying a sub-optimal trajectory, but because you are fly-by boosted, you don\u0027t have to expend fuel on that either. Finally, the fact that Venus has a much shorter period than Earth, the entire mission would be under a year in duration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompare that to a Mars mission. The trip there is straight forward enough. It shouldn\u0027t take more fuel than a trip to Venus. Not by a significant margin, anyhow. And yes, you can aerobrake to capture. But then what? You are in parking orbit near Mars, and you have to get home. First, you have to wait for a window, and then you have to burn a lot of fuel to escape Mars and get to a transfer orbit. This is something Venus mission would not have to do, and it\u0027s something for which there isn\u0027t going to be enough fuel on anything S-V could lift. And even if you managed to somehow get enough fuel for that, maybe with an LEO rendezvous, you are now dealing with a 2\u002B year mission.

Then the astronauts and mission stack, which includes a wet workshop for habitation, are launched and docked to the propulsion stack. The launches use an upgraded Saturn V with solid boosters to increase the payload capability.

Since we\u0027re wanting to land rather than fly by, we don\u0027t need the precise timing of a free return transfer, so that\u0027s good, but also means we\u0027ll have to save fuel for a return transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is our problem, Either we do not vent the fuel, from the S-IVB on the way to mars, and thus the astronauts do not have a habitat for the outbound trip, or you do and have to jettison it and use the Apollo SM engine for the return burn. Unfortuinately you now don\u0027t have the Habitat for the return trip, and still don\u0027t have the delta-v (only 2,800m/s on the Apollo) to return to earth. Another problem is since you want to land, you\u0027ve got to bring a lander, now you can\u0027t bring the airlock and supplies that would have taken it\u0027s place. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the only way you could do it would be to skip the wet workshop plan, and simple use the S-IVB for outbound and return, (but my research is suggesting even the S-IVB didn\u0027t have the delta-v for that) but then you have to leave the astronauts in the crapmt Apollo for over a year. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do want to point out, I\u0027m not saying it couldn\u0027t be done with early 1970\u0027s tech, I\u0027m saying that it couldn\u0027t be done with a modification of the Apollo.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T16:21:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nibb31\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nibb31\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECurrent Mars probes use high altitude aerobraking without a heatshield, but they do multiple passes over several months.

One of the uses slated for the NERVA was was part of the Saturn-launcher-based RIFT programme - NERVA upper stages placed in LEO to act as tugboats for moving things to higher orbits, or used to lift 170-odd tonnes at a time to LEO. The proposed vehicle was a Saturn S-IC first stage, S-II second stage, S-N (Saturn, Nuclear) final stage. That\u0027s two stages of off-the-shelf technology and a bit more work on one near completion. Even Von Braun had them lined up to be the engine that\u0027d take humanity to Mars. Apollo based craft? Maybe not (if only because you don\u0027t lock people in a container that small for an interplanetary flight).
