If you can produce a focusing panel for one third the mass and use a power\u00A0conversion panel\u00A0one tenth the mass you effectively increase the power mass efficiency by 3 fold. The orher benefit is that in situations were you need a minimal amount\u00A0of power to make panels worthwhile, this can effectively make an underlit panel sufficiently\u00A0lit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have to repeat this again because there is a historic tendency in this group to misuderstand these technologies. Nothing like this will reach space, shocking as that may seem. Every\u00A0technology needs to be reworked and reapplied to reach space and in the process some things will rise faster than others.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I found was interesting in designing the ultimate SEP is that if you really want to have alot of power you need panels\u00A0that roll out, panels that go from very compact spaces to completely fillng the maximum 2D space that the structural can support. This is not easy to achieve\u00A0with current technology, particularly with crystalline arrays, and\u00A0the most efficient\u00A0arrays are cystalline.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other problem is moving electrons. 1000 sq meter panel, alot of the mass goes into moving electrons on average 75 meters at 24V. That is to say you have to move 300KW of power at 24 V. There is therefore a need to concentrate the power generation to motifs that can step up the voltage for commuting electrons. If this can be broken up to panels that generate a stepped up voltage by higher power density in smaller strips then the step up transformers may not be required and the panel weights go down.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverwhelmingly in a SEP ship the problem is the energy density/mass. So that the basic problem is to get the voltages up at the source as mass efficient as possible and reduce the panel and the electronics and structural devoted to supporting thos panels. What actually gets this done only the future can telll, but I can see promise in multiple technologies to get there.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you don\u0027t see where i am going, try building a shell ship for SEP propulsion, alot of the gorey problems become apparent in the attempt to design.
