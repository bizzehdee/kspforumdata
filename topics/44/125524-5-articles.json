The argument that CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E produced today does not have an effect for 15 years is rationally true, the effects are both today and in the future. At any moment we are producing C02 and the environment is absorbing C0\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E as part of the dynamic equilibrium, and this makes it appear that today\u0027s CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E is not acting today. But this actually reveals is that the impact say of Chinas multifold increase of coal burning may not be fully felt for a decade, at a time when they will have to cut coal production and clean their air, this could result in shocking rises in the temperature of north pacific causing potentially devastating floods in places now suffering from historic droughts. Ultimately what goes into the pacific depths must come up and this does not bode well for certain parts of the US. Overall, regional climatology is set to change, dramatically, it is already changing but the swings that regions experience will alter things like decadal flood plains (25, 100, 500, 1000 year) will, in most places increase in size. Decadal drought probabilities, increase in frequency, magnitude for decadal drought events. Coastal erosion, increase rates of coastal erosion in many places, riparian evolution will increase in rate for many rivers resulting in property loss, man-made dam failures will increase in frequency, .. . . . More money will need to be spend on flood plain and coastal remediation, water plans and water projects, evacuation plans and disaster support, etc.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chakat Firepaw","CreatedById":150121,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-01T00:53:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222300588\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022125524\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221448860363\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022148918\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WedgeAntilles\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 hours ago, WedgeAntilles said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause that assumption would be false.

The measurement stations that were responsible for the infamous \u0022hockey stick\u0022 graph were very poorly placed and poorly monitored, resulting in very unreliable data. Unfortunately, the general trend has since been confirmed with satellite data. It\u0027s not quite as bad as the \u0022hockey stick\u0022 graph suggested, but it\u0027s bad enough.

There is a lot of very bad theoretical work that\u0027s been published over the years, and I am yet to see a model that definitively answers the question. The more thorough and detailed studies tend to have error band that covers everything from \u0022we contribute a little\u0022 to \u0022we are responsible for all of it\u0022. And we really need to know which one it is. If climate is directly controlled by CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E levels, and we are responsible for enough CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E output to directly control it, then we \u0022just\u0022 need to cut all of the CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E output and we\u0027ll be fine. If it\u0027s already a runaway effect we can\u0027t stop, whether it\u0027s human-caused or not, we also need to know it now. Wasting resources on trying to limit CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E output if it\u0027s out of our control by now is stupid. If that is the case, we should be investing all of our resources into finding ways to deal with a changing climate, including improving our cities.
