So how can you justify average civilians having constant acceleration starships? In a scifi setting?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEspecially with warp or jump drives in use? All a starship would have to do is accelerate at 1g for a year and then go to warp and drop out of a warp a light second away from a planet it wants to hit. A second is not much time to react.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet us assume a scifi setting has both hyperdrives and constant acceleration drives on starships available to civilians. How do you prevent WMD?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen it dawned on me. What if the starship instead used a hyperdrive that harmlessly auto-shifted it\u0027s speed on dropping out of hyperspace according to either the sun or nearby celestial bodies? Or even other vessels?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat does that mean? It means that if you drop out of hyperspace above a world, your speed and orbit will automatically match the planet you\u0027re above\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, since your orbit and speed matches the planet\u0027s exactly, you will fall to it like a rock. Unless you\u00A0engage your constant acceleration engines to curve over the world at\u00A0orbital velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat this also\u00A0means: So average joe decides he wants to ram his ship at 99% lightspeed into Earth because of... reasons. He spends a year accelerating at 1g, many lightyears from earth. Then he engages the hyperdrive, hoping to drop out above the planet and crash into the atmosphere at lighthugger speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe does drop above earth, just not at lighthugger speed.\u00A0Hyperspace has\u00A0auto-shifted his speed and orbital trajectory\u00A0to the earth\u0027s. Thus his ship drops like a stone. Damaging? Likely, but nowhere near relativistic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEasy spaceship interception: Now you do not have to match speed and trajectory of your targeted vessel. Since the hyperdrive will make drop out relatively at the same speed and orbit. Thus\u00A0all you have to do is chase and maybe retroburn for intercept.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is my solution for making constant acceleration drives with hyperdrives not WMD. For what it\u0027s worth, that is how many a common space sim could be explained away (not kerbal).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is yours?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: I realize average joe could\u00A0 drop out near mars and accelerate at 1g to earth, but he would get intercepted by hyperdrive ships long before he reached earth. Since the only way to become an RKV for a ship is to either do constant acceleration or drop out of hyperspace while autoshifting\u00A0speed to a near object more massive than your vessel that is already relativistic. Not exactly an easy find, as I am sure authorities would frown on that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thor Wotansen","CreatedById":157596,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-30T12:26:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA warp dive will conserve momentum.\u00A0 If you want to make your scifi obey the laws of physics, you\u0027ll have to figure some other way of fixing the problem.\u00A0 One interesting thing about RKVs is that a sewing needle in the path of the missile, a few hundred miles above Earth would be enough to completely destroy it, and Earth would be saved.\u00A0 Having railguns or gauss guns that can fire tiny projectiles at high speed, and the computing power to calculate an intercept in a few milliseconds would be a believable counter to a ship massed RKV that needed some run-up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA ship is not a good RKV though.\u00A0 They have a tendency to be as light as possible, so hitting the atmosphere at, say, 5%C would make a very big fireball and perhaps cause local devastation, but not really destroy the planet.\u00A0 A more effective RKV would be an aerodynamically optimized slug of Tungsten or Uranium massing a few kilotons.\u00A0 This would be able to release it\u0027s energy far deeper in the planet and cause massive tectonic instability and enormous earthquakes that would pretty much level any buildings and rearrange the geology of the planet suddenly enough to kill most everything.\u00A0 If you want to blast the planet into little bits, you need to go big.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-30T13:58:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223607603\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022184862\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221559203021\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022197504\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spacescifi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, Spacescifi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI well know that constant acceleration drives have the potential to be WMD.

Why? Because they have a huge \u003Cem\u003Ecooling\u003C/em\u003E advantage. All energy that a spaceship brings with it. Also, atmosphere makes it impossible to use hypervelocity weapons, because they\u0027ll be obliterated upon impact with it. To deal with atmosphere you need mass, which is at premium on ships, not to mention good bombardment weapons are poor space weapons (unless they\u0027re nukes).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to learn about space warfare, check out Children of a Dead Earth. It\u0027s a surprisingly fun ultrarealistic (yes!) space warfare sim. Generally, it serves to bust several misconceptions about space warfare. First, engagement ranges are on order of megameters, but actual damage is hard to do at that range.\u00A0Huge lasers can do damage at extreme range... except that not only do they need a giant, heavy ship, they also have problem actually \u003Cem\u003Eaiming \u003C/em\u003Ebeyond 1 megameter or so. At this distance, just a tiny torque anywhere on the ship puts your laser off target, so the laser spot wanders around.\u00A0Spaceships are aerodynamic with huge wings! It turns out \u0022aerodynamic\u0022 shape is awesome for making projectiles (even hypervelocity ones) bounce off it, and high-energy reactors that you need to power those weapons need a huge radiator area, which looks kind of like a \u0022wing\u0022 (especially once you notice that and deliberately shape them that way, which doesn\u0027t really hurt efficiency \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E). Really, just play it. You can even design your own weapons and ships, to see how they\u0027d really act. This is a low-tech setting, so you won\u0027t get torchships (without mods), but you can get a feeling for what it feels like. And it all works off real equations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for FTL, here\u0027s one limitation that is often overlooked: precision. Just say that it\u0027s impossible to come out of FTL with accuracy sufficient to actually \u0022hit\u0022 a planet. In reality, everything has some sort of pointing error.

If you imagine a magical reactionless drive, that\u0027s fine for your space opera, but then you can simply break physics even more, and not give it conservation of momentum. If you turn the drive off, it stops. Done. If you want it to coast with the engine off, then follow physics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJump/hyperdrive will always have issues with conservation of momentum depending on how you establish it. If you jump from one system to another, and there is relative motion between the star systems, then you might have a problem (our sun is moving at ~20km/s relative to the neighborhood average as I recall). So if your velocity vector is conserved, then preparing for a jump involves making sure your relative velocity is OK vs the target. It also means that if you accelerate a munch the wrong way, you might well pop out with some large velocity relative to the target system. You might not destroy a planet, but it\u0027s entirely possible to then make something jump that is big enough and fast enoug to be fairly nasty (say a few hundred km/s).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are two concerns. Your initial one suggests relativistic missiles, which is not really a thing with any reasonable selection of a rocket engine.

The only reason the US didn\u0027t nuke the USSR right after Japan (and before USSR developed nukes) was that they weren\u0027t certain that Soviets would react like the Japanese did, and with their highly distributed industry would probably be able to survive a nuclear strike, and the thing would devolve into a conventional war (that they\u0027d probably lose).

They were thinking in terms of cold, hard numbers. There was one idealist among Soviet Union\u0027s leaders (Gorbachev), and as it happens, it stopped being a union because of his policies. Nobody wants a nuclear war because it\u0027s bad for business, if one nation was given nukes or a means to reliably stop any retaliation, they\u0027d certainly use their own\u00A0nukes against anyone who didn\u0027t comply with their demands (what you\u0027d get in practice would be them being able to demand anything, on pain of nuclear death).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPolitics have nothing to do with morality, and those who try to keep \u0022moral high ground\u0022 in politics seldom last long.

Notice that all nations that banned cluster bombs, for example, are also nations that never had\u00A0any decent cluster bombs. Likewise chemical weapons, they\u0027re annoying (and costly) to deal with, but otherwise useless against a prepared enemy. Given that, the best way of ensuring that potentially destructive drive systems aren\u0027t repurposed into planet killers, is to introduce a weapon that could do the same, but in a far more cost-efficient way. As for individuals, give militaries a reliable way of destroying a civilian ship on approach (a nuclear missile swarm works well).
