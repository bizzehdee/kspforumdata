So there are all kinds of legal hazards for buzzing a sports match, there are federal laws regarding match-fixing. On top of that their may be municipalities or states that apply laws regarding camera use and distances, such as in Sweden. And the US Supreme Court ruled that use of photographs or other recordings in places where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy is can be subject to legal or civil action. IOW, if you are doing something extra-ordinary, then there are a number of avenues that you act in a way that people are unaccustomed to your actions, be it airline pilots, people walking on the street, someone undressing in their bedroom in from of an open window behind a fence, or a player at a match you could be subjected to different avenues of civil and legal action. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally speaking, unless the laws protect you from action, if you harm someone or violate their privacy you can be arrested and/or sued. In the case of New York they can simply extend FAA jurisdiction and you will end up spending money in court trying to reverse fines or punishments, it will not cost them anything. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine the following, It is February 5th, the Superbowl, X\u0027s team is losing, but not by much, X flies in low with a quad-copter and scare the quarterback of the opposing team, he is sacked hard and fumbles and the my teams recovers and scores, while the quarterback goes to the bench injured, minutes earlier I place a bet on the game that my team will win. So now you could suffer RICO investigation, the losing team could file a civil suit against you, the quarterback could charge you with assault, a rap you would probably beat, but the civil suit for injury would stick. The FAA may have restricted airspace over the event, as they sometimes do, and you would be in violation of that airspace designation, which would result in probably a misdemeanor charge and a fine. The RICO match fixing investigation alone you might beat if the prosecution cannot prove you collaborated with anyone, but it would go on for years and be incredibly expensive to fight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WestAir","CreatedById":59115,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T22:58:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not well versed on the range of these drones and UAV\u0027s, but I \u003Cem\u003Eassume\u003C/em\u003E a good one could make it pretty far.
