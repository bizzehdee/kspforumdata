Then, landers, rovers, manned capsules, labs, probes, and other payloads would be docked to this massive spacecraft and be carried away to other planets, acting as a mothership of some sorts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the mission, the spacecraft would carry its returning payload back to Earth orbit, detach the manned capsules for reentry, and stay in orbit for for its next mission, with new capsules, new crew, and (possibly) new engines. This way, the WHOLE spacecraft, other than discarded segments due to damage, is recovered, and ready for new missions without launching it to orbit again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried this concept in KSP, and while initial efforts are challenging (it cost me 19 launches, and it has 350\u002B part count, not including payload), the results are staggering. For every subsequent missions, all I have to do is launch a resupply mission, send manned capsules and landers, maybe a processing lab, and simply set the thing on its way.
