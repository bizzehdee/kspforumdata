If a definition is no longer useful then we should change it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0027Artificial\u0027 in A.I. is a historical hang-over from classical A.I. and is still in use because people are familiar with it. It\u0027s actually better to talk about Synthetic Intelligence but it\u0027s just not really an issue yet because the field just hasn\u0027t made enough progress. But I do appreciate that (hopefully) there will one day be the need to differentiate between true synthetic intelligence and smart programming even though both of them are artificial rather than naturally occurring. At the moment though, 95% of the field of A.I. is essentially just trickery. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s interesting to note though that the first journal in the field of artificial emotions is the International Journal of Synthetic Emotions. Possibly because the term \u0022Artificial Emotions\u0022 hasn\u0027t had a chance to catch on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESapience may be more specifically concerned with intelligence than sentience, but some argue that intelligence is not possible without the ability to feel. Minsky for example posed the question of whether you can have intelligence without emotions. There are many good reasons to believe that you cannot. I would also question whether you can have sentience without some degree of sapience. As with all other troublesome definitions, intelligence can be plotted on a sliding scale. Some agents are more intelligent than others. At the bottom of the scale are the stimulus / response agents. So at what arbitrary point do we say that something is sapient or sentient? The same could be said for consciousness.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-06T20:43:34Z\u0022 title=\u002210/06/2014 08:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Karla\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Karla","CreatedById":109530,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-06T20:01:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith regard to the OP about synthetic intelligent agents being slaves programmed to take pleasure from their jobs, how is this different from training dogs to sniff out explosives or to lead blind people about?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fingal","CreatedById":109326,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-06T20:06:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022|Velocity|\u0022 data-cite=\u0022|Velocity|\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EClearly, you\u0027re trying to make like there\u0027s some difficulty in defining what intelligence is. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, I just want to know what your definition of intelligence is.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"No one","CreatedById":112131,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-06T20:08:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy are we giving them souls?
