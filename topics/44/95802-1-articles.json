We can bring it back to the launch site, but the boost back penalty is significant. If we also have to the plane change for geo missions from Cape inclination (28.5 deg) to equatorial, then a downrange platform landing is needed. The Mars transport system will be a completely new architecture. Am hoping to present that towards the end of this year. Good thing we didn\u0027t do it sooner, as we have learned a huge amount from Falcon and Dragon. Our spacesuit design is finally coming together and will also be unveiled later this year. We are putting a lot of effort into design esthetics, not just utility. It needs to both look like a 21st century spacesuit and work well.

Using the Saturn V as a template, we can make an estimate of the size of the rocket that will send SpaceX to Mars because we know that they plan on using 9 Raptor engines in the first stage, and we know the thrust they anticipate they will get out of the Raptor. Also, let\u0027s assume they use a single core instead of 3 identical cores Falcon heavy style. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to wikipedia, the Saturn V weighed 2,970,000 kg at launch, and the F-1 engines (of which there were 5 on the first stage) could generate 7,740,000 newtons of thrust. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch TWR of the Saturn V was 1.3ish. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5 x 7,740,000 newtons / 2,970,000kg / 9.8 m/s^2 = 1.3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s see what SpaceX could do with 9 raptor engines producing a launch TWR of 1.3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9 x 8,200,000 newtons / mass of rocket / 9.8 m/s^2 = 1.3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9 x 8,200,000 newtons / 9.8 m/s^2 = 1.3 x mass of rocket\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9 x 8,200,000 newtons / 9.8 m/s^2 / 1.3 = mass of rocket\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd we get 5,790,000 kg, which is 6,385 tons, for the launch mass.
