Now this may seem like of course people would be able to come up with something, but it isn\u0027t possible, right now. The first and main reason is that the atmosphere would crush any bit of fragile equipment. Second, the heat on the planet would melt all the electrical equipment, as most are made out of copper, gold, and tin. Two, the solar panels would get very little sunlight due to the amount of cloud cover the atmosphere has, and would run out of electricity (if you hadn\u0027t melted already) So really a lander or rover on venus would be very impractical, and we can gather alot of evidence from earth about venus, and it really doesn\u0027t interest us as human beings because it would cost more to put things on venus than would grant scientific value.
