No way to do zero G like actual zero G. Do you think we might someday see a film made on a space station, maybe even one brought up specially as a set. Sounds kind of crazy, but you never know, if some visionary director/producer gets the idea in his head in 30 or so years time and is willing to put effort in it. Maybe the set could be built to then be used as an actual station or ship so it is dual purposed. This is probably just silly, but a man can dream.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thaniel","CreatedById":11130,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T09:47:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne day, when there are civilians in space on a daily basis e.g. living there. Then yeah, movies will be made there. It\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s too cool an environment not to. But the price and logistics need to allow for it. When it does, I fully believe it will happen. And for some strange reason, I also think the first proffesional movie made in space will be XXX rated. I may be wrong on that though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"karolus10","CreatedById":17876,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T14:30:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you want \u0022real\u0022 zero-G scene in Your movie You can hire vomit comet to do some more cheaply (Apollo 13 movie used vomit comet for zero-G scenes)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Echostatic","CreatedById":59603,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T14:45:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI imagine it will be a good long while before the cost would be less than simply using special effects.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kilmeister","CreatedById":65062,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T14:46:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, but even then they only used it where it was absolutely necessary.
