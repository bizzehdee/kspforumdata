Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere blocks a portion of infrared before it reaches the ground.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd blocks a greater proportion before it escapes into space.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSeriously, if anybody can back up this claim of yours, they will get a massive research grant. They would be set for life. Hard, experimentally-verified data proving that CO2 absorbs just as much, if not more incident solar radiation than radiated heat from the earth. That would be groundbreaking. Maybe, just maybe, there\u0026#39;s a reason nobody is doing this.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, not related to the part of my post that you quoted.
