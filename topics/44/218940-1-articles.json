So you may need to run 127 games for 64 teams.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut distributing them to 10 pitches is not trivial. At first, you can probably just send teams to pitches as they open up. If this was always the case, and games took roughly the same duration, you\u0027d expect about 13 rounds of games to get through these 127. But of course, when you get down to just a few teams, you have to wait for some of the games to resolve before you know who is even playing whom. So the last few games end up utilizing only a few pitches. That said, in practice, it\u0027s usually great for tension.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI used to do robotics in High School, and the competitions were always like this. You\u0027re in the pit, making final adjustments, somebody makes the run to the official brackets to see who we\u0027re playing next and at what table. Do we have another ten minutes to run a test after a battery swap? No? Well, cross fingers and hope for the best. The chaos of parallel games in double-elimination is perfect for that kind of a competition.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"farmerben","CreatedById":190194,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-21T02:06:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought the question was: \u0022How many possible games are there before a winner can be declared?\u0022\u00A0 In which case you need to count every possible pairing, even the ones that never play out in an actual tournament.\u00A0 Unfortunately, I do not have the answer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeSchmuckatelli","CreatedById":154477,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-21T03:14:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224314581\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218940\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221692583613\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022190194\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022farmerben\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, farmerben said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought the question was: \u0022How many possible games are there before a winner can be declared?\u0022\u00A0 In which case you need to count every possible pairing, even the ones that never play out in an actual tournament.\u00A0 Unfortunately, I do not have the answer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it\u0027s been answered - taking skill out, leaving the coin flip - the answers above seem correct (given my little experience with game theory/ probability math).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus I don\u0027t think \u0027every possible pairing\u0027 is required.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve seen the formulas above before.\u00A0 I\u0027m just not competent enough with probability math to figure it out on my own, and thus appreciate the help!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RCgothic","CreatedById":132560,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-21T07:37:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving a further thought, 127 is the maximum number of games in 8 rounds if every team loses once in the first 2 rounds, but the maximum number of rounds is greater.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 rounds to eliminate 32 who lost twice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 more rounds to eliminate 16\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 more rounds to eliminate 8\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 more rounds to eliminate 4\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 more rounds to eliminate 2\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBest of 3 rounds to eliminate the last 1 because neither team has lost until the final.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe maximum number of rounds to\u00A0\u003Cspan\u003Eplayed by the winning team is 13 and the total number of matches is still 127.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCrazy that it comes out to the same number of matches, but now I think about it further I guess it has to.
