I know reusability on the Falcon 9\u0027s second stage has been shelved in favor of development of the MCT, and nobody else is even considering it. \n\nBut let\u0027s say I was given the task of designing a fully reusable (aside from a few minor components like payload fairings) launcher.\n\nWe\u0027ll assume the design is a multi-stage rocket, capable of lifting at least 10 metric tons into LEO - enough for a manned spacecraft, a space station resupply, and some GSO, Molniya, or other high-energy satellite launches. The basic design will be 2STO - the second stage of a 3STO design would have a very high burnout velocity, leaving it on a very difficult reentry trajectory. Strap-on boosters may be used to boost payload capacity as high as 20 tons to LEO. The upper stage will only deliver its payload to trajectories of similar energy to GTO - this is because a reusable stage will naturally have a poor mass ratio making it inneficient to send payloads directly to high-energy orbits, and you\u0027re throwing away a reusable vehicle if you put out on an Earth escape trajectory. Some type of \u0022kick stage\u0022 will be used for high-energy orbits; this may be a cheap hypergolic or solid-fueled stage, or a pricier cryogenic stage where maximum performance is required.\n\nChoice of fuels: First of all, hypergolics shouldn\u0027t be fueling the main engines of a launch vehicle, because they\u0027re toxic, corrosive, and otherwise a pain in the ass to deal with. Kerosene\u0027s low specific impulse makes it decidedly suboptimal for upper stages. Hydrolox is very efficient, but a bad choice for lower stages because hydrolox engines have a poor TWR and atmospheric ISP. For upper stages, it may not be the best option either due to boiloff. Methane may offer the best of both worlds, offering reasonable density and insulation requirements (boosting mass ratio compared to hydrolox) as well as decent specific impulse and TWR. In addition, it reduces residue in engines compared to kerosene, making reuse easier, and as a gaseous fuel any leaks or spills are inherently less hazardous. Therefore it will be assumed that both stages will use metholox engines.\n\nStage Recovery:\n\nSo, I consider there to be four main ways of landing a stage. 1: parachutes (highest vertical speed on touchdown, very poor accuracy, but easy redundancy by using a cluster of parachutes. 2: parafoils (low vertical speed, some horizontal speed on touchdown. Slight cross-range capability, hopefully allowing a runway to be targeted. Any long skinny object like a rocket would have to land on its side, making landing gear design and parafoil suspension a bit interesting. Harder to make redundant.) 3: wings (effectively zero vertical speed on landing, but very high horizontal speed. Wings are very heavy and add a lot of drag during ascent, but offer excellent cross-range capability). 4: propulsive landing (effectively zero vertical speed and horizontal on landing. Weight penalty is that of reserve fuel, not of engines, and is fairly small. In theory adds little mechanical complexity, but as the Falcon 9 has shown additional control systems may need to be added).\n\nThere are also three main places to land a stage: A: On land (this is the best option for an upper stages, but for lower stages this requires lots of dV for a turnaround manuever) B: In the ocean (requires the least dV and landing precision, but saltwater exposure vastly increases maintenance costs, especially for liquid-fueled stages). C: On a floating platform in the ocean (less dV for lower stages. Precision requirements similar to land, but platform drift and wave action make life much harder. Use of a semi-submersible platform instead of a barge like SpaceX has could make things easier).\n\nThis gives us twelve options. We can immediately eliminate parachute landing for liquid fueled stages, because the touchdown speeds are unsurvivable for a high mass-ratio stage. An SRB should be okay as long as it lands in the ocean. Winged landing in the ocean is a near-guaranteed crash, and winged landing on a floating platform is unfeasible due to the runway length required. We\u0027ll also eliminate water landings of any sort for liquid-fueled stages because they make refurbishment a massive pain. Finally, a winged upper stage would interfere with the vehicle\u0027s aerodynamic stability on launch, and is therefore undesirable. This leaves us with:\n\nFor upper stage: parafoil or propulsive landing on land.\n\nFor lower stage: propulsive or parafoil landing on land (with boostback), winged landing on land (with flyback), or propulsive or parafoil landing on a floating platform.\n\nFor boosters: same as lower stage if liquid-fueled. If solid-fueled, glideback and winged touchdown on land, or parachute landing in the ocean.\n\nNow, the velocity of the lower stage and boosters will be kept low enough for a tailfirst reentry, but the second stage will be coming back from orbit, and can\u0027t just reenter on its engines. So, it needs a heat shield. With a monolithic heat shield, reentry must be nose-first, but what about with inflatables? Can an inflatable heat shield be designed that will cover the engines, and then be deflated in flight to allow for propulsive landing? For a nose-first reentry, how do you turn the stage around for a propulsive landing? Or is it better to just have special landing thrusters for an \u0022upside-down touchdown?\u0022\n\nFor a launch to LEO, the upper stage must have a minimum orbital operation time of 12 hours (enough for the launch site to come below the orbital plane), but 24 hours is preferable to allow for multiple landing opportunities. For a launch to GTO, the stage must perform a small apogee manuever, aerobrake from GTO into LEO 10.5 hours after the initial GTO insertion, boost its periapse, and wait several more hours before deorbiting, again requiring at least 24 hours of on-orbit operations. Is it best to stay simple and use batteries, or are solar panels worth the weight savings? For that matter, since methane will have a little boiloff, what about siphoning off the gases to power a fuel cell or internal combustion engine (Apparently ULA\u0027s Vulcan is supposed to power its upper stage this way).\n\nAre there any other ideas you guys have?"},{"CreatedByName":"Kibble","CreatedById":131042,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T04:25:59Z","Content":"In an upper stage, every kilogram spent on a heat shield, batteries, avionics, and fuel for deorbit and propulsive landing subtracts *directly* from the payload mass.

Grrrr...). So basically, we would have to slap on some heat-shielding (which I cant even begin to imagine having to fit somewhere), some parachutes (most likely), and somewhere to land them where we wont be crushing someones hydrangeas.

Putting something manned in the cargo bay of a normally unmanned orbiter would be a death trap, but as the space shuttle has proven launching crew and cargo on the same vehicle means you\u0027re not using your full capability on most missions. So, you need separate manned and cargo upper stages, somewhat like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle-C). But having a manned vehicle sitting on the side of your stack is a death-trap anyway, as demonstrated again by the Space Shuttle.\n\nSo you basically have to have an inline upper stage, as Magnemoe suggests:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Another idea would be to have an lifting body upper stage, this would let you land on side, think an larger dream chaser. This however would be more suitable for an manned stage.\n\nThe main problem I see with this is: where do you put the payload? In a cargo bay? (If so, the fully-fueled second stage has to be capable of acting as an LES in the event of a lower-stage failure, which will require a stronger structure and HUGE engines). If it\u0027s on the front, then once the payload is jettisoned the nose of the vehicle would probably be pretty much flat, which isn\u0027t that good for reentry.\n\nPerhaps a side-mounted inflatable heat shield with a lifting body shape?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Lifting body with drop tank like the shuttle on top of an falcon 9 style lower stage should also work.\n\n[Like this?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn-Shuttle) It might work, but it still has a lot of the problems of a purely side-mounted upper stage, including LES capability and the heat shield being potentially exposed to falling debris from the fuel tank.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ...What about a design where a winged second stage doubes the wing as a hardpoint location for strap on boosters?\n\nThat might put a lot of stress on the wing structure, but using the second stage fuel tank as a hardpoint might work better, as long as the payload fairing / capsule is located safely above the tops of the boosters.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The strapons do a spaceX return to the launchsite, after geting the winged second stage above most of the atmmosphere with some horizontal veocity; the secondstage is a flyback booster, after getting the third stage mostly to orbit; the third stage achieves stable orbit, then plans a targetted reentry.\n\nFrom what I know, \u0022mostly to orbit\u0022 isn\u0027t a great situation to reenter from. If you look at a chart of the Shuttle\u0027s abort possibilities [here,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_abort_modes#/media/File:ShuttleAbortPost51L.png), there are big \u0022black zones\u0022 late in the mission. With a lifting body the g-loads might be reducable to safe levels, but flyback would take an absurd amount of fuel. A better option would probably be landing on another continent, possibly with some \u0022boost-forward,\u0022 similar to the Shuttle\u0027s TransAtlantic Abort Mode, or even an Abort Once Around. This option would be most effective when launching beyond LEO.\n\nAlso, it looks like inflatable heat shields are pretty cool technology: [http://www.researchgate.net/publication/238029355_The_ParaShield_entry_vehicle_concept_-_Basic_theory_and_flight_test_development](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238029355_The_ParaShield_entry_vehicle_concept_-_Basic_theory_and_flight_test_development)"},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T21:39:58Z","Content":"Yea, I really meant a \u0022fly-foreward\u0022 core that lands on another contenent.\n\nAfter playing around with the idea in sandbox, I\u0027ve discovered that it\u0027s really hard to design a flyback booster without soe kind of noseweight- empty of fuel, the engines are so much heavier than the tanks that your wings look like overly large tailfins."},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T22:35:34Z","Content":"\u003E I\u0027m not saying winged upper stages are the way to go, but categorically excluding them from speculation here is baseless.\n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E [http://d1jqu7g1y74ds1.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/dream-chaser-5.jpg](http://d1jqu7g1y74ds1.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/dream-chaser-5.jpg)\n\u003E \n\nAgree, one of the benefits of wings is that the huge second stage vacuum engine is protected during reentry. \n\nYou also has the option to use a drop tank like the shuttle, as this would be second stage it could be smaller."},{"CreatedByName":"Superluminaut","CreatedById":58963,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T23:04:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Stage Recovery:\n\u003E So, I consider there to be four main ways of landing a stage. 1: parachutes (highest vertical speed on touchdown, very poor accuracy, but easy redundancy by using a cluster of parachutes. 2: parafoils (low vertical speed, some horizontal speed on touchdown.

There is a guy on the forums that converted me and knows more about this, but I\u0027ll have a go at defending the option. \n\nSo you would dive in the the atmosphere, top of the stage going prograde with a heat shield. Once you hit the desired altitude for deploying the heli blades you unlock them from the side of the stage and aerodynamic forces automatically deploy them as well as spin them up. So now you have an upside down fuel tank with a nozzle pointing up slowing down due to the lift provided by the free spinning heli blades. At this point you have control and can fine tune your dive towards the landing pad by angling the blades. You dive in just like a lifting body would and right above the landing pad you set the angle of the heli blades for maximum lift, they spin up and allow you to make a soft, controlled landing, no engine required, just gravity, air, and controlling the angle of the blades. This method also allows for a glide slope so you can guide the vehicle to the pad. \n\nThe technique of diving in and allowing the blades to spin up for a soft landing is a proven technique employed by helicopter pilots in the event of an engine malfunction in the air.\n\n5; Rotors (zero vertical and horizontal speed on touchdown, with cross-range capability.

Parafoil chosen due to low relative mass, and ease of removal for use as a disposable first stage (to accelerate flight times, allowing it to fly regardless of the readiness of the recovery). Also, it allows the first stage to fully deplete propellant regardless of recovery factor, as for SpaceX style reuse you MUST sacrifice payload capacity for reuse.\n- First-stage engines are hydrolox for greatest specific impulse. Engines are designed to be swapped out quickly for other engines so that complex flight checks can be done without impacting the flight schedule while prepared, ready to go engines are fitted for flight.\n- Hybrid boosters are provided due to relative low cost, and utilize LOX from the main tank as the oxidizer. This allows the shutoff and throttling of these motors, in the event of anomalous behavior.

No reusable shrouds.\n\n**Triple huge.**\n\n~5000t to LEO for the hugest single part to be put in LEO in one piece  \n\n(a 50m-wide drum with coaxial radially attached counter-rotating habitats with artificial gravity, for a standard heavy space station).\n\nFirst stage.  \n\nPack of 3 first stages from the 1500t-lifting LV like Falcon Heavy.  \n\nSingle-use, no legs, no return.\n\nSecond stage.  \n\nCentral module - fuel tank(s) and hydrolox engine.  \n\nTwo side modules - fuel tank and a gas-core nuke.  \n\nGets to LEO on a single chemical engine (for thrust) and two side nukes (for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E).  \n\nEither both nuke modules get separated and delivered to the shipyard orbital station for further usage or utilization, or both side blocks get delivered to the shipyard for further continuous refuelling and usage.\n\n**Spaceplane.**\n\nNot a part of the TSTO itself, but main spaceship to deliver humans and particular cargo.  \n\n1.5 times smaller that Shuttle.  \n\nTotal mass 30\u002B t, crew 4.  \n\nPayload compartment can contain 2m wide things.\n\nLifting body of Spiral/BOR/Dreamchaser shape.\n\nThe crew sits in an ejectable cylindroconic capsule 2 m wide, 2 by 2. Like Soyuz RV, but a bit longer.  \n\nThe capsule is not mounted into the ship like in Shuttle, but is put inside as a part of payload. Though rather than other payloads has front windows.  \n\nAll 4 seats ejectable (\u0027cuz they can).\n\nThe crew capsule is ejectable, too.   \n\n1. Jettison the doors section and engage primary ejection impulse in direction \u0022feet-to-head\u0022, throwing the capsule radially for 2 meters,  \n\n2. Decouple the lightweight attachment pad and enable main \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E engine pushing the capsule forward-away.\n\nTo carry more passengers, another same capsule can be put behind the crew capsule. To be ejected one-by-one.\n\nWithout capsules the spaceplane is pure cargo with long payload compartment.  \n\nSo, no cargo/crew modifications, just the same plane with/without a detachable cabin.\n\nThe crew cabin is crumped, it\u0027s a pure atmospheric cabin, no orbital flight abilities. They just get to/from the orbit inside it.\n\nBehind the cabin - a 2m spherical compartment like Soyuz orbital module or Almaz/OPS native rear EVA module.  \n\nFront door - to the cabin, top door - for EVA, bottom door - to the crawl tunnel to the rear cabin, rear door - to a pressurized module in the cargo payload (if any).  \n\nDetached in uncrewed flights.\n\nRear (orbital) cabin. Always present, not detachable. To be used all orbital flight long. All orbital maneuvering is done from here.  \n\n3m cylider with rear (in orbit - front) cone and front (in orbit - rear) hemisphere.  \n\n2 pilot seats aside the central passage to the docking node on the cone top.  \n\nBehind them - toilet and kitchen (1x1 m both, aside the passage).  \n\nThe hemisphere looks into the payload compartment and has 2 round doors: central - to a pressurized module in the cargo payload (if any), front-down - into a crawl tunnel to the nose part.\n\nAside the fuselage - two nacelles with tanks and paired engines.  \n\nOrbital engines (kerosene\u002BHTP or kerolox or hypergolics) in the nose part of nacelles, aside the front cabin.  \n\nTwo small turbojets (kerosene) in the rear part of nacelles, aside the rear cabin.  \n\n2 retractable air scoops. Blocks of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E (HTP or kerosene\u002BHTP or hypergolics).\n\nFoldable wings. Folded behind up on launch, expanded in flight or before deorbiting.\n\nFlight duration - 1..2 weeks, just to replace the crew and deliver some goods, not to stay docked.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-09-11T06:28:36Z\u0022 title=\u002209/11/2018 06:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 11, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by kerbiloid**"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-11T07:49:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 5/1/2015 at 5:32 PM, Mr Shifty said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E You\u0027ve just eliminated the Space Shuttle Orbiter.\n\u003E \n\nGenerally speaking... good riddance...\n\nThat thing as not cost effective. It got 27.5 metric tons to orbit, and had a dry mass of 78 tons. 3/4 of the mass it gets to orbit is simply the vehicle itself and is going to come right back down, that\u0027s pretty inefficient. Its even worse if you consider that the external tank makes it nearly to orbit (and could be taken there at the expense of payload: \u002B another 26.5 tons taken to orbit that serves no purpose once in orbit).\n\nEvery kg added to the second stage is many more kg added to the first stage. This provides huge incentives for first stage recovery before 2nd stage recovery (not to mention, first stage recovery is much easier). The shuttle was pretty backwards in that respect, focusing on recovery of the orbital stage, discarding a massive tank, and rather crude recovery of the boosters.\n\nI\u0027d like to see a modified concept of the skylon: airbreathing to about mach 5.5, then go closed cycle for another 2km/sec, and then release a 2nd stage to orbit.\n\nDon\u0027t bring the airbreathing equipment to orbit. Don\u0027t bring empty tanks to orbit, don\u0027t bring unnecessary wings to orbit (the shuttle could have used much smaller wings if they weren\u0027t committed to being able to return to the launch site right after launching something into a polar orbit).\n\nI\u0027m not saying a reusable 2nd stage is out, but it should be a lower priority than a reusable 1st stage.\n\nAlso, that dreamchaser makes more sense than the shuttle... it doesn\u0027t really have much wing, its a lifting body (much better for re-entry, lower dry mass), and it doesn\u0027t have a heavy payload bay. I suppose its ok as an alternative to something like the soyuz or progress- which aren\u0027t even second stages, they are orbital vehicles. Downmas capability is needed for stations as well, and in those circumstances, a lifting body or spaceplane does much better than a capsule.\n\nThey have OMS propulsion, but don\u0027t really do the work of getting their payload into orbit, they are the payload for the 2nd stage."},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-11T13:34:02Z","Content":"Premice: a large advanced-propulsion engine is only useful in space, but needs occasional servicing on earth.
