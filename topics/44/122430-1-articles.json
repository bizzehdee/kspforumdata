The one comment made is that einsteinian laws of the inflationary boundary are not limiting at the boundary. IOW relativity cannot be used to prove itself in all instances. That even if it consistent in the observable there is no guarantee its consistent everywhere If you are on the edge your conclusion would be different, The concept that the universe is flat on the observable large scale has been held since CMBR, meaning that euclidian geometry averaging out the effects of local gravitational wells is flat. But there could be reasons why that is not always true, for one we could be close to the center of inflation than much of the universe. The CNBR could be giving a false impression, warped by dark energy differential effect, or the large scale structure of the universe may exist and may be more evident in other observations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is listed under sci-fi, its a testimony to the fact the universe is expanding, and apparently the actual universe is much larger than what can be ascertained from the observable, which by itself is very large; to arrive at these hideous distances and still be flat, the instantaneous differential velocites of the extreme points of the universe are simply beyond our scope. Barring a infinite improbability drive (or warp drive) there is simply no way to achieve the speed or distance required to thoroughly test Einsteins prediction. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is another issue of course, that is space-time during inflation. during inflation all space grows from adjacent space at the same rate, matter is immaterial and energy is so high that electromagnetism is not present space and time are not resolvable in the same manner as present. The assumption however that inflation stopped. There is a priblem with this however, dark energy. Did inflation stop everywhere snd how did it stop. Certainly inflation slowed down or the opaque epoch would never have been entered and exited. But the universe is not homogeneous, there are places we can see further back in time; galaxies millions of years older than the expected oldest visible galaxies. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn one scenario inflation is like a wave that keeps traveling outward with a fantastic comoving frame traveling faster and faster away from us, in this scenario instantaneous predictions of size are only useful at the very beginning of the universe and are virtually useless now because the concept of velocity at the fastest inflating areas is not a calculable quantity. To these frames our age is unfathomable, opaque phase hase not been entered and will, from our perspective never be exited. The laws of gravity that bind objects in our observable universe would not effect these new objects. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo between this extreme and a finite universe are all variations including multiverses of expanding bubbles. The reason these various speculations can contend is because of one simple observable fact; the universe is larger than our observable universe. How do we know this to be true, if it were not true then CMBR would begin to fade in one part of the sky, weakening over time. Our perspective on the universe is akin to a housekeeping ant living in the middle of an ant-mound, never to see what goes on outside the darkness of its own personal creation, it thinks his world is complete, until it tries to contemplate its worlds creation, then its horizons fade into oblivian.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T12:54:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUntil we get FTL, we might never know what is out there...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T13:28:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RainDreamer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RainDreamer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUntil we get FTL, we might never know what is out there...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESaying \u0022until we get FTL\u0022 is like saying \u0022until we manage to draw a cubical circle\u0022.

That means at least one of the fine structure constants is probably variable, how variable and the circumstances of which remain unknown. Gravitational constant of all of these is most likely a variant, even in the lab its hard to fix, the other constants like Plank\u0027s, C, Boltzmann\u0027s constant are rather unchanging. The problem is that during the transition from pre-inflation to inflation supposedly quantum gravity transitions to relativistic gravity, the first of which we have never been able to detect, the second of which may be resolved to 7 digits (I think securely 6). With regard to the first source of variation, it is very difficult here on earth to reduce all matter, all electromagnetism and all source of static fields, thus you have papers that argue that they think they have emptied enough space to make a valid reading, but the problem is without knowing the interactive nature of dark energy, we don\u0027t know what constrains it. When the universe was full of homogeneously dispersed matter inflation stopped (as far as we know) then around 7 billion years ago as much of the clustering of matter into dark matter strands and galaxies the universe begins to inflate again. Einsteins concept of a cosmological constant was sort of invalidated when Hubble showed that every \u0027point\u0027 in the visible universe was expanding away from every other point, but now that we see that this is inflating an inconstant cosmological \u0027constant\u0027 is gaining favor over the infiltration of energy into persistent quantum vacuum of deep space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.
