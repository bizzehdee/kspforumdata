Yes, other companies jumping on teh re-usability train might have some catching up to do, but that is hardly enough to kill your entire research.

If they\u0027re smart and/or lucky, their tech might be faster to be developed/matured. \n\nAdditionally, having multiple players on the market urges each individual player to keep on investing and keep on innovating to try and keep their share of the market. If several different technologies/approaches are investigated, it also increases the odds of one of those technologies working really well.\n\nI\u0027m a big fan of SpaceX, but they are hardly infallible. Their tech might turn out to be too complex, too expensive, or run into a whole slew of other unexpected problems.

You can get into the fuel tank by removing the engine or the \u0022dollar\u0022 (the center circular closure of the end dome) and there\u0027s not much inside other than anti-slosh baffles and level sensors. Any avionics are in some sort of exterior pod that\u0027s just blistered on anyway. Things like helium pressurization bottles are usually located out in the open at the end dome for easy servicing already.\n\nRockets do have little \u0022oops\u0022 in the factory, so they\u0027re built with little features like this to repair and inspect them.\n\nAny major hatches are usually in the payload or payload fairing so you can put in batteries, short-life experiment stuff, and air conditioning at the pad. This is a standard feature. For example, the Saturn V LM adapter had hatches so you could get to the LM on the pad.\n\nInsurance costs will go \\*down\\* because the rocket has been tested and proven to actually fly, and is thus statistically more reliable than one fresh out of the factory.
