Granted they wouldn\u0027t negociate FTL away, but sitting the major governments down and offering up better methods of harvesting energy would probably buy a ton of good will and have people bending over backwards to comply so long as it isn\u0027t looking like prelude to invasion or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trouble is I\u0027m not sure how the first couple hours would go after contact has been established and confirmed.

I would like to think that the major powers would not be so stupid as to try to trap, imprison, and kill a representative of a race with superior technology for personal / national gain. If nothing else, it will likely tick off the rest of said race\u0027s fellows once they find out, perhaps to the point they would quarantine us (\u0022You stole our FTL drive? None of your ships will leave orbit \u003Cem\u003Eever!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022) or even invade to bring the parties responsible to justice. (And they WILL find out eventually. Don\u0027t think they won\u0027t.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the original scenario:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, while I doubt the average citizen would notice a \u0022mile long\u0022 spaceship in low orbit, just about every professional and amateur astronomer would find it in short order. The ISS is a similar size - though not as robust as the design you\u0027re probably envisioning - and we can see it as a bright moving star in our night sky. With the whole astronomical community turning instruments on the ship, we can forget about any notion of the aliens\u0027 arrival being secret. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, part of the reaction will depend on the alien physiology. The General Zod/Man of Steel scenario had to work with Superman being human in appearance. While I personally doubt that any alien race will come close to us in appearance to pass for one of us, it has been done in fiction before, and there can be justifications (deliberate body modification, either because the race are shapechangers, or because they have the technology to port themselves into specially designed bodies for different environments). Even if the aliens are friendly, the mere ability to look like us - and the fact that one of their own is hiding among us for whatever reason - would give every government, intelligence agency, and law enforcement agency \u003Cem\u003Eseizures\u003C/em\u003E. O Senator McCarthy, where art thou?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also depends on the fugitive\u0027s behavior and abilities (either natural or technological - what devices / weapons does the fugitive have access to?) I suspect if the fugitive does have any advanced technology on his/her/its person it would likely be imprisoned / \u0022disappeared\u0022 by the major powers for technology or interrogation because after all it IS a fugitive, and in today\u0027s post-9-11 world governments are more willing to do that sort of thing to people they consider to be \u0022nonpersons\u0022. An alien fugitive has an even worse standing in that regard. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the fugitive has been a troublemaker of some kind (committing robberies, feasting on people\u0027s spleens, selling pirated alien ****), I expect our governments would be only too willing to cooperate with the alien authorities in rounding him up. If on the other hand the fugitive has been either a good citizen or even a help, governments might accept the alien authorities\u0027 line for a time, but I expect there would be legal / sentient right issues blowing up on the public arena once the nature of the alien-hunt becomes widely known. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re spot on about all the world\u0027s governments salivating over getting their hands on new technology, and the trade negotiations would be something else again. Expect private enterprise to also go ape over the issue, and depending on what technologies are being negotiated, we can expect the stock market to go crazy at intervals - even BEFORE the new tech is sold, developed, and deployed, a process that will take years. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s all I can think of at this time. If there was someone here who has actual diplomatic experience (working for a consulate or something) or who studies law, they might be able to help further.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Will Fawkes","CreatedById":85847,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T18:09:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell the situation I\u0027m envisioning having the ambassadors/representatives being human...ish looking however it kinda ends at \u0027head with tow eyes, torso with four limbs\u0027 looking like us. they clearly can\u0027t pass for human.

As soon as they have him and the situation is stable the negotiations and discussions can begin. On one hand we shouldn\u0027t judge an alien legal system since their moral values likely differ from our own. But the fugitive lives on our planet and is therefore subject to our laws for sentient species. So it\u0027s going to be a few months of philosophy and bargaining. Meanwhile the markets will go haywire and scientists from all over the world will flock towards the landing site to pick up alien tissue papers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
