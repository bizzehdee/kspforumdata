It is called LIC, at the bottom of this list: [http://www.stpaulbrands.com/products.html](http://www.stpaulbrands.com/products.html)\n\nNote that none of that got sold in US, but exclusively exported to Vietnam. Not safe enough to pass FDA inspection?\n\nAfter reading some of its promotional material full of technobabble not intended to clarify anything to the average reader, it got me suspicious. So here are the listed active ingredients:\n\nBelaunja Extract - 300 mg\n\nMagastin Extract - 100 mg\n\nPsilio Husks powder - 200mg\n\nImage of the first 2 ingredients, as shown in their promotional material:\n\n![o8iHfA1.png](http://i.imgur.com/o8iHfA1.png)\n\nSo here is the result of my preliminary investigation: \n\nBelaunja is, apparently, the pink flower in the image, with the scientific name of Sphaeranthus indicus. The chemical that provide the weight loss effect from this flower is, according to the promotional material, 7-hydroxyfrullanolide, which match with this patent: [http://www.google.com/patents/WO2012014216A1?cl=en](https://www.google.com/patents/WO2012014216A1?cl=en) . The patent does claim to modulate metabolic processes, but it is just a patent. Searching for more scientific sources, I came across this study: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3059449/#ref1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3059449/#ref1) and this is where it goes even wilder, with claims of being a sedative, an antimicrobial and antiviral agent, and a lot more effects. The study does admit it is not a clinical evaluation, which makes me even more suspicious.\n\nMagastin is...something I have no idea about. That exact spelling doesn\u0027t give me any good result, however, the chemical it states to be providing the weight loss effect is called alpha-Mangostin. So I hit that up and found this: [http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/m3824](http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/m3824). So apparently it is just a (deliberate?) misspelling of Mangosteen the fruit (Garcinia mangostana)? That is another bad sign. There is no noted effect of alpha-Mangotin in helping weight loss either, and I have no knowledge in biochemistry to understand the attached study in the link I gave above about what it does to PC12 cells and stuff.\n\nWith those two ingredient kind of identified, I looked up for a case where they are used together for weight loss purposes, and found this: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3684102/](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3684102/) . All the rundown the mill study and result claiming double blind study and that, but this is the only one that mentioned anything about it. Then I noticed at the end, it is a study supported by an unrestricted grant from InterHealth Nutraceuticals. Essentially a sponsored study...suspicious. Further more, I discovered that, it was essentially sharing the same ingredients with another weight loss product called Metatrim, another not-FDA-approved product, and seems to be peddled by Dr.Oz, who is essentially a scammer.\n\nBy this point I have no more leads to find the actual effect of this product, or its ingredients, and way too many red flags has been raised. I hope some of you can help me in this effort. I really don\u0027t want my mother to use something dubious and harm herself. I will try to talk to her about my suspicions, but it is unlikely she will listen until I got some evidences.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-04T12:33:00Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2015 12:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RainDreamer**"},{"CreatedByName":"Godot","CreatedById":16902,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T10:29:37Z","Content":"Creating the informal name for a substance by the name of the plant/animal where it was first extracted\n\nand suffixing it with -ine (or. in german, -in) is pretty common in organic chemistry\n\nVery well known example ... caffeine (in german even clearewr as \u0022Koffein\u0022) from coffea (arabica) suffixed by -ine/-in\n\nTherefore Alpha Mangostin sounds pretty normal for me\n\nWith the -in, I guess, indicating an Alkaloid and the Alpha denmoting the position of the sidechain.\n\nAs for articles about Alpha-Mangostin, there are some, although it seems to have to do more with Apoptosis in cancer cells.\n\nGenerally however I never would trust any food supplemental that claims that just using it would make you lose pounds, without you having to change your lifestyle.\n\nIncreasing the time you move every day (even if is is \u0022just\u0022 walking) while at the same time decreasing your daily calories intake is usually the better bet ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T11:02:25Z","Content":"I get a little bit annoyed every time I hear the word extract used in this manner.

The point is though, that the extract will typically contain a whole bunch of different compounds, some of which will probably be entirely new. That makes it difficult to precisely characterise what you\u0027ve got, so calling it an \u0027extract\u0027 is about the only honest description you can give.\n\nBut back to OP\u0027s question.\n\nIn general, I don\u0027t have a lot of patience with this hippy-dippy insinuation that something is automatically good for you solely because it\u0027s \u0027natural\u0027. Deadly nightshade is entirely natural but its definitely not good for you. Neither do I have a lot of patience with quack diet pills, or faddish celebrity diets. Exercise more, eat less and pick a sensible eating plan that you can stick to. There\u0027s no point going on some ridiculously overcomplicated diet that just leaves you feeling hungry and miserable since the chances of you sticking to it are essentially zero.\n\nIt\u0027s not quick or glamorous or easy but speaking from personal experience (having lost the best part of three stone (19 kg) ), it does work.\n\nI\u0027ve had a quick look at that patent and to be fair it was a lot better than I expected it to be, as in it does actually provide some evidence that 7-hydroxyfrullanolide is having a tangible biological effect. From what I can see, it prevents fat cells from storing fat and also increases the rate at which they break down fats. So yeah, that might be doing something.\n\nHowever, I\u0027m not at all certain that it\u0027s a good something. Sure it might have the cosmetic effect of reducing body fat but that\u0027s not really dealing with the underlying reason why that fat is there in the first place. Without also reducing the amount you\u0027re eating, your body is going to be busily making fat out of any food that it can\u0027t immediately find a use for (or put into short term storage for example, as glycogen) - and that fat then has nowhere to go.

They yield at best a temporary improvement. What is needed to change your weight for the better is a change in lifestyle. You need to *permanently*  change your eating habits (changing input), while also making sure you make different use of that input (changing output) by exercise. That is pretty much the only thing that will work. Torturing yourself for a few weeks does nothing than to stress your body and psyche, so make sure that the changes that you make are sustainable in the long run.\n\nSadly, a lot of people want the results, but are not prepared to deal with the practicalities of getting to the results, causing them to look for magic results in all the wrong places.

Fruit juice in particular, even if it hasn\u0027t had sugar added, is made from fruit varieties that are especially sweet and sugary, and juice made from concentrates is worse because only the very cheapest juices are reconstituted to their natural amount of water.\n\nIf somebody is worried about giving up on juice, eat more veg to compensate - it\u0027ll be better for you.\n\nAs you say, veg are an excellent filler, plus they have all sorts of compounds such as flavonoids which have other beneficial health effects.\n\nI\u0027m not sure drinking water does much to suppress appetite, but at least it stops one drinking juice.\n\nSome recent studies suggest that eating two large meals a day is an easier way to lose weight than eating several small ones. It takes a lot of willpower to stop after eating a small meal, and that is when many dieters slip.\n\nA neat trick is to use your phone to photograph every meal and snack you take. In one study they wanted people to record their intake before starting a diet and once they were on the diet, and decided to get them to take pics as a quick way of recording things. To their surprise, most people lost some weight even before they got to start the diet because photographing their food made them more aware of what they were eating and more self-conscious about it, which helped their self-control!\n\nNever purge. That is the very worst way to lose weight - you eat the food, your body gets all prepared to digest it and store the carbs away, and then you dump it. One of the things the human body does to get ready for food is to produce insulin, which tells the liver it has got to absorb and store all the sugars you eat: when a meal is eaten and then purged, that leaves the liver absorbing sugars that haven\u0027t been eaten, so the \u0022dieter\u0027s\u0022 blood sugar levels crash, making them feel even more hungry.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-04T21:42:56Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2015 09:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by softweir**\n  \nDecided to leave out some speculation I inserted as if it was fact."},{"CreatedByName":"QuesoExplosivo","CreatedById":102949,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T04:10:58Z","Content":"I don\u0027t suppose you could run an LC-MS?\n\n(Without a proper analytical chemistry lab, verifying the contents really isn\u0027t feasible.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T05:14:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Someone correct me if I\u0027m wrong, but eating ALOT of fruit is equally bad, since some of these are also high in sugar content?\n\nYou are both wrong and right. Yes, fruit contains a lot of sugars, so if you eat massive amounts of them, you might still gain weight. However, fruit sugars are not the same as the refined or high fructose corn syrups you will find in processed candy and soft drinks. Your body digests them differently, making them less harmful and is almost impossible to truly eat too much like you easily do with snacks. Also, fruit contains lots of minerals and fibres that help your body digest the sugars and those are absent in snacks and candy.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E There is a lot of evidence that added sugar is harmful. This includes table sugar (sucrose) and high fructose corn syrup, which are both about half glucose, half fructose. The main reason they are harmful, is because of the negative metabolic effects of fructose when consumed in large amounts. Many people now believe that because added sugars are bad, the same must apply to fruits, which also contain fructose. However\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 this is completely wrong, because fructose is only harmful in large amounts and it is almost impossible to overeat fructose by eating fruit.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Peaches, plums, berries, melons are all at their juicy peak! Despite the smorgasbord of flavors and colors offered by summer\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s fruits, many people pass them by in fear of their sugar/carbohydrate content. What many people do not know is that there is a huge difference between naturally occurring sugar found in fruits, dairy, and other foods and added sugars.\n\u003E The primary sugar in fruit is fructose, which some refer to as fruit sugar. Fruits contain water, fiber and other beneficial nutrients, making them an optimal choice to include in a balanced and healthy eating regimen. Purified forms of sugar \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC including table sugar, honey, and high fructose corn syrup \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC consumed as added sugar to soda, candy, and sweetened baked goods should be consumed in moderation. Too much added sugar can contribute to weak bones, obesity, fatigue, lack of concentration and tooth decay.\n\u003E \n\u003E Researchers are learning that Mother Nature put more thought and chemistry into her fruits than just sweetness. Many fruits contain phenols, a form of antioxidants that offers many health benefits including protection from heart disease, cancer, and other damaging effects of free radicals in the body. Added sugars certainly do not provide this benefit. In addition, the benefit seems to be derived from eating the fruit, not a mixture of added sugars and phenols. Read More about Free Radicals\n\nLong story short, if you eat 2-4 pieces of average sized fruit a day you do not have to fear ill health effects, and probably not with quite a bit more fruit either. Of course, as always, mind your teeth and take care of them, as fruit juice tends to be sweet and often acidic.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Never purge. That is the very worst way to lose weight - you eat the food, your body gets all prepared to digest it and store the carbs away, and then you dump it. One of the things the human body does to get ready for food is to produce insulin, which tells the liver it has got to absorb and store all the sugars you eat: when a meal is eaten and then purged, that leaves the liver absorbing sugars that haven\u0027t been eaten, so the \u0022dieter\u0027s\u0022 blood sugar levels crash, making them feel even more hungry.\n\nI find the term purging to be a rather nasty euphemism for throwing up. That is a terrible thing to do. Your stomach acids are actually very powerful and throwing up more than the absolute minimum (illness and/or poisonings) it will quickly hurt your oesophagus, mouth and mostly, your teeth. People that habitually throw up generally have bad teeth, as that kind of acid and basically calcium teeth are a horrible combination.\n\nWe cannot stress enough how much of a bad idea this is. If you habitually do this - please, get help. You are hurting yourself in ways you cannot imagine.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-05T05:19:29Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2015 05:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha**"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T05:16:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t suppose you could run an LC-MS?\n\nI have tried that approach before, but for some reason nobody wants to turn me loose on the expensive lab equipment ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nUnless there\u0027s someone here who works in a lab that has the requisite machine..."},{"CreatedByName":"Cirocco","CreatedById":100285,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T08:19:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I have tried that approach before, but for some reason nobody wants to turn me loose on the expensive lab equipment ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\u003E Unless there\u0027s someone here who works in a lab that has the requisite machine...\n\nif I was still at uni I might have been able to get some time on the liquid chromatography machine, but sadly that\u0027s not an option anymore ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nThat being said: in response to the OP\n\nI would not trust these pills at ALL.

Yes, fruit contains a lot of sugars, so if you eat massive amounts of them, you might still gain weight. However, fruit sugars are not the same as the refined or high fructose corn syrups you will find in processed candy and soft drinks. Your body digests them differently, making them less harmful and is almost impossible to truly eat too much like you easily do with snacks.\n\n\u0027Fruit sugar\u0027 is mostly fructose and glucose.

I am seeing it classified as a health hazard and that it has been used to induce cell death of cancer cells in some studies. What happen if that is taken without cancer cells?\n\nI had a look for alpha-mangostin. It appears that it does indeed induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) when taken orally. As for what happens when you take what is essentially a chemotherapy drug without having any cancer cells.. Well here\u0027s how chemotherapy essentially works (what I am about to write is an oversimplification, but it should get the point across).\n\nChemotherapy is essentially poisoning your own body. Cancer cells are cells that reproduce uncontrollably and therefore require a ton of nutrients and use them very quickly. Chemotherapy basically poisons your body (or an area of the body around the cancer) close to lethal range. Because cancer cells take up more nutrients, they take up more of the poison, pass the lethality threshold and die off (note, even with today\u0027s advanced treatments, that statement is often followed by \u0022we hope\u0022). If you take an agent that induces cell-death without cancer cells, then the cells you have most of will take up most of the agent and die off. If you have a ton of fat cells, you\u0027ll probably lose weight (probably. Depends on the chemical agent. Again, biochemistry is a messy business). But the thing is, while you\u0027re doing this you\u0027re also damaging other tissues. And once you start losing weight and the number of fat tissue drops, you\u0027re going to start killing off more and more other tissues.\n\nbottom line: taking chemotherapy drugs when you don\u0027t have cancer is a very, very bad idea. I would highly suggest you ask your mother to try the diet and yoga exercises without the pills. It might be slower going, but it will be a lot safer.\n\nEDIT: also, about losing a lot of weight quickly: fatty tissues can contain (low) concentrations of chemicals that are bad for your health. Part of the reason for this is that fatty tissues are storage tissues, they store both the good and the bad. If you lose weight at a normal pace, this is absolutely no problem as the hazardous compounds are simply filtered and excreted. But if you lose too much weight too fast, your health can actually suffer because of this. An uncle of mine went though it after having lost a lot of weight quickly due to illness. Best just to take things more slow and steady. It\u0027s healtheir and results last longer.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-05T11:47:31Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2015 11:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cirocco**"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T11:46:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I get a little bit annoyed every time I hear the word extract used in this manner. How the hell do you make an extract of a plant? One can extract a certain compound of it, but not the plant itself.\n\u003E The best example of it would be [this sort of crap](https://longevitypower.com/products/pearl-extract/). Pearl extract? What a devious way to sell chalk at $500 per kg.\n\u003E \n\u003E Tell your mom to stay clear of those weight (mass) loss products and implement better eating habits. It\u0027s a lot better way to reduce body mass by just adjusting the amount of food you eat vs. any (non-approved) pill whose manufacturers spent more time in designing the label than the actual product.\n\nAnnoying at it is, bonafida scientist use this in the current literature, although without clarification of the components (protein, carbohydrate, etc) the probably will end up in the reject pile.\n\nTo extract pearl, take an acid such as hydrochloric acid. \n\nA plant extract simply means grinding the plant and taking the water soluble (or alcohol, or urea, whatever). You can take the pellet and re-extract after treating it with something (for example cellulase). A [Plant] extract is simply all the soluble components either in it original unstable liquid form, or lyophilized to produce a powder extract that has a much longer shelf life (when packed in helium, argon or nitrogen). \n\nI am not going to knock the technique, the single most important step in any purification/characterization routine is the first step (usually the extraction). But its not the end all. Minimally you can filter in a HMWCO filter or run it over a desalting or other gel filtration column. Also, bulk Ion-exchange is very good at plucking one desired component out and leaving the rest behind. \n\nAdding my opinion on the original topic - these herbal remedies - often less herb than you think and not very effective.

How long does those agent like alpha-mangostin stay in the body, usually? Can they be accumulated somehow and cause more harm?\n\nI\u0027ll be honest with you here: I don\u0027t know. I have some knowledge on biology and biochemistry, but I\u0027m no oncology expert. That being said, I can make an educated guess.\n\nEducated guess being as follows:\n\nI\u0027ve had several people in my family suffer from cancer. All of their chemotherapy sessions usually came once every 2 to 3 weeks, and they were always sick for about 3 days to a week after their sessions. so my guess would be that the amount of time these kind of compounds stay in the body can be measured in days to weeks. Give it a month, maybe two to be absolutely sure and it should all be gone.\n\nAs for if they can accumulate and cause more harm: if you keep taking things that induce cell-death and kill off your tissues, it probably will start causing more harm the longer you take it. Partly because of accumulation but also because you\u0027re weakening yourself and then you keep attacking our own weakened body, weakening it further, etc. If you just stop taking the stuff before any real damage is done, you should be okay. Remember, people who take chemotherapy can also fully recover once the therapy is successful. The biggest danger here is that chemotherapy is very carefully monitored and dosed but these diet pills are not. If you take these things without close monitoring, you have no idea what you are doing to your body until it\u0027s too late.\n\nThat being said, the above is pure conjecture and educated guesswork on my part. I have no idea about the long-term effects such things might have, and I\u0027m guessing that lack of knowledge of long-term effects may be one of the reasons why this stuff is not FDA-approved.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-05T13:00:57Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2015 01:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cirocco**"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T15:28:16Z","Content":"I\u0027d never ever take those \u0022omg new exotic plant\u0022 \u0022extracts\u0022.
