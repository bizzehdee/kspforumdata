Not as a mechanism in a comparatively complex bacterium, but free-replicating in organic ooze. However, we don\u0027t see anything like that outside of the lab, despite suitable environments being available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOcam\u0027s razor cuts both ways here. If life on Earth started from a bacterium, then we wouldn\u0027t expect to find a precursor. We would also expect absolutely all life to have a common origin. Abiotic origin would allow for multiple ancestors. Panspermia makes a lot of things a lot simpler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut this is just what makes me lean \u003Cem\u003Eweakly\u003C/em\u003E towards panspermia. What I\u0027d like to see is a lot more research done on Mars, since it\u0027s the only likely origin besides Earth. Even simply knowing more about its formation, and gauging whether it could have been habitable early enough to allow for life to start there, evolve into something complex enough to survive travel, and hitch a ride to Earth in time would be a great start. As you\u0027ve pointed out, it\u0027d need a considerable head start for necessary adaptations. Of course, jackpot would be finding actual life there, confirming common origin, and making sure that it\u0027s not a modern contamination. But that might be too much to hope for.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mazon Del","CreatedById":32991,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T14:08:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReally this is one of the unfortunate side effects of setting up a colony on Mars,. Any bacteria and such that we find there, if it is genetically similar to Earth based versions (as a result of panspermia) run the risk of being discarded for the discovery that they are simply because of the similarity and now the contamination that is certainly going on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"G2-","CreatedById":119367,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T15:16:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a PhD student working on space systems I have to agree that the contamination from a non russian launch sounds much more likely.
