you are going to have a lot of gravitational noise to deal with as well. i presume the amplitude will be a function of mass, but what governs frequency? modulation? amplitude modulation is out (unless mach effects), but maybe you can do frequency modulation? your ability to do gravitational communications is probibly related to your ability to move around black holes at will. being able to manipulate gravity may entail some kind of gravity cloak to cancel out waves, essentially an anti-gravity device, and that means a device that breaks conservation of momentum. i do not think the universe would allow something like that to exist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-02T23:30:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthis how i moslty see this:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nhuman referential scale p=mg\u003Cbr\u003E\nearth referential scale \u00A0p=mg\u003Cbr\u003E\nmilkyway scale p=mg\u003Cbr\u003E\n... etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\nuniverse scale p=mg[\u0026amp; insert another additionnal constant/t variable or disturbance in the force somewhere] (due to distance and celerity this small little complement might have an interest at this scale)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nsorry for pidgin writing 2034 2034 lisa pathfinder\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eedit:\u003C/u\u003E and eventually open some new research fields from this potential fresh new basis wich is also non neglectable imho\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-03T01:49:23Z\u0022 title=\u002201/03/2017 01:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 3, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jonfliesgoats","CreatedById":168077,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-03T13:23:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFiltering:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would imagine there are quieter frequencies out there. \u00A0Celestial, gravitational noise would be all relatively low frequency, right?
