A lot of russian stuff use grid fins, including some real rockets - the N-1 rocket had huge grid fins, and current manned soyuz have grid fins mounted on the fairing - they are deployed in case of abort. UR-700 and UR-900 concepts made use of grid fins too \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne other advantage of grid fins is the low torque needed to control them - allows for much smaller servos than standard steerable fins. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe downside being the increased complexity - as you need to include a reliable way to deploy them \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-19T21:20:56Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2014 09:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by sgt_flyer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T07:07:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd yet another advantage is that they work through a whole lot of flight regimes, including hypersonic regions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this video, below a certain speed, they pivot clockwise and anti-clockwise to induce roll or yaw and pitch.
