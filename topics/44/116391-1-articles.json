Think they also have a couple of submarine missiles but they are smaller and solid fueled and should manage with one pad extra. \n\nProblem might be that the ICBM pads need to be seriously upgraded for handling something like falcon 9. Smaller rockets might use the pads but they would need lots of changes, all satelite launcher uses liquid oxygen for one while ICBM has storable oxidizer."},{"CreatedByName":"fredinno","CreatedById":143381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T10:06:55Z","Content":"They\u0027re converting LC-13 at the Cape into a landing site for landing first stages. No need to built a new facility for that.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nICBM row launch sites were used in the early days of rocketry, when Titans and Atlases were being used as ICBMs. These older rockets needed a dedicated launch facility.

So they could only launch as many rockets as they had pads before they had to recondition the pads, place rockets on them, fuel up, etc. etc.."}]}
