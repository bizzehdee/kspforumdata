I went to a sort of open seminar at MIT (no, I don\u0027t go there) on the basic physics of space and rockets. IT was pretty cool, but coolest was this: the woman teaching it had a huge photocopy of the \u003Cem\u003Eoriginal\u003C/em\u003E blueprint for the Apollo lunar landing engine (might not have been the lander engine, but was certainly planned to be part of the Apollo missions). Even cooler was that it was at a 1:1 scale.

According to Wikipedia, the APS engine was actually derived from the main engine (Bell 8247) used in the Agena upper stage (famously converted into a docking target and orbital maneuvering stage for the Gemini program), with an emphasis on 100% reliability through simplicity (because if it didn\u0027t work, two men would be left on the lunar surface to die).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a result, it was one of the two simplest liquid-fuel rocket engines ever flown (the other being the Service Propulsion System used on the Apollo Service Module, which needed the same reliability--because if it didn\u0027t fire, the crew would be stuck in lunar orbit for all eternity). It was pressure-fed rather than using any form of pump, it relied on gravity feed (if the Descent Propulsion System failed in a way requiring an abort from a free-fall, the RCS thruster quads would be used to provide ullage for startup), it used hypergolic propellants (which were so corrosive that it required a complete rebuild after each firing, so each lunar liftoff was with an engine that had never been tested) that required no ignition system to start the burn, and it had exactly TWO moving parts--one simple ball valve for each propellant, with two positions, open and closed. No throttle, no gimbal, no nothin\u0027.
