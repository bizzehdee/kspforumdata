I\u0027m sorry Mr. Clark, but your article is pure clickbait with no substance. Please try to be more thorough in your research, and less sensational. If your math turns out an unbelievable result, it\u0027s usually best to actually disbelieve it and look for your error instead of taking it for truth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea of using nuclear reactors for space applications isn\u0027t new. And it\u0027s not as simple as you think it is. For example, you conveniently ignore the mass of the radiators required to cool the reactor, which is not trivial - in fact, the majority of the reactor\u0027s output is going to be waste heat. The NTR does not require radiators, because the fuel carries the heat away. If you\u0027re producing power, the heat needs to go somewhere. You did not notice this because you went straight from \u0022the reactor produces heat\u0022 to \u0022I am converting mechanical into electrical energy\u0022. But where does that mechanical energy come from? You forgot the heat engine, the part that converts thermal energy into mechanical energy. And that part is massively inefficient, which causes the huge amount of waste heat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome 15 years ago, NASA construted a test reactor called the SAFE-400 (\u0022Safe Affordable Fission Engine\u0022). It produced just 400 kW of thermal power, and it had a built-in dynamo driven by an equally built-in brayton cycle turbine - the best heat engine that physics knows how to build today. It\u0027s rated electrical output was 100 kW. In other words, 25% of the reactor\u0027s output was usable, and 75% was waste heat. At 520 kg weight, the reactor had a specific power of 192 W/kg... and that is presumably measured without the mass of the radiators required to deal with the 300 kW waste heat, since such a thing was not part of the experiment setup according to photos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpscaling the reactor would yield better mass ratios and increase the specific power. Perhaps a fancy cryocooled generator could further improve things, but probably not by a lot, since a.) that is not where the major losses are in the first place and b.) cryocoolers are heavy and require even more radiators. However, to get anywhere close to your dream of 10 kW/kg, the reactor would need to become 52 times as efficient as it was in NASA\u0027s lab... and then it would need to become even more efficient, because that still ignores the weight of the radiators. Unfortunately I need to tell you: this is not going to happen. Even if the SAFE-400 had absolutely zero losses, it would still only have posted ~770 W/kg. And you are never going to get a lossless conversion. 300 W/kg? Sure, may work on a large-scale reactor. Maybe even 500 W/kg in the future, if such reactors were being actively developed, which they are not. 10-100 kW/kg? Not today, not ever, not with nuclear fission.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-29T19:14:52Z\u0022 title=\u002208/29/2015 07:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theend3r","CreatedById":97560,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T19:04:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Thomassino\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Thomassino\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENuclear-powered VASIMR won\u0027t be tested in space anytime soon IMHO, because some people are not comfortable with putting nuclear devices into space (they can hardly stand RTGs).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich is quite sad as according to published papers, nuclear energy is by far the safest source of energy, even more so than hydro or solar.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T19:44:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022theend3r\u0022 data-cite=\u0022theend3r\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhich is quite sad as according to published papers, nuclear energy is by far the safest source of energy, even more so than hydro or solar.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are talking about space applications here.

A meltdown anywhere beyond LEO isn\u0027t going to be much of a concern. Alright, so it\u0027s leaking radiation. Who on Earth has any reason to worry about it? Obviously it\u0027s bad for anyone riding the engine, but comeon. It\u0027s in deep space. Everyone needs to quit worrying about a repeat of Chernobyl.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dint said nothing about space, I just disagree with tater\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s stadistics and I comment than this topic was not about that, the same than Nibb31.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs many said, If you need to produce a lot of power in space, you need to take into account all the extra mass you need to radiate waste heat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you need to keep your crew far from the reactor.

None.
