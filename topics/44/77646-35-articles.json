The convenience of using these internally is that they are constant for orbit around perfectly spherical mass with no other forces present. And when other forces are acting on the satellite, I only have to account for these in computations, dramatically reducing any errors. There will be methods available to set and grab current values for all of these.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, I\u0027ll have methods for setting (when appropriate) or getting some of the related quantities.

What\u0027s irrelevant within simulation, and with which I will certainly not bother for now, are things like orientation of the reference plane and reference direction. For geocentric orbits, reference plane is just equatorial plane, so that part\u0027s easy. But reference direction is the first point of Aries, which moves with respect to Earth\u0027s surface.
