This is typically either moving the nozzle or entire motor on a mechanical pivot (the former being what happens in KSP), but there are a few other methods - a good example being a Japanese system which introduces water into part of the exhaust, which cools it and reduces the thrust in that area, effectively altering direction of net thrust for the motor. As for rotation control, if you have more than one engine then this is easily achieved with thrust vectoring again - simply gimbal the nozzles/motors on opposing sides in opposite directions, if only one engine though then you\u0027d probably be wanting fins, or RCS for upper stages.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T23:34:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr you design the rocket so that it doesn\u0027t tend to roll, and you accept what roll occurs anyway.

There are two important points on a rocket with regards to (static, and without gimballing engines) stability. One is the center of mass, which we should all be quite familiar with as the point where the rocket balances. The second is called the center of pressure or lift, depending on weather you are dealing with rockets or aircraft. This one is a bit more difficult to explain, and pretty darn hard to find, but it\u0027s essentially the point where all the aerodynamic forces balance. You want this point to be behind the center of mass, because effectively this is where any aerodynamic force will be applied, and the aerodynamic forces you discussed in your post will only make the rocket point the correct direction if the center of pressure is far enough back. This point is manipulated by changing the shape of the nose of your rocket, or much more so by manipulating the shape and locations of fins. This is why model rockets always have large fins at the back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost modern rockets designed to go into space will use thrust vectoring, which completely ignores all of the above, though the less stable a rocket is, the harder it is for the vectoring to compensate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anizer","CreatedById":75841,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-20T01:28:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo how did they accomplish this before computers?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-20T01:30:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey didn\u0027t-the earliest space launches used electromechnical analogue computers.
