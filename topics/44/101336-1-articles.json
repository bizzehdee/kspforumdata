SLS and Orion are just the first step, the pieces needed in their plan to get there (and back) are much bigger and AFAIK - no budget for them."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Fang","CreatedById":108403,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T02:33:21Z","Content":"Nice of you t o start this topic, as I have been reviewing Zubrin\u0027s speeches for the past couple of days. Too bad I have not been able to a hold of his books by now. I\u0027ll see to remedy that asap. Meanwhile, here are my opinions on Mars Direct:\n\n Mars Direct sounds as a solid plan, better than most, semi direct more so, regarding safety. There are some hurdles along the way. \n\n1. Unfortunately, it seems it is to late for quick and dirty development of an STS derived vehicle, suc as [Jupiter of the DIRECT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIRECT) proposal, so we are probably stuck with SLS and/or something new, and hopefully cheaper. Up to two or three docking launches might be acceptable: one for Earth departure stage, one for trans-Martian habitat and Mars orbit insertion stage and the third just for the crew. With a bigger launch vehicle, you might get all that launched on one really superheavy launch vehicle such as an SLS BlockII was planed.. (not sure if they still have Block II in the foreseeable future). \n\n2. Sabateur converter has not been tested in Martian atmosphere. It should require a dedicated robotic mission to be done. The part I am most concerned about is supplying enough empty tanks to the converter as well as landing a large volume of liquid hydrogen without rupturing the tank. ~8 tons or about 85 cubic meters! Alternative is an automated system for extracting water from Mars surface and supplying it to the converter which will extract H2 and O2 from it.\n\n3. The mission design calls for a 50-100 kW reactor that should work in Martian atmosphere. AFAIK we do not have a working design for such a machine. OTOH, even with a 25kWe reactor on Mars the mission should be doable, while a smaller design, such as a modified Topaz II with a decent turbine or a Stirling engine might work for a prototype. I do not know enough thermodynamics to judge whether cooling at such low atmospheric pressure should pose a significant problem. \n\n4. The heaviest payload that we have landed on Mars is ~1 ton. How do we land a 20t habitat and a huge Mars Return Vehicle in the same weight class but with a huge volume and height? There might be some significant challenges to developing a heat shield and parachutes for that. There might be some merit in propulsive landing. \n\n5. Radiation. That is a big scarecrow, or as Zubrin would say: \u0022a dragon to be slayed\u0022. We do not need much more than several long term missions beyond the Van Allen belts to prove and IMPROVE our knowledge about radiation shielding both from cosmic rays and solar flares. \n\n6. Life support. We need high efficiency to keep the mission weight down. That is especially important for O2 and H2O. Food should not be an issue as it is routinely packed to high nutrition/weight ratio. \n\n7. Doublecheck everything to see if that fits into mass limits of a 20-30ton landing habitat and MAV. \n\n8. Methane engines. No, seriously, liquid methane engines have never been in serial production, so if you want them to be reliable, \n\nOther challenges include selection and development of rovers, making a choice of Habitat\u002BRover or just a bigass rover, (re)development of NERVas, choice of fuel for EDS depending on the mission architecture (any docking/orbital assembly operation will most certainly be better done with hypergorlics, and a single launch mission would be doable with hydrolox. There is a big mass penalty for hypergorlics. ); building a global survey and navigation network, testing a tether system for artificial gravity to confirm mass and reliability etc. Oh, and one more problem: wee need vehicles with long term storage capability in space. \n\nTo sum it up, you need several precursor missions:\n\n1 or 2 - sabateur converter, tanks and reactor test on mars. \n\n2 - Mars landing mission with heavy, bulky payloads\n\nMethane engine testing and development, HLV, and a small station in high Earth orbit with several crews staying up for 6-24 months at a time. \n\nI am certain that all that should be doable within a decade provided sufficient motivation and financing. HLV might be a problem that could only be solved in a CCDEV way. The thing that scares me if the Mars Direct program gets of the ground is becoming to expensive not to be shutting down the program before committing to colonization, the way Apollo got cut.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-06T02:44:00Z\u0022 title=\u002203/06/2015 02:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Red Fang**\n  \nmy spelling was a crime."},{"CreatedByName":"FishInferno","CreatedById":106219,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T02:47:18Z","Content":"\u003E What\u0027s the BFR/MCT?\n\nBRF is Big Fat/Freaking Rocket.

Life support techniques, radiation shielding, ISRU, power production, dust mitigation and decontamination, partial gravity... These are all things that are common to Mars and the Moon, and are much easier to study 3 days from Earth than 6 months every 2 years.\n\nPeople are often tricked by pictures from Mars that make it look a lot like New Mexico or the Australian Outback. They see it as a desert that shares similarities with our own deserts. The colors make it look warm and hospitable. In reality, it is freezingly cold, the atmosphere is for all intents and purposes inexistant and the soil is sterile with no organic matter or minerals that can support vegetation. It has a lot more in common with the Moon than with Earth.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E Another thing is the issue of colonization.

Beyond the PR, SpaceX is only going to Mars if somebody (NASA) hires them to. BFR/Raptor \u0022development\u0022 is only to demonstrate that they can cater to the HLV market when SLS is cancelled. \n\nThere is no market for regular Mars trips, nor will there ever be one any time soon.

Colonization is a silly science-fiction induced pipe dream that SpaceX uses for PR purposes, and I really wish people would put a little more thought into it before drinking the Kool Aid.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This is the video of the first public presentation of **Mars Direct**. This is significant, because this was filmed during the era of VHS tapes! ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif) The idea that crewed missions to Mars need to be delayed until far future sci-fi technologies are available, or require prohibitive spending on space infrastructure, is nonsense! This isn\u0027t just some daft idea from a deluded dreamer, this mission plan has been adopted by NASA as their Design Reference Mission as their plan to get to Mars. Robert Zubrin can explain this far better than I can!\n\nIt is a vast simplification to say that the technologies required for Mars Direct are available. There is a difference between \u0022theoretical\u0022 and \u0022operational\u0022, which is why NASA uses a scale called the Technology Readiness Level to rate various technologies. \n\n![NASA_TRL_Meter.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/NASA_TRL_Meter.jpg)\n\nSystems like SLS or Orion are at TRL8. You need TRL9 before risking human lives on it. \n\nTechnologies such as ISRU, which Zubrin\u0027s mission relies on, are around TRL3, which means that there is a long way to go before they can be deployed in mission-critical roles with no redundancy. It will take at least a decade or two at current funding levels to reach TRL9. Nobody is going to Mars with operational ISRU in a life depending role before then.\n\nAnd again, if we wanted to, we could develop the technology. It would be an enormous expense, but then so were Apollo or the Manhattan Project. The question is \u0022why?\u0022. \u0022Because we can\u0022 is a not a good enough answer when you have to convince millions of taxpayers. Heck, many taxpayers don\u0027t even want to pay for schools or hospitals, why would they pay for flags and footprints on another planet? They will pay for entertainment, but Hollywood produces better entertainment for cheaper. \n\nAmerica had reasons for Apollo or the Manhattan Project. It was at war (hot or cold). There is no reason today to launch such a huge effort to go to Mars.\n\nAs for the idea of a colony, that is totally premature. Take the ISS. It\u0027s Humanity\u0027s effort to keep 7 humans alive in space. It took a huge effort and decades of international cooperation to build, yet it needs regular maintenance and logistics flight just to keep those 7 people alive. To make a self-sufficient colony, you would need thousands of people, something on the scale of 150 times the effort that was needed to build the ISS. And you need the resources to fling all that infrastructure not just to 400km above us, but to another freaking planet.\n\nAnd who is going to pay for a self-sufficient colony on Mars ?\n\n- Elon Musk ? Even his pockets aren\u0027t that deep. \n\n- The colonists ? Only the Uber-rich could afford a ticket. But uber-rich people don\u0027t like to get their hands dirty and won\u0027t give up their lifestyle to spend the rest of their life in a glorified Airstream trailer.\n\n- Governments ? Why would they fund a colony that is bound to either become economically independant and turn its back on them if it succeeds, or become a liability that is going to cost billions just to keep the people alive if it fails. There is no winning scenario.\n\nNo, colonies are stupid. The best we can hope for is a science outpost, but even that is a stretch. There simply isn\u0027t much science that can be done in a limited science outpost that can\u0027t be done for much cheaper, over a much broader area, and over a much longer time, with robots. The only science that you can only get from sending people to live on Mars is to learn how to send people to live on Mars, which is a bit too circular to be a proper justification.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-07T00:16:58Z\u0022 title=\u002203/07/2015 12:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31**"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T09:56:58Z","Content":"Hey, Marts Direct! It was interestign to see the VHS video of its first presentation. Really puts into perspective how old this plan is!\n\nAnyhow, I\u0027ve always liked it, but with a big grain of salt. Basically, Zubrin\u0027s margin are so razor-tight, and his mass assumptions so optimistic, that I seriously doubt it is realistic. With a bigger booster and doubling most mass figures? Maybe. I still think the ERV to return to Earth is going to be a *very* tight space to spend month on the way back.\n\nIn any case, I think it\u0027s biggest merit is to show that you don\u0027t really need a \u0022Battlestar Gallactica\u0022 approach, with thousands of tonnes launched to LEO in order to get going. Basically, what you really need is the capability to put 20-50mT payloads on a Mars-bound trajectory, and preposition supplies every launch window. In fact, the thing I like the most about it is that is form a true exploration campaign, with a cadence of regular missions that increase the amount of hardware on the ground every two years.\n\nNow, how would I do it? Well, I would launch bigger payloads for starters. A standard of 100mT would probably do, I think you can put in there either a Hab \u002B lander, or a surface hab \u002B ISRU unit (to produce fuel for ascent, that would prove itself before a crewed mission leaves of course). Capturing into a highly elliptical orbit on Mars, delta-v requirements for the orbit-orbit leg of the mission are reasonable, going down to Mars from there is only a matter of using the atmosphere to slow you down, and going back up you can use locally produced fuel. That way you absolutely slash the total delta-v budget for the trip, and still each leg of the trip is within the realm of what a single-stage reusable vehicle could do. Ok, maybe the Earth-Mars leg asks for nukes, but if you make your departure from L2, even chemical engines should be able to do it in a single stage. In any case, even disposable chemical transfer stages would do. You have to launch twice as many? Great, more business to lower the price per kg to low earth orbit... *and it will still be cheaper than developing the monster rocket that can do the mission in less launches*. That is a mighty important point, imagine the mass that could have been lofted to LEO for what SLS has eaten to date.\n\nThat way the whole infrastructure is reusable, and all you have to do to keep on going with the missions is to lift up new payloads and fuel each time to your initial staging point.... with a variety of rockets allowing international cooperation to share the costs. And minimal development costs, mostly for the Mars-dedicated hardwre. Also, note that you can prove the whole orbital thing with a flight to Mars orbit (or an asteroid) before you develop the surface elements.\n\nWhat NASA should do if they were serious about going to Mars is to develop the long-stay interplanetary Habs that they need to make the trip, and the transfer stages to push them around. Instead, they are following the incredibly expensive ion route, that even in the best of cases won\u0027t really solve anything (ion engines don\u0027t cut the travel time because their thrust is tiny, and they don\u0027t really cut weight either because their powerplants are huge, the only thing that they do well for human spaceflight is to burn a lot of money). If they really wanted to develop the engine that would open the solar system to humans, they would be working of nuclear engines: high isp, high thrust propulsion that allow single stages to... anywhere? It can certainly allows a round trip to Mars in a single stage. In any case, for Mars you don\u0027t really need either, the delta-v budget is really not much over what a lunar flight entails.\n\nAs to the \u0022dragons\u0022 along the way (i.e: radiation and microgravity), there I completely concur with Zubrin: they have been blown completely out of proportion, and are not really show-stoppers... unless you want political justifications to not go. Landing big payloads on Mars is bit of a tougher nut to crack, but F9 actually shows that supersonic retro-propulsion is not an impossible technology.\n\nThe point is to start building the things you really need, if you want to do this. An ISRU demonstrator, use it for a sample return mission. Big transfer stages, test them by launching a probe to the outer solar system faster than it could have gotten there otherwise (extra points if you recover it by slowing it down after it accelerates and releases the payload). Long duration habitats, initially test them in LEO where rescue is immediate, then move to cislunar space, then out to NEOs, doing awesome crewed missions with a decent science component along the way.\n\nThose are the things NASA would be doing, if they where seriously thinking about gong to Mars. And they don\u0027t even need a much bigger budget that what developing SLS and ORION takes right now.\n\nRune. Of course, NASA is a political entity controlled by Congress, you have to take everything they say as such."},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T10:14:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Basically, what you really need is the capability to put 20-50mT payloads on a Mars-bound trajectory, and preposition supplies every launch window.

Mars has a surface area of 144,798,500 km2 and you are advocating sending regular missions to explore the same area over and over again.

But if you do, it would be a hell of way to build the infrastucture to, say, support a dedicated rocket hopper to explore the whole panet in suborbital hops, refuelled from the central base.

But that takes a huge investment.\n\nWait, is that 50 *mega* tons? Isn\u0027t 50 gigagrams or something? Man that is huge... \n\nThere are a lot of ways to go about doing a lot of things. Do you mean using a bunch of smaller transfer stages strapped together to act as a big one?\n\nAnd here\u0027s another thing: Why is payload per launch so important? I mean, for the cost of one SLS launch you could launch almost the same payload with other launch vehicles, all in one year. So, maybe payload per year is better? In that case, SLS would be about 70 tonnes/yr, (the average person eats about that much mass of food in his/her whole lifetime, woah!). If we used the average estimates for SLS launch costs, or about 2.75 billion US dollars per launch (wikipedia data), and assuming one launch per year at 70 tonnes per launch... Then you could launch about 7 DIVHs for that cost. That\u0027s 201 tonnes/yr! Of course, this is dependent on future data, which we don\u0027t have. And I doubt the DIVH facilities are able to handle that much use. But what if the money used for developing SLS was used instead to allow the much more economical option of revamping the logistics to allow for almost 7 DIVH launches per year? We would be on Mars in a decade, by my estimate."}]}
