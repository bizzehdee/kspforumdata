Like using its oceans, you could always just fly in the water from Kerbin.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a given, there\u0027s only a few things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaythe is trapped in Jool\u0027s radiation zone, meaning you\u0027re adding some lead onto the base. Say this lead is 15cm applique to the surface of the module you\u0027re thinking of. This dictates the lead weight wL as being surface area in m\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 * 0.15 * 11.34. So if I had a 1 m\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 tile of protective cover, it would weigh 100x100x15x11.34, or 1,701,000 grams. Thats nearly 2 tons of radiation shielding per m\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 of surface area! Hence you take the surface area m\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 * 1,701 to yield your lead weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaythe has oxygen in its atmosphere, this can be utilized through deionization and radiation filtering, at massive electrical costs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaythe has water in its oceans (presumably, considering the oxygen). Through similar treatment, this water could be harnessed to supply the Kerbals. It still costs megawatts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo increase self-sufficiency, one could bring plants. These would require (based on distance) the plants to have x5.2 more leaf surface area, to function like on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaythe has relatively little land, requiring precision piloting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing these factors, out of pure curiosity, I designed my own base, but I want to compare it to other bases (using lots of lead, once my math was checked \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAfter mathematical correction of weight, it appears as if I can ditch this thought process for good and buy an excavator.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe base consists of multiple buildings:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Living Quarters (x2 lead protection). This houses 30 Kerbs in a cylindrical building. Using the Hitchhiker as my source data to base off of: 2x2x2 (cube-ified) for 4 Kerbals. Hence 8 to 4 as x to 30. x is 60. This means 1 Kerbal requires 2 m\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B3 of space to live in. Considering the Hitchhikers surface area, 56.3 m\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2, all I need to do is take this times 7.5, as total surface area doesn\u0027t change, despite changes to r and h. This gives me 422,25 m\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 of surface area to cover, hence 717,825 kilograms or 717.83 tons of lead. I only elaborated on the additional weight here to stress how much of a factor it is. The hitchhiker doesn\u0027t have much weight to stand up to this colossus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUtility Building Alpha. This is the storage building for processed water and air, as well as reprocessing of waste water and atmosphere. It is not accessible, however still requires protection to keep the water and air at acceptable radiation levels. Lets say its outside is a duplicate of the Kerbal Living Quarters, giving 717 tons of protection. \u003Cem\u003EThis time, the lead mass is substantially lower because of the increased dry weight. Lets make the UBA (which has 188.5 m\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B3 of volume) weigh 4 tons before lead application. This makes the percentage of lead drop to 14.8% of its total dry weight.\u003C/em\u003EOr, in adjusted weight, it still doesn\u0027t compare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUtility Building Beta. This is the acquisition facility. It produces breathable air and drinkable water, at the cost of lots of tower. Lets twin this building to the UBA, but inverse its radius and height, making this one a bit flatter than the other two. \u003Cem\u003EIt retains its 188.3 m\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B3 of volume, however at 10 tons dry mass, to facilitate all of the processing equipment. Using extendable/deployable air ducts and water pipes, its surface area is increased substantially, by (say arbitrarily) 15%. This yields 717*1.15 or 824,55 kg of lead. This is just 8.25% of the total dry mass now.\u003C/em\u003EStill doesn\u0027t compare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience House. As the name says, this is where science occurs. Given its duties, it has lots of interior space for Kerbals, reducing dry weight. In addition to this, the atmosphere of Laythe is analyzed here with a spectrometer and Jool\u0027s atmospheric behavior with a telescope. This means more lead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPower House. I choose to use a nuclear reactor for this, which is basically 110% lead anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe goal behind my thread here is a study of initial dry mass launched to Laythe, and then following supplements of Food or return-capsules.
