Also, you don\u0027t take sea ice cores, which mean north ones are actually greenland than north pole.\n\nIt is my understanding that those graphs are only VOSTOK which is antarctic. Greenland cores would be fine too. I\u0027m mostly interested to see if northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere warm up and cool down in phase or out of phase. If it is in phase, then TSI or greenhouse effect could be the cause (but not Milankovich cycles); If it is out of phase, than Milankovich cycles can be the cause (but not TSI or greenhouse)."},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T08:16:43Z","Content":"I found one here, including some temperate region glaciers: [http://www.climatedata.info/Proxy/Proxy/icecores.html](http://www.climatedata.info/Proxy/Proxy/icecores.html)\n\nMind that, whatever the reason were, it\u0027s quite hot nowadays ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nRaw data should be available also, probably at NOAA or so."},{"CreatedByName":"arkie87","CreatedById":103434,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T14:00:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I found one here, including some temperate region glaciers: [http://www.climatedata.info/Proxy/Proxy/icecores.html](http://www.climatedata.info/Proxy/Proxy/icecores.html)\n\u003E Mind that, whatever the reason were, it\u0027s quite hot nowadays ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E Raw data should be available also, probably at NOAA or so.\n\nThanks! \n\n![07-Temperature---Vostok-and-GISP2.gif](http://www.climatedata.info/resources/Proxies/Ice-Cores/07-Temperature---Vostok-and-GISP2.gif)\n\nIt\u0027s a bit hard to tell if they are in sync or not.
