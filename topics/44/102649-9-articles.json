Which is physically impossible-- the treadmill can\u0027t do that, because the plane moves forward.  A self-contradictory definition isn\u0027t a real definition, and a problem statement that involves physical infinities isn\u0027t a real problem.\n\nYou might as well say:  \u0022The treadmill moves so fast that chocolate chip cookies rain from the sky.  Can the plane take off?\u0022  And then get into arguments about whether engines can survive having cookies sucked through them.  It\u0027s a word-play, not an actual physical question.\n\nIn terms of *\u003Cu\u003Ephysical reality\u003C/u\u003E*, nothing that the treadmill does can affect the plane\u0027s motion in any significant way, and trying to word the question to *\u003Cu\u003Emake\u003C/u\u003E* it matter simply invalidates the question.\n\nOf course, if we say \u0022but we\u0027re just making up a misleading linguistic conundrum and nothing here has anything to do with physical reality\u0022, then sure, we can say anything we want about what will happen because it\u0027s just flapping our gums.
