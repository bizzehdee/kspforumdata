Yeah, you\u0027d be dead.\n\nYou are thinking of Universal Constructor (UC) teleportation. The UC disassembles you at source and reassembles you at destination. StarTrek employs UC teleportation, which is heavily exploited throughout the series. This is definitely one of these, \u0022I\u0027d rather walk,\u0022 scenarios.\n\n Quantum Teleportation involves actually transporting matter state. It fundamentally precludes existence of copies. Your state is transferred whole from source matter to destination matter. By every sensible definition of teleportation, including these involving locality limits, QT is actually non-lethal.\n\nUnfortunately, QT has some very severe limitations which mean that we almost certainly never will have practical QT for macroscopic objects. The list of problems is lengthy and technical, so I won\u0027t get into details unless someone challenges this, but serious, QT isn\u0027t happening. That\u0027s not to say that it\u0027s useless, because there are a whole bunch of quantum information applications for QT.\n\nThe only type of teleport system that\u0027s both feasible in some distant future and that I\u0027d consider a \u0022safe way to travel,\u0022 in that you actually travel rather than being killed and cloned, is similar to what\u0027s used in Stargate franchise. They have a lot of technobabble around it, but the ghist of it is that rather than being disassembled whole, you step through an surface where you are converted into a digital form. The digital space is fully simulated until you are fully within. In the series, they refer to it as the buffer. What that means is that if you are standing half way through the portal, half of you keeps existing in the physical form, and half of you is simulated within the buffer, still allowing connection between neurons, blood flow, etc. So in effect, there is never a point where you are copied whole, but rather there is a gradual transition preserving continuity. That is, until you are fully within the buffer. At that point, your simulation is paused, and data is copied from source gate to destination gate. At the destination end, the reverse process takes place.\n\nThere is an additional bit within the canon about both matter and data for reconstruction being sent along a wormhole formed between two gates, but that\u0027s not particularly relevant. The above scheme is the only practical UC-type teleportation that I\u0027d find acceptable. In addition, the fact that the interface between physical world and the buffer is 2D, it actually makes the conversion process feasible without having to resort to something like freezing the subject. All in all, the only practical teleporter I am aware of that doesn\u0027t kill the subject."},{"CreatedByName":"baggers","CreatedById":143067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T05:29:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Quantum teleportation as depicted in most sci-fi IPs seems to involve atomic disintegration.
