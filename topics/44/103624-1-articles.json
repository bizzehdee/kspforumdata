A dog is sentient. A *tapeworm* is sentient even, though certainly less so than a dog. Supposedly even some single-celled organisms have shown signs of sensing the environment and acting in self-preservation. This is all varying levels of sentience. *There are literally millions of sentient species on planet Earth.* Yet over and over again, you see science fiction authors calling intelligent aliens \u0022sentient aliens\u0022 and intelligent computers \u0022sentient computers\u0022. Where in the heck did this come from?! Don\u0027t they know their English? If I was an alien, I\u0027d be insulted to be compared to nothing but a mouse or a tapeworm ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nThe proper word for intelligence is *sapience*, which means the ability to reason- i.e., the possession of intelligence. Where the cutoff between sapience and non-sapience lies, however, is not as well defined.\n\nSome people contend- sometimes with some arrogance, in my opinion- that humans are the only sapient species on Earth. This does make sense to some degree, because we are the most intelligent, we are the only ones to use \u0022high\u0022 technology, have a complex language, etc. However, if we define sapience this way, then there\u0027s no reason a more intelligent alien race (or, more likely, a machine intelligence we create ourselves) could come along and tell us that we are not sapient, and that only it and beings more intelligent than it are sapient. \n\nPersonally, I\u0027d prefer to define the minimum level of sapience to be based off of some measure of intelligence that requires sub-human sapience (such as self-awareness). This would help finally give intelligent non-humans the respect and protection they deserve (i.e., force Japan to stop the torture and murder of dolphins), and set up an important precedent whereby, if we ever encounter or create our intellectual superiors, the moral precedent exists for them to respect *our* rights as sapient beings. Of course, that doesn\u0027t mean that they would, but it might help to have the moral high ground. Otherwise, if we had defined sapient beings as simply being the smartest things around, how could we rightfully object to being slaughtered or otherwise repressed? So I think it\u0027s important to set up a fuzzy boundary (pun intended ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)) between human rights and animal rights. But I\u0027m starting to seriously digress from the definition of \u0022sapience\u0022.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-07T19:24:13Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2015 07:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|**"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T19:27:25Z","Content":"I think the writers using \u0022sentient\u0022 for \u0022sentient AI\u0022 is correct though, because it is not so much about the computer gaining intelligence, but gaining self-awareness and emotion."},{"CreatedByName":"-Velocity-","CreatedById":74097,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T19:38:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I think the writers using \u0022sentient\u0022 for \u0022sentient AI\u0022 is correct though, because it is not so much about the computer gaining intelligence, but gaining self-awareness and emotion.\n\nI disagree, because it is quite possible to imagine (and demonstrate) a computer that can feel but is not sapient. For example, your computer already responds to stimuli. You strike a key, and it responds. It sends out a ping to a website and sends data back and forth.

Sentience is not something you either have or don\u0027t have- it\u0027s a spectrum. Every higher animal- say, vertebrates- will have a reasonably high level of sentience. Software on our computers can already be very minimally sentient. As I said before, a tapeworm or protozoa may have minimal levels of sentience (which certain software has probably already exceeded). This idea of a continuum of sentience has been around for decades, here\u0027s one variation on the idea- [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience_quotient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience_quotient) \n\nIt can be useful to define a certain cutoff limit between sentience and non-sentience, and this is commonly assumed though people may not realize it- because too broadly defined, even a rock could be considered to have some near infinitesimal amount of sentience. Basically, like sapience, there is a problem of where to draw the line between sentience and non-sentience. If we want to draw the line at levels of sentience experienced by say, vertebrates, then there might not yet be a piece of software that is sentient.\n\nIt *might* be possible to create, for example, a superintelligent being that has abnormally low levels of sentience- a sort of \u0022philosophical zombie\u0022- [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie) Personally, I am skeptical such a thing is possible- but if it were, as I said, I\u0027d rather be a highly sentient being with lower sapience that a being with almost no sentience as compared to its level of high sapience.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-07T22:40:35Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2015 10:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|**"},{"CreatedByName":"dog23","CreatedById":171405,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-10T13:52:22Z","Content":"would an \u0022actor\u0022 be considered as a sentient when he/she plays a role that he which he/she was assigned? how do we know whether the sentient is \u0022inside\u0022 the actor?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 2015-04-07 at 3:52 PM, -Velocity- said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E All in all, I\u0027d rather be a feeling, dumb being than an unfeeling super-intelligence.\n\u003E \n\nthere are many dumb people although they think about themselves as caring etc. How does anyone know whether someone else is an \u0022actor\u0022 who mimic feelings or whether he/she/it is a true feeler?"},{"CreatedByName":"78stonewobble","CreatedById":97559,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-10T15:13:27Z","Content":"Well, when you put it like that...
