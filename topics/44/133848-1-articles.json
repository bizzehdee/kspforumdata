Now having watched the video, that is certainly impressive, and it\u0027s certainly the incompressibility of water that breaks the glass. It\u0027s interesting to note that he didn\u0027t get the boom until he heated the salt well past the meltng point. He also didn\u0027t get a boom from the other ionic liquids he tried, but I wonder if he had also super-heated those. Finally, he decides the boom was from a physical reaction, not a chemical reaction, by testing the pH before and after and finding it still neutral. I have to wonder if he used super-heated salt for the pH experiment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-10T15:36:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222449339\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022133848\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221457541547\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002258254\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tex_NL\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n22 hours ago, Tex_NL said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want a BIG boom you throw a cup of water in a pot of boiling oil over an open flame.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis one time\u00A0(resist urge to say \u0022at band camp\u0022 - failed) I accidentally lowered a basket of dripping wet french fries into hot lard, which generated a cloud of oil droplets, which then flashed into a fireball when the cloud reached the burner. mpressively scary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
