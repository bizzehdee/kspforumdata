This may not sound like much, but it corresponds to 20 kbars of hydrogen and helium, 20\u00D7 higher than the pressure at the bottom of the Marianias Trench. Moreover, the temperature at the bottom of such an envelope would be 3000 K, even for ages of several Gyr. We believe that such a planet is more properly classified as a sub-Neptune. As a result, 2.0 R is more of a quite hard upper limit for the size of a envelope-free super-Earth and most of the planets between 1.75 and 2.0 R are likely to be H/He rich sub-Neptunes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Assessing the impact of thermodynamics for the case of Kepler 11b is more difficult, because the expected steam envelope is not modeled.

On one hand, the large temperature variations and possible evidence of volcanic ash blocking emissions suggests a relatively\u00A0thin atmosphere. On the other hand, spectral evidence suggests a hydrogen/helium atmosphere. On one hand, the planet is\u00A08.63x as massive as Earth, so it could have gathered a H2/He envelope. On the other hand, it is on an extreme torch orbit, worse than Kepler 10b and Corot-7b, which have practically no atmosphere, according to transit data. Yet this one has, yet no H2O was detected (while for a Neptune like planet it is the major component), drastic temperature variations, possible volcanism... yet it apparently retained some light gases. The radius is 2x of Earth, mass 8.63x of Earth, so it is much denser that the 5 ME/2 Earth radius hypothetical \u0022borderline\u0022 planet. That would suggest it has a hydrogen atmosphere, but one with a lower surface pressure than 2 GPa. Basically, what I am saying is that some exoplanets might have hydrogen/helium atmospheres that have high pressures, but have not retained the extensive hydrogen envelopes like Neptune or Jupiter. I think planets like this might be frequent in torch orbits, as the gravity holds SOME of the light gases, but not everything. The result might be an unholy Venus/Neptune hybrid with features common to both ice giants and terrestrials.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut this does not end, apparently, some planets managed to grow to Neptune like masses while being so dense that they are clearly fully terrestrial and free of any H/He envelope:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-06/hcfa-afa053014.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-06/hcfa-afa053014.php\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAstronomers announced today that they have discovered a new type of planet - a rocky world weighing 17 times as much as Earth.
