Specifically the Aerospike. I have always loved it but felt that it was a bit off. specifically the inability to have it for higher stages. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpon a few hours of reading and digging i had come up with a few different models for the Aerospike and a limited understanding of the basic mechanics behind it. No the main project that i was able to dig up was the XRS-2200. It was designated for the X-33 SSTO. it produced 909,300 N of force with an ISP of 339 s at sea level and 1,184,300 N thrust with an ISP of 437 in vacuum. Now if the information that i have dug up is correct the Liner Aerospike Engine (XRS-2200) is modeled with the J2-X parts and some of it\u0027s tech. The reason i bring up the J2-X is that i have been catigorically unsuccessful in finding a weight for the XRS-2200. What i did find is that the J2-X is 5,450 pounds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eone could surmise that the \u0022Mainsail\u0022 in KSP is modeled after this J2-X, were as the Teroidal Aerospike is probably modeled after Rocketdyne\u0027s J-2T-250k.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif i were to surmise a weight for the XRS-2200 i would guess it probably sits at 5,900 - 6,500 Pounds. due to i t being crated in the late 90\u0027s i would guess it\u0027s the latter at 6,500 pounds, however since then obviously technology for metals and cooling have come leaps and bounds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if i were to model this in KSP i would probably give the Liner Aerospike Engine something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Emass = 3.5\u003Cbr\u003Ecost = 3700\u003Cbr\u003EdragModelType = default\u003Cbr\u003Emaximum_drag = 0.2\u003Cbr\u003Eminimum_drag = 0.2\u003Cbr\u003EangularDrag = 2\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EattachRules = 1,0,1,1,0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EMODULE\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\tname = ModuleEngines\u003Cbr\u003E\tthrustVectorTransformName = thrustTransform\u003Cbr\u003E\texhaustDamage = True\u003Cbr\u003E\tignitionThreshold = 0.1\u003Cbr\u003E\tminThrust = 0\u003Cbr\u003E\tmaxThrust = 1100\u003Cbr\u003E\theatProduction = 625\u003Cbr\u003E        maxTemp = 4200\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\tatmosphereCurve\u003Cbr\u003E \t{\u003Cbr\u003E   \t key = 0 440\u003Cbr\u003E  \t key = 1 360\u003Cbr\u003E \t}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esome numbers in the above \u0022code\u0022 is spitballed. i\u0027d like to also use a velocityCurve if i can figure it out to model the velocity as well. but will probably not want to deal with that until ksp evolves a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-01T01:13:45Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2013 01:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Ignamious\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded [Flight] Prefix\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
