According to what I found on the internet (real reliable, I know) a 2L soda bottle can survive 11.6atm of pressure. What I think you may be able to do is to place a few trimmings of fresh cut grass (since the individual cells are still living) and use them to recycle some of the CO2 in it (although CO2 won\u0027t be that large if an issue.) Next, wrap it with a few heater elements. These can be as simple as a 9v battery and some resistors. As far as any radiation, wrap a few bags of water around it. I know water is dense enough to block some radiation (although you may want to wrap the heating element in some tubing to prevent any stray wires from puncturing the bags.)

It should touch water until it is soaked through, but not leaking, and there is no more air between water and cotton.

Put the ants in the fridge for a hour or two - it should make them lethargic, so you can relocate them to the vials without trouble. Warning! Don\u0027t freeze them, just cool a bit.
