We estimated that this rocket - including GSE, ground station electronics, custom fabricated test stands, test equipment - will cost us upwards of $60k. The engine itself would cost $15k to 3D print out of Inconel 716. It would be 3D printed because drilling extremely long and thin regenerative cooling channels into the thin, curved walls of a small methane fueled engine is probably impossible. While most of our efforts are focused on continuing to design, the president and I are organizing business majors to go to companies in person to attempt to get funding (or even spare rocket parts). We had limited success with Cryoquip, Inc. when we talked to them in person over the summer for example - they were extremely excited to design high pressure composite cryogenic tanks for us - but they got some LNG deal in South Korea recently and they dropped our project.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI skimmed through this thread and saw something about using turbopumps. If you can shell out tons of money for the manufacturing of it, then sure.

I was wondering if it would be a good idea to restart the thread again, and see if we can continue trying to come up with a rocket design that, one day, might actually get built. (Oh, and just for the record, I didn\u2019t actually participate in the original thread, but I did read \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E of it)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince no ones touched on this in a while, I\u2019ll start off the conversation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe consensus of everyone on the rocket design was to have ether a single core with 4 boosters and a upper kick stage, or, if that didn\u2019t have enough delta v, 4\u00A0cores and 4 boosters with the same upper kick stage. The cores and boosters would be identical, using fins to steer in the atmosphere, while using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E to steer in vacuum. The motors would be hybrids, running of a propellent that most people agreed would be\u00A0some sort of htp/gasoline (I think). The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E would be built into the core, and the side boosters would use the empty holes where the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E would be on the identical core stage to mount gas thrusters to act as sep motors. The boosters and core would be recovered with parachutes. The upper stage would be a cluster of ether solid or hybrid motors. For simplicity it would have no guidance system other than gyros and accelerometers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome people also suggested air launch from a ballon, but this was generally thought to be to complex.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI propose that we use the same first stage design, and the boosters, but switch out the second stage to be a (very small, like just slightly larger than \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E sized)\u00A0liquid engine running on ether\u00A0methane/lox, gasoline/lox,\u00A0or\u00A0alcohol/lox\u00A0(We could machine it with a lathe).\u00A0It will be capable of thrust vectoring using simple hydrolic pistons to move the engine, and\u00A0the fuel lines will be ether\u00A0rubber tubes (which might turn brittle in space) or segmented plastic/metal tubes. The payload will be a cylinder covered in simple solar cells, (you can get them very cheaply on Amazon, though if they\u2019ll survive space I\u2019m not sure) and will contain ether a RPi or an arduino for control, with a series of accelerometers and mangatorquers for direction control.
