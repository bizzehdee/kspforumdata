Decaying organic matter usually makes earth soil slightly acidic. Mars obviously doesn\u0027t have that, its soil is alkaline.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It has significant concentrations of perchlorate salts. These are really the biggest challenge.

ClO4- is a weak oxidant, it can form in relatively sterile oxygenated environments like the atacama desert. They can be reduced immediately by strong reductants and slowly by weak reductants. Perchlorates do not persist in soil. Composting reduces perchlorates, and deep soils undergo microbial anoxic metabolism by oxygen scavenging by perchlorates, nitrates, sulfates, and sugars. Consequently as they appear they are degraded. Thus it is not surprising they are present in martian soils and may indicate a past presence of oxygen and/or electrical discharges.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NERVAfan","CreatedById":72817,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-31T03:33:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIIRC quite a few deserts and evaporating environments have perchlorates in soil on Earth e.g. in New Mexico.
