It\u0027s then absorbed by the ground. The ground slowly releases the energy in the infra-red range.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0emits and absorbs most strongly in the infra-red wavelengths, so if your CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0is near sea level, it\u0027s hard for that energy to escape, so CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0basically traps the energy near the surface. Instead of passing straight back out to space, the energy gets absorbed by the CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0and bounced around a bit, increasing the temperature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut this energy the article is talking about wasn\u0027t deposited by visible light, it was a solar storm, which is composed mainly of charged particles. They hit the upper atmosphere and deposit their energy by collisions with particles there, causing the thermosphere to heat up. The CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0in the thermosphere can then release the energy as infra-red radiation, and being above most of the bulk of the atmosphere, this can escape into space quite easily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCompletely different mechanisms. In the grand scheme of things, global warming due to increased CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0in the lower atmosphere outweighs any increased protection we might get from solar storms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
