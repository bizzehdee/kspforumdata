For example, in Iceland.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe question is simply one of energy, and it\u0027s generally easier to produce solar energy in most locations. If you\u0027re in Iceland, obviously, geothermal is a better bet, but we don\u0027t yet have the technology to \u0027tap into\u0027 geothermal energy wherever we please. Solar thermal, however, is far more widely available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I guess this is a question of whether your raw materials are closer to a hot spring or a desert, more or less. Also important to note is whether or not the source of geothermal energy you\u0027re using is located somewhere that it is stable enough that you can actually use it for industrial purposes, and whether or not it\u0027s available for said purposes (as in, not a national park / natural monument, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe size of a solar thermal facility that could do this on any appreciable scale would probably be pretty intense, and variable temperature would be a serious engineering challenge, but I\u0027m guessing that the cost saved by not shipping your raw material half-way across a continent (or the world) to get to the nearest geothermal plant would probably end up making it worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr you could do it the way most folks do this sort of thing - By burning hydrocarbons as your energy source. Depending on your raw materials, it\u0027s actually very possible to come out with a net chemical energy gain from that sort of process, and in fact, there are a number of facilities that can achieve this with simple organic materials, like farm wastes / meat processing by-products. It\u0027s not terribly efficient, but again, the question becomes one of logistics - carting around your potential fuel mass gets expensive fast.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Winter Man","CreatedById":11358,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-02T16:59:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe most efficient thing to do though would just be to use the nuclear fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Idobox","CreatedById":80299,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T16:16:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA similar idea, although much easier, is to make charcoal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake organic matter (made mostly of water and atmospheric CO2), heat it, and you get coal.

Nuclear has very high capital costs, high output but high running costs, a long life, then high decommissioning costs.
