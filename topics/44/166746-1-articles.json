A 100 minute polar orbit passes to within a few kilometers every twenty four hours. The Earth rotates under the orbit. There are 14.4 orbits a day however radiating 28.8 orbits per day at each pole. The Geomagnetic north poles is at 86.5 degrees. A degree at the equator is 60 nautical miles or 110,600 meters. The cosine of 85.6 is 0.0610. 110,600 Cos 85.6 = 6,746 meters. If a satellite cross from equator to NP or vice versa each orbit, and the number of orbits a day is not an even whole number then it creates ~ 29 areas everyday. 360/29 on average differing by 12.413 degrees however its closest proximity on either side are 6.206 degrees which is means the satellited passes within 41 kilometers of the north or south pole every day. Within a week it will pass within 5 kilometer. The magnetic pole of the earth has been moving 35 kilometer each year in a western direction. This means it moves 0.673 km per week. Thus a magnetical polar orbit would in about 2 months, obviate any need to have a magnetic polar orbit. In addition since the satellite would hold magnetic north the longest if the equatorial path was set to 86.5,\u00A0 and south magentic pole is less than 86.5 degrees, then it would be and not 90 degrees, the more intelligent magnetic pole crossing spacecraft would simply\u00A0 have an inclination of 86.5\u0027 allowing clustered\u00A0 mulitple north crossings per day and a few close crossings of the south pole.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-23T05:36:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I believe that some unexpectable bug in the software would be crashing the system every time when it passes zero coordinates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/17324/airplane-software-crash-caused-by-zero-negative-altitude-at-dead-sea\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/17324/airplane-software-crash-caused-by-zero-negative-altitude-at-dead-sea\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-10-23T05:38:34Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2017 05:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by kerbiloid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
