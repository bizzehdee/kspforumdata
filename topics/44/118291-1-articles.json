For the past half year, scientists and astronomy clubs were invited to submit proposals; now the the IAU has published a curated list of all suggestions it considers valid.\n\nVoting closes October 31st. Voting is free and does not require an account. Votes are tracked by device ID; each individual device (each PC, smartphone, etc.) is eligible for one vote *per star system*.\n\nEvery name option given comes with an explanation for why that name was chosen as an option, provided by the submitting party. because submissions were accepted worldwide, these text can sometimes be amusingly Engrish. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nStar systems to be named include cryptic candidates like PSR 1257\u002B12, but also well-known stars like epsilon Eridani (and yes, \u0022keep calling it that\u0022 is an option you can choose). In cases where a star is named alongside a planet it hosts, you can only vote for preset combinations; you cannot mix and match.\n\nThe website is here: [http://nameexoworlds.iau.org/exoworldsvote](http://nameexoworlds.iau.org/exoworldsvote)\n\nHave fun, everyone! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-12T21:14:31Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2015 09:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mitchz95","CreatedById":82292,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T15:39:29Z","Content":"I feel like it\u0027s a bit too early to start naming planets in other solar systems. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) We should save proper names for systems of special interest: ones that are targeted for interstellar probes, or ones that have Earth-like (as in habitable) planets.\n\nStill, I voted.

Except one, where I went with the option that at least looked like it had the most effort put into it.\n\nThe Japanese were really gung-ho about this, to my surprise. It was understandable for the star system that was discovered/researched by a Japanese team, but surprisingly enough, every single system has multiple Japanese suggestions, more than any other nationality. Meanwhile the participation among western groups seems to have been kinda low by comparison. Which I\u0027m kinda confused about, considering exoplanet hunting is big at NASA. There should have been a large number of scientific teams eligible for submissions and very interested in the field... but I suppose they forgot about it or something?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-12T15:56:05Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2015 03:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mitchz95","CreatedById":82292,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T16:42:49Z","Content":"All I can think of as I go through these:\n\n![exoplanet_names.png](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/exoplanet_names.png)\n\n*\u0022Astro-Club \u0022Nippy\u0022 would like to propose for the sun-like star \u0022epsilon Eridani\u0022 the name \u0022Tilapia\u0022, while this star can engender and maintain a civilization of intelligent tilapias on one of the moons of the planet \u0022epsilon Eridani b\u0022.
