Currently, humanity produces about 15TW of energy, which is 10^12 watts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo magnetise Mars\u0027 core in this way, you\u0027d need to pump 5.8*10^13 times more energy through it than humanity currently uses. Or put another way, to keep Mars\u0027 field at this strength for one second, you\u0027d need to gather up all the energy our species produces for 1.8 million years and release it all at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, this amount of energy is also enough to actually boil a good 55% of the Martian core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, sorry pal, it\u0027s a good idea, but the numbers don\u0027t really pan out.

First of we can build them off the asteroids and sail them to mars, they are just solar sails that hold their position in psudo-L2 halo-orbits via mars and sun gravity and light pressure, so they could be built just about anywhere and sailed to mars. Second lets assume a technologically reasonable 3 g/m^2 and a total surface area equal to a circle as wide as mars, that would be ~10^8 tons (~100 million tons), for comparison that would be equal to about 3 years our present world wide aluminum production. So a reasonably size asteroid mining industry could make that in a few centuries, and mind you that is for enough orbital mirrors to double Mars\u0027s solar flux and increase its surface temperature several dozens of degrees (at the sacrifice of a \u0022night\u0022 replaced with a \u0022day\u0022 of many many tiny \u0022suns\u0022, which would truly be an alien sight to behold) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso again I disagree with CFCs, they aren\u0027t as stable or as powerful as a greenhouse gas as SF6. SF6 is so dam perfect for mars I can\u0027t stop talking about it, it density and mass, its stability to UV (thus the ozone depleting Florine levels are lower), it\u0027s relative ease of production, for CFCs we are going to need Florine, we are going to need to mine salts for Florine, sulfates will be a by-product, might as well make SF6 from it. If we use *Aqua* 400 million tons of CFCs need, and SF6 has at least double the greenhouse gas potential of the best CFC (in the 100 year span, at the 1000 year span it 6 times better then any CFC!), then we would need ~200 mt of SF6.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-11T11:01:15Z\u0022 title=\u002203/11/2014 11:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by RuBisCO\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dudefinal","CreatedById":150168,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-13T05:09:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.futuretimeline.net/the-far-future.htm#mars-terraformed\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.futuretimeline.net/the-far-future.htm#mars-terraformed\u003C/a\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NuclearNut","CreatedById":143605,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-13T05:42:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHorribly wasteful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe amount of energy needed would be huge, massive, beyond massive.
