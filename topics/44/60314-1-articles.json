Even if you could accelerate the development to 7 or 8 years, you wouldn\u0027t have time to get much science out of it before the end of the program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee this more the discussion I like. Ok we have reasons now. Good I accept them. Now the question I have is what monkey in suite at NASA decided to cancel the module as it would in my opinion have given us some of the best data on possible effects of not just centrifugal gravity but also possible the adaptation of Earth organisms to Lunar and possibly mars gravity as such I think other projects should have been cancelled first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy problem is not with the scientists at NASA who I think do great work with the little they have but rather the Admins and polticans in charge that seem to waste money. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI work in Pharma, if the companys I have worked for opperated like NASA we would have had a number of big compnays go bust by now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"crazyewok","CreatedById":97592,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-18T13:55:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kryten\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kryten\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s because most ideas are bad.
