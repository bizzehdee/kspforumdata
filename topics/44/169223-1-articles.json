The so-called swap file generally tried to swap more memory that was necessary, and windows was very poor at cleaning up memory it did not need. The Microsoft aps frequently loaded with all the procedures they needed but many they hardly used that could be keep in DLL files. If you worked in an institution this proved to have rather annoying and time consuming consequences. For example Norton\u0027s CIS would try to load all its definitions onto the computer at start up (keeping in mind the old WinNT OS could only access up to 3 gb of memory, and the OS takes up 400m . CIS up to 1 gig. .by the time all the constitutive stuff was loaded there was little space left for the user.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suspect its not a bug, its probably a feature that some lawyers and engineers sat down and designed to give the \u0027ultimate\u0027 processor protection, realizing the loss of power, and blind to its unintended consequences. Intel specifically designed CPU protection because the OSs were asking for them, they did not want the users peeking and poking the memory. When your OS is loaded before you have a chance to access the process it puts the CPU in a protected state, your stuff talks to the Kernal and the kernal talks to the processor. If this done really securely, such as OS2 and higher, there is no way a process can take over the machine, for example, from the keyboard you can always stop a process, even a do_loop that has no exits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t be surprised if this is not another way the powers that be try to find ways to get in and access your computer without your knowledge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starman4308","CreatedById":122674,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-04T14:09:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy understanding is that performance drop for KSP will not be significant.

Remember the axiom \u0027for every action there is a equal and opposite reaction\u0027. In computing for every added security feature some other feature is compromised. At the forefront is straitline processing speed. Even if you get rid of that you still have some added subprocessors that generate more heat to compensate. So they want to get out on the market something that has the highest rated speed, which means the highest voltage or osscillator speed or both, which means they don\u0027t want to add heat added or amp taking subprocessors . . . . . . that\u0027s where the compromises comes in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost of Intels users are companies . . . . . .they set the standard, they want increased security at the cost of some performance. That is their lunch, the consumer PC market is the icing on the cake. Companies buy lots of the same thing, for example 1000 dell computers configured exactly the same way, this cuts both Intels cost and Dells cost. They can farm out this work to the lowest paid people or contractors that use undocumenteds so that they can cut labor cost to almost nothing. We ran into an issue because we were forced to start using winNT/XP which makes RS232 communication difficult but on Windows 7 RS232 almost becomes impossible, and many new computers don\u0027t support RS232 although most laboratory machines, including some being built today have RS232 ports on them.
