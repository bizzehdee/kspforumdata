Yes plasma can be used as a lens to focus laser beams.... how I don\u0027t know. But I read online it has been done, and occasionally happens (albeit rarely) even in nature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, for those of you that actually know, what are the advantages/disadvantages of using a plasma lens for uber laser cannons instead of glass lens?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdvantages: Can increase power levels almost arbitraitly without destroying your lens, but will still need to shed the waste heat from effecting other ship systems by using reaction mass/radiation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDisadvantages: Harder to do than glass lens and more energy costly too I think, since glass is passive but plasma control is an always active based system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Actually some lasers have no lens right? But are\u0027nt those the single use ones that blow up (bomb pumped X-ray lasers)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-07-23T17:05:36Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2024 05:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 dy\u0022\u003ETuesday at 05:05 PM\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"farmerben","CreatedById":190194,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-23T18:31:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought they used corundum\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-23T22:18:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwatch some videos about euv machines used in semiconductor fabs. there are some impressive laser shenanigans are going on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-24T06:38:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGoogle gave this an plasma lens for an petawatt laser.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://physics.aps.org/articles/v15/s16\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://physics.aps.org/articles/v15/s16\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDownside is that the lens will not last long who is don\u0027t matter for fusion but probably not optimal for weapons, the fusion laser does not have that much energy since the pulse is very short.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne fun thing with lasers is that for an powerful one you will combine multiple laser generators.
