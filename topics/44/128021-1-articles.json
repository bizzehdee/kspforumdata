(as in, they still obey conservation of momentum)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy thought is that the logical reaction would be lithium-7 \u002B protons. \u00A0They would then inject oxygen into the fusion plasma stream when they want more thrust. \u00A0This would therefore make the primary propellant they use water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA quick perusal of this table \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/fusionfuel.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0says 8.5% of the speed of light is the exhaust velocity. \u00A0My thought is the Epstein must be using aneutronic fusion, that the secret behind it is that it shapes plasma so well that there are these plasma mirrors inside, where sheets of hot plasma reflect the incredible heat of a star away from the components of the drive. \u00A0These plasma mirrors aren\u0027t going to be very effective against neutrons, but they would reflect away light and charged particles, allowing you to reach insane internal fusion reaction rates relative to the mass of the drive. \u00A0This also agrees with plot points in the show - the drive has so much hot fusing plasma inside that if a software failure causes the bottle to fail, it blows up the ship it is attached to. \u00A0It\u0027s basically the core of a fusion bomb continually reacting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo for every proton, you get 2 helium atoms. \u00A0Total atomic mass 8. \u00A0Oxygen has an atomic mass of 16. \u00A0So you\u0027re tripling your total mass. \u00A0Assuming even division of the kinetic energy, and\u00A0some energy is lost and the Epstein is only 95% efficient (it has to be extremely efficient or the whole ship using it is going to vaporize)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nx = 1/2 * m * .95(8.5%c)^2\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nx = 1/2 * 3m * (V)^2\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n.5m(8.5c)^2 = 1.5m(V)^2\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n0.33333 *.95 \u00A0(8.5c)^2 = V^2\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n0.562(8.5c) = V\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nV = 4.777%C\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nISP = \u00A01\u00A0459\u00A0845\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow we\u0027re hauling ass. \u00A0If your space awesomesauce wtf sci-fi Mars warship (that is \u0022stealth\u0022 as well, of course, cuz special black paint prevents the star like flare from your engine from being detected) is half propellant (gotta have room for the railguns, armor, and really posh looking interior!) you can do a 10 m/s burn for 275 hours!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt depends on planetary positioning but it appears that this is about 11.4 days at full thrust, you could build a ship that could do a Mars to Jupiter run at 10m/s^2\u00A0the whole trip. \u00A0This is also why in theory, if you just posit that the Epstein drive internally basically uses magic - it\u0027s made of indestructible adamantium with internal mirrors that reflect 100% of all incoming energy away from the drive - you could do multiple gravity burns, for days even, if you had a ship that is all engine and propellant tanks. \u00A0(there are rich people racing ships in the novels that can do this)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing of note : if you\u0027re using proton-lithium or proton-boron fusion, the main mass of fuel is actually the lithium or boron. \u00A0The water consumption is nothing. \u00A0You\u0027d be consuming the ship\u0027s mass in boron or lithium to do a high gravity trip between planets. \u00A0I\u0027m not sure how much lithium or boron there really \u003Cem\u003Eis \u003C/em\u003Ein our solar system, at least in minable forms, to be throwing it away like this. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething like the Epstein might be possible, albeit it might have to be extremely large. \u00A0If you think about it, the larger a fusion reaction chamber is, the more the outer plasma protects the walls of the chamber from being heated by the energy produced by the inner core. \u00A0Logically you could just keep making the reactor bigger and bigger and bigger. \u00A0You could never use the energy produced directly - converted to electric power, you\u0027d be producing as much energy as it takes to convert your whole ship to vapor every second - but you could allow it to escape, shaping the thrust plume with magnets indirectly and using yet more layers of plasma to protect you. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, good luck with stealth. \u00A0The absurdity of even attempting to stealth something that probably makes a plasma plume brighter than the inner planets as seen from earth...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-17T06:02:27Z\u0022 title=\u002212/17/2015 06:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SomeGuy123\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SomeGuy123","CreatedById":154263,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-18T08:18:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNobody wants to discuss fusion drive performance or water recycling? \u00A0Bueller? \u00A0Anyone?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"1of6Billion","CreatedById":46191,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-18T08:41:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWatched 3 episodes yesterday.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI approve\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kunok","CreatedById":147982,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-18T11:32:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI only watched the first episode, but I read the first two books, and I\u0027m reading the third.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the first book, in the end is a little interview:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ELeviathan Wakes has a gritty and realistic feel.

There have been numerous examples of warships slipping into lines of freighters at night and setting their emissions to look like and read like another warship or civilian ship. US Carriers even do this with lighting and emissions to look like bulk carriers. Their line and Radar Cross Sections very much look like bulk freighters or oil tankers.\u00A0\u00A0Deception has a long and storied past with naval combat since before the golden age of Fighting Sail.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith low observable ships, you could probably throw out a pattern of RADAR/LADAR\u00A0reflectors that would give your stealth space ship a profile that looked like an ore freighter, or a water hauler or some other craft bumping around. Diddle your drive signatures for less efficient civilian modes and you\u0027ll look like just another ship blipping around the belt doing it\u0027s thing. The reason the Can\u0027t got killed was that they were too close and the operators of the Anubis didn\u0027t want any possible witnesses, which the crew of the Canterbury was.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs to being stealthy, it would be even more useful to have a gaagle of RADAR/LADAR reflectors on your hull and then discard a set of them facing an opponent in a tactical situation (ie a battle). OR even both halves, the sensors of your opponent would likely continue tracking the reflectors and stop following the actual ship. Embed some remote emitters in those reflectors as well as jammers and other components with enough gear to make them look like the real ship while maneuvering and you\u0027d seriously stand a chance of completely breaking your opponents lock in a heated battle.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-28T20:48:38Z\u0022 title=\u002201/28/2016 08:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Montieth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded points.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-28T20:57:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222327894\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022128021\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221450457738\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154263\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SomeGuy123\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 18.12.2015 at 5:55 PM, SomeGuy123 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight. \u00A0Even\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eif\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eyou ignore thermal equilibrium, the Epstein...those numbers above assume it\u0027s a real engine with the ability to basically contain a fusion bomb, for hours of burn time, and it\u0027s 95% efficient. \u00A0That\u0027s basically as described by the author.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe flare that would leave..one thing in the latest book they got right is that from a human perspective, seeing a ship in the distance using one of these engines, you see a gigantic plume of glowing gas. \u00A0At the very top of the massive drive cone is a tiny object you might miss. \u00A0That\u0027s the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne would think that every time somebody fires one of these things off, thousands of separate sensors in the solar system would get triggered without fail, automatically recording the course of the spacecraft in question. \u00A0And you would reasonably assume all the major factions - Earth, Mars, the Belters - would have vast surveillance networks. \u00A0It wouldn\u0027t be very expensive - as I said, firing a drive like this, with a plume power measured in terawatts, is going to be really easy to see.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if you have a stealth warship, that\u0027s cute, but one would reasonably expect that everyone would know about it\u0027s every move as you just can\u0027t hide your flare.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis an stealth probe is plausible, but that is something small unpowered and pretty passive, its easy to make it harder to see than an 3 meter asteroid. as it hardly\u00A0reflect light, if you are willing to accept reflection in some direction you can keep it colder.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAn ship is harder, an ship under power is impossible.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kunok","CreatedById":147982,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-28T23:37:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI forgotten about this thread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thing about people does thinks this scenario can\u0027t have stealth it\u0027s than they think that with that tech level i\u0027ts doable to make devices with enough resolution and field of view, so you can see everything at once.
