The neutron ejecta out the nozzle falls into a plane about 180 degrees, thus some of the neutrons are traveling forward with respect to the movement along the horizon, some are struck by the solar wind and travel in the direction of the capsule. If the capsule is accelerating forward this is not likely to happen because by the time it reaches the capsule is very well scattered and diffused. But of the capsule stops, the engine is still producing neutrons and the solar wind is still scattering them. In the event of a solar storm, this could make the problem even worse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch1 lang=\u0022en\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_scattering\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_scattering\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/h1\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ENeutrons can be scattered by anything, the hydrogen in water is particularly good, but they can be scattered by the shielding, scattering creates thermal neutrons, which travel at about 500 m/s.

If the neutron is far enough away from the capsule at the time it is scattered, then the probability of it hitting the capsule is low. But if the ship is drifting in space, neutrons come of with a variety of speeds from fast neutrons that can be scattered by rapidly moving particles to slow thermal neutrons that can be scattered by magnetic phenomena, and the neutrons can end up on the other side of the shield.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
