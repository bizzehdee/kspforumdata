It starts as a binary system with similar planets, and the orbits decay, slowly bringing the two planets together. Eventually they come so close that they touch, and you get a rapidly spinning double planet, at least for a short time before it all melds together into one bigger planet. There was an article a while back about a star system doing this, so I wondered if it could happen with planets too. My question is\u00A0could this planet exist, at least for a geologically short period of time, or would the tidal and gravitational\u00A0forces be so great that both planets break apart before getting close enough to touch? Wouldn\u0027t it be weird to walk from one planet to another?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-12T01:54:16Z\u0022 title=\u002212/12/2015 01:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cubinator\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-12T05:18:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this would depend on a lot of factors, like the sizes of the planets, their mass, their velocities, and so on.

For this instance we\u0027re assuming the planets have similar masses and densities, and their orbits are slowly decaying. If it decays slowly and steadily enough, they would eventually just touch and it would be a fast-spinning double planet. The only problem I see with this is that the gravitational forces would be stronger in the middle, so the planets would be prone to tearing each other apart. The material in the planets would want to clump at the barycenter, and the planets would likely deform and break.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/JeFuy5E\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere is a picture of how this probably would turn out.\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0The gravity is much greater on the inside, so the planets would be spinning faster in the middle than on the outside. This would lead to a lot of stress, probably enough to tear both planets apart. Then there would be a spinning disk of matter which eventually clumps back into a new planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
