In case you don\u2019t remember, this is a high end red dwarf with one confirmed planet and five other candidates found by me, Vidar87, and shutcheon on Exoplanet Explorers last October (wow, it\u2019s been a full year already). \u00A0The exact physical parameters of the five other candidates have been dubious for a while, but I plan to refine them to the best of my ability. I will incorporate better light curve processing and transit folding techniques to remove as much data noise and glitches as possible, leaving the six cleaned-up signals behind to further analyze. Because of a VEX robotics competition and preparation yesterday into today, I only have access to mobile, meaning I haven\u2019t been able to start my analysis. However, during my free time, I\u2019ve been re-calculating the equilibrium temperatures and insolation of the planets, and found that my original estimates from January were completely messed up.

K2-149b, c, and d aren\u2019t really worth talking about at the moment, but the final three are now looking very intriguing. K2-149e, as it turns out, has the exact same equilibrium temperature and stellar flux/insolation as Venus (also 300 K and 1.91 flux). This makes it likely to be a super Venus analogue, something that isn\u2019t too common of a find. I don\u2019t know of any other Super-Earth with the same temperature and insolation as Venus, which will make this planet one of a kind and worthy of further study. The other two, K2-149f and g, are looking more promising than before. K2-149f is still in the optimistic habitable zone, but at 1.42 flux, it is less likely to suffer a runaway greenhouse effect. It could easily resist such a scenario because of its high mass (probably 4-5 Earth masses) \u201Cholding down\u201D all its water, and the fact that it\u2019s likely to be tidally locked. Simulations have shown that synchronous rotating planets would develop star-facing storms, blocking out some incoming sunlight and allowing the planet to resist a runaway greenhouse at higher insolations of 1.3 to 1.5 flux, depending on the star.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nK2-149g is even more promising. Getting 66% as much sunlight as Earth, it is smack in the conservative habitable zone and very unlikely to have undergone a runaway greenhouse effect. Like K2-149f, it is expected to be an ocean planet (10-50% water by mass) due to its large radius. My upcoming radius re-analysis should determine its actual size and give an idea into its composition and water/volatile content. One thing that I immediately noticed with these two planets is how they\u2019re almost identical to Kepler-296 Ae and Kepler-296 Af. Not only are the stars similar in size, but\u00A0K2-149f and g\u2019s orbital periods of 34.3125 and 60.3850 days are very close to the 34.1421 and 63.3363 days for the outermost Kepler-296 A planets. In addition, they\u2019re stellar insolations are just about the same \u2014 1.42 and 1.41 flux for K2-149d and Kepler-296 Ae; and 0.67 and 0.62 flux for K2-149g and Kepler-296 Af. Whether or not their sizes are also similar has yet to be seen, but the similarities so far are almost uncanny.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI should have my analysis results posted either tomorrow or Monday.

I deleted all the original signals and used the Box-Least Squared (BLS) algorithm to find better orbital periods for the planets after de-trending the light curve.\u00A0Unfortunately, while K2-149b and K2-149c came out fine, the other four had problems. K2-149d and e turned out significantly larger than expected due to stellar noise messing up their transits. Meanwhile, I couldn\u2019t find the signals for K2-149f and g at all. The closest I could get was a 47-day signal, which later turned out to be a false positive. Today I decided to take the signals from the SFF light curve and analyze them in the EVEREST light curve, which has significantly less stellar noise than the former. Not only were the parameters for K2-149d and e more believable, but I was able able to find slightly different orbital periods for K2-149f and g.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- K2-149b: 1.69 Re, 746.8 ppm 11.336890 days, 0.08311 AU, 402 K, 6.225 flux.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- K2-149c: 1.68 Re, 734.75 ppm, 16.367583 days, 0.10616 AU, 356 K, 3.815 flux.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- K2-149d: 1.99 Re, 1029.1 ppm, 21.393409 days, 0.12691 AU, 326 K, 2.670 flux.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- K2-149e: 1.70 Re, 750.75 ppm, 28.750066 days, 0.15455 AU, 295 K, 1.800 flux.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- K2-149f: 1.62 Re, 685.6 ppm, 37.226523 days, 0.18360 AU, 271 K, 1.276 flux.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- K2-149g: 1.55 Re, 626.4 ppm, 69.743461 days. 0.27903 AU, 220 K, 0.552 flux.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the exception of K2-149c, all of the planets have different orbital periods than initially calculated, either by a few minutes for the inner ones or by a few days for the outer ones. K2-149b and c are practically identical in terms of radius, temperature, and \u2014 presumably \u2014 composition. I expect both of them to be mainly rocky with a significant steam envelope, like larger versions of TRAPPIST-1b or LHS 1140c. K2-149d is the largest at almost twice the size of Earth and is probably a Mini-Neptune with a significant volatile (water, methane, hydrogen) envelope over a rocky center. Due to its temperature, much of its clouds are likely made of water vapor, with a haze of methane like Uranus and Neptune.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nK2-149e is where things get more interesting. At 1.7 Earth radii, it likely has a very similar composition to K2-149b and c. However, it\u2019s signficantly cooler, getting just 80% more sunlight than Earth. This puts it outside most definitions of the habitable zone, but it could be just cool enough to not get too hot and have a liquid ocean underneath a steamy, sauna-like atmosphere. K2-149f is even cooler than calculated yesterday, due to its orbital period being about three days longer than my January analysis determined. At 1.62 Earth radii with an insoation about a quarter more than Earth\u2019s, it is likely able to resist a runaway greenhouse effect and is a great candidate for a potentially habitable ocean planet. The dayside storm cooling method I mentioned yesterday will be quite effective here, helping to keep the planet\u2019s climate temperate and stable even though it\u2019s likely tidally locked.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, there\u2019s the new K2-149g. More analysis needs to be done to make sure this actually is a planet. It only has two transit events, the final one of which is close to the last observed transit of K2-149b. So far it seems like a good candidate, enough to gain the designation K2-149g (unless it gets disproven). It is also by far the most promising of the entire system. It\u2019s both the smallest and coolest planet of K2-149, at 55% larger than Earth while receiving 55% as much sunlight. This places it well within the conservative habitable zone by all definitions, and its small size means it is either entire rocky or has a very small layer of water, no more than 1-2% of its entire mass. An Earth-like Carbon-silicate cycle may be able to take place here, and volcanoes could create islands poking out of the watery surface \u2014 both of which would give K2-149g a significant edge over K2-149f in terms of potential habitability. Its low insolation also means a runaway greenhouse effect is nearly impossible; there isn\u2019t enough radiation to evaporate enough water for this process to take place. Another potential advantage is how it may not be tidally locked. Its 69-day orbital period may place K2-149g far enough from its host to not become a synchronous rotator, and instad have a rotation period of several days to a few weeks. This could allow for a better distribution of heat across the entire surface, allowing more areas to support liquid water.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore work needs to be done with K2-149. I would like to get an expert\u2019s opinion on my results to see how well they hold up, so I may E-Mail one of the scientists I\u2019ve been in contact with about this. If my results do hold up, it would make K2-149 a very rare and very promising system, and the first since Kepler-62 with two potentially habitable planets.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ProtoJeb21","CreatedById":153551,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-12T00:43:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt turns out I messed up my calculations for the equilibrium temperatures and insolation of the K2-149 planets.

The former is now slightly more irradiated than Venus, but because of its large mass and huge amounts of water, I\u2019m still not too sure whether or not it has become a Super-Venus.

While EPIC 220221272 f is no longer potentially habitable (although it could still be some weird steamy ocean planet), all the planets are significantly larger and now more dynamic and interesting. EPIC 220221272 b likely has retained an atmosphere, while EPIC 220221272 c, d, and e all likely have significant geological activity and thick terrestrial atmospheres. All the planets likely migrated inwards from near the Frost Line, so they all would\u2019ve formed with about 5-20% water by mass. Depending on their size and final orbits, some would\u2019ve lost this water, while for other planets it would\u2019ve turned into a thick atmosphere. EPIC 220221272 b and c are probably too irradiated by stellar flares and too small to have retained their initial water layers, which would\u2019ve made them 5-10% more massive than we see them today. EPIC 220221272 d and e may have formed with about 15% water by mass, but due to their low masses (around 2-4 Me) and exposure to stellar flares, most of this would\u2019ve been lost as well. But keep in mind, I said most. EPIC 220221272 d is probably large enough to have held onto a thick water vapor atmosphere, and EPIC 220221272 e is far enough away to be the same. The latter probably formed with more water due to being further out in the system, and as a result its steam layer would be much larger and more Venus-like than EPIC 220221272 d.

TIC 30312676 b is roughly the size of Jupiter and orbits every 2.2 days. At first glance, that doesn\u0027t seem very odd -- there are a few other Hot Jupiters with similar sizes and orbital periods -- but everything becomes horrifying once you realize that the host star is\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ehuge\u003C/em\u003E. At 2.24 solar radii with a temperature of\u00A08,747 K and over 26 times the luminosity of the Sun, it is the largest and hottest star I\u0027ve found to host a planet. This results in TIC 30312676 b to have an equilibrium temperature of nearly 2,800 K; for comparison, the star TRAPPIST-1 is about 2500 K. At these temperatures, the planet is probably extremely inflated and losing its gaseous envelope, with a day side of at least 3,100 K. But it may be worse. A different analysis on the same planet by an automated program designed by the TESS team found that this planet could have an orbital period of 1.1 days instead, which would give it an equilibrium temperature of 3,504 K (5,848\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003EF).

While not a find of my own, HD 48611 b -- formerly known as TOI-214.01 -- is now TESS\u0027s first rocky or mainly rocky Super-Earth, thanks to the efforts of citizen scientist EEfinder. He managed to uncover archived HARPS data of the host star gathered back from 2003 to 2006, but for some reason had never seen the light of day until now. The HARPS data, despite being limited in quantity (only about a dozen measurements), was enough to tease out the 1.8 m/s signal of this planet. That semi-amplitude corresponds to a planetary mass of 6.7 times that of Earth, which when combined with my radius estimate of 1.78 Earth radii, gives HD 48611 b a density of 6.55 g/cm\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E. When plotted on the exoplanet mass-radius diagram, HD 48611 b is right on the 100% MgSiO2 line. However, this doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s purely rocky. It is probably almost entirely made of rock and iron with a thin volatile envelope or thick atmosphere that makes it seem less dense. Not only is the planet notable for having a nearly terrestrial composition, but it also has a rather eccentric orbit, swinging from 0.092 AU to 0.170 AU. This causes the planet to nearly double its temperature between winter and summer. However, such orbit swings likely impart significant tidal forces into HD 48611 b, which would lead to increased volcanic activity and a massive release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and other kinds of volcanic material. Not only would a volcanic atmosphere caused by tidal heating create a Venus-like greenhouse effect, but it may also be the explanation behind the planet\u0027s thin volatile layer. The Super-Earth 55 Cancri e has shown us that atmospheres of heavy gases can make planets appear less dense, meaning that many worlds straddling the 100% MgSiO2 line don\u0027t need water envelopes to explain their densities. HD 48611 b could be one of them, and since its host star is bright, its own atmosphere may be able to be analyzed by either Hubble or the James Webb Space Telescope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose are all of my significant finds as of now.

Each of the three candidates has the potential to host liquid water, but each have their own set of problems and uncertainties that could make them uninhabitable. Let\u0027s begin with the star itself. On ExoFOP-K2, EPIC 201663913 is given a radius of 0.403 solar radii, a mass of 0.461 solar masses, and a temperature of 3939 K. Originally, I calculated that the luminosity of the star would render the second planet an uninhabitable, Venus-like hell. It gets even worse when you take into account that ExoFOP-K2 parameters, especially for red dwarfs, aren\u0027t the most accurate. Many stars reported as small red dwarfs on ExoFOP-K2 by Huber et al turn out to be either larger red dwarfs or small orange dwarfs, and a few like EPIC 212525618 end up actually being yellow dwarfs! Thankfully, the newly launched ExoFOP-TESS contains much better estimates for the sizes and temperatures of the stars the telescope will observe, including nearly all stars in the Ecliptic Plane Input Catalog (EPIC). Unfortunately, no radius and mass estimates are given for this star, but a temperature estimate is: 3510 K. This is surprisingly compatible with Huber\u0027s estimates, so for this analysis I\u0027m going to use a combination of K2 and TESS estimates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first candidate, EPIC 201663913 b, is by far the smallest, at just 0.65\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#fafafa;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;text-align:left;\u0022\u003ER\u003C/span\u003E\u003Csub style=\u0022background-color:#fafafa;color:#353c41;font-size:10.5px;text-align:left;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\u2295\u003C/sub\u003E. Its orbital period of 17.648 days places it within the system\u0027s Venus Zone, with 2.1 times the stellar flux of Earth. However, this doesn\u0027t mean the planet is a Venus-like hell. Remember, it\u0027s just 65% the size of Earth, which may make it too small to even hold onto an enormous, crushing atmosphere, especially since the star appears to be moderately active. This stellar activity may also kill the possibility that this planet even exists. Its signal is not particularly strong and may end up just being a product of the star\u0027s typical variability. Until a more sophisticated analysis can be done, EPIC 201663913 b will hold onto its status as a planet candidate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext up is the Super-Earth EPIC 201663913 c, at 1.30 \u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#fafafa;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;text-align:left;\u0022\u003ER\u003C/span\u003E\u003Csub style=\u0022background-color:#fafafa;color:#353c41;font-size:10.5px;text-align:left;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\u2295\u00A0\u003C/sub\u003Ewith a newly calculated stellar flux 1.21 times that of Earth. While outside typical definitions of the conservative habitable zone, it will be within the conservative habitable zone for synchronous rotators. I\u0027ve mentioned this before, but extensive climate modelling has shown that tidally locked, temperate planets would probably develop day side cloud cover that would extend the inner limit of the HZ. With an orbital period of 26.707 days, EPIC 201663913 c is likely a synchronous rotator, which would prevent it from suffering a runaway greenhouse effect. Its signal is also much more prominent than that of its Mars-sized little sibling and extremely likely to exist. However, now that the promising aspects are out of the way, it\u0027s time for the problems. These have nothing to do with the planet itself; rather, they have to do with the host star. Even though the temperature from ExoFOP-TESS supports Huber\u0027s estimates, that does NOT mean EPIC 201663913 isn\u0027t larger than expected, possibly closer to half the radius and mass of the Sun. This could make 201663913 c both too irradiated and too large to prevent itself from experiencing a runaway greenhouse effect. In addition, EPIC 201663913 may have a nearby binary companion, which would make all three planets even larger if the companion and the host are being observed together. That might also kill the potential habitability of EPIC 201663913 c. So, while it seems quite promising as of now, don\u0027t be surprised if it turns out to not be so in the future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, there\u0027s the temperate Earth-sized candidate EPIC 201663913 d. If you recall from back in April, I found a circumbinary \u0022Super-Pluto\u0022 orbiting around two dim red dwarfs that I nicknamed after the Star Wars Rebels ice planet Krownest. It now seems like EPIC 201663913 d would be a much better real-world analogue...maybe even an exact analogue. It\u0027s just a tad smaller than Earth at about 0.99\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#fafafa;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;text-align:left;\u0022\u003ER\u003C/span\u003E\u003Csub style=\u0022background-color:#fafafa;color:#353c41;font-size:10.5px;text-align:left;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\u2295\u003C/sub\u003E and orbits in the outer reaches of the habitable zone every 71.22 days while getting just a third of the starlight Earth receives from the Sun. Because this distance, the planet has one of the lowest equilibrium temperatures of any planet candidate I\u0027ve found: just 193 Kelvin, or -112 degrees Fahrenheit. An Earth-like greenhouse effect could warm the planet to an average of around\u00A0220 K (-64 F) and warm some areas, especially around the equator, to temperatures suitable for liquid water. However, that\u0027s just assuming it even has an Earth-like atmosphere, and that it even exists. It\u0027s starting to look more likely that, instead of a ~71 day orbit, the third planet of EPIC 201663913 has an orbital period of around 48.13 days. If this is the case, it would be about the same size as before (0.96 \u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#fafafa;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;text-align:left;\u0022\u003ER\u003C/span\u003E\u003Csub style=\u0022background-color:#fafafa;color:#353c41;font-size:10.5px;text-align:left;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\u2295\u003C/sub\u003E), but be rather warmer, with an insolation 55% that of Earth and an equilibrium temperature around 220 K. Unlike the possible changes to planets b and c, this would make EPIC 201663913 d both a better potentially habitable candidate and a better Krownest analogue. It\u0027s also quite likely to exist, with a clearer signal despite a longer orbital period. If there\u0027s any planet candidate around EPIC 201663913 to put your bet on for potentially being able to support life, I would definitely recommend planet d.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ProtoJeb21","CreatedById":153551,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-23T21:43:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:48px;\u0022\u003EEPIC 201299484\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022nK5LuQz.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022435\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/nK5LuQz.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEPIC 201299484 and EPIC 210736056 are two very similar systems found by Vidar87 last year, with a Venus-like planet and a temperate ocean world orbiting a small (\u0026lt;0.3 Rs) red dwarf. However, with better TESS parameters, the two systems aren\u0027t as twin-like as they were before. EPIC 201299484 was found to be significantly larger and hotter, at 44.1% the radius and 46.6% the mass of the Sun with a temperature of 3601 K, giving it just under 3% the Sun\u0027s luminosity.

However, EPIC 201299484 b appears to be quite a massive rocky planet, which could help it retain a thick atmosphere and give it a Venus-like or greater greenhouse effect.

However, once I determined the planet\u0027s insolation, I realized something peculiar: it\u0027s the twin of LHS 1140 b. EPIC 210736056 c is not only practically identical in size to LHS 1140 b, but it also has just about the same orbital period (29.03 days vs 24.747 days) and stellar flux (0.55 vs 0.503). The similarities between the two planets are uncanny, and one may assume they also share a similar rocky composition. However, I doubt this is the case; their host stars have significantly different heavy element abundances and likely resulted in different formation processes. I think it\u0027s best to assume EPIC 210736056 c has a water envelope and isn\u0027t a huge rocky world like LHS 1140 b, but as of now it\u0027s impossible to know for certain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI need to finish a few things today before I can get to the big reveal of K2-149\u0027s potential seventh planet.

But before I go into this new discovery, I need to present a bit of context behind it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOver the last three-ish weeks since TESS Sectors 1 and 2 data became public, I\u0027ve developed an improved method for measuring the radius of transiting exoplanets in TESS and K2 data. First, I detrend the target light curve with LcViewer to a very specific level, where all stellar variability is no longer apparent and the data set is just about flat and punctured by transit events. However, it can\u0027t be too high to the point that it starts cropping out parts of the larger transit events. This level varies from star to star and LcViewer has detrending levels between 1 and 25, so for K2-149, I used 20 (for reference, the standard LcViewer detrending level is 16). Next, I had to change how I viewed and processed the folded transit. When LcViewer stacks all the transits of a planet into one average transit to analyze, you can change something called the Signal Region Timescale. Basically, it determines how much of the rest of the light curve will be in the same view as the folded/stacked transit. I usually change it to 5 Signal Durations (i.e., it includes a region 5 times greater that the length of the transit), but I realized that the large the SRT is, the more that noise and variability starts to impact the measurement of the folded transit. That\u0027s why for this analysis and many other recent ones, I set the SRT to be as low as possible before measuring the folded transit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow that my methodology is out of the way, it\u0027s time to go into what I found. Out of the six original planets, K2-149c, e, and f remained relatively unchanged, with revised radii of 1.67 (\u00B10.17), 1.69\u00A0(\u00B10.17), and 1.61\u00A0(\u00B10.15) \u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#fafafa;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;text-align:left;\u0022\u003ER\u003C/span\u003E\u003Csub style=\u0022background-color:#fafafa;color:#353c41;font-size:10.5px;text-align:left;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\u2295\u003C/sub\u003E. The other three planets, K2-149b, d, and g, were either significantly larger or smaller than initially estimated. K2-149b is the only one with a larger radius, at 1.76\u00A0(\u00B10.17) \u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#fafafa;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;text-align:left;\u0022\u003ER\u003C/span\u003E\u003Csub style=\u0022background-color:#fafafa;color:#353c41;font-size:10.5px;text-align:left;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\u2295\u003C/sub\u003E, indicating a thicker volatile envelope. Stellar activity and rather high insolation, about 7 times greater than Earth\u0027s, may have prevented a stable hydrogen layer from staying around and instead leave K2-149b with a suffocating steam atmosphere, maybe turning it into another Super-Venus. Despite the size increase, K2-149b is still just smaller than K2-149d, which has been revised down to 1.81\u00A0(\u00B10.18) \u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#fafafa;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;text-align:left;\u0022\u003ER\u003C/span\u003E\u003Csub style=\u0022background-color:#fafafa;color:#353c41;font-size:10.5px;text-align:left;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\u2295\u003C/sub\u003E. This radius and its lower insolation still favor some amounts of hydrogen, but likely less than initially thought. A better explanation for its volatile layer is one made almost entirely out of water, with a methane-dominated atmosphere and possibly either a supercritical water ocean or a layer of crushed Ice-VII. Finally, the potentially habitable candidate K2-149g has also shrunk, with a radius now down to 1.47\u00A0(\u00B10.15) \u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#fafafa;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;text-align:left;\u0022\u003ER\u003C/span\u003E\u003Csub style=\u0022background-color:#fafafa;color:#353c41;font-size:10.5px;text-align:left;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\u2295\u003C/sub\u003E. This better favors a rocky, Earth-like composition of rock and iron with only small amounts of water and no significant volatile envelope, increasing its chances of being potentially habitable if it does exist. Thankfully, I\u0027m a little more confident in its existence after this study. It\u0027s still a possibility that K2-149g is a result of data glitches and/or variability, but less so. However, it\u0027s possible all six planets here are smaller than I calculated.

If all the other planets are this much smaller than I\u0027ve calculated due to impacts from stellar noise and variability, they would be around 1.56, 1.69, 1.57, 1.50, and 1.37 \u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#fafafa;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;text-align:left;\u0022\u003ER\u003C/span\u003E\u003Csub style=\u0022background-color:#fafafa;color:#353c41;font-size:10.5px;text-align:left;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\u2295\u003C/sub\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen finishing my analysis, I noticed something odd. The third transit of K2-149d appeared to be inside a much larger, ~6.4 hour transit-like event. I don\u0027t know how I never noticed it before, but it doesn\u0027t seem to be from a data glitch, and as far as I can tell, it\u0027s a decent new planet candidate. This K2-149h is difficult to study with just a single candidate transit transit, especially since it\u0027s being skewered by a transit of K2-149d. However, I was able to get a radius estimate of 1.73 \u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#fafafa;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;text-align:left;\u0022\u003ER\u003C/span\u003E\u003Csub style=\u0022background-color:#fafafa;color:#353c41;font-size:10.5px;text-align:left;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\u2295\u003C/sub\u003E, which is probably slightly overestimated due to the previously mentioned K2-149d transit and impacts from stellar variability. Like the rest of the planets except K2-149g, K2-149h probably has a significant layer of water, but instead of in the form of a steam atmosphere or an ocean, it\u0027s probably entirely frozen over. The best estimate I can get for the candidate\u0027s orbital period is ~175 days, placing it well beyond the outer limit of the habitable zone and giving it an equilibrium temperature of around 167 K (-159 F). Even with an Earth-like or stronger greenhouse effect, K2-149h is too far from its dim star to have any regions warm enough for liquid water, making it one of my very few ice planet candidates. In fact, behind the circumbinary planet Krownest and a possible long-period Super-Earth from Campaign 14, K2-149h is my coldest planet candidate so far. That is, of course, if it even exists. It is easily the least likely of the K2-149 planets and still has a decent chance of being a data glitch. I haven\u0027t been able to find this transit-like event at the same time in any other Campaign 8 light curve so far, so as of now, it will be considered a potential planet. Just don\u0027t be too surprised if it turns out to be a false positive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceception","CreatedById":152800,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-24T20:13:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks like you expect it to be a Titan-esque world?

However, it\u2019s the section after that I\u2019m most excited about: \u201CA Small Transiting Planet Discovered by Citizen Scientists\u201D. Ever since Jessie said on Twitter how multiple citizen scientist exoplanet\u00A0finds would be announced at AAS\u00A0233, several of us over on Planet Hunters have been hoping one of them would be EPIC 210693462 Ab/Natalie, the Super-Earth shutcheon, Vidar87, and I found in a binary red dwarf system almost two years ago. The title for this section hints that this could be the case. Not only does Natalie fit the title description, but it has also been studied so much and for so long that not announcing it tomorrow seems highly unlikely. It\u2019s one of the most prominent EE finds, and one of the first that was targeted for follow-up observations.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn preparation of Natalie\u2019s possible discovery announcement, I deleted all my Imgur albums and the wiki page about the system.

I just haven\u2019t been able to get back to it, and I can\u2019t even keep up with my newest mods.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have some good news: it looks like the TESS press conference will be happening tonight! It\u2019ll start at 7:00 pm PST (10:00 pm EST), so it will probably be a little too late for me to watch it, but I should be able to watch the K2-138g press conference. It starts in less than an hour at 10:15 am PST (1:15 pm EST), and I think you\u2019ll be able to watch it here:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://aas.org/media-press/aas-press-conference-webcasts\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://aas.org/media-press/aas-press-conference-webcasts\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
