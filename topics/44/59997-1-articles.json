This means that there are universes that (theoretically) exist in where \u0022Buzz\u0022 Aldrin was the first to step on the moon. Another exists where neither landed on the moon first. If you\u0027d care to think about it, there\u0027s even a universe in which everybody here on the forums was the first!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, this always got me thinking: If \u003Cem\u003Eevery\u003C/em\u003E possible event occurred, then this means that there are an infinite number of universes nearly identical to our own, but with sometimes subatomic differences. Think of it this way: There is another universe where you are reading this right now, but the alternate you has one less atom than you do right now. Small differences like this create an infinite number of possible outcomes that all exist simultaneously. Every time you get a paper cut, peel a banana, or ask someone on a date, an infinite set of new universes are created. In one, that paper cut opens you up to radiation from an X-Ray you might be taking shortly in the future, and you get superpowers, but are corrupted with a tiny lifespan. That banana bursts into flames when you try to eat it. And your date? You screw it up an infinite number of times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlways remember that the opposite happens, too! Maybe the X-Ray instantly heals the paper cut, and you make lots of money letting researchers study you. Maybe the banana delays you from going swimming for an hour, and saves you from an errant lightning strike. That date goes better than you could ever dream of. And all of these possibilities happen an infinite number of times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are some of your crazier ideas of what happens in your alternate universes?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skyler4856","CreatedById":76452,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-15T01:11:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am the ruler of the world, Kerbals exist in place of humans, and I am currently taking a dump on mars\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theend3r","CreatedById":97560,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-15T01:19:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is those universes with different outcomes cannot share the same past.

If this were true, than the converse is true: We are an alternate universe of \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E universe, and so this problem is never actually a problem.

An object exists in the 3 dimensions and in the other 3 dimensions at the same time. This means that there are two instances of each atom, everything. X and X2, Y and Y2 and Z and Z2. I mean, that there exists a red cube in my example. It\u0027s position is X=31 , Y=12 and Z=13. But it also has another instance whose position is X2=81 , Y2=4 and Z=22, for example.
