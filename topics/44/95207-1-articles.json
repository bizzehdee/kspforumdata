It should have had the correct chemistry to allow life to emerge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMars and Earth have been trading meteorites throughout their histories. Rocks have been blasted off the surface of both planets by asteroid impacts and have travelled through space before falling as meteorites. Despite what happens to the outside of the meteorite, the \u003Cstrong\u003Einside\u003C/strong\u003E of the rock remains unsterilized. Mars was being hit by unsterilized rocks from Earth containing microbes at a time when it was capable of supporting life. Any microbes that may have evolved on Mars during the same warm and wet period would also have ended up on Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMars is known to have geothermally heated subsurface water. Life can easily survive and thrive in such conditions on Earth, so if there was ever life on Mars in the part, it\u0027s perfectly reasonable to expect to find it still living in subsurface water today. The geologically active areas on Mars where we would expect to find such water are releasing methane into the atmosphere. The source of this methane could be geological or biological, but either way, we know that the required geological conditions are present. The only way to know for sure whether there is microbial life in that water today is to use a drilling rig to drill down to the water and take samples.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf found, life on Mars may turn out to be descended from ancient Earth microbes that survived the trip to Mars inside a meteorite and subsequently took hold on Mars. In this case, there would be strong arguments for restoring Mars to a warm wet state through terraforming so that life from Earth can once again thrive there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn even greater discovery would be life descended from a completely separate genesis on Mars. All living things on Earth are descended from an ancient microbial common ancestor.
