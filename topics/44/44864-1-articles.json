The crafts used to get us there!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026amp; then I thought, hay if you gave anybody else my age the given materials I could build a rocket and leave earths orbit circum-navigate the moon in orbit, sling shot around and come back to earth. But that isn\u0027t going to happen, but what I could do is build a smaller sub-orbital \u0022 model \u0022 rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am just wondering if anybody on the forums here, would like me to upload photo\u0027s on progress / work I have done. But I also add that it will be a bit off a slow project ( as of the funding ) but it will be a fun science project. I would be happy to receive any input / advice too!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efeel free to PM or just post a comment on here!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers, Ryan!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thaniel","CreatedById":11130,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T22:35:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice thought. One problem many of us face with this is our governments who think that private people should not be allowed to build and launch model rockets, since they can so easily be turned into ICBM\u0027s (or something just as devastating). So my question for you is: have you though of what kind of fuel to go for? Solid? Hybrid? Liquid?And secondly, you mention suborbital, I atleast think of a rocket that is able to go beyond the Karman line, but not reach orbit proper. Or did you mean just \u0022realy realy high\u0022?I know that if you just want to reach well past the 100km mark with a rather small payload, it\u0027s quite possible to do using solids, and relatively cheap materials. After all, sounding rockets used by universities here and there aren\u0027t realy too large or advanced, but they still reach high altitudes. When I say \u0022cheap\u0022 and \u0022simple\u0022, it\u0027s a relative term.Anyway, I wish you luck, even if it ends up being just a small one (or ten) reaching just a few km up. The fun is (as I see it) in learning, building, then, if possible, launching. Or just run a hot test on the ground, and build the next one a bit better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpeach","CreatedById":34566,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T22:40:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t have these problem if you go in the international waters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever,you *might* have some problems finding the materials,getting the launch that float on the water and,I know it\u0027s going to sound ridiculous but you may have problem getting in the international waters!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wakairyu","CreatedById":41878,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T23:07:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehello, I am planning on making my propellant from solid fuel. I have a few very nice mixtures. I am yet to test which of the 3 works best, or if i can infuse all 3 to make a really powerful mix. and by sub orbital I am not really planning on anything to large. I was thinking that for my first attempt 1.5km - 2.5km high, with recovery. as I am planning on adding in altimeter \u0026amp; telemetry modules ( also enables me to deploy a drogue parachute and then a main chute at 500ft. then allowing me to upload the data to my computer to view flight data, speeds, e.t.c. and I have gotten authority from the government to build and launch this rocket as well.

You\u0027ll probably run into all sorts of regulations if you try to make money off of it, but so longs as its a purely \u0022amateur\u0022\u003Csup\u003E*\u003C/sup\u003E project, it falls under umbrella of amateur rocketry laws which are quite flexible. You would need a high power license which is not that difficult to obtain, and if you are launching anything serious, you should inform FAA so that they can issue a NOTAM to prevent a plane from flying into it. But all of this is fairly straight forward. It\u0027s not something you have to be a mega-corp to set up and file. Compared to the challenge of actually building a rocket that can reach space, let alone establish orbit, getting permissions for one is easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, first \u0022amateur\u0022\u003Csup\u003E*\u003C/sup\u003E rocket only reached space in something like 2010, and nobody came even close to establishing orbit yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Csup\u003E*\u003C/sup\u003E \u0022Amateur\u0022 in this context simply means non-commercial.
