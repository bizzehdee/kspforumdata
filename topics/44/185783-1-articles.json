that was not enough knowledge for Man to fly?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWilbur Wright uttered the \u003Cstrong\u003Emetaphor,\u003C/strong\u003E \u0022a propeller is nothing but a twisted wing\u0022, which was a novel idea then to be communicated but it may be more helpful these days to think that both are just airfoils -- similar as airfoils but different in other ways.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI personally guess that it is probable that you cannot deflect air efficiently (without undue turbulence) without understanding less obvious effects such as Bernoulli\u0027s and I wouldn\u0027t be at all surprised if a modern aeronautics 4-year program starts with 3 days to verify a student is sufficiently familiar with Newton\u0027s Laws and their implications and \u003Cu\u003Ethen spends the rest of the time on fluid dynamics\u003C/u\u003E and more.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the definition of a wing includes rubber-band powered balsa wings you can see that deflection of air is the purpose but when you look at the particular shape of a modern wing (an airfoil) and you ask \u0022well, what makes this an airfoil and not a plank?\u0022, you get the first glimmer that what is going on on the way to producing the final result (including displacement of air) is quite a bit more subtle.\u00A0 (If you don\u0027t think this is important in modern aeronautics then consider that some of the first prototype parachutes were made of balsa wood -- and they did not work...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeing \u0022correct\u0022 is fine but not so much fun when you have to accept that you are also being simplistic -- and dating yourself back in a pre-flight era.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, if you don\u0027t think there isn\u0027t something a bit more surprising going on than simply sticking your hand out of a car\u0027s open window, then think about a sailing dinghy tacking upwind.\u00A0 You might be certain that the sail is somehow deflecting air but you will have little hope of explaining how it does it unless you know[*] a lot more than Newton\u0027s Third.\u00A0 This is where \u0022a propeller is nothing but a twisted wing\u0022 (in the 21st) equals a closed mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Thought experiment: predict

some flight regimes\u0022 qualification.\u00A0 Passengers today spend the great majority of their time airborne at cruise altitude/speed in a regime optimized for very low angle of attack.\u00A0 At that speed, lots of lift can be produced but little (comparatively) is needed.\u00A0 (The article I cited in the other thread was criticized for being wrong in one point but it made the point quite well that a small pressure differential over a large wing area can easily generate the required lift for \u003Cu\u003Elevel flight at high speed.\u003C/u\u003E)\u00A0 At the same time, drag at high speed is a killer and the design effort needs to absolutely minimize it, which means eliminate turbulence and minimize any net deflection of the air.\u00A0 In this regime, if Bernoulli\u0027s effect actually exists at all, it may be that it is completely sufficient in and of itself to provide the required lift.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(The reason this is particularly interesting to me can

the result and see that he has made small changes and the machine flies with some discernible inefficiencies in certain regimes, but by the time it has reached its top speed, the angle of attack is

circles for decades which ought to be a clear signal to the alert that this is not a black-or-white proposition.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\ntherefore being \u0022correct\u0022 does not mean the

It is certainly true that momentum will be conserved, but perhaps that was not enough knowledge for Man to fly?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWilbur Wright uttered the \u003Cstrong\u003Emetaphor,\u003C/strong\u003E \u0022a propeller is nothing but a twisted wing\u0022, which was a novel idea then to be communicated but it may be more helpful these days to think that both are just airfoils -- similar as airfoils but different in other ways.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI personally guess that it is probable that you cannot deflect air efficiently (without undue turbulence) without understanding less obvious effects such as Bernoulli\u0027s and I wouldn\u0027t be at all surprised if a modern aeronautics 4-year program starts with 3 days to verify a student is sufficiently familiar with Newton\u0027s Laws and their implications and \u003Cu\u003Ethen spends the rest of the time on fluid dynamics\u003C/u\u003E and more.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the definition of a wing includes rubber-band powered balsa wings you can see that deflection of air is the purpose but when you look at the particular shape of a modern wing (an airfoil) and you ask \u0022well, what makes this an airfoil and not a plank?\u0022, you get the first glimmer that what is going on on the way to producing the final result (including displacement of air) is quite a bit more subtle.\u00A0 (If you don\u0027t think this is important in modern aeronautics then consider that some of the first prototype parachutes were made of balsa wood -- and they did not work...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeing \u0022correct\u0022 is fine but not so much fun when you have to accept that you are also being simplistic -- and dating yourself back in a pre-flight era.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, if you don\u0027t think there isn\u0027t something a bit more surprising going on than simply sticking your hand out of a car\u0027s open window, then think about a sailing dinghy tacking upwind.\u00A0 You might be certain that the sail is somehow deflecting air but you will have little hope of explaining how it does it unless you know[*] a lot more than Newton\u0027s Third.\u00A0 This is where \u0022a propeller is nothing but a twisted wing\u0022 (in the 21st) equals a closed mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Thought experiment: predict what happens if you place spoiling devices on the windward side of the sail and then on the leeward and measure the respective differences in performance of the yacht??\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe debate \u0027between\u0027 bernoulli and newton with respect to aviation is not a debate. It\u0027s a conflict between people of varying degree of knowledge and scientific credentials.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWings, propellers, rotors, or anything which moves through a fluid can have it\u0027s behavior and performance predicted by physics. The term \u0022bernoulli\u0022 gets thrown around, but all Bernoulli taught is that pressure drops linearly with an increase in velocity. That knowledge can be combined with the unwaveringly true 3rd law, which states that momentum must be conserved.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA flat plate makes lift the same way an airfoil does - when you tilt a flat plate, the stagnation point changes which acts on the fluid (usually air) in such a way as to cause a pressure drop above the surface. This pressure drop is responsible for the creation of the lifting force. It is also responsible for an increase in drag - usually called induced drag.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAn airfoil is far more complex a shape, but for good cause - the geometry of an airfoil is intended to streamline the wing area upon which the reduced pressure in the fluid is acting. With the reduced pressure comes an increase in the speed of the fluid flow over the top of the wing. Pressure and Velocity are linked linearly, but momentum goes up with the square of velocity.

Boundary layers are thicker where fluid flow is slower, and thinner where it is faster - Kutta allows a simpler means of determine a \u0027true\u0027 performance analysis of an airfoil by helping approximate an effective shape of a given foil (assuming the analysis parameters hold to all of Kutta\u0027s constraints) such that it can be analyzed using inviscid principles.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a nutshell, Kutta/Joukowski is typically used for very niche applications such as cruise regimes of large craft.

Induced drag is the component of drag which increases linearly with lift, and the square of velocity. Lift can be determined using Coefficient of lift and velocity, using the lift equation: L=A*Cl*q, where A is the wing area, Cl is the coefficient of lift, and q is dynamic pressure (1/2 *density*velocity-squared). Induced drag can be calculated using the equation:\u00A0Cdi = (Cl^2) / (pi * AR * e) where Cl is coefficient of lift, pi is... pi (3.1415926....), AR is the aspect ratio and e is an efficiency factor. Now, I\u0027m pretty sure KSP doesn\u0027t calculate AR or e, but maybe it has an assumed e and does calculate AR? AR is a ratio of span versus area - longer spans have a higher AR and better efficiency too. This is why airliners and gliders have very long wings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt any rate, from these equations we can see that an increase in wing area will increase lift without increasing the drag except by the amount of inherent parasitic drag the wing member creates. Parasitic drag is usually orders of magnitude lower than induced drag. The more wing area a craft has, the less angle of attack it needs, and as a result the Cl can remain low. A low Cl means low induced drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom what I\u0027ve observed, KSP doesn\u0027t technically calculate induced drag, but drag definitely increases with angle-of attack. What I\u0027ve found with craft in KSP that have a hard time reaching high speed is that they either: A) lack enough wing wing area to remain aloft in the subsonic range without a significant angle-of-attack and thus create more drag that prevents more speed, B) have a high parts with lots of drag cubes that keeps total drag too high to achieve supersonic performance.\u00A0Remember that any angle of attack, positive or negative, means the entire fuselage is also exposed to the relative wind (airflow around the craft) which means that the various fuselage parts being to make their own drag. By keeping the angle of attack, of both the wings and fuselage, as low as possible - drag is minimized. As a result, short fuselages with minimal wing tend to do best. Think F22 instead of SR71. Long fuselages can contribute lots of drag unless the wing area and incidence angle (rotation of wing relative the body) are tweaked just-so.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-25T17:04:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223624809\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022185783\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221561440107\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002245577\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shpaget\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 hours ago, Shpaget said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course props have variable geometry.
