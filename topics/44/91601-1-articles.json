The center of mass is ideally at a point located perfectly between all 3, and they must have carefully load balanced the cargo to achieve that, but obviously is not quite there. So you vary your throttle slightly, throttling back slightly on engines away from the CoM and throttling forward (or leaving them maxed) on the engines towards it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy would you tilt the engines at all?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E That doesn\u0027t help, it adds lateral velocity components and torque which you don\u0027t want. You only lose delta v with throttling back in the sense that the burns will take slightly longer and gravity drag makes the delta v needed slightly more. If you have slightly more engine thrust available than your setting at \u0022100% throttle\u0022 you won\u0027t have any change in net acceleration and won\u0027t lose any delta-v at all from your planned ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-29T22:59:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt only really matters until booster separation. During the booster assisted flight they needed to burn the SSME at a slight angle to compensate for the uneven mass distribution. Post separation they\u0027ll just keep pointing the thrust along the prograde vector and tilt the ship to keep the thrust aligned. So the only point where you have engines pointed at an angle to the prograde vector (And thus the optimal launch trajectory) is the booster assisted section. And that only lasts 2 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I reckon they did lose a bit, but not much.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-30T02:37:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t say it lost deltav, just that it used it inefficiently.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
