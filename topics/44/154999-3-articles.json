Since that is clearly not the case, women get the preferential treatment since some men who obtained better scores than some women were rejected simply because all male positions were already taken. This leads to an inferior candidate being employed simply based on gender, so the goal of 50/50 ratio can be met.

To start, a lack of copper, which you would need for wire for power systems. Sure, you could ship it up from Earth... but then we\u0027re shipping stuff from Earth. Avionics pose a different problem-there\u0027s no feasible way to build up enough infrastructure on the Moon to permit fabrication of the sorts of solid-state electronic you would need for spacecraft avionics. You probably wouldn\u0027t be able to make engines, either, because of a lack of the kinds of precision machining you would need to make turbopumps. Fuel would also prove problematic. It would have to be LH-LOX or LH NTR, since the Moon lacks the carbon, nitrogen, chlorine, and fluorine needed for any other propellant combinations. Unfortunately, both require hydrogen.. which you would have to extract from the scant supplies of water present on the Moon. Fuel tanks would also be a problem, since you would (somehow) have to manufacture cryogenic tanks using only resources on the Moon... And, on that subject, if you want to use NTRs you have to build a nuclear reactor on the Moon, find uraninite (somehow), and refine it (somehow). All of which are problematic. Of course, you could ship the uranium from Earth... but that\u0027s dangerous and expensive, since uranium is so heavy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short, building things on the Moon sounds like a nice idea due to the composition of the regolith, until one starts looking at what that would actually entail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Carl","CreatedById":2645,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-26T23:28:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou do know theres a hell of a lot of aluminium wire out there right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore importantly ass i noted, people a lot more knowledge than us sat down and determined that actually, yes it is possibble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m also not sure why you think this or that or the other would be missing.
