I\u0027m guessing, that thread got lost with many others in the crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, yes, relative velocities are too high. But if, say, you used a really long and really strong bungee chord to attach yourself (or your ship) to the station, if nothing breaks, you\u0027ll end up with a weighted average of the two velocities (weighted by mass due to conservation of momentum). Whether that puts you and the station on re-entry path or if you stay on orbit will depend on exact trajectories and masses. But station\u0027s orbit will most certainly change.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbface","CreatedById":58573,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T06:11:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think this is just a case of people\u0027s tendency to liken space with airflight. Like if a ship is shot or blows up, the wreckage will fall, they might sometimes think of a reentry trajectory hitting a station as being like someone jumping and landing on a plane, the plane will still fly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
