Personally, I felt that high school wasn\u0027t that bad, and university is, in fact, a lot of fun (I\u0027m on a work term right now, but that\u0027s another matter). So, here\u0027s my question to you, the assembled intellect of the KSP community:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow would you go about reforming the American educational system? What would you change/scrap/implement?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I\u0027m very much in favour of open-ended learning, at least in subjects that support it (history, the sciences, computer programming). In the US, the trend over the last 10-20 years (at least in the public educational system) has been a shift away from that, towards memorization- and testing-based education (all the better to quantify student progress to the bureaucrats with). However, such a paradigm has the unfortunate side effect of making kids hate knowledge and hate learning - if learning is hard and tedious work, what reason would a student have to enjoy it? High schools are worst for this - at a time when students are first beginning to develop their own attitudes and opinions, the educational system seems specifically geared towards breeding resentment towards knowledge and learning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut how to reverse this trend?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my view, the answer is threefold:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Get the bureaucrats to lay off. Less demand for statistics for their portfolios means less pressure to produce test scores, which means less debasement of the curriculum (in order to produce higher test scores, of course - add in the fact that TEACHERS have been known to cheat on the tests as well, manually filling in hundreds of correct answers before sending them for grading), as well as less standardized testing in general.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Reduce class sizes. It\u0027s been well-known for a while that a teacher cannot adequately support learning at the elementary- or high-school level past a class size of about 30 - too many students demanding the teacher\u0027s time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Replace the \u0022standardized learning\u0022 paradigm with something more open-ended - especially at the high school level. Cramming facts and figures and names and dates into the heads of students isn\u0027t useful (especially in the Information Age), and runs a significant risk of missing the bigger picture - WHY is this fact or figure or name or date significant? What did that person accomplish, in the broader context of history/chemistry/politics? In my personal view, a more research-based curriculum is the ideal - students are allowed to pick a topic (within the confines of the subject matter, naturally) and sent to research it independently, with minimal teacher oversight. Picking a topic allows students to remain engaged, as they are likely to pick one in which they are interested. Some basic instruction is necessary, of course, but it should be of a form that emphasizes context and the bigger picture over memorization of facts and figures. For instance, rather than \u0022this is a hydrocarbon, it has this chemical structure, repeat after me\u0022, the lesson would be more along the lines of \u0022this is a hydrocarbon, it has this chemical structure, can anyone think of why that is the case? Why do other hydrocarbons have different structures? Do other hydrocarbons with similar structures behave in similar ways?\u0022 This format encourages independent learning and inquiry, and is much less likely to turn students off of learning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are the thoughts of the KSP community on all this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. PLEASE don\u0027t post any complaints about school here. I\u0027m looking to start a constructive discussion on how the system could be changed for the better, and am not here to hate on it.

Not to mention that the american educational system is probably one of the worse ones in western countries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso in general you cant let kids choose to much. They have to get a basic knowledge. Point is most of those kids will not know what they want to do later on anyhow and many of them would probably just choose whatever is easiest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA thing i would change - which is rather easy is to make progression more dynamic so that smarter kids can progress trough classes faster and less smarter kids slower. The target should be to get everyone to a certain level while still giving them the chance to learn more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in the end a better educational system is not a question of new ideas but about people willing to spend money with taxes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-07T15:31:51Z\u0022 title=\u002209/07/2013 03:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SpaceHole\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Endeavour","CreatedById":21125,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-07T15:46:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis may be a bit off topic, but as an American in high school right now, I think that more students need to understand the purpose of what they are learning.

At least in many peoples opinions, that is. It is an old system, and as a counter-argument to SpaceHole , teenagers aren\u0027t mindless. Kids can be genius. But the current education system doesn\u0027t let them be. I am a young leader for my local scout troop, and I can say that the 12-14 year old there can work really well together when they are having fun and with a bit of leadership. But at school they will put in little effort and, at scout meeting, complain about school. They can really put their minds to something, they just won\u0027t.

Children are naturally curious, but primary education seems especially geared to grind curiosity out of them, as opposed to rewarding it. Because of the formatting of standardized tests, teaching facts and figures (which, naturally, appear on the test) is encouraged over allowing students to roam over the subject matter (set guidelines, but allow them to explore, which helps with preventing the \u0022Lady Gaga problem\u0022, mentioned above - think of a restricted sandbox, and you get the basic picture). The end result is, of course, children that hate knowledge, because to them, knowledge is uninteresting, dry, and reeks of authoritarian teachers trying to shove it into their heads. I\u0027ve found that, overall, ESPECIALLY at the high-school level, allowing students some free reign over the material (again, with guidelines and a certain amount of teacher approval) generally results in higher student satisfaction and engagement. Perfect example: my grade 11 ancient history class (yes, it was nominally an elective, but it was part of a set of alternatives - either ancient history, or another science, or something to that effect - that you needed to graduate, which means that a lot of the students there weren\u0027t necessarily history buffs). There were a number of different \u0022free-range\u0022 projects - a couple of my favourites were the paired assignments: given the technology of the time and the material you\u0027ve learned in class, devise a plan for the construction of Stonehenge (and, for the second assignment, in greater detail, the Egyptian Pyramids). The final project was a combination research paper/seminar - I was no slouch (yes, I\u0027m ever so modest, aren\u0027t I?), and I was very impressed with some of the other students\u0027 presentations - ironically enough, some of the students I believed to be academic underperformers actually turned in some of the best projects. The thing that set this project apart was that the subject of the paper could be anything related to the class material - I personally chose to do a comparative study of ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian architecture, which was something I found interesting, but had not been covered in class at all. I got the teacher\u0027s sign-off on it, and off I went. That\u0027s the kind of open-field learning I advocate for - a sandbox, with boundaries, to allow exploration and expansion on the core material.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
