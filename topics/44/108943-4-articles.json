I responded that it could only do that when expendable, and with a upper stage, so it was cheating. It was not supposed to be reusable.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E And what you propose would basically be a reusable SLS with a hypergol upper stage. BTW, Hypergols are not cheap anymore due to enivronmental and handling costs. And any design that needs NTRs is a unrealistic dream. I know KSPers love NTR, but still...\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Today, you\u0027d just use a SLS w/o upper stage (IUS would be used for MEO, GEO, and planetary robotic missions, while Exploration Upper Stage is used for manned lunar and asteroid missions.) with 2x F-1C Dynetics-esque boosters. These would land vertically via smaller landing engines (which can also serve as booster verniers). The SSMEs would be reused Vulcan-style, with helicopter recovery, while the core would be expendable. Even then, since Dynetics \u002B SLS Block I could launch 120T to LEO, you would have a lot of payload capacity left over. So much, you might be able to just put a massive inflatable heat shield on the core, then return both the tanks and the engines via parafoil and horizontal landing on a runway. The deorbit burn would be done by disposable small solid motors. The boosters can\u0027t be reused like this since you would need jet engines to do so, and those would increase the complexity enormously.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Actually, fuel tanks are about 45% of cost (excluding avionics). They are cheap in terms of mass-to cost ratio, but not in actual cost. However, disposing tanks are a good way of getting the most payload out of a RLV, while keeping costs down as much as possible.\n\u003E \n\nHmm. A single SLS first stage with propulsive-landing-flyback boosters, that returns to Earth by a massive inflatable heat shield, and glides to the runway via parafoils.

Something fairly alien in appearance, like an isoceles-triangular hyperboloid lifting body with an elliptic cross-section. The boosters would all strap on to one side, perhaps with a gap in between them for a raised payload bay. Double linear aerospike on the orbiter, but running the same fuel as the boosters, obviously.\n\nIf you really wanted to get creative, it could even glide in to kill velocity and then descend vertically on overengineered SuperDraco OMS engines. That way you don\u0027t have to directly factor in extra weight for landing gear or wings, but you still get the advantage of gliding return, lowered terminal velocity, and propulsive landing.

Payload bay is the same size as the Shuttle Orbiter\u0027s, but the lack of control surfaces allows surrounding space to be used for additional fuel.\n\nThe engine is a truncated aerospike:\n\n![truncated_aerospike.png](http://s16.postimg.org/8l48vk3hx/truncated_aerospike.png)\n\nThe high-thrust aerospike engines provide optimal thrust and Isp respective to altitude.\n\nOptional/detachable cabin:\n\n![cabin.png](http://s16.postimg.org/mp043yaph/cabin.png)\n\nThe crew cabin module has about half as much space as the Shuttle Orbiter but three times the space of the Dragon V2. It fits into the main body and is equipped with multiple high-thrust hypergolic engines which also act as the OMS and RCS system. These allow the crew cabin to eject during launch abort.\n\nFor crew transfer only, the payload bay is fitted with an additional internal tank and a disposable strap-on tank, allowing SSTO with the loss of the external tank alone. For unmanned flights, the crew cabin module is replaced with an autonomous control module with an auxiliary fuel tank but the same hypergolic engines. For manned flights including payload, or for higher-dV unmanned missions, 2-4 strap-on FH-style boosters are attached with propellant crossfeed; these detach at fairly low speed to return autonomously.\n\nRe-entry will be...exciting. The aerospike already has to be able to handle very high heat fluxes and will probably already be actively cooled, so the orbiter enters tail-first and upside down to burn off most of its speed, with active use of the RCS system for stabilization. As soon as enough speed has dropped off, the orbiter begins to rotate forward, exposing more and more of its underside. The lower speed at this point means that the heat shield on its underside can be constructed of a lightweight, non-ablative, lower-performing, highly reusable material rather than requiring the tiles that the Shuttle used. Active RCS stabilization continues as speed decreases, ultimately entering a low-L/D gliding flight:\n\n![re_entry_profile.png](http://s28.postimg.org/ukh4pqsel/re_entry_profile.png)\n\nThe orbiter does not make a very good glider and cannot manage a level approach, which is all the better because it doesn\u0027t have heavy landing gear. Instead, the RCS system returns the craft to a high angle of attack, and the aerospike engines are ignited, killing terminal velocity in a near-suicide burn. Then, the RCS system reduces power, allowing the angle of attack to drop until the orbiter is horizontal, and both the RCS system and the aerospike engines in combination fire to lower the orbiter to the ground:\n\n![Landing_approach.png](http://s29.postimg.org/v3zopba8n/Landing_approach.png)\n\nIf the aerospike cannot be directed downward enough to execute such a landing, then additional RCS thrusters can be incorporated in the aft portion of the orbiter.\n\nAmbitious? Perhaps...but it seems like the best possible combination of geometry to allow for the capabilities of the shuttle with next-generation technology.\n\nThe amount of hypergolic fuel, internal fuel, and the number of strap-on boosters can be adapted to each mission. By using in-orbit staging and/or refueling, the orbiter could easily manage a lunar transfer. Depending on the fuel capacity of the crew cabin, it could manage a landing on its own on hypergolics, or lunar-orbit refueling could allow the entire orbiter to make the descent to the lunar surface and return to refuel and make the transfer to LEO again. The ability to take off and land vertically in a horizontal attitude reduces the instabilities and risks of vertical landings and allows far simpler crew egress.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-09T21:48:28Z\u0022 title=\u002202/09/2016 09:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 9, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by sevenperforce**"},{"CreatedByName":"Emperor of the Titan Squid","CreatedById":158183,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-09T21:44:27Z","Content":"I say that we make the first stage tanks built in and reusable, winged or Saturn shuttle style.Baikal boosters, falcon style upper stage.

Yes, the shuttle did that, but with today\u0027s hindsight it was clearly a bad idea that forced them into an inherently unsafe design. What about all those times you just want to swap a few ISS astronauts? You\u0027re wasting the costly launch of a heavy-lifter, unless you just happen to also have a new space station module or 50 tons of satellites ready to lift as well. \n\nMy support would go to dual programs. The smaller crewed craft would be \u003E99% reusable, and nothing lost but fairings and SRBs on the cargo craft. Both should have simple enough support requirements that they could theoretically reposition to, and operate from, any simple spaceport worldwide with a single custom-built support building. The idea being to sell or lease them, rather than the manufacturer operating them.\n\nThe crew version, if winged, could perhaps be something like [Faget\u0027s DC-3 shuttle](https://sites.google.com/site/spaceodysseytwo/stg1969/s_nar70a.jpg). Yes, wings are wasteful but my goal isn\u0027t to be the most efficient, but to have the highest safety and lowest operating costs. Half a dozen astronauts and their gear don\u0027t mass very much, and being able to land either under power or with a shuttle-style glide is one heck of a safety feature.\n\nFor vertical launch systems, the 2016 version of Falcon 9 gets impressively close to qualifying. They\u0027re already assembled horizontally in a hangar, and have pretty simple support requirements, so no trouble there. But it isn\u0027t reusable enough yet. I\u0027d want to see 2nd stages recovered and reused, and we\u0027d have to do something about that trunk.

It fits into the main body and is equipped with multiple high-thrust hypergolic engines which also act as the OMS and RCS system. These allow the crew cabin to eject during launch abort.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E For crew transfer only, the payload bay is fitted with an additional internal tank and a disposable strap-on tank, allowing SSTO with the loss of the external tank alone. For unmanned flights, the crew cabin module is replaced with an autonomous control module with an auxiliary fuel tank but the same hypergolic engines. For manned flights including payload, or for higher-dV unmanned missions, 2-4 strap-on FH-style boosters are attached with propellant crossfeed; these detach at fairly low speed to return autonomously.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Re-entry will be...exciting. The aerospike already has to be able to handle very high heat fluxes and will probably already be actively cooled, so the orbiter enters tail-first and upside down to burn off most of its speed, with active use of the RCS system for stabilization. As soon as enough speed has dropped off, the orbiter begins to rotate forward, exposing more and more of its underside. The lower speed at this point means that the heat shield on its underside can be constructed of a lightweight, non-ablative, lower-performing, highly reusable material rather than requiring the tiles that the Shuttle used. Active RCS stabilization continues as speed decreases, ultimately entering a low-L/D gliding flight:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![re_entry_profile.png](http://s28.postimg.org/ukh4pqsel/re_entry_profile.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The orbiter does not make a very good glider and cannot manage a level approach, which is all the better because it doesn\u0027t have heavy landing gear. Instead, the RCS system returns the craft to a high angle of attack, and the aerospike engines are ignited, killing terminal velocity in a near-suicide burn. Then, the RCS system reduces power, allowing the angle of attack to drop until the orbiter is horizontal, and both the RCS system and the aerospike engines in combination fire to lower the orbiter to the ground:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![Landing_approach.png](http://s29.postimg.org/v3zopba8n/Landing_approach.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If the aerospike cannot be directed downward enough to execute such a landing, then additional RCS thrusters can be incorporated in the aft portion of the orbiter.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Ambitious? Perhaps...but it seems like the best possible combination of geometry to allow for the capabilities of the shuttle with next-generation technology.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The amount of hypergolic fuel, internal fuel, and the number of strap-on boosters can be adapted to each mission. By using in-orbit staging and/or refueling, the orbiter could easily manage a lunar transfer. Depending on the fuel capacity of the crew cabin, it could manage a landing on its own on hypergolics, or lunar-orbit refueling could allow the entire orbiter to make the descent to the lunar surface and return to refuel and make the transfer to LEO again. The ability to take off and land vertically in a horizontal attitude reduces the instabilities and risks of vertical landings and allows far simpler crew egress.\n\u003E \n\nWouldn\u0027t making the rocket a little larger and packing fuel for supersonic retro prop be easier and a lot less risky?\n\nAlso, what are you using for Hypergolic/OMS/RCS?\n\nWhere\u0027s the docking port?\n\nAlso, the external tank thing in the cargo bay bothers me.
