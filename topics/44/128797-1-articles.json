Now\u00A0I know they talk about midi-chlorians and that stuff, but in terms of real physics, I figured there is an explanation for most force powers (although no explanation on how these are controlled). I figured that it essentially boils down to the control of 2 of the fundamental forces: Gravity and electromagnetism. Control of gravity would explain how Force users can move objects around with their mind (by creating gravitational fields), and other powers such as force lightning are easily explained by control of electromagnetism (inducing a very strong electric\u00A0current in a particular direction). Now the Jedi mind tricks is somewhat harder to explain, but I figured that it can also be explained by electromagnetism: The Force user simply induces tiny electric currents in the neurons of the victim\u0027s brain, causing them to do what they are told to. Well, this is just an attempt to explain using real physics something that can\u0027t really be explained (and isn\u0027t really ment to), (also makes no attempt to explain\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ehow\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the Force user controls this), but what do you think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-28T22:43:06Z\u0022 title=\u002212/28/2015 10:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by A35K\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-28T22:38:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt just magic.
