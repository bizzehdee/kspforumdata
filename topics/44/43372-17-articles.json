You are mixing the scam/try. These are separate things. I am not scamming, I am the one trying. Singularly all of my effort amounts to the $40 and the 10 minutes it took me to get the application set up. The burden is on MarsOne to be a scam or not be a scam, nothing I do can affect that. Based on the presentations I watched and the information at my disposal at the time, there was no definite way of determining if MarsOne was a scam or not. In my opinion, there still isn\u0027t. Since there was no clearcut way of determining the scam-level of the company, there existed two possibilities for them, and two for me. Again, since nothing I can do would change that system, it made sense to buy in. Absolute worst case, I lost $40 and 10 minutes. Why should I care? It is less of a risk than kickstarter for a reward that I win either way (I get there or I don\u0027t, but either way I still have the happy feeling of knowing I did what I could).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe information I had stated that the way they intended to reduce costs was that they (for the most part) were NOT going to be developing anything. Their plan was (and to my knowledge, still is) buy things from people that are footing the dev cost themselves. For example, using the Falcon Heavy. They only need to pay the $50-100M cost of its use YEARS from now instead of the billions for dev costs. Considering the Falcon Heavy won\u0027t be launching any tests until August (unless that has changed since last I heard), you can\u0027t use the lack of any purchased launch vehicles against them. They have the option of going \u0027now\u0027 and paying the United Launch Alliance a billion dollars for the launch or they can wait a couple years and pay SpaceX a tenth or better what they would pay the ULA. Depending on exactly what they are doing with the rovers, its possible the same logic applies, they may still be in the discussion stage for exactly what they want the rovers to do (just be an examination bot like Curiosity for landing site judging? Or perhaps it is a construction bot?). These things take TIME in the real world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy job is a Systems Engineer, and for important systems the process involved in just choosing a color for an LED indicator takes several meetings, trade studies, and research power points. And that is just for an indicator light! Not something that actually does anything at all, no computation, no movement, etc. That may sound absurd, and to a point it is, but this is how a system gets made where everything is thought of, because almost literally every person on the project got to have a say in every aspect of the project. One person can make a massive mistake (ignoring red green colorblindness), one hundred people has a good chance of catching even the slightest of problems (at just the right orbit above mars, with the right orientation of the craft and the solar panel arrays, some light will bounce off the solar panels and shine through the window to land on the console, making it impossible to see that a warning light has started glowing the specific amber color you chose). And at ANY stage you can be forced to go back and start over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, it doesn\u0027t make much sense to purchase a crew cap or the transit stage craft until such a time as you actually know what your desired launch system can actually do. On that note, their plan for the transit stage was to basically pay one of the major contractors that had produced habitat modules for the ISS to build a near carbon copy of their module, just with redone internals to more suit their needs. The development costs are almost zero, they just need the tooling costs, labor, and materials for the most part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fact that they are waiting means they are not actually idiots. They are waiting to see if technologies that can drastically reduce the cost will pan out this year. During that time they continue to go through the selection process for their astronauts. This gives them plenty of time to make sure they make the \u0027right\u0027 decisions (clearly they have already failed though, as they booted me \u0026gt;\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E ) and to begin the training. From the information I have come across, they are doing tasks exactly as they said they were (with a little slippage in the time frame, but they made their schedule during the hope filled early years, so I don\u0027t blame them) and in an order that makes sense for what it is they can do with the money they currently have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might be my broken English that made you misunderstand me.

Your not a scammer, you\u0027re the scammee (I found a new word!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand the difference between creating your own system or use a proven one. The problem is that none of the systems Mars one wants to utilize has been proven to work. Or isn\u0027t up for the work it has to do. The Falcon heavy can (on paper) lift about 13 tonnes to Mars... That is half the weight of the Apollo spacecraft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the capsule, what capsule is Mars one going to use? Not only does it have to support a crew of 4 during the trip \u0026amp; the landing... It also has to serve the astronauts TILL THEY DIE. Not even the ISS is capable of doing that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd as a system engineer, you know that certain systems get old and get replaced. Are incompatible with new systems (I work in IT, think Windows XP expiring). Is MArs one sure that the first capsule is compatible with the new load 10 years later?
