One final OCM (Orbit Correction Manoeuvre) is planned for Friday which, assuming adequate Helium remains, will delay impact until the 30th.

Eventually it might become too much, but not anytime soon. Only the occasional object really collides. I can list less than half a dozen.

There will be a small field of its parts on Mercury\u0027s surface. And the people are screaming about \u0022polluting the universe\u0022, \u0022polluting Mercury\u0022.\n\nNot only it\u0027s terribly stupid because polluting a sterile, scorching hot wasteland is a silly thing to even think about, but also shows how high they think of themselves, as if we\u0027re capable of doing anything significant in our solar system. They don\u0027t have any understanding about how enormous space is and how little we are.\n\nEven if it was about orbiting, their pathetic cries about pollution do not consider that.
