I don\u0027t know how technical it gets later on (only about a 1/3 of the way through), but it provides an interesting perspective about what it is like being a contractor for such a major project.

The cast of characters includes the famous folks (Flight Directors, managers), Designers (Max Faget et. al.), Engine developers (the F1 stability story is particularly memorable...they had to set a bomb off within the thrust chamber and have the flow/vibrations stabilize within milliseconds), mission control guys, back room experts, and so on. This one book gives perhaps the best cross section of the engineering effort involved in developing the entire program that I\u0027ve ever read.
