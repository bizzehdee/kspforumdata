The Aerospike had the most delta-V, but it was just 30 m/s over the LV-T30 witch had 4948 m/s of delta-V. I say you should through out your Poodle engines and replace them with LV-T30 because they have nearly the same thrust, but the LV-T30 has nearly 500 more m/s of delta-V than the poodle. Tell me witch is the best injection burn stage based off of this chart.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Themohawkninja","CreatedById":9628,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T17:53:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEfficiency will technically always be better, but for the sake of orbital injection, you will need to balance enough thrust to get into orbit, with enough fuel to get into orbit withou adding too much weight in the form of engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xeldrak","CreatedById":57228,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T19:05:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, it depends on the sitiuation.

A skipper has the best looks and the high thrust simple make the burn less tedious. A poodle is also awesome if you want to land on it, because it\u0027s short.

The LV-N does things slowly and efficiently. However, during launch, every second you spend not yet in orbit is one more second that the planet is dragging you down. Slow won\u0027t do. You need all the power your ship can handle to get into orbit as quickly as possible to stop this bleeding loss of delta-v. Thats where the less efficient but more powerful rockets come in. Usually I go for Mainsails on launch, but on lighter craft without much fuel to burn, the medium thrust/medium efficiency engines are probably the better choice.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-03T04:39:55Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2013 04:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Gus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bunsen","CreatedById":10598,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T22:06:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELike almost every true/false question, the answer is \u0022definitely maybe.\u0022 Long burns are sometimes inherently inefficient, whether due to gravity losses (as Gus pointed out) or the Oberth effect (where your optimal efficiency is only available at periapsis, but much of your burn happens at higher altitide because it takes so long -- this happens a lot with interplanetary transfer burns). And there\u0027s always human impatience, which is why we don\u0027t do all our orbital maneuvering with ion engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the uselessness of the Poodle, you should take a look at what happens when you put some more payload mass on top of that tank. When the engine accounts for much of the stage\u0027s dry mass, engine mass has a huge influence on delta-v and the light engines look great (that\u0027s why the 24-77s look so good in your list -- they\u0027re light as hell, despite having crap I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E). But when there\u0027s a bunch of payload also, the engine mass has a smaller impact and the Poodle\u0027s high I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E often wins out over the T30\u0027s low mass -- and the 24-77s will look utterly terrible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
