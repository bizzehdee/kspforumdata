Not necessarily war but definitely an adventure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRockets lack reusability, and reusuable propulsion drives are what make space opera work. A fleet of staging rockets is an alternative along with electroplasma jets for air travel, but I did\u0027nt want to go that route either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I made up an almost tachyon rocket. I say almost because it is really photons, flying through a special gas medium that when ionized allows the light to travel at FTL speeds. The glass over the flashlight is specially made NOT to slow the light down to lightspeed as it passes through, but once the superluminal light passes through to the environment outside it\u00A0instantly shifts back\u00A0to lightspeed since the universe normally does not apparently permit FTL photons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe end result is a reusuable spaceship drive that can run on batteries or even a nuclear reactor. Since photons already produce thrust, but if you increased their speed dramatically then their thrust I imagine would also increase. Allowing for getting to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYet I did not want the drive to be capable of endless acceleration, so I figured a 60 minute charge that allows one to do 1g for an hour is sufficient. If one wanted to do 3g to help leave Earth for\u00A0orbit that would give you a charge of 3g for 20 min, but it should\u0027nt take that long (eight minutes about) .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if you wanted dangerous level accelerations you could do that too, but the charge would not last as long. For example, 10g would make you exhaust your charge in only 6 min.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll these calculatons were based on the division of 60 based on the number of g\u0027s accelerated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what I want to know is, did I get the math right? It is important because I need to know how much charge the ship has at any given time so I know what the ship can and cannot do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks also for previous answers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-05-17T17:40:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2019 05:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ESpelling\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-17T18:19:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the math is alright.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMostly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThrust is a change in momentum over a change in time.

I assumed one would not require power plant amounts of power since the special (fictional) gas medium makes light go FTL so long it is ionized. The only power imput from the ship involves ionizing the gas itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnless I arbitraily require vast amounts of energy to ionize this fictional gas, it should not require a lot of power to provide thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout the only bonus for using massive power loads to ionize the gas is that now your drive emits visible white rays like the sun in when in atmosphere. Looks awesome although blinding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYet if lower power levels produce high thrust as I think they would, the flashlight drive simply has a white glow that obscures the reflector inside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, I do find your inject propellant idea intriguing. I would have to adjust the physics to allow FTL light beams outside the nozzle, but the visual and sound effects would be awe inspiring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would make the beam itself just look like an EPIC sun ray flashlight, blowing lots of air but not actually propelling the ship UNTIL, one injects propellant. Which could be accelerated at at sublight but still arbtrarily high velocities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis a new limitation comes into plat with launching. If your ship is too massive, you WILL obliterate tour launch site. If you do not want that to happen, scale your ship size down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor that matter, make massive vessels modular so can land them in pieces and launch them piece by\u00A0piece\u00A0as well like\u00A0Ironman armour. Since orbital assembly would easy, especially with this drive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Exoplanet%20World%20Two%20Suns%20Spacesh\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022https://desktopwalls.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Exoplanet%20World%20Two%20Suns%20Spaceship%20Clouds%20Desktop%20Wallpaper.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-05-17T19:05:14Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2019 07:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EPucture\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
