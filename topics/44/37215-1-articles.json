The general answer is you take your initial and target orbits, which must intersect at the location of your maneuver, and calculate the orbital velocity vectors for the two orbits at the maneuver location. The maneuver delta-V is the vector difference between those two velocities.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SolarLiner","CreatedById":41047,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T21:02:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou consider two Vector3: before and after maneuver speeds.

They are never efficient, however. The only time you should do radial/anti-radial is for small corrections to meet the target at an intercept.
