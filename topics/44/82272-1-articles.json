Though, it does have some very neat ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat it comes down to is that if you wanted to come up with a world which is much like our own, and would be indistinguishable from just some basic observations, it\u0027s not that hard. But we have too much data. There are satellites, the GPS system, cosmology and all sorts of obsrervations of the space around us. The topography which includes curvature, the time zones, and just general topology of the world. And then there are experiments that look at Earht\u0027s gravity variations and measure the rotation due to inertial effects. Too many points of data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, it\u0027s entirely possible, and almost rivial, even, to construct a coordinate system which is entirely cyllindrical, in which Earth\u0027s surface is a disc. (Ok, technically, one point will be missing in the mapping. But you can\u0027t physically approach it.) Then you can construct differential geometry that allows for entire universe, with all of the bodies in heaven to move the way they do. And at the Earth\u0027s surface we\u0027d be experiencing the gravity that we do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem is, this is just a coordinate transformation. It\u0027s taking the world as we typically think of it and casting it in a weird coordinate system. Physics allows for it. It\u0027s the same sort of deal as with making Earth the center of the universe. You\u0027ll end up with all sorts of weird laws for motions of things, but otherwise, it will be entirely sensible.
