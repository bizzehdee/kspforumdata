You overcome it a similar way. You use filtered sensors that have extremely narrow fields of view, and they scan across the sky very rapidly, and you correlate the inputs from several such sensors to search the sky in 3 dimensions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou probably do this digitally with massive sensor arrays that are sensitive to the phase of incoming light. You can then digitally focus on different areas of the input and thus filter out the bright decoys.

V is directly related to the pressure inside the storage vessel. When you open the valve and the gas starts hissing out, the velocity slows down as the tank empties.
