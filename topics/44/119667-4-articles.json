Both are very close to the theoretical maximum ISP for LFOx engines. The difference between the B-X and the SSME is that the shuttle engine is designed to run both at lift-off and in space, the second is a second/third stage engine designed to carry payload to its final destination. THe SSME does not have the advantage of moderate burns, at lift off it might be pushed to 109%, and at the thrust, temperatures, and heat transfers it has to keep vapor locks from developing in either of the too pumps.

So what dominates electric drives, all of them, is the radiator mass, since radiating is the only way to get rid of heat in space. It is the crucial weak point in ALL electric drives. Because here you can\u0027t really invent anything, you are limited by very basic equations we have known for ages, and those say the weight of the drive system is dominated by the weight of the cooling system. Which uses \u003Cem\u003Elots\u003C/em\u003E of pumps and fluid engineering. And let me tell you, those haven\u0027t changed much since the last \u003Cem\u003Ecentury\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow there is another problem related to heat people often forget. How cold is your cold side? Because you can cheat a bit with the ideal gas law by compressing and expanding gasses to change their temperature (at a cost in energy), but you really can\u0027t go too far without seriously staging your system, which adds complexity and mass really quick, and produces additional sources of low-level heat (which is basically stuff heating below the temperature your radiator works at but still over their working temperature). Also, this is where all spacecraft start to resemble a plumber\u0027s worst nightmare. So how do you keep your fancy superconductors and control electronics cool when you run your fancy droplet radiator at 1600\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BAK with liquid lithium? Yeah, a sad fact: all those exotic radiator concepts that give orders of magnitude less mass than what spacecraft use today? They are only really capable of taking heat out of high-temperature machinery like, say, a bulky fission reactor. Which is why spacecraft use today what they use, and why VASIMIR is even deader than the analysis we have done here imply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might be wondering now how is it that commsats and probes and such can run ion engines without issues. The answer is simple: they are already designed to handle the kilowatts of waste heat their solar panels generate, whether they use the small fraction (~15-20%) of power that gets turned into electricity, or not. And kilowats is a long way from drive systems that have to be in the gigawatt range to fulfil that absurd \u002239 days to Mars\u0022 really-high-energy trajectory with a ship in the hundreds of tonnes. Hundreds of tonnes vs Gigawatts in heat... really, that can\u0027t go well in those proportions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune. Why would you want to shorten the trip below a Hohmann anyhow?
