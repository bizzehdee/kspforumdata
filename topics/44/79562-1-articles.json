Obviously, even the blow-out panel would be able to handle the pressure produced by the SRB plus the standard factor of safety (I believe it\u0027s 1.25 in rocketry), but if it was a bit weaker than the rest of the booster, then a pressure failure would simply blow out the panel and extinguish combustion due to pressure loss, instead of destroying the whole rocket. Of course, doing so would force a mission abort, but it would seem that such a design would give the crew of the rocket a greater chance of survival, since the rocket as a whole would survive the initial rupture, allowing the LES to pull the capsule to safety, rather than the whole rocket exploding, potentially before even an auto-abort system could be activated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a disclaimer, I\u0027m no expert on rocket design, so this may be a completely stupid idea. Even I can think of some potential issues -- intentionally weakening a section of an SRB could lead to production issues whereby the panel could accidentally be made \u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E thin (i.e. due to someone setting the tool used to create the panel to an incorrect thickness), and the rapid rise in aerodynamic drag caused by blowing out a section of the SRB could cause the launch vehicle to tumble or break-up, complicating the design of an effective abort system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, since it appears that there are a considerable number of knowledgeable people on this forum who may be able to answer my question, would such a design in any way improve launch vehicle safety?

I thought that if the pressure inside a solid/hybrid rocket motor falls to or near that of the outside atmosphere, the motor would stop burning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn another note, what\u0027s the general safety info on hybrid rocket motors that use non-monoprop oxidizers like liquid oxygen? It would seem like they\u0027d be safer, since they\u0027re more tolerant of fuel grain errors than liquids, and are quite simple if a pressure-fed, pintle injector, valveless design is used. This, combined with the fact they use stable, nontoxic, cheap propellants like LOX and paraffin, and don\u0027t require special treatment while being handled, would seem to make them a good low-cost alternative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only problem with hybrids seems to be that:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) They have a very low regression rate (although the paraffin-based fuel used by SPG seems to solve that issue).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) From what I\u0027ve heard from Copenhagen Suborbitals\u0027 use of hybrids, they seem to be prone to combustion instability (could a pintle injector solve this problem? I\u0027ve heard that they\u0027re inherently stable).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Because of problem 1, a complex \u0022wagon wheel\u0022 grain has to be used in large hybrids to develop acceptable thrust levels, which both reduces the mass fraction of the booster to ridiculously low levels (Copenhagen Suborbitals\u0027 page on their hybrid motors indicates that their motors have a fuel fraction of just 40%!), and causes the grain to weaken and fall apart during the burn, which causes chunks of fuel to be ejected from the nozzle. A high regression rate fuel like paraffin would probably solve this problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cpast","CreatedById":112846,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-26T04:20:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Exosphere\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Exosphere\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDoesn\u0027t the rate of combustion change with the internal combustion chamber pressure?
