A tentacle might be more robust (so \u0027better\u0027 in one sense) but wouldn\u0027t be quite as versatile as a hand for manipulating tools.\u00A0 However a tentacle would be a much more flexible and versatile carrier for that tool manipulator than an arm is for a hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA tentacle with some kind of receptacle in the end (think of an elephant\u0027s trunk) would be reasonably capable as a manipulator whilst being considerably more flexible and versatile than an arm. It could grasp a handle with ease (an octopus would have no problem holding a hammer), the receptacle at the tentacle tip would allow for holding smaller tools or manipulating \u0027poking\u0027 tools like bradawls or punches (or daggers).\u00A0 About the only thing I can think of where it would seriously struggle would be with scissors and related tools where having multiple digits to operate multiple parts of the tool simultaneously is an advantage. One could operate a pair of scissors two-handed but it would be clumsy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps a bifurcated tentacle then, with each tentaclet(?) having a receptacle at its tip?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething else to think about when considering alternatives to hands is that you\u0027re also likely to be considering alternatives to feet.\u00A0In general nature seems to be quite good at coming up with symmetrical body plans or body plans where similar structures can be pressed into service for different roles. Arms and hands vs legs and feet for example. I would find an alien creature with tentacle manipulators which walked on another set of tentacles to be much more believable than some half-and-half critter with humanoid articulated legs and tentacular arms. Of course - as you\u0027ve mentioned before - \u0027aliens\u0027 could be the product of human biological engineering, in which case all bets are off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom a worldbuilding perspective, I\u0027d find it interesting to write about a fictional race of tentacle critters. How would that reduced dexterity (compared to hands) affect their approach to every day matters. Take clothing for example - I imagine that manipulating buttons or zips with tentacles could be a real pain, so they might favour clothing with as few closures as possible, and perhaps rely on toggles or overgrown cufflink style closures (longer, easier to grip with a tentacle) than buttons. Hook and loop fasteners would be significantly easier to use, so perhaps all their clothes would rely on alien Velcro.

A tentacle might be more robust (so \u0027better\u0027 in one sense) but wouldn\u0027t be quite as versatile as a hand for manipulating tools.\u00A0 However a tentacle would be a much more flexible and versatile carrier for that tool manipulator than an arm is for a hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA tentacle with some kind of receptacle in the end (think of an elephant\u0027s trunk) would be reasonably capable as a manipulator whilst being considerably more flexible and versatile than an arm. It could grasp a handle with ease (an octopus would have no problem holding a hammer), the receptacle at the tentacle tip would allow for holding smaller tools or manipulating \u0027poking\u0027 tools like bradawls or punches (or daggers).\u00A0 About the only thing I can think of where it would seriously struggle would be with scissors and related tools where having multiple digits to operate multiple parts of the tool simultaneously is an advantage. One could operate a pair of scissors two-handed but it would be clumsy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps a bifurcated tentacle then, with each tentaclet(?) having a receptacle at its tip?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething else to think about when considering alternatives to hands is that you\u0027re also likely to be considering alternatives to feet.\u00A0In general nature seems to be quite good at coming up with symmetrical body plans or body plans where similar structures can be pressed into service for different roles. Arms and hands vs legs and feet for example. I would find an alien creature with tentacle manipulators which walked on another set of tentacles to be much more believable than some half-and-half critter with humanoid articulated legs and tentacular arms. Of course - as you\u0027ve mentioned before - \u0027aliens\u0027 could be the product of human biological engineering, in which case all bets are off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom a worldbuilding perspective, I\u0027d find it interesting to write about a fictional race of tentacle critters. How would that reduced dexterity (compared to hands) affect their approach to every day matters. Take clothing for example - I imagine that manipulating buttons or zips with tentacles could be a real pain, so they might favour clothing with as few closures as possible, and perhaps rely on toggles or overgrown cufflink style closures (longer, easier to grip with a tentacle) than buttons. Hook and loop fasteners would be significantly easier to use, so perhaps all their clothes would rely on alien Velcro.

that some great apes actually have better evolved hands than we do. of course those hands are evolved for mostly arboreal use, so they are simply better at climbing trees. seeing aliens with less evolved hands in scifi makes me wonder how they ever developed tool use. we used to have a hamster who liked little cheese crackers. i liked watching him hold onto his food while he bit off pieces to shove into his cheek pouches (i like to think he ate some of it). that\u0027s actually way more evolved than a cat\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Part Action Window\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr

paws, drop them, and try to pick them up again. thus i have my doubts about cats ever developing tool use. and i like to think the hamster stands a chance, so long as he doesn\u0027t get eaten by a cat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthis particular hamster died years ago, of old age, so he escaped cat-death even though they always liked to watch him while licking their

fact its their only means of moving objects, they can both bite hard and be gentle enough to say move kittens around, anything they do with their paws in terms of manipulating must be done in a stationary position. this got me thinking about elephants. some have been trained to paint for example (the alaska zoo up in anchorage used to have an elephant that could paint, and would sell the artworks to help fund their wildlife programs), and it takes some dexterity to use a paint brush. im not sure if elephants in the wild have been known for their tool use, but its certainly something they are capable of learning. whats more it can carry things, which cats are not so good at. they are a pretty intelligent species, and i cant imagine that developing agriculture is very far from their current capabilities. being limited to a single trunk is probibly not as big of a limitation as you would thing, as they are very social animals. 2 or 3 elephants working together could probibly weave baskets and make gardening tools. and being powerful creatures, would make plowing a field a fairly simple job. though they would need a lot bigger fields than humans given their

allows to form a holding shape at various levels of scale, from millimeters to meter on size.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis allows to operate with various objects, hold, split, and combine them.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe cognitive abilities allow to add moar effectors by using and creating tools to operate with objects from atomic size to millions of tonnes heavy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe apes lack at least the thumbs opposed to other fingers.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey have two more hands, but this is not needed when you have tools.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso\u00A0 the upper hands are closer to the sensors, so they allow to operate with objects much quicker and more often.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bones inside the effectors reinforce the holding effectors and allow to apply stronger force. Also they make the fractality levels discrete.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThus, no tentacles are better than a good skeleton.\u003Cbr\u003E\n(The liquid metal teminator can form temporary hard objects like bones, but needs energy to keep them hard.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe cognitive functions are fractal, too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe more primitive a creature is, the more linear is its behaviour and thinking.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe more developed ones can keep in mind several different topics at once and unexpectedly bite your finger while squinting and purring (and who knows, what this hairy jerk had suddenly recalled to revenge for).\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe human thinking is extremely fractal, the human can think on several different topics at once, constantly varying their priorities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, the fractality of both mind and body is the key.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd the fractal mind could develop only in a fractal surrounding, like a forest with labyrith of trees and bushes, requiring fractal thinking to survive, perfect labyrinth task solving abilities to get throw or hide, fractal limbs to interact with different objects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, the line of rodents/primates gave the most fractal of the known creatures, the human.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-17T08:21:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsometimes i wish i had ape foothands for those tricky soldering joints. i think it would be somewhat dangerous to hold a hot iron between my toes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfoothands also seem like they would be useful in zero gravity. for navigating both in and outside of the vehicle/station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-04-17T08:23:43Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2022 08:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Nuke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-17T10:27:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI always doubted Puppeteers lips would work as manipulators.
