The payload is such a small fraction of total rocket mass already that an order of magnitude reduction in that doesn\u0027t change things dramatically for the first stages. I\u0027m sure the upper stage was calibrated and throttled to fit the payload and target orbit, but that\u0027s something that they surely always do \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mattasmack","CreatedById":62809,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-15T20:42:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll admit, I wrote that last message without actually looking for numbers. Looks like you\u0027re right. Using the numbers from \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.spaceflight101.com/falcon-9-v11.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.spaceflight101.com/falcon-9-v11.html\u003C/a\u003E, for a light payload like this one the second stage would have to throttle down significantly to keep the acceleration reasonable (under 5g\u0027s, say) if they run the tanks close to dry, where it wouldn\u0027t be necessary for a heavy payload. On the other hand, there\u0027s enough extra deltaV in the second stage for a light payload that if they start with a full load of propellants, it should finish its burn before running close to dry. I thought the first stage burn was shorter on this flight (MECO around 2:43, where SpaceX\u0027s website says the first stage burn is 180s), but looking back at a couple of previous flights on Youtube it looks like that\u0027s the normal MECO time as well. So, never mind!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
