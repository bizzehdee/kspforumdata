The infamous 57-megaton \u0022Tsar Bomba\u0022 was actually the cleanest nuclear weapon ever built (in its tested configuration), with a fusion fraction of about 98%, meaning that \u0022only\u0022 about one megaton of the total yield was due to fission and generated fallout. (It was tested with an inert lead tamper/neutron reflector to reduce the yield by 50% from the originally designed ~100MT yield--because it was realized that at full yield, it would be impossible for the bomber crew that delivered it to escape the fireball, much less the blast radius, before initiation. Had it been tested with the depleted uranium tamper, it would have undergone the \u0022fast fission\u0022 tertiary stage that would have doubled the yield, but generated immense amounts of fallout.) Granted, this wasn\u0027t a practical design for this sort of application, due to the need for a fission trigger, but had Orion been approved, research into laser-ignition fusion devices would have been put on the front burner and, most likely, would have borne fruit within ten years. (Laser-ignition fusion has LONG been deliberately underfunded by all the nuclear states simply because successful development of it for any application would let a nasty genie out of the bottle--it\u0027d make it possible for rogue states to develop thermonuclear fusion \u0022hydrogen\u0022 weapons without having to go through the difficult, expensive, and relatively easily-blocked process of developing fission \u0022atomic\u0022 weapons to act as the trigger to initiate fusion. Now that rogue states are starting to get fission weapons, we\u0027ve finally gotten serious about developing laser-ignition fusion for non-weapons applications.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven that early-1950s technology was able to engineer materials and structures that were capable, in actual nuclear tests, of surviving direct contact exposure to a fusion device\u0027s fireball (IIRC, they were graphite-coated steel spheres), I\u0027m certain that with a Manhattan Project/Apollo-level national effort, the technological stumbling blocks to Orion could have been overcome--remember, there was a huge amount of technology *and materials* required for Apollo that didn\u0027t exist when Kennedy proposed it in 1962, yet we made it to the Moon in just seven years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big reason for Orion never being pursued is the 1963 Limited Test-Ban Treaty between the US and the Soviet Union, which prohibited nuclear tests in the atmosphere, underwater, and in space. This meant that Orion was now a non-starter, because it could never be test-flown without abrogating the treaty, and the whole plan was dropped. If not for that, combined with the cost of the Apollo program (which was going to be competing for funds with it), Orion might well have been reality by the mid-70s. After all, it\u0027s one of the few spacecraft designs where one of the hardest problems in the design (control of total vehicle mass) isn\u0027t an issue; Orion was one where things actually got *easier* as the vehicle got heavier. Compare that to the space program we have, where many millions of dollars are spent to shave every gram they can off of every part of the vehicle, due to the limitations of chemical rocketry...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T16:41:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Themohawkninja\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Themohawkninja\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWe actually gave serious thought to a Moon base back then?

There\u0027s a reason why they were specified by the original designers.

Apparently, this is actually *easier* than using the fission primary to compress the secondary, but anything more detailed than what I\u0027ve mentioned isn\u0027t mentioned in any open-source material I know of (and no, I have no access to anything that\u0027s not publicly available).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd yes, Tsar Bomba was tested - but never weaponized or deployed. Nor did the US ever test a weapon with a sufficiently high fusion fraction.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, it WAS weaponized--Khruschev\u0027s requirements to Sakharov specifically stated that the weapon had to be delivered by a bomber rather than being an Ivy Mike-style immobile physics experiment. It just was never deployed operationally. And there was a simple reason for this--there was never any application for it. Tsar Bomba was too big, both physically and in terms of yield, to have any practical application. Even at the reduced yield \u0022clean\u0022 design, there were only three targets in the US that were large and sprawling enough to warrant it--New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles. It might have also been useful for digging the Cheyenne Mountain Complex and Mount Weather out, but by the time those were operational and known to Soviet targeteers, ICBM accuracy had improved to the point where they could collapse them with a 20MT \u0022city-destroyer\u0022 warhead like was on some mods of the SS-18. Nothing else was big enough or hardened enough to warrant the Tsar Bomba\u0027s yield, either \u0022clean\u0022 or \u0022dirty\u0022. On top of that, the weapon--which, remember, was deliberately designed to be as physically small as possible, due to the weaponization requirement--was so physically large that even the Soviets\u0027 largest bomber, the Tu-95, required modification to carry it: the bomb bay doors had to be removed, and part of the fuselage had to be cut away to clear the bomb, and even then, it could only carry the bomb semi-submerged, with part of the bottom of it sticking out of the belly of the aircraft. The added drag and weight meant that a mission carrying a Tsar Bomba to the US would have been a one-way mission ending in either a bailout, a ditching, or MAYBE a landing in Cuba; they also would have rendered the aircraft exceedingly vulnerable to interception by USAF and RCAF interceptors, since it slowed it down and reduced the maneuverability. (Not to mention that a \u0022dirty\u0022 version would have literally been a suicide mission for the bomber crew, since they\u0027d have been caught in the fireball.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETsar Bomba *could* have been deployed, if there had been any mission for it. However, like most of the Russian \u0022tsar\u0022 projects, it was a purely politically-motivated thing that had no actual use beyond overcompensating for perceptions of having a small *****. It still worked, though, and had an amazing fusion fraction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, the biggest reason that the US never tested a weapon with a sufficiently high fusion fraction is that we were *also* dick-waving at the time, and big yield was considered more impressive than high fusion fraction. Therefore, when we were doing fusion weapon tests, we always used the \u0022dirty\u0022 version that had the bigger yield. Ironically, most of our tests related to fusion weapons were done after Ivy Mike and Castle Bravo proved the basic design; the ones that weren\u0027t just saber-rattling were mostly tests of *only* the boosted-fission primaries for new fusion weapons, since we knew that the secondary would operate correctly if the primary had sufficient yield to get the radiation implosion going. (There was also the issue that the primary to a fusion weapon is a rather effective weapon in and of itself for smaller targets and/or with more accurate placement...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe problem is, those things you call \u0022unremarkable\u0022 are anything but - they\u0027re quite remarkable due to their size and the stresses they\u0027d undergo in flight.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is true, but scale is something relatively unremarkable to engineers--once you get it working small-scale, you can always scale it up and work out the bugs.
