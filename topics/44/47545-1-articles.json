It is what I call modular society. Now, everything influences everything else. We see that in the economy. However, new technologies that allow for highly technological production on a small scale will change these vulnerabilities. Instead of one part that breaks down tearing into other bits of society, we can (and probably will) have seperate modules or cells. When one goes wrong, the others will still be able to survive and thrive. When the time comes, the surrounding cells can help rebuild the broken one. The new industrial revolution of 3D-printers, accessible computer design, lab grown foods and more things like that will enable all this without creating the system wide vulnerabilities and dependencies the first industrial revolution caused. It is like society was before the industrial revolution - very local and free from bad influences - but with the added benefits of a global network sharing knowledge and ideas.

In reality the earth is far more massive than we give it credit for, problems like famine and overpriced materials arise from geopolitical and economic issues, not supply and demand. For example, the earths combined food production is somewhere around 5 times the consumption of the people eating it(the rest goes to livestock to guess what...make more food), the reason 3rd world countries are starving is because most of it\u0027s grown in 1st world countries and the rest is hoarded by corrupt local governments. Another example is oil, oil is not rare, it may not be produced quickly, but there is a ton of it. While it is difficult to estimate exact numbers, we have enough fossil fuels for anywhere from 500, to 2000 years, not that we should use it for that long. Gold is also not a rare metal, and our iron supplies are unlimited compared to the demand. People are focusing on the wrong problems, the problem is not how much we have, but what we are doing with it and how it is being distributed.
