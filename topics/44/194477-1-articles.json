It\u0027s normal to the surface of Earth. You\u0027re suggesting that the star that is at the zenith should be less than one sun-radius above the horizon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the correct statement would be \u0022I\u0027m standing 1/5 of a degree away\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eon Earth\u0027s surface\u003C/em\u003E from the terminator.\u0022 The angle the star makes with the Sun would be 90.2\u00A0degrees, then.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you know where you are and what day and time it is, you should be able to find the star that is 90.2 degrees above the sun by figuring out the sun\u0027s azimuth at sunset (or in the case of your measly hill, about thirty seconds after sunset) and going to 90\u00A0degrees above that. Actually, you don\u0027t need to do that at all, since the zenith is a single defined point. Just figure out what time the sun sets for that day, and go to the star that\u0027s at the zenith for your location at that time. Given that you\u0027re seeing it at sunset, it\u0027s got to be a pretty bright one. For such a small hill, you won\u0027t even need to worry about the altitude difference. Even if you were on Mount Everest or cruising in an intercontinental airliner, the difference in the sky would only be 3 degrees, hardly distinguishable on a handheld starmap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the bottom line is, you can find out what star it is if you also know the date and time and your location, or just the date and location if you have a table of sunset times (you probably can derive the table too if you know Earth\u0027s axial tilt). Otherwise, if you don\u0027t know what day it is or where you are you\u0027re better off waiting an hour so you can see the rest of the constellation it\u0027s in and figure it out that way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeSchmuckatelli","CreatedById":154477,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-05T16:57:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223797817\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022194477\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221591373995\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022190194\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022farmerben\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n45 minutes ago, farmerben said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHuh?\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003EI\u0027m sure someone in your group argued that directly overhead was about 90 degrees from the sun.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E And your argument for a very acute angle is???\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany years ago, on a vacation with my family, I derived the general case for how far you can see over the ocean, based on lines tangent to a circle.\u00A0 I won\u0027t derive it again right now, but I can tell you several variables are squared or square-rooted so the approximation you made is not accurate.\u00A0 IIRC standing 6\u0027 above sea level lets you see about 4 miles.\u00A0 \u00A0Hotel balconies let you see 10-20 miles.\u00A0 At long ranges you really see mostly things above the horizon like the crest of a wave and the crest of the next wave beyond it, without seeing any surface in between.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was the exact crux of the discussion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u2026 and, damnit, having revisited my napkin...
