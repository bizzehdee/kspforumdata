Any mission involving rendezvous and docking prior to a large rocket engine burn has to use less-efficient storable fuels instead. But what I have realized about EML2, the reason it is so important - it allows you to store energy. That way you can use your fancy hydrogen to send up individual pieces, and they are already 90% of the way to Mars, before rendezvous even happens, and only a small amount of the work has to be done by hypergolics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 launches of formerly-named Space Launch System Block IB to EML2, first the lander, unpiloted, with an attached hypergolic rocket stage for TMI, MOI, and lander deorbit. Waits on lunar orbit for a year or so until launch of astronauts. Second launch, piloted, Orion and habitat for journey to and from Mars, Orion does TEI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.ezimba.com/work/150831C/ezimba18622747386600.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ezimba18622747386600.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-30T16:40:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThen why not build a full fledged base at EML-2?
