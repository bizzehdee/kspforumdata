It might be true that there is a critical mass to a gaseous planet whereby the gravity is high enough then you see a gas giant circling a star, but if not or the star has a powerful enough pulse stage, the planet can lose its atmosphere and become rocky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-12T07:35:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEarth\u0027s early atmosphere\u00A0is thought to have been\u00A0lost by a different mechanism -\u00A0planetesimal bombardment.\u00A0 An article on MIT\u0027s studies of the phenomenon \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/10843/20141203/earths-early-atmosphere-obliterated-by-space-rocks.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
