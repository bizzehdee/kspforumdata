Your goal would not to be to present an impenetrable substrate enemy weapons cannot pierce, but rather to reflect and absorb as much enemy firepower as possible... Predictive plating becomes a necessity, due to the projectile energies involved- it\u0027s far easier to reflect a kinetic projectile if the armor plate it impacts rotates to create a smaller angle of impact (think of it like skipping stones on a pond)- and the effective armor thickness (should the magnetic systems fail) becomes much thicker. Automated systems to control the predictive plating would of course also be necessary...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich brings me to my final point- automation. It\u0027s not quite as valuable as you think...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrue, an unmanned vessel can be lighter, faster, and more agile than a manned one. And, even on large ships which would probably carry a small repair crew (to repair damage to the vessel between engagements) you would theoretically still want to automate as many systems as possible...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, theory doesn\u0027t always match practice. The fact is, unmanned vessels/systems introduce several weaknesses and vulnerabilities that manned ones do not...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first of these, is an extraordinary vulnerability to EMP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll an enemy has to do to fry an entirely unmanned enemy fleet is let off a strong enough Electromagnetic Pulse. If this pulse is strong enough, it can permanently disable enemy electronics. You would expect to see specialized vessels with highly shielded systems themselves built precisely for this purpose- but shielding every single unmanned system and vessel you build to a sufficient level would be extremely expensive, and greatly reduce the mass and cost benefits of unmanned systems versus manned ones. Manned vessels, with their reduced reliance on electronics, and capability to switch many automated functions over to \u0022manual control\u0022, would be far cheaper and easier to protect against such an EMP system...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second of these is these weaknesses is a reliance on outside transmissions to control an unmanned vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcepting the development of quasi-magical fully independent advanced AI, which is still a long ways off (and blurs the line on what is human or manned anyways), most unmanned systems would be remote-control. True, you could give an unmanned vessel relatively simple programming to engage enemy vessels, and hope it works. But there are a variety of electronic countermeasures and systems to fool the target-identifications systems of such a vessel that could make this strategy nigh-useless, not the least of which is because such programs would likely have to identify enemies by transmitted signals which could easily be faked or jammed rather than appearance or behavior...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf a system is remote-control, then your best weapon against it becomes attempting to imitate the real control system and issue commands telling it to do things like self-destruct or attack allies. Even if this proves impossible, general (and already well-understood) signal-jamming techniques can render a drone a worthless hunk of metal to be blown into pieces at leisure...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould NONE of these approaches work, a remote-control vessel can be most effectively disabled not by targeting its engines, weapons, or reactor- but by targeting its antenna. Destroy this relatively fragile and exposed piece of equipment, and once again, a RC drone just becomes a worthless hunk of metal...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, as a last-resort, you can always destroy the drone-control center (if there are no backup control centers to take over), Phantom Menace-style; though that really only works when it would take minutes or hours for signals to arrive from the next closest control center...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, unmanned systems have a number of vulnerabilities. So in practice, they wouldn\u0027t be used that much- or the first interplanetary or interstellar power to use them in symmetrical warfare- rather than asymmetrical warfare against a massively-outmatched opponent (which is the only reason things like drones have worked as well as they have in the modern era- not to be stereotypical, but comparatively primitive Arabs in the desert being attacked by a Predator Drone don\u0027t have things like powerful EMP or sophisticated electronic countermeasures to co-opt its command and control systems...) would be in for a massive surprise, when their \u0022superior\u0022 drone force would quickly be defeated by a manned force using things like EMP and electronic countermeasures to their best advantage...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope we never see warfare in space.

But there are a variety of electronic countermeasures and systems to fool the target-identifications systems of such a vessel that could make this strategy nigh-useless, not the least of which is because such programs would likely have to identify enemies by transmitted signals which could easily be faked or jammed rather than appearance or behavior...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf a system is remote-control, then your best weapon against it becomes attempting to imitate the real control system and issue commands telling it to do things like self-destruct or attack allies.

(so, a capital ship or base firing at microwave-sized fighters would DEFINATELY use lasers, because a base can absorb 50 Mj into it\u0027s structure, whereas the fighter is vaporized by the 25 Mj pulse)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause the best weapons against parasite warships (\u0022fighters\u0022) damage the firing craft, it\u0027s still worth it to throw fighters and cheap missiles at the enemy, because it forces the enemy to raise it\u0027s thermal signature, bleeding off their capaciters and heat sinks before the real fight begins.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-09T03:06:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFewer electronic systems to protect.

I mean, don\u0027t we have ways already to protect sensitive electronic equipment against excessive radiation?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn another vane:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I\u0027ve been going about this somewhat in the wrong way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean, I\u0027ve been assuming that the space aspect of warfare would be the only one going on, and so I\u0027ve been just thinking in terms of naval warfare, but I suspect that might be rather myopic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about the guys on the ground? After all, infantry have been a part of our warfare since the dawn of civilization, and even though every other aspect of warfare has changed (well, maybe not every aspect, that was hyperbolic), I just get the feeling we\u0027ll still have ground forces involved in battle for the next couple centuries, at least as long as the scope of this discussion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd navies and air forces planet side won\u0027t just dissappear, I don\u0027t think. I mean, if we\u0027re still not united on earth, any armed force would still have a part to play terrestrially.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, that leaves the question as to what would orbital forces would do in these battles. To me, it seems like the role would develop progressively, much like the role of aircraft in battle has already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first major conflict might see small, light craft designed primarily for recon missions, maybe with small armaments to defend or take out small, strategic targets (think of the first canvas planes in WWI; ships not really designed for combat, exactly, but the pilots still carried bombs they could drop on unsuspecting enemy troops below). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen we\u0027d see more combat oriented craft in the next few conflicts, but still they are very balanced so thy can do a little bit of everything, but not very well. Perhaps they\u0027ll have more armaments, better dV budgets/life support, etc, but we still would be developing just what role orbital forces would play in any given battle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, what comes to mind for me are orbital batteries used for taking pot shots at enemy strongholds without using nukes, and we\u0027d have craft designed specifically for orbital superiority, meant specifically to take out other space-faring vessels. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI imagine we\u0027d see some sort of amalgamation of strategies from artillery tactics, submarine tactics, naval tactics, and air force tactics, depending on what was going on. Probably some new stuff we can\u0027t foresee thrown in there, as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust some thoughts\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
