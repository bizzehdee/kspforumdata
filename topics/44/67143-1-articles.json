Adware is any program that uses advertising to pay for the software. Malware can be anything from harmless adware to keyloggers, redirects, or hijackers. It is frustrating when one encounters these things, but they can all usually be avoided by paying close attention to what you download and where you download it from. Most adware type applications will have checkboxes located in the installation process that allow you to uncheck things like toolbars and attached bloatware.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit : for further discussion : you can usually remove unwanted adware in the form of toolbars by going to the control panel - programs and features - and sort by date. Look for the most recent entries that you either do not recognize or don\u0027t know what the hell they are and then right clicking and choosing uninstall. Further steps may be necessary such as removing unwanted startup items. CCleaner from pinform is a invaluable tool for easily removing these startup entries. Once cleanup is done, and the system is stabilized, registry cleanup may be necessary in order to remove what I call \u0022ghosts\u0022 or unused keys. CCleaner is also effective for this. Bonus : CCleaner is free! They also have a paid version, and like any other piece of free software, they may try to trick you into installing unnecessary crap. Pay attention during the CCleaner installation process for those little checkboxes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-29T21:37:41Z\u0022 title=\u002203/29/2014 09:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Otis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
