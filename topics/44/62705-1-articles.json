A computer has some strange interface that plugs into your brain or nerves and completely overrides your senses with with computer generated ones, giving you an experience that is indistinguishable from actually being and doing whatever was programmed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E My question is, can and should something like this be built\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E My thoughts, briefly:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it could be built but not until we master how our senses work and find out how to interface our brain with a computer and somehow shutdown our natural senses.

Currently, we go to school to get a job, work that job to make money, and use that money so we can retire and not work. I think offering this program as a type of retirement could be very attractive, where you pay for the real food and water your body needs, all the while you enjoy the fantasies of a lifetime, living in whatever physical condition you want.
