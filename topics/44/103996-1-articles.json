I hope so, otherwise this could be hard to understand.\n\nSo right from day 1, I bet you have been told to be yourself, and that nothing else is more important. Well, that\u0027s true! Being yourself is the #1 key to loving the \u0022you\u0022 that you are now. That view may change in a few years, but by then, the \u0022you\u0022 would have changed as well.\n\nThe definition of you: The construct of your life so far, your interests, beliefs, religion, accomplishments, morals, ect. \n\nMorals is probably the most important, because it can dictate whether or not the \u0022you\u0022 that you are now is...\n\nOkay, so that half-statement kinda brought in a whole new topic, so to clear it up now: The \u0022you\u0022 that you want to be is perfectly fine, but if that \u0022you\u0022 entails the harm and/or suffering of others, than that image of \u0022you\u0022 should change for the better. You may not like it, but it is the right thing to do.\n\nWith that out of the way, the best [and moral] \u0022you\u0022 is always the way to go. That\u0027s what everyone wanted from the start, right? Well... no.\n\nFor you to become the \u0022you\u0022 of image isn\u0027t what people want. What was meant by \u0022yourself\u0022 means the \u0022you\u0022 that they saw, not you. Think about it.\n\nIn school, were you often sick of doing the same thing over and over again, all because someone didn\u0027t quite understand, forcing everyone to be set back?\n\nDid you still do it? If no, because YOU don\u0027t want to, that\u0027s the wiser choice, because it exercises your independence. \n\nIf yes, why? Why would you subject your mind to unnecessary stresses? Why go with the mold just to create more work?\n\nIf you think that\u0027s too theoretical of an analogy, try this:\n\nYou are at war. You are currently resting at camp, after exchanging weapons fire for days with your enemies. Enemies that have killed your friends in front of your own eyes. At night, you hear a moan of pain nearby. You slip out, and find it to be one of your enemies. Unarmed, dying, and in a lot of pain. You report to your commander for instructions. Say that you wanted the decision to kill him, since he\u0027s your enemy, and was among those that killed your allies, and wouldn\u0027t hesitate to shoot you on sight. You want to end his life, but your commander gives orders to rescue, and treat him. What would you do?\n\nComply with his orders, and save him? Or stick to your morals, and disobey orders? Disobey orders, and you are confined, all for exercising your rights as an individual. \n\nSo, to be an individual is to be punished for exercising it? To not be an individual is to be rewarded for blind compliance? If you\u0027re not supposed to be independent of the collective, why are you told it\u0027s a good thing?"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T22:12:35Z","Content":"According to the laws of warfare you can\u0027t kill him.

I am free to do what I wish, but there is no guarantee of being free from consequences.\n\u003E Further, I\u0027m a social creature. We naturally crave companionship and community. We\u0027re wired that way. You\u0027re NOT supposed to be independent of \u0027the collective,\u0027 and it\u0027s very rare to find someone who truly WANTS to be. I\u0027m not even certain where the paradox is here, to be honest.\n\nYou\u0027ve met no one who wishes to be independent of the collective? Well, I guess I\u0027m the first you\u0027ll meet.\n\nThe paradox is: Your lifelong goal of independence is the greatest thing for you, yet also the worst. To be an individual is to be normal. To wish someone individuality is to integrate them into the collective. To be unique is to just be another person.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s not how it works.\n\nThis reply made no sense\n\n\u003E \n\u003E History tells us otherwise. Unless you want to suggest that the efforts of someone like Rosa Parks are in vain.\n\nKeyword \u0022most\u0022\n\n\u003E \n\u003E There is no they. It\u0027s WE.\n\nFor you, maybe, but not for me. I refuse to be a part of this.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I said morals and rules are set by the group. You said that was absurd, that is was set by the individual. I invited you to create a rule other people would be obliged to follow. I was making a point. YOU as an individual do not create rules that others must adhere to, except in your own personal sphere of influence. Those who chose to be around you follow your rules. Those who don\u0027t want to, don\u0027t. But your influence on the whole of society is limited, so you as an individual can\u0027t go around setting mores. You need influence. Again, proved by history.\n\nI don\u0027t speak for everyone, however. If no one is in my group, then it is a group of 1. You\u0027re trying to disprove my statements by using the history of humanity as an example. That\u0027s probably the worst comparison.\n\nTry the history of innovators. Others groups of 1 who made their own rules, unaccepted at first, but soon had an astronomical influence on the entire world.\n\nNow, I need to figure out how to complete this Jool-5 thing..."},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T07:41:40Z","Content":"I think that independence comes from having freedom.
