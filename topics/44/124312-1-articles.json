There have been dozens of threads about it here, and KSP\u0027s RAPIER engine is a direct hommage to it, down to the name. It\u0027s also a bit cringe-worthy how the article calls the spaceplane \u0022SABRE\u0022, when that is just the name of the engine: \u003Cstrong\u003ES\u003C/strong\u003Eynergistic \u003Cstrong\u003EA\u003C/strong\u003Eir \u003Cstrong\u003EB\u003C/strong\u003Ereathing \u003Cstrong\u003ER\u003C/strong\u003Eocket \u003Cstrong\u003EE\u003C/strong\u003Engine.
