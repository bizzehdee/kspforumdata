You need to inject fuel in a supersonic stream, mix it with air and burn it in the very short time it takes for air to go through the combustion chamber.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have several MW of microwave beamed power available, you could simply use an electric arc to heat the air, without trying to burn anything. That way, you don\u0027t create drag by injecting fuel, you don\u0027t need a long combustion chamber, and the whole thing is much more stable in regard to speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a bonus, the antenna and power electronics can be used for a MPD thruster when outside the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, it doesn\u0027t solve heating issues (actually, it makes them worse since you can\u0027t use fuel as coolant), or how to reach initial velocity (although it could probably work as a ramjet too), and although you get rid of the fuel (not such a big mass in a space plane anyway), you have to put a big antenna and power electronics, as well as a massive emitter on Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA simpler alternative would be to build a thermal microwave scramjet. You get rid of the antenna and power electronics, put a big slab of silicon carbide on the underside of your ship that will turn microwave into heat. Force your supersonic airstream to get in contact with it, and it will heat. The same slab can also be used as heat shield for reentry. The main issue I see with that you could not use it for thermal protection while accelerating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, designing a beam powered scramjet would be difficult and expensive, since neither scramjets nor beam powered are mature technologies, but if we get to build emitters powerful enough for beam powered thermal test rockets (we have emitters of comparable power in particle accelerators), we might as well try to use them for scramjets too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObjections?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-09T17:59:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe main objection is that microwave beamed power doesn\u0027t work like it does in KSP interstellar at all. To collect microwave energy you need a receiver, the larger the more power you can leech. If you try to pump enough energy for a scramjet through a small receiver you\u0027ll just end up melting the hull and frying the electronics. But on the other hand, large receivers aren\u0027t very aerodynamically favorable in hypersonic airstreams.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Idobox","CreatedById":80299,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-11T17:18:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI used to design antennas, and I can tell you it\u0027s not that difficult to build a receiver antenna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can have up to several MW/m\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 and efficiency in excess of 90%, leaving several hundreds of kW of waste heat, difficult but manageable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you go for microwave thermal, it\u0027s even easier.

But heck, magnetic rail launch, perhaps?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you have to deal with the fact that transmitting highly focused energy through the atmosphere will generate a lot of waste heat in the air, contributing to global warming as well as degrading the performance of your system. But as far as I know this can be overcome with \u0027MOAR LAZORZ\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the real show-stopper is the thermodynamics of scramjet engines. The scramjet has a very low pressure ratio, which means that even though they may be fuel-efficient, they still produce very low thrust per unit of air that flows through them. This boils down to a need for a very large air intake which is a heavy and drag-producing structure, which must be made from exotic materials and probably also be actively cooled. If you somehow manage to wirelessly transfer megawatts of power to a launch vehicle, it is probably easier and more efficient to push all that power into some form of more conventional thermal rocket. Just my two cents.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Idobox","CreatedById":80299,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-19T18:56:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are designs that work both as ram and scramjet.

It still seems to me that accelerating gas to proper exhaust velocity is easier if it already moves fast, and that you save on weight if you don\u0027t have to carry it around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I understand, the main performance issue with both ram and scramjets is that you need to slow the air flow down to have time to combust properly, and that induces heat, drag and poor pressure factors. But if you don\u0027t chemical combustion, I\u0027m not sure you need to slow the flow down in a significant way, as a result you should be able to improve performance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"whynot","CreatedById":111363,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-19T21:14:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1. The combined ram- and scramjets I\u0027ve seen all have moving ramps and intakes which are heavy and complex propositions, or inefficient compromises where only a portion of the internal flow goes supersonic. Maybe there are others? Like ablative combustion chambers? Also the need for heat resistant structure does not come from the combustion of fuels per se but from the need to rise the energy of the gas in order to produce thrust. If it ain\u0027t running hot, it really ain\u0027t running at all. (see #3:)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. If you take that GW/km\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E and concentrate it on the cross-sectional area of your vehicle, the atmosphere will heat up considerably along the path of your beam and you will have transmission losses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The ammount of thrust you get is really dependant on \u003Cem\u003Ehow much\u003C/em\u003E you accelerate the reaction mass, not the absolute magnitude of the exhaust velocity. So increasing the speed of the airflow from mach 5 to mach 25 is not the same thing as accelerating the same mass of propellant from 0 to mach 25. To accelerate the air through your engine you will need to raise it\u0027s pressure and temperature at the same time, raising the temperature alone will not produce any thrust because heat is just random motion. In order to extract thrust from this random motion you must direct as much of it as possible rearwards. That\u0027s what rocket nozzles do, and when a gas is accelerated like that it\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Laval_nozzle\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Etemperature and pressure will fall\u003C/a\u003E. If the air flow was at atmospheric pressure to begin with, you will end up with a partial vacuum behind your engine and that\u0027s just gonna slow you down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I understand it the point of having a scramjet is that you can do without some of the oxidizer needed to get to orbit because you can hog some from the atmosphere. Taking the fuel out as well, really what you have is a lot of chemical potential energy (oxygen in the air) flowing through the engine that is just wasted. Cheers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
