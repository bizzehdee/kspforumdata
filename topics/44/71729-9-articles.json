Although my camera isn\u0027t a top of the line DSLR camera, the same DIGIC 5\u002B image processor is used in Canon\u0027s current crop of top of the line cameras like the 5D Mark III and 1D-X. My camera, like all DSLR cameras, struggles to correctly expose shots that contain a combination of very bright and very dark areas. You can compensate by adding filters and/or by stacking multiple shots to create a HDR image, but my read of the various references suggest that OSIRIS does a better job natively.

For instance, it may have too much lateral velocity (try landing on the Mun while sliding sideways and see what happens).

Although the comet\u0027s gravity is tenuous, if all velocity is zeroed out it will be enough to keep Philae where it is... for now.

Shortly after, Philae is released with a precisely calculated ejection force to put it exactly on the right trajectory. Then Rosetta does another burn to re-enter orbit, while Philae continues to fall towards the comet. Its trajectory will be such that its periapsis is a few centimeters above the surface of the landing site, and the landing site (on the rotating comet) will arrive under that periapsis point at the same time as Philae reaches it. Furthermore, at the instant of periapsis, the movement speed of the rotating surface below Philae will match the speed of Philae itself, temporarily canceling out all lateral velocity for just one brief moment (this is possible due to the very low gravity of the comet). That is when Philae will launch its harpoons and fire its little downpress thruster in an attempt to cling onto the comet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe success of this maneuver is reliant on a.) making sure Philae\u0027s landing legs face the surface at the instant of periapsis and b.) succeeding in zeroing out lateral velocity at the instant of periapsis through carefully calibrating the trajectory.
