It\u0027s more likely that particles from Saturn\u0027s inner rings will eventually start to burn up in Saturn\u0027s atmosphere, but this process will probably be a lot longer than moon formation in outer rings."},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T13:47:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Could Saturn\u0027s ring system ever collapse? Why does it seem that so many bodies can stay in what seems to be a stable orbit without eventually throwing each other out?\n\nThing is, you are most likely seeing the result of a lot of throwing out and other chaos. What remains is relatively stable, which is why the rings seem permanent from a human perspective ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nLong story short, it is no coincidence that the rings appear stable - only what was or became relatively stable remains there to be seen by us."}]}
