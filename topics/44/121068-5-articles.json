Going into space period is a risk. Going into space without proven and reliable technology and equipment is reckless. Read your history. The entire reason we didn\u0027t just go straight for the Moon after Mercury is because we needed to prove that it was even possible in the first place, and no amount of theoreticals was going to cut it for ANYONE. And thus, Project Gemini was born, where we built and tested the technology needed to go to the Moon. We couldn\u0027t just slap together some equipment and just go to the Moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd its the same situation we face with Mars. Its no question that we have a greater understanding of space travel than we did back then, but that doesn\u0027t change the fact that the technology needs to be proven before we can actually send anyone. And regardless of how \u0022silly\u0022 you may think that is, fact of the matter is that the moment an astronaut dies because of some flaw in the system that could have been fixed is the moment you lose public support (and very likely end up with a backlash), and with that goes your funding. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether you do this on the ISS, during a stepping stone Lunar program, or even the old fashioned way with a Gemini-like program, it doesn\u0027t matter.

And you can\u0027t just bring unproven equipment along with proven stuff, for one thats not cost effective and two, if you can go to Mars and back without the new equipment, then WHY BOTHER WITH IT AT ALL? The main goal of any initial manned mission to Mars is going to be the first landing. If that could be done with current equipment and within NASA\u0027s budget they would have done so already.
