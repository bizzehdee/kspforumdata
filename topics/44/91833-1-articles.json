I agree with the above on all counts, particularly the first reply. Think about this: batteries work because some of the electrons from one side have been stolen and stashed on the other side, where they must wait for a conductive object (wire) to connect the ends in order to return. Even a tiny fraction of the electrons is enough to create a sizable charge. I don\u0027t have the exact numbers here, but one electron being \u0022stolen\u0022 equates to a tiny fraction of a volt - something like a millionth of a billionth. A bolt of lightning averages about 30 million volts, making 30 million times however many electrons make a volt. And the number of electrons in a piece of matter is the number of atoms in it times the number of electrons per atom (usually the same as the atomic number) - so a liter of water, for example, has about 3.3x10^26 electrons in it - billions of lightning bolts\u0027 worth. If you took that many protons or electrons and nothing of the opposite charge to contain that energy, well... in the end making a \u0022proton star\u0022 even the size of a melon would result in an explosion many times more powerful than an atomic bomb.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-03T19:56:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s not what a volt is.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WestAir","CreatedById":59115,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-03T21:33:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs it possible at all to have a celestial object with a positive or negative charge?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aethon","CreatedById":110755,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-03T21:43:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow about a strange quark star?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.dailygalaxy.com/my_weblog/2014/04/strange-quark-stars-does-one-actually-exist-in-a-nearby-supernova-research-suggests-that-neutron-stars-may-gradually-tran.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.dailygalaxy.com/my_weblog/2014/04/strange-quark-stars-does-one-actually-exist-in-a-nearby-supernova-research-suggests-that-neutron-stars-may-gradually-tran.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dansmithers","CreatedById":11592,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-04T15:53:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WestAir\u0022 data-cite=\u0022WestAir\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs it possible at all to have a celestial object with a positive or negative charge?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, you just have to rub a balloon against it \u003Cem\u003Ereally fast. \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-Velocity-","CreatedById":74097,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-04T17:10:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WestAir\u0022 data-cite=\u0022WestAir\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs it possible at all to have a celestial object with a positive or negative charge?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, but it would be a weak charge. Most objects WILL in fact have some net weak positive or negative charge, simply because it\u0027s easy to knock electrons off or accept them, so it\u0027s highly unlikely for an object to be in a perfect balance. However, the charge will always be weak. Positive and negative charges are in equal number in this cosmos, and this balance of charge is also conserved in all interactions that I\u0027m aware of. So it\u0027s really hard to make things keep any kind of significant charge separation over time- opposite charges will be attracted, additional like charges will be repelled, and the object will go towards charge neutrality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough electromagnetism is many, many, many, orders of magnitude stronger than gravity, because there are equal numbers of positive and negative charges in the cosmos and those charges neutralize each other, electromagnetism has little effect on large scale structures. Gravity rules there, because there are no negative gravitational \u0022charges\u0022, and like gravitational \u0022charges\u0022 attract. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, because electrons are so mobile, they like to flow. When charges move, they and the electric fields they produce get length-contracted by Lorentz transformations. This gives rise to magnetic fields, which, while magnetic fields appear to be something different from electric fields, in reality, magnetic fields are just electric fields disguised by relativistic effects. All of Maxwell\u0027s equations for describing electromagnetics can be derived from just Coulomb\u0027s law and Relativity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I mention this because magnetic fields can have strong astrophysical effects- not nearly as strong as gravity though- and magnetic fields are, in a relativistic sense, nothing but electric fields.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-06T08:54:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA photon star.
