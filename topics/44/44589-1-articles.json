It is not that it will end the air in the space because the plastic bag will be completely closed and sealed with adhesive tape, in the case of the prototype for the home. In space, you would use a turbine several fans that compressed air so that you have more strength and push the sheet stronger or several sheets that go on air turbine that runs with an electric motor or several motors.
