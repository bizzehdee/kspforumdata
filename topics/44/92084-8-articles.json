A Hohmann transfer to Pluto takes about 45 years. On the one hand we don\u0027t know if a spacecraft can remain operational for that long (the Voyagers are about to hit 40, and that\u0027s way more than anybody expected at the time; the Pioneers weren\u0027t so lucky). On the other hand, it\u0027s also a social problem due to human timescales. By the time the craft reached its destination most of the project leads would be retired or even dead. It would require multi-generational planning, logistics and funding.

On the one hand we don\u0027t know if a spacecraft can remain operational for that long (the Voyagers are about to hit 40, and that\u0027s way more than anybody expected at the time; the Pioneers weren\u0027t so lucky).
