I didn\u0027t think having to go to the point of showing every multiplication would be necessary but here you are. Apparently explaining it all isn\u0027t enough, I have to go through every tiny step of calculation.\n\nTo melt aluminium requires raising it to its melting point of 600C.\n\nAluminium has a very high specific heat for a metal of 1kJ/kgK, meaning for every degree C it\u0027s raised requires 1 kilojoule. Everyday temperature is close to 0C, so 600kJ (600\\*1) required to raise aluminium to melting point.\n\nThen aswell as raising a material to melting point, there is extra energy required to melt it. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll of noticed before that water for instances in a freezer gets very cold much faster than it freezes. This is because of the extra energy needed for a phase change. The latent heat of fusion for aluminium is 500kJ, meaning it takes 500kJ to change solid aluminium at melting point into molten aluminium at melting point. So in total ~1100kJ (that\u0027s 600\u002B500, the energy to get the aluminium to melting point plus the energy to melt it) are required to melt aluminium.\n\nA heavy duty battery has 26 amp hours, an amp hour is 3.6kJ per volt. 26\\*4\\*6=100\\*6=600kJ contained in one battery\n\ntwo batteries have double the energy, 600kJ\\*2=1200kJ.\n\nSo two heavy duty 6 volts batteries contain ~1200kJ."},{"CreatedByName":"Fel","CreatedById":57121,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T19:20:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I assume you\u0027re just a troll now, because not only did I not link a forum (I linked google) you then went onto link a different battery. You know heavy duty and super heavy duty are actually terms in the electronics industry right? They mean things. A super heavy duty battery IS NOT a heavy duty battery. There is a reason they have different names.\n\nYou linked to the first link on google which is a forum. Or are you saying you didn\u0027t even read the webpages just \u0022google\u0022?\n\n\u0022Heavy Duty\u0022 and \u0022Super Heavy Duty\u0022 aren\u0027t really electronics industry terms, they\u0027re consumer advertisement terms. If anything the implication is that \u0022super heavy duty\u0022 should have greater amp-hours than \u0022heavy duty\u0022 which means \u0022heavy duty\u0022 should be less than 11mAh.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Ironically, everything you are saying is ignorance. Power is entirely irrelevant in this. Again, it almost certainly wouldn\u0027t be possible with the power output of 2 lantern batteries either BUT THAT DOES NOT MATTER. The power could be anything, there is not enough energy to melt a kilo of aluminium in two lantern bateries. I have argued it with competence I have not just stated it.\n\nAgain, ignoring the idea that you can use multiple sets of batteries. I gave a fairly valid reason for only hooking two up at the same time and it is believable that the detail was omitted.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Xannari was asked if he used the batteries for the power supply or not and he stated that yes he did.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I decided to use carbon rods from 2 large batteries as electrodes.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E What battery did you use.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 6V heavy duty."},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T19:24:58Z","Content":"You\u0027re being blinded by this single detail, but just look at everything else in the posts.

You are doing inadequate nitpicking on something he didn\u0027t even say.

Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nPower is J/s, the question if it can do it at all rather than \u0022This small aspect of what you\u0027re saying is wrong and I\u0027ll ignore all attempts to point out the possibility of multiple batteries.\u0022 I\u0027ve been advocating that from the perspective of the misconception, there is still enough reasonable doubt to actually TALK about it rather than repeat the same old \u0022It just cannot.\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"BlueCosmology","CreatedById":138863,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T19:35:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You linked to the first link on google which is a forum.
