Why do we need the capsules, when the moss can be directly in the cylinder sections themselves, and orientation of the moss from/to/perpendicular to gravity achieved simply by positioning and orienting the moss inside the compartments ? Because we won\u0027t have two cameras. The problem is depth of field of the camera. To have depth of field 1.5 cm long, the camera lens must be at least 15 cm from the sample. So the camera must be inside the ring, and the image bounced once through a mirror on the opposite side of the sat. Otherwise the camera has to sit on the other side itself, which will give us cca 8 cm camera distance and only 5 mm of depth of field, which means the sample would have to be only 5mm thick, otherwise only first 5mm of it would be in focus and the rest would be blurred.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nicholander","CreatedById":108347,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-15T23:37:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you\u0027re wondering, the pressurized moss area is 9.4 Cm in diameter and 3.5 Cm tall.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nicholander","CreatedById":108347,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-15T23:39:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MBobrik\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MBobrik\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...the camera lens must be at least 15 cm from the sample.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWait, 15 Cm?

Why do we need the capsules, when the moss can be directly in the cylinder sections themselves, and orientation of the moss from/to/perpendicular to gravity achieved simply by positioning and orienting the moss inside the compartments ? Because we won\u0027t have two cameras. The problem is depth of field of the camera. To have depth of field 1.5 cm long, the camera lens must be at least 15 cm from the sample. So the camera must be inside the ring, and the image bounced once through a mirror on the opposite side of the sat. Otherwise the camera has to sit on the other side itself, which will give us cca 8 cm camera distance and only 5 mm of depth of field, which means the sample would have to be only 5mm thick, otherwise only first 5mm of it would be in focus and the rest would be blurred.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe capsules are a relatively standardized system to grow small amounts of moss inside, plus they can incorporate additional lenses to allow for the user to be able to use the naked eye instead of alternate lens systems. Basically the cover (injection molded plastic I think) is shaped to have a lens in it that provides some magnification. I would need to ask Luis about how easy it is to specify the magnification level with this. Alternatively, if we decide we do not need them, we can do a lens-less design. In the early days of this thread we found some links to a few electronic microscopes that were very small form factor devices that seemed to be able to look at objects immediately in front of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally we want to reduce the optics requirements as much as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, having only 5mm for depth of field is pretty much perfect. The starting moss is likely to be approximately a thin paste on the bottom of the capsule (nutrient gel, plus the starting moss material). It will grow into the 5mm capsule over time. Probably about the 2-ish weeks of the experiment. More than enough time for us to get the information we are trying to find.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as why we want to have the mosses oriented all in the same direction despite the different growth directions, it reduces the variables under test and we don\u0027t need to care about the possibility that over the period of the experiment the moss could slip \u0027down\u0027 its container.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would say it is far too early to declare with certainty that we won\u0027t have two cameras.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edeljr15: Right now I do not actually have the specs for the capsules because I was told they can be made to order to our needs. So far it seems that our needs are driven by our rate of image downloading. No reason to cram in a bunch of moss if by the end we will only have been able to take the pictures required for a third of what we put in.

But this is just a tentative opinion of mine based on some information he had said the first time we met. It could turn out that we need images every several hours for this to work.

Does putting the camera on the ring directly really make sense? The issue of how exactly to arrange the camera system seems to have been discussed at length already, and it seems that that really does not make much sense at all. The ring should rotate so the camera can view the samples one by one, and directly into their viewers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was also mention of using several cameras, rather than one. As I saw this, it could be a backup measure--not a means of getting more data-- as if we have one camera only, and that gets damage or fails to connect, or whatever else, the mission becomes, well, pointless. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDown link speed is rather important too, but more for the question of image size and number. This seems to vary quite a good deal by the radio we get (i.e. how much money we spend on a transmitter). Do we really need to talk back up to the satellite very much? It does not seem like we need more than maybe to ping it it get it to send down the images. If that is the case we could probably set up a much simpler comm system than otherwise. Tomorrow I plan to read some more into exactly how fast we may be able to gather data from the sat, and how to talk to it generally, so I may be able to talk more about this then (if I have access to the forum).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the 3D work, that really helps.

But in this case we are screwed anyway, aren\u0027t we ? It would of course require free space in-between, but that would be only marginally bigger than what will be needed w/o mirror, because to get at least the 5 mm DOF, the camera has to be at least 80 mm from the sample, which for all practical purposes means on the other side of the sat as the sample.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@data rate constrains\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few pages back, I computed a rough estimate - we can transfer cca 50 images per one communication window, which occurs ~ 2x per day per ground tracking station. So if we want to take picture each hour, and have some redundancy, we need one ground tracking station per 3 samples. Of course we can increase this by increasing the picture taking interval or/and decreasing image resolution. Or by adding \u003Cem\u003Emoar\u003C/em\u003E ground tracking stations, which, given they are just ham radio with a good antenna, should not be all that difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-16T11:02:59Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2014 11:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MBobrik\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Newt","CreatedById":131025,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T14:31:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMirrors and other optic systems also make me nervous.
