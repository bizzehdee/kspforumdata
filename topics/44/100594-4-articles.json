Mobile phones do not.\n\u003E \n\u003E I know that microwaves are dangerous in high doses/power uses, such as my microwave oven. If used incorrectly it could kill me. But...\n\u003E \n\u003E I know that radio waves (including microwaves) are safe in low doses/power uses. Such as the sun, the air and my tv and my mobile phone.\n\u003E \n\u003E Hope that helps. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThe basic rule for testing is something is safe is to test if large amounts are harmful, you here have to use reasonable amounts as anything including oxygen and water is harmful if enough of it. \n\nYou can now look at groups who is exposed to far more than the normal population, you can also do animal experiments both will show if large exposure is dangerous.\n\nIf you don\u0027t find anything here its no risk, this is true for any chemical and ionizing radiation. In fact the limits tend to be on the safe side, for chemicals getting 1/4 of the dose don\u0027t give you 1/4 of the effect but far less. Drinking a bottle of wine every day is bad for your health, a glass might even be good for you.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I can, because it hasn\u0027t changed at all... as long as technology is profitable it is used on global scale because nobody cares about life. Corporations cares about money and common office slave cares about convenience and job more than about his life. If in 1920 neighbor would discover you are posisoning him or his children he would start to shoot at you, but today people don\u0027t care about their kids life, more value have modern phone, TV and admiration of friends.\n\nit was magnitudes easier to get away with stuff 50 years ago or earlier, or do you seriously claim its easier to pollute today than in 1960? \n\nPeople 100 years ago also had far more important issues than minor health risks. Look up that people died of. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E From your post I can only say microwaves, radio waves, radiation are safe separately, but on the basis of this information you can not be assume that after the closure of 50 people on one floor of a skyscraper amount and strength of the various impacts will continue to be not harmful.\n\u003E \n\u003E Anyone ever did research on iphones or any other smartphone like that? And how it will affect people (and their kids) after 20 years of work in that office?\n\u003E \n\u003E Are those people beyond the reach of the radiation, from phones of people that use them, and masts transmitting and reciving signals from phones?\n\nEver heard about the inverse square law? the power of any non directed transmitter falls by the inverse square of the distance. so if you are 2 meter away you get 1/8 of the signal from 1 meter. \n\nCell phones only drew attention as you hold them to your ear. \n\nLook above on how to find dangerous effects.\n\nNote that lots of health advices come from bad tests, effects is to small to show up, hard to do double blind tests regarding eating more fish ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) and so on. \n\nAdd agendas as promoting an lifestyle or selling an product. \n\nIn short if the effect is to small to show up clearly then trying hard it probably don\u0027t exist.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-26T15:01:11Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2015 03:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by goldenpeach**"}]}
