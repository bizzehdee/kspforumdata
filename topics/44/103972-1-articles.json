That means the border depends on the access of a state on devices capable of reaching that height (planes, missles, etc.). Because of that no exact height number is stated.\n\nThere doesn\u0027t seem to exist an international law concerning that topic. Yes, there\u0027s the space treaty but that doesn\u0027t define at which height space begins. And it doesn\u0027t say anything about the airspace belonging to a country.\n\nDo you know something about that? At which height does you country set the upper limit (if it does)?"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T15:04:51Z","Content":"in my opinion.. space begins were your spacecraft would not fall due its speed even if it try it.

Unfortunately, despite using the phrase nearly 40 times, the treaty never actually defines what constitutes \u0022outer space,\u0022 so interpretations vary from context to context. There is some discussion of that in the [Karman Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line) article. For the most part, it comes down to two figures. 100km, which is roughly where centrifugal force exceeds lift for \u0022typical\u0022 aircraft. And 150km, which is the lowest perigee a satellite can have and complete a full orbit.\n\nSo in summary, anything bellow 100km and not over international waters is somebody\u0027s airspace, and everything above 150km isn\u0027t. The 50km in between are kind of a gray area.\n\nWhether or not an airspace is actually controlled is a separate question. In US, for example, everything above 60,000 feet is Class E airspace, which means that you don\u0027t need flight plan, ATC clearance, or any of that formal stuff that you\u0027d need at lower flight levels. But these are still altitudes accessible to spy planes, so don\u0027t think you won\u0027t raise an alarm crossing borders at these altitudes. Come to think of it, simply climbing to 60k feet ought to put you on some sort of a watch list.\n\nWith all of these complications and hazy areas in mind, if I was building a private space ship and didn\u0027t want various hassles with scheduling launches, I\u0027d probably go for an aircraft launch over international waters. The carrier aircraft would take off from mainland and can cross the border using standard transceiver routines. The actual space ship would then only need clearance for a fly through the Class A."},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T16:36:42Z","Content":"But you can be even at 300 km without any orbit velocity, or equal to the earth rotation, this mean that you will fall and crash in the next moments, the same that any else will do even with less altitude.\n\nOf course if nobody really define space before, or there is not consensus about that, then is open to suggestions.\n\nIn my definition (that of course it may have many loopholes) I take into account in some way what happen if re-entry by atmosphere brake over time.)\n\nBut well, who wanna try to define space without many words and loopholes?\n\nIf you wanna try to define a law, how it would be?"},{"CreatedByName":"Sandworm","CreatedById":66244,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T18:54:13Z","Content":"There is no international law because most countries have themselves internal conflicts. For example, in the US there is no law directly saying that landowners do not own the airspace above thier lands. By \u0022airspace\u0022 I mean everything from ground to mars and beyond. The common law (ie 1000\u002B years old) was that you owned all of it. Then the airplane was invented ... but nobody changed the law. In the US the FAA and others do regulate use above a certain altitudes, but make no claims that they \u0022own\u0022 that airspace.\n\nSimilarly, in the early days of the space race it was thought that any sat would be an \u0022overflight\u0022 regardless of altitude. Many have speculated that, were it not for the lawyers putting the brakes on overflights, the US would have been first into space. Google \u0022international geophysical year\u0022 to learn about that debate. Week governments like the US fed do not have the authority to usurp landowner\u0027s rights. So they don\u0027t speak about owning various altitudes. The treaties they sign instead speak of non-aggression, not officially complaining about overflights. (The US fed is \u0022week\u0022 in that\u0027s its authority is limited in respect to individual states, versus countries like Canada where the national government is the be all and end all.)\n\nIn practical terms, altitude doesn\u0027t matter so much as trajectory. A sat at 1000km, but on a suborbital trajectory, would still be considered an overflight (ie DPRK lobbing things over japan). But something in orbit at 500km would be \u0022a spacecraft\u0022."},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T05:21:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If you wanna try to define a law, how it would be?\n\nIs this question for me or K^2?\nIf you ask me I would go along what Germany does.

In the case of Germany the end of the state\u0027s airspace would be at about 30-40 km height (I think there are missles which can climb up there). In the case of the USA it will reach to the border of space. The USA is known to have missles which can shoot down satellites. That should be enough to prove that it (he? she?) has the means to control.\n\nThis kind of definition has the advantage that you don\u0027t have to define space or at which height planes can\u0027t fly anymore.
