The journey takes 6 weeks to traverse the 11.9 light years, and they fall into orbit around the planet. Shortly after, scanners find it has a breathable atmosphere, and comfortable temperature, and 5 crew go take a look down at its surface.

Hell, they might communicate by warming up different parts of their bodies. As for technology, I would leave it at what they can understand, which, with 11th century technology, probably amounts to telescopes and Rubik\u0027s Cube. But the one thing that I would give them is math. It would be as simple as writing\u00A0a list of numbers from 1 to 100. Then we could ask them to tell us the same. They most likely have a writing system, so it wouldn\u0027t be too hard. After we\u0027ve exchanged numbering systems, we could tell them about pi and zero. The Pythagorean Theorem. Graphing. We could show them how their planet goes around the sun and it\u0027s moons go around it, but knowing how well that turned out on\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethis\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eplanet, even when it was our own species,\u00A0I would leave that bit out for the moment. We could probably tell them that we come from a star in the sky without too much trouble. That\u0027s all I would give until they ask for more, because too much information about how the universe works could shatter their ideologies and create turmoil, like the heliocentric model did for us. Imagine if we showed them that not only were they not the center of the universe, and that they shared it with others, but that we had devices that could communicate across a planet and even across solar systems, or worse, that we had devices that can destroy them at the push of a button.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-06T22:05:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow would humans explain their technology and language to a young alien race?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf history is to serve as a guideline, probably with nuclear bombs and a wide range of nasty diseases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceception","CreatedById":152800,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-06T22:15:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222311165\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022127189\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221449439506\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002278303\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kerbart\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 minutes ago, Kerbart said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow would humans explain their technology and language to a young alien race?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf history is to serve as a guideline, probably with nuclear bombs and a wide range of nasty diseases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAssume the crew of the Starship (And the space agency/s that launched it) is peaceful without (Much) weaponry (For defense).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-07T01:33:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222311165\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022127189\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221449439506\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002278303\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kerbart\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Kerbart said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow would humans explain their technology and language to a young alien race?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf history is to serve as a guideline, probably with nuclear bombs and a wide range of nasty diseases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJesus Christ why does everyone think we\u0027ll answer with violence?!
