Heh, silly kid!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Space Shuttle main engines operate with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. They are stored in those big white rounded tanks on opposite sides of the launch pad area and loaded on the Shuttle only at the (virtual) last minute before launch. The reason they are kept so far apart is that when mixed, hydrogen and oxygen are extremely explosive. (I mean, duh, they\u0027re powering a ROCKET ENGINE with the mix, right?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of its high volatility, it\u0027s extremely dangerous to allow any leaks or seepage to accumulate around the pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiquid hydrogen is used to cool the engine nozzles and then re-circulated to intermix with the rest of it being injected into the combustion chamber. This pre-heats the fuel slightly, increasing engine efficiency as it warms up, so it\u0027s actually in motion within the engines a bit before ignition. The sparklers shower the area underneath the main engines to burn off any escaping hydrogen gas so it can\u0027t accumulate and cause an \u0022unplanned thermal concussive event\u0022 (understatement of the decade) the second the Shuttle\u0027s engines light off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother fun fact:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the \u0022smoke\u0022 you see billowing around the pad is not smoke, but water vapor. Immediately before lighting the engines, the engine apertures in the pad are doused with a water curtain, which pulls the particulate byproducts of the booster engines\u0027 operation out of the air. A great deal of the water is vaporized in the process, resulting in massive clouds forming around the pad at the time of launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe shuttle\u0027s main engines themselves also produce water vapor as an emission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe result is that the Space Shuttle quite literally made it rain behind it as it fired for orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WillHop","CreatedById":67486,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T18:16:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave a feeling this is in the wrong section.

To go orbital would need at least a second rocket stage, some sort of RCS, and a TPS. The actual vehicles would end up being twice as heavy, the mothership would have to be 10 times larger than it is making air-launch impractical, the feathered wing concept would be useless. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would have to be a totally different vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Floule","CreatedById":82840,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-04T14:30:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FITorion\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FITorion\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eshuttle picture thread?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMOAR PICS!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, really, we need a space shuttle pictures thread!

There were also provisions made for 39C, and plans for 39D and 39E, since Complex 39 was planned out in an era when they thought they\u0027d literally be launching a Saturn V every month(!) by the early 70s. (Technically, 39A *is* 39C; the decision was made that they\u0027d only build the two pads closest to the VAB, and redesignate the closest one, originally marked 39C, as 39A; the third pad, originally to be 39A, would be surveyed and plans made to build it, but it wouldn\u0027t be built unless a pad accident, pad damage from launch, or sheer rate of flights required it. 39D and 39E were longer-range plans, intended for either Nova boosters or for Saturn Vs that used nuclear third stages, and would have been served by a completely separate crawlerway that would go through the Nuclear Assembly Building to install the reactor cores into those nuclear upper stages. The \u0022elbow\u0022 in the crawlerway to 39B shows where original 39A/\u0022backup\u0022 39C would have been; that pad would have been at the end of an extension of the \u0022straight\u0022 portion past the turn to 39B. As it turned out, 39B was only used for one launch during the Saturn V era, Apollo 10, and was essentially an unnecessary backup. However, at the time, nobody knew how much damage the Saturn V would do to the pad when launched, so having two pads was seen to be essential. Given it was also used for the Skylab and Apollo-Soyuz Saturn IB launches, allowed for quicker turnaround between launches in the Shuttle era, and was the *only* reason the final Hubble service mission could be flown, I don\u0027t consider 39B wasteful. As a side note, NASA doesn\u0027t plan to upgrade 39A from the Shuttle configuration until/unless they find a need for more than one operational pad at Complex 39 in the post-Shuttle era...)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T20:03:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENibb, SS1 and 2 go above 100km.
