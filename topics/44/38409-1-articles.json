The dimmest possible stars are normally Red Dwarfs and White Dwarfs. We are able to detect objects in the solar system as dim as a \u0022\u002B20\u0022 apparent magnitude reliably; the dimmest possible white dwarf based on the age of the universe is a \u002B20 at 100 light years distance, so even the dimmest possible star within a light year would have been found long ago and observations of it over even a year or two would have shown that it was orbiting the Sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Apparent magnitude for the dimmest possible star would be, absolute worst, \u002B5 - since that\u0027s what Proxima Centauri\u0027s brightness is from 4 light years away, and it\u0027s about the dimmest it could be already - but we\u0027ll be unrealistically optimistic about the potential for a binary and say a much dimmer star was our binary.

However, I personally do not think so. I just have a feeling the extinction rate would be a little more steady. Also the graph doesn\u0027t look all that random either. Course I am not going by the mass extinction spikes. The graph as a whole just isn\u0027t all that random, each little pike is about the same distance apart.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nyrath","CreatedById":61886,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T16:02:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022khyron42\u0022 data-cite=\u0022khyron42\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESide note: In Russian black holes are called \u0022frozen stars\u0022 instead, because black hole meant the same thing that Uranus means to your 10-year-old... \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlas, as it turns out that is an urban legend, propagated by Jerry Pournelle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.arts.sf.written/E1OSDY6JrRs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.arts.sf.written/E1OSDY6JrRs\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dharak1","CreatedById":61137,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T16:32:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI heard there are issues with Neptune\u0027s orbit too and that prompted the search for something beyond it but they only found Pluto but it\u0027s too small.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flixxbeatz","CreatedById":29991,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T16:42:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022khyron42\u0022 data-cite=\u0022khyron42\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe planet Neptune, 19 times less massive than Jupiter, was discovered solely from the pull it was exerting on Uranus from 10 times further apart than the earth\u0027s distance from the Sun. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it means that Neptune was discovered from the gravity it was exerting from my a- ughh. oh. okay. not that one...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PringleMan","CreatedById":1396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T17:07:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is a logic test for whether or not we would be able to see a brown dwarf star that was a companion to our own:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan we detect extra-solar planets: Check\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave we even been able to detect them other than gravitational influences: check\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould a brown dwarf be more massive than a super-jupiter: Check\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre these exo-planets more than a couple ly away?: Check\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould \u0022Nemesis\u0022 be less than a couple LY away: CHECK\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am sure you are seeing where I am going with this. If we have not found a brown dwarf companion to the sun by now, we are not going to. The only good mitigating circumstance that would prevent discovery would be a dust cloud with extremely high extinction, but that would also block out background stars which we would notice. The fact of the matter is that idea came up when they were starting to be able to see the minute gravitational wobbles caused by the extreme outer bodies, but had not discovered them. Now that we know about Neptune, Pluto, Haumea, Make Make, etc. it becomes pretty clear that we had just assumed that Uranus was the end of the planets and other large bodies and did not think of the possibility of there being more out there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd before anyone screams, obviously the combined mass of all outer-solar system bodies is peanuts compared to what the mass of a brown dwarf would be which further throws a wrench in the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T17:45:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd there are other possible explanations for the apparent periodicity of impact events.
