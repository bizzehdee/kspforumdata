Thousands of miles of not thermally insulated superconductor magnets? That would not only waste huge amounts of power, but ice buildup would derail any train that tries to drive there. Keeping the air perfectly dry is going to be pretty unpleasant for the passengers, so you need to seal off the cabin, which again is not trivial.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy all this? So you can go faster? But in a pressurized tube that actually makes it harder to go faster than open air? High speed train lines need to take into account special\u00A0tunnel designs to prevent the train from acting as a plug that forces a huge amount of air through the tunnel.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe speed of conventional trains is limited by several factors, but air resistance\u00A0is one of the primary. You don\u0027t solve it (and driving in vacuum tubes brings a\u00A0whole lot of new problems). Another important factor is power pickup from overhead wires.
