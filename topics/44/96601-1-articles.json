Purely mathematical statements like \u00221\u002B1=2\u0022 are not considered physical laws, and as such the final condition does not exclude the possibility of us being able to state them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll be assuming throughout this post that the Universe is consistent; i.e. there are no meaningful physical propositions which are both true and false. (I\u0027ll admit I\u0027m hand-waving a bit here by not properly defining meaningful; to be frank, I haven\u0027t a satisfactory definition. We can use \u0022observationally falsifiable\u0022 for now, but it\u0027s not clear that a theory of everything won\u0027t be able to result in observationally unfalsifiable statements. For example, metaphysical questions like \u0022what came before the Universe\u0022 would not be considered meaningful.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this case, we can try to invoke G\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00B6del\u0027s first incompleteness theorem on our theory of everything. To my understanding the theorem can be stated as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny formal axiomatic system which can describe basic arithmetic, if it is consistent, must also be incomplete (meaning we can construct \u0022undecidable\u0022 statements which cannot be formally proven nor disproven.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe given definition of a theory of everything was meant to conform with the definition of \u0022formal axiomatic system\u0022 (or whatever phrase mathematicians are using nowadays.) Therefore we can try to apply the first incompleteness theorem to our theory of everything, which presents three possibilities:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYou don\u0027t need to know arithmetic to be a physicist.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThere is no theory of everything; we can construct meaningful statements which cannot be decided in any candidate for a theory of everything.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIn order to conform to the definition of \u0022theory of everything\u0022 given, we need to include any and all necessary mathematical prerequisites; the incompleteness could be in the mathematical prerequisites rather than the physically meaningful questions. I\u0027ll have to grudge my way through Science Without Numbers, ignoring as best as I can that Hartry Field is a bit of a jerk, to see if this possibility can be excluded.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I feel like this post, especially the definition of \u0022theory of everything,\u0022 is becoming a bit of a mess. I wanted to open up discussion on this idea; feel free to criticize my reasoning (I tried conforming as best I could to mere first-order logic for my deductions,) my definition of \u0022theory of everything,\u0022 or anything else about this post. I\u0027m frankly just a mathematician who dabbles occasionally in philosophy, so I\u0027m not too familiar with philosophical conventions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENotes regarding various philosophies of mathematics\u003C/strong\u003E: For accessibility, I\u0027m presupposing the existence of a \u0022real world\u0022 independent of mathematics. This may bug mathematical monists. I\u0027m also presupposing, as the Platonist I am, the absolute truth of mathematics; this may bug others. I have attempted to construct this post in a manner which does not assume that the philosophy being used is correct or justifiable, but only that it\u0027s valid and consistent. I am, however, also assuming that any conceivable theory of everything can be described mathematically, but it may be arguable that the mathematics required is not abstract, and is as such ontologically uncontroversial. If you have no idea what any of this paragraph means, don\u0027t worry; it\u0027s pretty much a fairly unimportant side note.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I do apologize for any and all offense to philosophical beliefs I may cause.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I should note that these in no way reflect the views of the mathematical community and I doubt I\u0027m a typical mathematician when it comes to my philosophy, but it\u0027s too late to change the title now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZetaX","CreatedById":60692,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T03:10:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022real world\u0022 should probably not be seen as the theorems following from your axioms, but as a model of them. This is much closer to how physicists use it, too. In particular, G\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00B6del\u0027s theorem does not apply anymore that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, the undecidable statements could be things like \u0022does this nucleus of Pu-238 decay in the next year\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BF\u0022 that are governed by quantum randomness.
