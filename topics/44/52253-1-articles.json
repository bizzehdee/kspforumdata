How does studying Martian rocks and puttering around an alien red globe help anyone here on the ground other than furthering our knowledge of the universe. I\u0027m not an economist and I still have no idea how a countries economy works but this sounds silly to me. If it works for India and somehow helps brings them out of poverty then that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s awesome, good for you India, but I can\u0027t see how.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t understand the people saying 75mil is chump change so there would be no point in spending it to help the country out of poverty. Yeah its not a lot on a country wide scale but it seems counterproductive to spend it on something that has no monetary gain. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s kinda like saying I have twenty dollars so im gonna use that to go get some college classes instead of eating for a week. And it should be that simple, us Humans we complicate stuff way too much, me included.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm not trying to insult India, I think its cool that at least someone is still taking an interest in our solar system despite any issues they are having, I just hope it isn\u0027t at the expense of their populace. And BTW the American space program did not start while the country was in a state of poverty so its probably not the best comparison. I don\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Eknow\u003C/em\u003E the whole story on India\u0027s situation so please consider that when reading my comments.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T10:53:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you support shutting down NASA?
