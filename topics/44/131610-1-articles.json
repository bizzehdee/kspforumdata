About the time we reach deionization state a protective x-ray shield is added, and then we have an antimatter, neutron and anti-neutron deflector. Next you may note that neutrinos are starting to make you sick, we have a special drug for that, then some very exotic particles appear, the strength of all the hv shielding needs to be increased, your bubble itself is expanding and a rich array of exotic matter is filling the bubble, and then you and the bubble cease to exist. The point may seem meaningless but consider that a universe at its very beginning has little meaning to us, it is rich in things that our age is incompatible with. Many exotic materials existed in that period that science has not yet characterized, but its for acedemic meaning only (at least until humans learn how to harness much more energetic sources of energy).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-08T07:02:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen an observer needs to treat a random cluster of things as an integral entity, he/she/it designates it as \u0022the Entity\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBtw \u0022appear\u0022, \u0022disappear\u0022, \u0022come into existence\u0022 means you are matching two states of something on a time scale.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut the time itself is also a part of the whole system.
