What you get from the rocket, yes, you just use I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E for atmospheric operation. But then your rocket is also going to lose a lot of speed to drag, and that will depend on ascent profile. Either way, however, your total delta will be smaller due to drag.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
