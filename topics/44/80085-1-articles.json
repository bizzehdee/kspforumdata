By the time it reaches its next major research location, it will have covered a full marathon distance of over 42 km. It was originally designed to drive no more than one kilometer over the course of 90 days.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T09:47:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESerious kudos to the engineers who designed that thing and the mission controllers who managed to keep it going.
