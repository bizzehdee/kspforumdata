If you include what was spent during Constellation on this number, as well as what we\u0027re going to spend on it by the time EM-2 lifts off, then sure it\u0027ll probably cost about that much (though you\u0027re still over by a billion provided the numbers stay consistent), but its not particularly fair to do so given the fact that Orion under Constellation was screwed over just badly as every other aspect of Constellation was. What we\u0027ve spent since then was to redesign and actually get the thing ready, and thus far we\u0027ve actually spent less and accomplished more in a smaller amount of time compared to Constellation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, we haven\u0027t invented some revolutionary new tech out of doing so, but we have done what Constellation set out to do originally in regards to the Orion, and thats simply to provide a safer, more reliable spacecraft that can be used to ferry crew to and from space. The capsule design fits this bill perfectly and efficiently. And regardless, Orion itself was never something that would have led to a new technology anyway, nor should have ever been expected to. It is a relatively simple spacecraft that has a simple purpose that plays a relatively minor role in the scheme of things. Trying to up the ante, technologically speaking, in the wake of the Shuttle program would have been the wrong the idea. Our technological progress as a whole needs to move forward a considerable way before we can try to make that leap from a spacecraft to spaceship. (IE, the difference between a throwaway pod named Endeavor that often gets forgotten and a spaceplane named Endeavor that\u0027s highly regarded and well known by the common man, even though the former technically accomplished something more historically important than the latter did)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure it sounds like we shouldn\u0027t have issues building one, but the problem is is that NASA hasn\u0027t built or seriously designed one in over 50 years, and in that time frame, they\u0027ve spent the vast majority of their time designing, flying, and maintaining a completely different type of space craft. This is the same reason why NASA has very few in-house engines, and why old F1\u0027s were being pulled off museum displays and studied. It simply isn\u0027t actually that simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo, its hardly silly. The US has lacked manned capability for years now and there\u0027s no real reason to outsource to Russia for this capability, especially when NASA is focusing more and more on deep space exploration as the private sector begins to enter LEO. Russia won\u0027t have manned deep space capability (and likely won\u0027t for a long long time, though I don\u0027t claim to know much about Russia\u0027s plans) and theres only one private company that\u0027ll be able to provide deep space capability and even that rocket won\u0027t be a perfect solution the problem either, as the Falcon Heavy is optimized primarily for LEO, and won\u0027t be able to deliver what the SLS will be able to deliver to any particular BEO location. Even when taking orbital construction into consideration, you\u0027re still not matching the SLS. The same number of SLS launches are going to deliver more to a particular location than the FH will.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDragon and Orion have different purposes. Orion was never meant to be anything more than what it is, nor does it need to be. We don\u0027t need fancy bells and whistles for a spacecraft whose purpose is largely crew ferrying from Earth to a proper mission module/LEO and back. Reliability and safety is key for this purpose, and Orion will provide this in spades. From the very beginning, Orion\u0027s overall purpose was to replace the shuttle as a crew vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENASA has never deviated from exploration, and its only threw this overall purpose that its delved into so many different fields. They all ultimately go back to whats going to benefit space exploration and in turn benefit the planet as a whole. Nothing NASA is involved in of its own accord is something that won\u0027t eventually come back into (or come from, for that matter) the space program in one way or another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, all that being said, its no secret that Orion and SLS have huge problems in that they were projects that were dictated to NASA rather than something NASA chose to pursue of their own accord, and as such leads to problems of the lack of payloads and active goals. And this really isn\u0027t NASA\u0027s fault (its administrative issues aside). Much of the manned programs problems since it began have largely stemmed from Congress and/or the White House dictating the how, what, and why of what NASA can design and build. This is why the shuttle program grew to be as convoluted as it was compared to what it would have been, and this is why NASA is building a rocket without a truly active manned program in effect. What we\u0027re seeing now is pretty much the equivalent of building and designing the Saturn V without a Kennedy figure saying we need to be on the Moon in 10 years or bust, with the added strain that is keeping alive a vast infrastructure that was developed to support a spacecraft that wasn\u0027t ever fully utilized.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn response to the post above me: Technically, NASA was already established in all but name when the Soviet space program popped up on the radar. NASA was essentially just NACA, but refocused towards space exploration. But no, to say that NASA has no more use is just woefully ignorant, because it literally ignores everything that NASA has done since 1969. And competition is only ever a good thing, regardless of what we\u0027re talking about, because in the end everybody else profits. (Unless we\u0027re talking Cold War arms build up type competition, but that\u0027s a special situation) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECancelling the manned spaceflight program is just ridiculous. That\u0027s basically saying, oh well,we kicked Jimmy and now he\u0027s fallen down and can\u0027t get up. Lets just tell him its time to give up on using his legs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENASA\u0027s biggest problem when it comes to the post-Shuttle program is that it never received the proper funding to get Constellation off the ground (though admittedly that program did have its flaws beyond that) and right now its only receiving just enough to get the US manned spaceflight capability again (and really its still not enough), but not enough to really go anywhere with it as of now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it will be a VERY long time before any other space agency surpasses NASA\u0027s achievements.

Orion under Constellation never got anywhere significant and at the time was the probably the least developed portion of the entire program. Judging Orion based on what happened with Constellation isn\u0027t fair because most of what Constellation developed for Orion has either been completely overwritten or dropped from the design altogether. Really they\u0027re almost two completely different spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd actually its a pretty cheap vehicle given the context. When you adjust for inflation, spending 17 billion today equates to spending about 2 billion back in 1969. And the Apollo CSM actually did take 17 billion (Upwards of 100b in todays money) to develop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd again, 17 billion isn\u0027t all that much. At all. As has been said countless times, when you stand back and look at the big picture what we\u0027re spending right now is a pittance. As scary and huge as 17 billion might seem, in reality its just not. The biggest misconception anyone in the US or anywhere for that matter has is that the space program is this arbitrarily expensive thing, but it has no basis in reality. Want to know how much of every tax dollar goes to NASA? 1 penny. If you want to criticize how much is being spent on NASA, you can\u0027t look at it from the perspective of 17 billion dollars because you can\u0027t judge that amount on a personal scale. This is why its commonly argued that space exploration IS cheap, because the actual cost on a personal scale is just that. A whole penny on the dollar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, yes they did forget. There was a lot of buzz about that years ago in fact, and its largely due first to the general problematic administration (Which NASA has always, always, ALWAYS had a problem with) and then to the Shuttle program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can\u0027t compare the two without taking into consideration what their purposes are. Its not a fair comparison.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause NASA never got adequate funding in the first place. Its quite literally the equivalent of expecting 3 men to do the job of 12 with no overtime pay, and not only that expecting results that would be BETTER than if you adequately funded the program. Its no secret that NASA has its administrative issues, but if theres anyone to blame for NASA not being able to get the job done its the external people dictating what they do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd again you\u0027re arbitrarily putting this expectation on NASA to use bleeding edge technology, and that is just dumb. For one, its been proven time and time again that the same basic design from over 50 years ago is still just as fine in space as it ever was, and given the track record of the Shuttle program, NASA would be wise to say as far from bleeding edge as they can. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELol at the idea of NASA not wanting to try and go to Mars.
