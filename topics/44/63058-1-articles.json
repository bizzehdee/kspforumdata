At which point I am confused.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo Bose-Einstein condensates have volume, or is their volume, in fact, that of a single atom, no matter how many of those you pack in? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd how many of those can you pack together (still cooling vigorously), without them \u0022fusing\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the way until gravity becomes important? A hard limit before that, having to do with ZPE or something?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. I know that technically cooling \u0022to\u0022 absolute zero, is impossible, so the question is about anything (and the amounts of, in a cubic cm/m, 1 bar) taking place riiiiiight before it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-13T07:22:02Z\u0022 title=\u002202/13/2014 07:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Vaebn\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T07:43:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you get it down to around 20K it will liquify and it\u0027s density would be 0.07 grams per cc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt about 14K it will solidify and have a density of 0.086 grams per cc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou aren\u0027t going to make metallic hydrogen unless you put it under extremely high pressure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vaebn","CreatedById":76969,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T08:02:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHm.
