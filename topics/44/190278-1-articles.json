Dismiss the survivors, and utilize them in a nice pet cematary for a million of persons without any traces of proper mummifications-schmummifications.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna56639940\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna56639940\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n13. Repeat pp.1-12.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n14. Find the Copts. Explain them that they are true ancestors of the \u003Cem\u003EAncient Egyptians\u003C/em\u003E \u003Csup\u003E(tm)\u003C/sup\u003E, unlike the Egyptian Arabs.\u003Cbr\u003E\n15. Call their language Ancient Egyptian.\u003Cbr\u003E\n16. Invent the aesthetically perfect Egyptian graphics and hieroglyphics, without any predecessors, with no ancestors.\u003Cbr\u003E\n(No joke, it\u0027s a memetic masterpiece of art for further mass reproduction. Once seen, can be never forgotten, but can be easily reproduced by parts copypasting, by the laziest and silliest student of arts).\u003Cbr\u003E\n17. Try to pick it up with a shovel and through into the fan as Horapollo\u0027s manuscripts.\u003Cbr\u003E\n18. Say oops, after realizing that there are a lot of concepts which can\u0027t be represented graphically (abstract ideas, verbs, a hundred of crop names or fishes).\u003Cbr\u003E\n19. Invent first simplified hieratic, then almost stenographic demotic scriptings, based on the failed hieroglyphics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n20. Make the fake Rosette Stone, which would be called idiotic if it was not made from despair.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHieroglyphic, demotic, and Greek incriptions on the same \u003Cem\u003Ememorial\u003C/em\u003E caption.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLike if you make a memorial caption in Roman letters, Gothic letters, and stenographic scratches...\u003Cbr\u003E\n(In more close analogy for Russian: in Ancient Greek, in Church Slavonic, and in stenography.)\u003Cbr\u003E\nA cultured Ancient Egyptian would be happy with hieroglyphs, a Hellinistic person - with Ancient Greek.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFrom what the hell could they take the idea to add the demotic text??? The only purpose is to present the demotics to the wide public, as a way to write long \u003Cem\u003EAncient Egyptian\u003C/em\u003E \u003Csup\u003E(tm)\u003C/sup\u003E texts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n21. Find a talented linguist Champollion (and several others). Intrigue his professional vanity, let him \u0022discover\u0022 the \u0022Ancient Egyptian\u0022 language which you\u0027ve just finished inventing. Huzza, huzza!\u003Cbr\u003E\n22. Publish his works, intrigue everyone, let everyone touch the mystic world of hot Ancient MidEast beauty, make the Ancient Egypt a classic setting. Her Deity Isis in thin clothes with wings is our everything!\u003Cbr\u003E\n23. Champollion and some of his colleagues suddenly die tragically, but right in time.\u003Cbr\u003E\n24. Open the mummy market, make hundreds of thousands of them in Egypt, then sell in Europe as a medicine, an aphrodisiac, and just a funny toy.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd khopesh! Make as many bronze khopeshes as you can. Screw the idea that the copper should be mined with iron pickaxes, melted on charcoal (yes, those three palms on the horizon), and the tin mining was absolutely rare until the iron age.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n25. Put the pyramid construction junk in four piles one-by-one, put a statue head on the first one, fill the gaps with junk and ground, cover it from side with bricks, call it Sphinx. In early XX add paws and tail for kittiness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n26. Give funny names to the pyramids. Call the biggest \u0022HF\u0022, which is either Cheops, or Khufu, or other versions. But probably just \u0022Jefe\u0022 / \u0022Chief\u0022, /HeFe/.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBtw, they indeed were trying to make something working inside.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEvery pyramid has a hydrostatic sistem, formed by its chambers and \u0022shafts\u0022. Their vertical positions match each other, like if they are to be filled with some viscous liquid from top.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe \u0022great gallery\u0022 looks similar to other same structures, like the \u0022Ulugbek observatory\u0022 in Samarkand, or Fort Lippe near Elvas, Portugal. It\u0027s bad to climb up, but it\u0027s good to pour from top.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0022Bent Pyramid\u0022 aka \u0022Snofru Pyramid\u0022 is a monument of engineering fakeups.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFirst they were trying to build it with the original, sharp angle, from the Cestius pyramid in Rome and \u0022Nubian\u0022 pyramids.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut then it began crushing under its weight. They quickly changed the angle, but soon had to do this again, getting the final angle which they use for Cheops and others.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut as the thing became lower, the planned hydrostatic system appeared to not fit the actual size of the pyramid, so they had to put a half of it outside, building a satellite pyramid to place it inside.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe sarcophagus is put on some another collapsed structure inside the pyramid.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, the \u0022Bent/Snofru pyramid\u0022 should be named \u0022Thousand Facepalm Pyramid\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s the purpose of the hydrostatic system inside?\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat\u0027s not enough clear. The only thing we may be absolutely sure, it\u0027s made by bad people for greater evil, because good people with good intentions don\u0027t build pyramids with mummies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-12-02T16:26:54Z\u0022 title=\u002212/02/2023 04:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Dec 2\u0022\u003EDecember 2, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by kerbiloid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
