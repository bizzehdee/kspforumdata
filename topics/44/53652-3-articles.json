The cold, hard answer is NO ! 40 years ago, Nasa was an organisation that was capable of launching a manned, heavy lift space craft to another planet, now that same organisation cannot launch a single man to orbit with it\u0027s own hardware ! Perhaps it is my warped perspective living on the other side of the Atlantic, but it seems to me fundamentally wrong that the richest, most powerful nation in the world can have a massive space station sitting in orbit, yet no longer has the capacity to reach it on it\u0027s own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E100 billion dollars, think about that figure, mull it over in your mind, it\u0027s a huge amount of money. What else could have been done with that kind of funding ? What opportunities have been missed ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is just one...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDevelop a true heavy lift vehicle. OK. so you want to place a large space station in orbit, unfortunately all you have is the limited payload the shuttle offers so it has to go up in 25 ton sections increasing both the cost, technical complexity and the number of interfaces required on the station. So someone has the bright idea to revisit some of the post Apollo heavy lift proposals to see if there is a better way to do it (this of course never happened, Nasa were still in denial that their elegant, high tech spaceplane was the single worst economic way of getting large amounts of material into orbit ever built)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf they had done, they would have found many different proposals, but many of them shared the basic concept of KISS, separate out heavy lift duties and keep the design as simple as possible.. One typical proposal was Sea Dragon, a monster 2 stage launch vehicle that took the concept of the Big Dumb Booster and evolved it into a Very Big, Very Dumb Booster. Basically built in a standard shipyard out of standard 8mm steel using bog standard shipyard construction methods it\u0027s eventually towed out to sea, filled with hydrogen and oxygen and someone lights the blue touch paper. Whilst Sea Dragon was a beast of a launcher, it was also costed (and verified by independent bodies) as requiring a fraction of the development and construction cost of the existing Saturn 5 launch system. It\u0027s construction was simple, it\u0027s engines were simple, it contained just about enough technology to put itself into the orbit you wanted and most important of all, it wasn\u0027t man rated, it never would be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo lets go a little further down this road. From 1964 until 1973, a total of $6.5 billion ($46.77 billion present day) was appropriated for the Saturn V development and construction of the flight articles. Estimates for the development and first 5 flight articles of Sea Dragon were thought to be in the region of 25% to 35% of the Saturn V programme costs. Well, we all know that major construction projects over run, so lets pick a more realistic figure of 50% of the Saturn V cost. so what do we get for our $23 billion\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell the first thing you get is a launch system that can place 550 tons into Leo. Think about that figure, that\u0027s an entire ISS sized space station placed into orbit on a single launch ! Better still it wouldn\u0027t be the complex, modular, cramped (and very expensive) station we have today, but would be much more along the lines of a giant sized Skylab, much more interior space, far fewer interfaces to go wrong and best of all, a fraction of the cost of trying to launch the ISS one piece at a time. Quite simply, the cost savings on the station alone would have more then paid for any possible over run on the Sea Dragon development.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now comes the even better bit, for our $23 billion we still have 4 flight articles remaining capable of putting 2200 tons total into LEO. That\u0027s a moon base, or a manned Mars capable landing system or simply more giant Skylab type modules to our already large station. Hell, why settle for 3 people up there when we can comfortably house 30 ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA flight of fancy ? Not really, the Sea Dragon concept and technology was well understood even in the 60\u0027s, you really don\u0027t need a lot of technology to get large masses into orbit, you simply need a lot of grunt\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this is what basically frustrates me with the ISS, we could have done it differently, at lower overall cost, built a better station and developed a true heavy lift capability that would have effectively opened the solar system up for manned flight.
