This is more a design question -- what would be the simplest, cheapest, most dependable option for getting a rocket into orbit at an amateur level?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThings to consider include:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nStaging: Serial or parallel?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFuel: Liquid, hybrid, or solid?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGuidance: Gimbal, differential thrust, or aerodynamic?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nParallel staging would allow you to light all your engines on the ground, which is nice if you use liquid or hybrid. But it may not be as efficient since crossfeed is not really feasible. Gimbaling is probably well beyond the capacity of amateurs, but differential thrust is a possible guidance mechanism if you use parallel staging with hybrids or liquids. Aerodynamic guidance will work for lower serial stages but you\u0027d probably need spin-stabilization for the upper stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you did go with a liquid or hybrid rocket, what propellants would be used? The kerosene-and-peroxide combination of Black Arrow is promising; both are pretty readily available and there is already a lot of literature on amateur use of peroxide monopropellant for jetpacks. The primary difficulty with a liquid-fueled design is cycle use; pressure-feeding is tricky to get right for an amateur operation, but anything with a turbopump is probably also too complicated.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA pressure-fed hybrid rocket with something like jellied gasoline and self-pressurizing peroxide is a high-thrust option with respectable specific impulse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-05T21:37:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 stage solid design with aerodynamic guidance for the first stage and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thruster package\u00A0for the second stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Steel","CreatedById":49317,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-05T21:45:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223112452\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022162931\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221499290650\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022115084\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022_Augustus_\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 minutes ago, _Augustus_ said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 stage solid design with aerodynamic guidance for the first stage and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thruster package\u00A0for the second stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure at an amateur level you could build two stages large enough to get you to orbit.

Parallel staging allows you to use common cores (meaning less testing) and ground ignitions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a thought. What about a hybrid/vapor\u00A0pressure-fed rocket using catalyzed HTP as the oxidizer and autogenous pressurant (perhaps with liquid nitrogen as an auxiliary coolant) and jellied petrol as the fuel? The biggest problem with hybrid rockets is getting an even burn surface (combining liquids and solids is hard), but napalm would flow and vaporize rapidly enough that this wouldn\u0027t be an issue, and the HTP would decompose and vaporize so you wouldn\u0027t have liquid-on-solid at any point. If the napalm used aluminum salts as a gelling agent, you could easily get upwards of 260 seconds of isp. While both napalm and HTP are extraordinarily dangerous, they are well-studied and present no particularly exotic handling requirements. HTP can be manufactured with a fairly inexpensive lab setup and petrol is, of course, widely available. If the rocket was equipped with chutes and peroxide-charged (or nitrogen-charged) airbags, it could be easily recovered and refueled much more simply than typical hybrid rockets, since napalm pours readily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn alternate option would be to add a powdered oxidizer to the fuel in very low quantities, so the solid/gel fuel would burn on its own.

What about a hybrid/vapor\u00A0pressure-fed rocket using catalyzed HTP as the oxidizer and autogenous pressurant (perhaps with liquid nitrogen as an auxiliary coolant) and jellied petrol as the fuel? The biggest problem with hybrid rockets is getting an even burn surface (combining liquids and solids is hard), but napalm would flow and vaporize rapidly enough that this wouldn\u0027t be an issue, and the HTP would decompose and vaporize so you wouldn\u0027t have liquid-on-solid at any point. If the napalm used aluminum salts as a gelling agent, you could easily get upwards of 260 seconds of isp. While both napalm and HTP are extraordinarily dangerous, they are well-studied and present no particularly exotic handling requirements. HTP can be manufactured with a fairly inexpensive lab setup and petrol is, of course, widely available.
