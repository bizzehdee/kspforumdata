Energy sources involve?\n\n3-Efficiency added if we exploit hydrothermal vents (black smokers) on electrolysis or other process. \n\n![electrolysis_deep_waters.jpg](http://s20.postimg.org/lzvpkhdvh/electrolysis_deep_waters.jpg)\n\nGraphic details and extra info:\n\nThere are 3 methods, of course we can delivery the o2 and h2 using the same method, but this help to visualize in 1 image.\n\nSomething which is not very clear, is the pressure relation with the electrolysis efficiency, in theory taking into account the Gibbs Energy, it should cost more energy split water under pressure, but is the other way around. Also all best efficient methods work with high pressure electrolysis.\n\n*\u0022high pressure electrolytes will consume less power in the process of electrolytic decomposition. The main reason was stated to be*\n\n*the shrinking effect of pressure on the gas bubbles which cause the ohmic voltage drop and power dissipation to reduce. Moreover, high pressure electrolysis has less power demand for the phase of product compression\u0022, the max efficiency is at 700 bar with 250 c*\n\n[http://www.electrochemsci.org/papers/vol7/7043314.pdf](http://www.electrochemsci.org/papers/vol7/7043314.pdf)\n\n**Method A**\n\nThis is the most simple case to visualize with Force \\* Distance = Work,\n\nIf we produce 1m3 of hydrogen with water at 700 bar, then in that volume we have 42kg of hydrogen.\n\nThis is equal to 5600 mjoules/m3 = 1583 kwh (energy of 1m3 h2 at 700 bar)\n\nLifting force and work:\n\n9388 N \\* 7000 mts = 65.7 mjoules = 18 kwh\n\nThen we need to add the oxygen lift force and work.\n\nIf we produce 1m3 of hydrogen, then we should (??) produce 1/2 m3 of oxygen, at 700bar weight 375 kg aprox, this provides 1225 N of force \\* 7000 mts = 8.5 mjoules = 2.3 kwh\n\n18 \u002B 2.3 = 20 kwh which seems negligible, but it does not need compression.\n\nA1--\u003E h2 load, displace water out\n\nA2--\u003E tank full of h2 rising\n\nA3--\u003E the tank release the h2 and let the water in, it remains open all the way down.\n\n**Method B**\n\nIn this case we dont use a fixed tank, we use a bag, and we allow the bag expand meanwhile rise, this calculation is not simple, we should integrate, but we would need to include the pressure variable in some way. But is pointless, because the extra energy we would get, it will be the same (in theory) needed to compress the gasses back at 700 Bar.\n\n**Method C**\n\nHere we produce and exploit the flow that we get injecting h2 or o2 bubbles to a pipe, the bubbles transfer the kinetic energy to the flow, all bubbles over the 7000 mts help on this, depending how much water flow we allow under the tank it will determine the storage pressure (10 bar= huge flow same values than method B, 700 bar = small flow same values than method A)\n\nIn theory, we should have the same power output vs the other methods.\n\nBut with this we have extra benefics, we are injecting cold water full of nutrients in the surface, this increase the algae and plankton, which will absorb sun light (as solar panels) and absorb extra co2, it can be used as a perfect place to fish.\n\nSo? what methods seems better? we get some beneficts from the thermal gradient in the sea or is negligible?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-16T22:43:14Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2015 10:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AngelLestat**"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T23:04:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m always wondering what would be the most cost/efficient way to exploit and storage wind energy.?\n\nGoing by your photo, since chlorine only has to transfer one electron it preferentially undergoes oxidation and you produce CL2 gas not Oxygen.

As with all in science.\n\nElectrolyzing sea water is different from electrolyzing aqueous solution of sodium chloride because sea water is a heterogeneous mixture. The solution itself contains alkali and earth alkali metal cations, as well as various anions, chloride being the dominant one, followed by bromide.\n\nBefore anything, sea water needs to be filtered and treated chemically to remove certain ions which would clog up the system when their precipitates form.

It would be great if we can get the heat from an hydrothermal vent, that would reduce the power needed by a lot, also all hydrothermal vent are pretty costant.\n\nNot sure how the sea composition change with deep, this is on average:\n\n![Sea_salt-e-dp_hg.svg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Sea_salt-e-dp_hg.svg)"}]}
