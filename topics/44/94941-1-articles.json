For example, even though the Internet does connect anyone with an Internet connection, users mostly gravitate to online communities with similar cultures, interests, languages, levels of humor, and vocabulary. While mass communication would be essential between worlds, the distance would create distinct extraterrestrial communities which would reduce interplanetary communication. Additionallily, early extraterrestrial settlers would be in small enough numbers that necessary bandwidth to earth is more manageable. As these settlers expanded, I would expect to see less communication with earth, as it would drop out of importance in that society.
