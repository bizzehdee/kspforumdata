SpaceX\u0027s Falcon 9 rocket has almost identical engines throughout the stages. The lower stage has 9 Merlin engines, the upper stage has 1 Merlin with a nozzle extension. Since a single rocket requires 10 engines, they can mass-produce the Merlins and cut costs by economies of scale. Furthermore, using only one engine design cuts R\u0026amp;D costs, since the engineers have only one engine type to worry about; most of the tooling can be specified for this engine alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only other engine SpaceX makes are the Draco engines used in Dragon spacecrafts, which are simpler hypergolic thrusters mostly used as OMS/RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
