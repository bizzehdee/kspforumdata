The affect of no gravity during the flight are comparable. Before Elon Musk can die on Mars he first has to survive the trip to Mars (or Venus).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo a rotating ship as mentioned by kerbiloid with 1 meter thick composite with a density of 2.0 is 2000kg per cubic meter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a rotating ship to work the human body would on average need to experience 1 g of force, this means either 2 to 0 g. But the effect of less gravity also includes the eyes. Consequently the head needs at least half of a g-force.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe average human of 6 feet tall would need to be in a cylinder. And the device needs to be balanced, iow it would hold two individuals. Such a device 2/3 of a meter by 1/2 a meter (minimally) or about 7/12 of a meter in inside diameter and an exterior diameter of 19/12ths of a meter would have a crosssectional area of 1.968 square meters at the base (v=1.968 m3) and 1.7002 along the column. In order for the g force to be 4.9a at top of head and average 9.8a over then entire length of the body (4.9 \u002B X)/2 = 9.8\u00A0 then at the feet G should be 14.7 a. The column should be 2.74 meters in length( v = 4.65 m3) The mass of the body, alone would be 2 x (4.65 \u002B 1.968) = 13.25 m3 x 2000 kg/m3 = 26,504 kgs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSee other thread about the amount of ground rocket to escape velocity. Basically you need An atlas IV rocket to send 3000kg to escape velocity. Double that to reach mars and retro into orbit. So to get 26,504 from a launch pad to Mars you would need the equivilent of 17 atlas 4 rockets. This does not include non-g areas of ship, its food and water supplies or the mars or venutian lander. So lets just say a launch rocket about 5 times the size of a SaturnV rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, no, thats not a solution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-22T18:32:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLcd-kDNtJc\u0026amp;t=1187\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis might be relevant here\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn interview with John Amabile, who wrote a book detailing how to terraform and colonize Mars and Venus within a human\u0027s lifetime. Now, I\u0027m sure everyone has their own opinion on whether or not that\u0027s a reasonable estimate (I certainly do have one), but discussing that essentially boils down to crystal ball reading, and so is fairly pointless. Maybe a more interesting topic is the details of how exactly this person thinks it could be achieved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo start with, he outlines that the following should happen:\u003Cbr\u003E\n- The USA exits the Outer Space Treaty, thereby becoming able to declare themselves owner of property in space\u003Cbr\u003E\n- The USA invites its numerous allies to also exit the OST, and instead join them in their efforts, so that a new power block is formed that can hold its own against the UN and the rest of the world\u003Cbr\u003E\n- In return, each country joining would receive a guarantee along the lines of \u0022own 1% of the solar system\u0022 (exact details up for negotiation)\u003Cbr\u003E\n- The various countries would then sell or lease parts of their stakes to private companies for money, or form state owned companies dedicated to resource exploitation\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Space exploration would be driven primarily by market forces - in other words, if there\u0027s money to be made, people will be all over it\u003Cbr\u003E\n- The USA uses its vast amounts of existing military technologies to enable rapid resoruce exploitation and planetary colonization by asteroid bombardment\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Asteroid mining, orbital fuel depots and space tugs feature heavily in this vision, as does nuclear thermal propulsion\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe author posits that all of this is possible now, using existing technologies. The main thing holding it back is that \u0022nobody cares\u0022. As in, the general public neither knows nor cares that this might be possible. He gives the comparison that if the government decided to declare airplanes illegal in 1900, nobody would have cared either, even if today it would be unthinkable. Perhaps space exploration could become as much a thing that everyone cares about as airplanes are today. It certainly would have to in order to make this plan work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverall, it\u0027s a pretty radical approach IMHO. What do you guys think - would it work? if not, could it be modified to make it work? (At the end of the interview you can find the author\u0027s website and his youtube channel where he goes more in depth about some of his ideas.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DAL59","CreatedById":180784,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-22T19:53:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223198262\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022166181\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221508365046\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107380\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 10/18/2017 at 6:17 PM, PB666 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nintensity of magnetic storms increases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe dense Venusian air actually results in less radiation in the Venusian upper atmosphere than on the Martian surface.\u00A0 There\u0027s also plenty of solar power for active shielding.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223198262\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022166181\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221508365046\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107380\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 10/18/2017 at 6:17 PM, PB666 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nrotating ship\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nISS tours are about the same length as a mission to Mars/Venus airship would be.\u00A0 The astronauts take a while to get back to peak physical strength, but they don\u0027t die upon return.\u00A0 On Mars, the recovery would be much easier, given the low gravity.\u00A0 Especially with the faster transit times offered by the ITS, artificial gravity en route is not necessary at all.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223198262\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022166181\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221508365046\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107380\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 10/18/2017 at 6:17 PM, PB666 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nr.

In fact, there\u0027s a lot of things you can get from asteroids that you \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E get from Mars, like phosphorus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWater? Same deal as before, get your ice from comets and asteroids.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRadiation shielding? Here Mars has a slight advantage, in that it has more space available to put stuff beneath several meters of rock. But it\u0027s not too hard to add some layers of shielding to a spacecraft. If you really want to go the distance, you can hollow out an asteroid and use that as your living space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is nothing on Mars or which can be provided by Mars that cannot be obtained more easily from small-mass asteroids. Colonizing planets is a foolish distraction, the idea of which is only kept alive by naive romanticism. We should be focusing on building arkships and asteroid habitats, which pose far fewer engineer challenges and have the added benefit of being mobile. (Or mobile enough that we could set one [or two, or three, or a hundred] up to slowboat out of the solar system, thereby ensuring the continued survival of the human species, even if, say, a gamma ray burst scoured the life from every planet in the system.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR: Mars ain\u0027t the kind of place to raise a kid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgreed, the dreamy-eyed Mars and Venus colonization dreams are just that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut to address one issue. If we come up with a constant t\u003Csub\u003Ek\u003C/sub\u003E where t\u003Csub\u003Ek\u003C/sub\u003E is the time each day dealing with the effects of low gravity on the human body. Here on earth t\u003Csub\u003Ek\u003C/sub\u003E = 16 hours per day and since we are out of bed 16 hours a day walking around at 9.8 g then our bodies do not need to set aside time to deal specifically with gravity we can create a metric of 9.8m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E x 43200 sec/day or 4.9m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E (averaged over a day). Mars has a gravity of 0.376 is a person works 8 hours per day that gives the person\u00A0 1.222. This means they only spend 9 hours in the gravity machine to get the same quota as earth. In zero gravity they would have to spend 12 hours a day and then 4 hours working at zero gravity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA second issue is that construction is one hell of alot easier with some gravity versus zero gravity. The earth itself (or mars) is a foundation for all buildings, it provides traction, friction, a hard place to provide force against.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA third issue is that water on mars is trapped on the surface and you apply force to get it out of its trap, given the preexisting colony on mars extractin water from martian soils in and of itself is expensive, but doable.. On asteroids water is not as abundant and on comets its abundant but its incredible unstable (as the recent asteroid landing mission shows) and most comets apogees require more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E than landing on Mars. If you land on an asteroid you have to bring your own hydrogen with you. Oxygen can be extracted from the metal salts. And for those who think we can extract hydrogen from space, the level of proton in space at 150,000,000 km from the sun is a factor of 1 billion of what we need to be to extract. There is a way to overcome the problem, take a comet, wrap it in a non-breathing material (and shield the sun expose side) and force it into an asteroid with a low relative \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E. Now you have volatiles and solids, you can do something. Keep the asteroid side always sunfacing (tidally locked) and the comet side anti-locked. To do this we need an energy source of a way we currently don\u0027t have, because comets reside in the part of the system with \u0026lt;/14th the sunlight that earth has. Solar panels produce 135 watt for 1 meter panel, at best 135 W/ kg of panel. The energy density require to move a comet down to earths orbit needs to be at least 2 magnitudes higher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYOu could move a asteroid into a comets orbit (again \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E from earth is an issue) and once again we have the issue of a higher wattage density power plant. While comets provide a readily usable ejection mass, some manipulation of asteroid will have to be done (e.g. purifying magnesium or manganese).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe correct way to think about the problem is How do you provide humans with proper radiation shielding and proper gravimetric exposure while simultaneously providing the opportunity to build a colony. If a martian colony is built into the surface and if only they need the surface as an energy source, and they can work at least 6 hours a day at martian gravity and some other hours in a centrifuge then it does seem to be easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut if we ask the question, humans are to explore X. Yeah X should be a roid whose orbit is most similar to earths.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-10-25T18:06:42Z\u0022 title=\u002210/25/2017 06:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 25, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal7","CreatedById":182165,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-25T19:22:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223203269\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022166181\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221508954516\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107380\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, PB666 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgreed, the dreamy-eyed Mars and Venus colonization dreams are just that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you said, 100%.
