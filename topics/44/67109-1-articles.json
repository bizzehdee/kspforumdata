They couldn\u0027t wait any longer and besides, if microgravity didn\u0027t hold such important learning experiences, then we WOULD have gone back, or more likely, focused more on Mars, sadly that path leads to no SLS, but rather back to the Saturn Nova.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was inevitable.
