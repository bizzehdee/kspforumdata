They had several dozen tiny rockets lined up next to each other, burning down along the spike. This is the same thing, except circular.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving a single combustion chanber with a ring exhaust is actually a bad idea because you need to hold the central plug in place somehow. That generally means having metal struts in exactly the spot where the engine burns the hottest and hardest. That tends to melt anything that isn\u0027t actively cooled.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
