However, when you are standing on A or B, things get a little more complicated. A would not see B as traveling at the speed of light, nothing (with mass) can reach the speed of light You need to use the Lorentz Velocity Transformations to find out how fast B will be going in A\u0027s frame. It turns out that when A looks at B, it seems as though B is traveling at exactly .8c, and since they are traveling at the same speed (in opposite directions) with respect to you, then B sees A as going .8c as well. Velocities do not add up the way you would expect when you get to high speeds, this is because the speed of light is constant for everyone, and because there is no preferred frame of reference from which you take your measurements.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WestAir","CreatedById":59115,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-29T15:43:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe the correct formula here is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eu\u0027 = (vb-va)/ (1-vbva/c^2))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EU\u0027 is the end velocity [The answer to your question] that we\u0027re trying to learn.
