I need someone to build me an upper stage, all you need to do is to make an entirely new engine, reinforce the structure to make it suitable for the flight, slap on it an adapter and invent a way to send it to Cape Canaveral. You already have the tanks for Ariane 5, so it should be pretty easy. Love, NASA.\u003Cbr\u003E\nP.S. You need to pay for it too, and preferibly assemble it before 2026 so that I can maintain my schedule. Thanks!\u0022\u0022It\u0027s how Apollo did it so it\u0027s right\u0022 isn\u0027t a great argument, considering you\u0027re talking about a program that could only do the definition itself of a flags \u0026amp; footprints series of mission before being cancelled for its unsustainable costs. Add to that the fact that the only way Lunar Orbit Rendezvous was considered better than EOR (i.e. multiple launches) was in that it was more likely to fulfill the lunar landing goal in this decade despite costing quite a bit more, and it\u0027s a pretty meaningless phraseThat\u0027s not how it works, at all. This is the least thought out part of the article (which isn\u0027t thought out a lot by itself), so I will focus on this in part specifically.\u003Cbr\u003E\nGiven that you haven\u0027t, let\u0027s start by putting some math here:\u003Cbr\u003E\n- ICPS is 13 meters high, and the ariane 5 core is 31m; replacing one with the other will bring the full stack up of, at the very least, 18 meters\u003Cbr\u003E\n- the full SLS is now 116 meters high, or five more than Block II Cargo. This means a higher launch tower, which means a higher cost both to develop and per launch, but the article makes no mention of how this would reduce expenses so let\u0027s just ignore money, as there\u0027s more absurd parts here.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou have now obtained an almost a hundred and twenty meters high monstruosity (probably by 2030 or so, very optimistically) that has the capability to launch Orion by itself in a TLI, enter NRHO and then... do nothing. That\u0027s because in the whole article you forgot to adress the premise itself: where\u0027s the lander? In those 116 meters there\u0027s no free space whatsoever for nothing but some cubesats, surely not for a lander that can go NRHO -\u0026gt; lunar surface -\u0026gt; NRHO. You need to make some space for it by making the rocket higher and adding a long interstage to comanifest the lander.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, you run into a second issue of this nonsensical architecture: the Ariane 5\u0027s radius is \u003Cem\u003Emuch \u003C/em\u003Esmaller than the one of SLS, so small that it\u0027s only 15 mere centimeters more than Orion. With EUS you\u0027d have a 9 meter fairing in which to fit your comanifested lander, but now, you have to make it fit into \u003Cem\u003E5 \u003C/em\u003Emeters instead.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe LEM had almost 7 meters to fit in thanks to the fantastic S-IVB, and it had to only go to LLO; this one needs to go all the way to NRHO thanks to Orion\u0027s absimal service module. Let\u0027s say that this adds only 15 more meters; this is more or less the height of the National Team lander, which couldn\u0027t fit at all into this fairing diameter, but let\u0027s keep it because I\u0027m an optimistic person - maybe ESA can help NASA by finding two more meters inside a 5 meters fairing.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYour monstruosity is now 131 meters tall; thankfully the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E doors are 138 meters high, so that\u0027s not a problem, right? But unfortunately, this rocket doesn\u0027t have wheels, and can only move above one of those NASA crawlers that carried shuttles, saturns and now SLS. That\u0027s an issue, because the 6-8 meters of the crawler make your rocket go above the top of the door; add to that the fact that you *also* need the Mobile Tower specifically built for this rocket, and you\u0027re probably a full 10 meters above the limit.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow you have a 145ish meters rocket on the pad, a semi destroyed \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E door and a few thousand tons of LH2 and LOX waiting to send four brave people to the moon. What\u0027s still missing, however, is the lander: cause again, you started with the premise that you need to do this to solve the lander problem, but \u003Cem\u003Ethere\u0027s no lander that could work with this architecture.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EI don\u0027t mean one that is being built, mind you: there are zero lunar lander \u003Cem\u003Edesigns\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ewith enough fuel to go from NRHO to the moon and back that fit into a 5 x 14 fairing. There\u0027s exactly 0 chances that someone could design, build and test a crewed lander by 2025 starting from scratch - hell, I doubt someone could do that by 2028 by the time EUS will probably launch.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m sorry but, this post really wasn\u0027t thought out much\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Correct the SLS with the Exploration Upper Stage(EUS) was to be the SLS 1B.

You say 130-150t to LEO. OK, go with that (though the upper stage is then doing substantially more work than ICPS is just to get to parking orbit\u2014which I will completely ignore). Your concept uses an engine with an I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E of 432-440s. We can look at 130t in LEO to 150t in LEO, largely residuals. Ariane core is 12-14 t, but we need interstage for lander, etc, call it 15t being generous. Orion is ~27t (not counting the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E). So our LEO stack is 130-150t minus 42t for dry mass plus the CSM.

For that stack (note I was being really generous saying 65-70t to TLI), the 150t to LEO won\u0027t do it either (~2500 m/s). For the Orion plus minimum lander stack to work, we need 83t to TLI, which means ~175t to LEO, any less than that, and a single stack SLS to the lunar surface\u2014assuming Orion\u2014is impossible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo this idea is a nonstarter for the 2 stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe 3 stage lander has a lower minimum mass. Using all the lowest masses, the 130t to LEO does not close (screwed up sleepy last night) at ~2300 m/s (need 3200) even with RL-10. 150t to LEO doesn\u0027t work, either, even with a less massive 3 stage lander.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo we need to get the mass to LEO at or very close to 160 tonnes to LEO for any SLS mod to work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf Orion could be dumped, then all we need is ~50t to TLI (and stock SLS is still garbage, but some variant might work).
