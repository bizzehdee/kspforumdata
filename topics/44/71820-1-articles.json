Since momentum (p) is equal to mass (m) multiplied by velocity (in this case the speed of light or c), then one might expect photons with zero rest mass to have zero momentum. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, photons have energy and so from Einstein\u0027s equation (E=mc2), they do have relativistic mass. From the Planck equation, e=hf, where f = frequency and h = Planck\u0027s constant. Substituting into Einstein\u0027s equation we get hf=mc2 and therefore m = hf/c2. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe momentum of a photon (mass x velocity) is therefore chf/c2 or simply hf/c. Assuming a perfect reflector exactly perpendicular to the direction of travel of the photon, that photon will transfer 2hf/c units of momentum to the sail.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shynung","CreatedById":101096,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-13T17:11:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KOCOUR\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KOCOUR\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut of cours you cant use it for spacetravel as there atre no roads or air in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E:-D\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne could use electromagnetic coils to hurl ferromagnetic propellant at high speeds.
