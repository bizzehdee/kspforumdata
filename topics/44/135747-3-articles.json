Besides being able to launch much bigger payloads in one piece (so you could launch the entire ISS in 4-5 launches rather than 30\u002B), it will be much cheaper than the Shuttle in terms of dollars per ton to orbit. It costs less to NASA per year (~$1.8 billion rather than ~$3 billion for the Shuttle). Plus it\u0027s actually on budget and ahead of schedule, partly due to its more efficient design compared to Shuttle and Ares. If the marginal cost estimates of $500 million per launch come true, it would even be competitive with the Falcon Heavy in terms of cost per mass in orbit.

It\u0027s been in development since 2004 or so, and the total amount spent on it until its first crewed launch in will be greater than that spent on the SLS. It was originally designed for lunar missions, so it has some carryover baggage. A capsule designed specifically for longer-term missions like Mars would be more efficient. Orion can\u0027t really do much by itself, just go in orbit around the Moon and come back.

I think that attempting to recover F9H core stages would be well beyond that. If SpaceX wants to reduce cost of the F9H by recovering engines from the core stage, I think they should look towards the past--specifically, the Atlas booster, and the S-ID first stage for evolved Saturn Vs proposed in the late 60s. Both used a \u0022stage and a half\u0022 design where the outboard engines were mounted on a \u0022collar\u0022 that could be jettisoned once they were no longer needed. While the Atlas\u0027s booster engines were expendable, the S-ID design was intended to not only increase payload, but to also reduce cost by having the four outboard engines recovered and refurbished for reuse on a future launch. The inboard engine on the S-ID would be a sustainer, and would not be recovered, but by recovering four out of five first-stage engines, the bulk of the stage cost could be recovered, compared to the S-IC.\u003Cp\u003EThe new F9 design, with the circular ring of outboard engines as opposed to the square nine-pack design used on the early boosters, would be ideal for a similar \u0022stage-and-a-half\u0022 setup; it could even be configured as a dual-collar design, such that only four engines are jettisoned at a time, allowing even earlier reductions in thrust (and making recovery of all the engines simpler due to having less weight to land safely)...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem with only returning the engines is that they would have to splashdown, adding control and fuel to do an accurate landing would be complicated, Another design where the engines was in a sort of miniature boosters who separated and landed might be possible but would be an totally different design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElse I agree with you, one benefit is that the core and the boosters share most design so they might reconfigure aging boosters as core stages instead of doing major services. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn barge might be possible, not sure how stable it would be, thing it require some stabilization system it would also need an service ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-27T19:52:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMaybe SpaceX could move to something more stable, like that.
