Your question might be not about the observed speed/velocity (only), but peculiar velocity. One way to define them is by setting a local standard of rest (the method that is also used to get the true velocity of stars in our own galaxy, noting that Sun also moves) on the scale of galaxies. Then you can start to see for their true peculiar velocity. It\u0027s very long mathematically, but the main idea is that if the velocities are truly random, their average should be zero (at rest)."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T14:36:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E None of that makes any sense.
