When I started playing this game I knew absolutely nothing. I thought if you just went straight up you would get into orbit. Thank you Scott Manley for teaching me the error of my ways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell tonight I have my interplanetary mission to Jool with 6 probes with all kinds of science things ready to go. During the massively long burn phases I thought about why objects that are further away from the object that is their sphere of influence moved slower than others that are closer. Finally a light bulb went off in my head. I could be way off here but to me it seems that they don\u0027t actually move slower it is all relative. The further an object is from its SOI the further around the object it has to travel thus all objects more at pretty much the same speed around its SOI, possibly regardless of their own mass as well. I would guess then that the determining factor of a speed needed to reach orbit would be the mass of the object that is causing the SOI because of gravity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this makes sense and if it does can someone who is good with this stuff tell me if I am right or wrong.

I see all these people back and forth with each other on who\u0027s right and who\u0027s wrong. None of it answers me question. I would like to know the answer to my OP but I think its best to close this thread as I have seen too much head butting over it. ANY MOD PLEASE CLOSE THIS AT THE REQUEST OF THE OP. thank you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI only wanted to learn, not cause conflict. Thank you all that posted. I read and somewhat learned in me limited way (why I asked for simple terms). TY again. but I cannot see a thread going on causing this much conflict. goodnight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
