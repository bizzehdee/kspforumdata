Something similar did happen in the aftermath of the First Gulf War: the smoke from several hundred oil well fires darkened the skies over Kuwait and sent temperatures down several degrees nationwide. Before this happened, a number of scientists (including Carl Sagan) had theorized about what would happen if the Iraqis did this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll their predictions were wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe actual results from the Kuwait oil fires were temporary, localized, and a lot less damaging than the predictions said they would be--despite a large number of wells, all over the nation, burning day and night, vaporizing six million barrels of oil a \u003Cstrong\u003EDAY,\u003C/strong\u003E for months.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, right off the bat, everybody, keep this in mind: we\u0027re theorizing. The best scientific minds in the world can be (and were!) wrong about this, so you all can too. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:o\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 title=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd global warming is a good thing because it results in more biodiversity, more farmable land, \u003Cstrong\u003Eless\u003C/strong\u003E desert and tundra \u003Cstrong\u003E(NOT MORE!),\u003C/strong\u003E milder winters, and various other things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow do I know? Because the above things \u003Cstrong\u003Ehave already happened\u003C/strong\u003E on Earth, many times. Most notably during the Paleocene epoch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProbably all of you are familiar with the \u0022medieval warm period\u0022. Well, turns out that wasn\u0027t the only warm period in history. There have been at least three: the Minoan warm period (three thousand years ago), the Roman warm period (two thousand years ago), and the medieval warm period (one thousand years ago). Uhhhh.....gee, I\u0027m seeing a pattern in there. I wonder when the next warm period was supposed to be.......\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, these three warm periods are all called \u0022climate optima\u0022. There\u0027s a reason for that. The climate during those periods was optimal for the human civilizations that existed (and for the wildlife as well). Whereas (you\u0027re all probably also familiar with this) the \u0022Little Ice Age\u0022 was bad news for everybody involved. Too warm and too cold both cause a mix of good and bad things--but history has shown that human beings (and other living things) do much better when it\u0027s too hot than when it\u0027s too cold.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, before anybody goes off on a bender and starts arguing about the above: remember that all of this is \u003Cstrong\u003Eactual Earth history.\u003C/strong\u003E Everything I described up there actually happened. It\u0027s basically impossible to argue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe get an similar effect from volcanoes as from nuclear winter, key word is how high the ash cloud reach. Forest fires and oil wells don\u0027t push ash into the stratosphere.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHuge volcanoes does, that is huge Krakatoa is the only in modern time who had an measurable\u00A0impact on climate the next year. Use of many multi megaton nukes could\u00A0have an impact, not sure how the 500-200 kt nukes who was more common during the end of the cold war, smaller explosions who will not push ash so high.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyway volcanoes are dangerous here because how much ash they throw out, pushing ash high into the air is one of the key effects and it can last for days an megavulcano like Yellowstone will probably give an nuclear winter effect same with an dinosaur killer asteroide\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut yes the doomsayers used it for the burning of the oil wells even if they should have known better.
