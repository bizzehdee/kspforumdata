Without sustained fission U-235 is just about 5 times more active that U-238, so that the activity of natural isotopic composition is barely higher than of pure U-238. If you add equilibrium amount of natural decay products to the equation it goes up by an order of magnitude, but still not really high. And if you take in account penetration capability (which is not very high for charged particles), radiocarbon in your body might be more dangerous than a small piece of uranium in your hand. (And do you know that zinc uranyl acetate is pretty much a common analytical reagent?) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here goes one thing that anti-radiation people always forget - natural radiation level. All life on our planet is pretty much resistant to what radiation is normally present around and even inside (C-14 and K-40 being the prime examples) and often can resist something by couple orders of magnitude higher without any problems. If one hit of ionizing radiation to DNA molecule was deadly, the life would go extinct long ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomehow, radical reactions caused by naturally occurring UV levels can be much more dangerous than naturally occurring ionizing radiation levels (damn, I can\u0027t get normal tan, I get sunburn instead).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"running","CreatedById":82033,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-13T22:23:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooking at the chart....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEating 1 banana... is 2 the dose of sleeping next to someone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t eat banana\u0027s... hence I need to buy a bigger bed... right?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-13T23:14:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WestAir\u0022 data-cite=\u0022WestAir\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E0.
