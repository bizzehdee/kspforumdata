Some rockets, (Titan, Soyuz) do this by lighting the next stage while the first is still burning. Some stages such as Saturn V stages use ullage motors, solid rocket fuel motors that keep the stage in a state of acceleration while the main engine lights. Ullage motors are solid and the fuel doesn\u0027t move so zero G is not an issue. Some stages such as Centaur (As far as I know anyway) use RCS to push the stage and function as ullage motors just before the stage lights.\n\nSo far so good.\n\nHow is the RCS fuel kept from floating around the tanks they are in? My guess is that inside the tank the fuel itself is in a bladder and that you can pressurize the inside the tank but outside the bladder so that as the fuel is used it can\u0027t float around. But I am not sure such a system works in the cold. My next guess is that if the line is large enough, the fuel in the line can be used to bootstrap the rest of the system as needed. If this were the case I would expect RCS systems would need to sometimes do and then undo pointless maneuvers to keep the lines pressurized. I haven\u0027t heard of any such maneuvers and it also seems wasteful.\n\nSo I Googled it, and then Youtubed it. Actually I did that in reverse order.... Anyway, my Googlefoo isn\u0027t good enough apparently, or I found the answer and just don\u0027t see it. (Even after looking at this text for example, I find that it is a lot of dry text for a simple answer that may not be in there: [http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/sts-rcs.html](http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/sts-rcs.html))\n\nThen I figured there is probably someone here who knows. So, why don\u0027t RCS tanks need ullage motors or equivalents of their own?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_Update\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nSo in the same text page I linked I found this: \u0022surface-tension, [propellant](http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/sts_asm.html#srb_mod_propellant) acquisition device\u0022\n\nWhich doesn\u0027t sound like any of my two guesses. I have read more about it from the text but I am having a hard time visualizing the text. It would be nice if there was a video but \u0022surface-tension, [propellant](http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/sts_asm.html#srb_mod_propellant) acquisition device\u0022 and similar doesn\u0027t find it.

The pressurization makes the RCS work regardless of Zero G.\n\nNot generally. Many RCS systems are cold-gas, in which case there is no liquid that requires settling force. But with a liquid monopropellant you need avoid stratified two-phase flow at all costs. One way of doing this is with positive expulsion devices, such as bladders, but more commonly capillary channels are used to wick propellant into a collection sump. These usually go by the acronym PMD, for \u0027propellant management devices\u0027.
