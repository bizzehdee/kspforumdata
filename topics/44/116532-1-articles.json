I\u0027m still not allowing commercial spacecraft, as most did not exist in 2005.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E As you can notice in my post, my objective was not to be 100% serious. Also I was writing at the same time that I was thinking. \n\u003E \n\u003E But now that I did the math, it will need some changes..\n\u003E \n\u003E In fact 3 delta4 heavy will be enoght to put 4 womens in the moon surface with some kind of isru experiments. But they will need some kind of fuel transfer, which is not nice.\n\u003E \n\u003E If I take into account what is the minimun mass for each vehicle, it gives me that each lander will need at least 5 tons, which 3 tons are fuel, and only take off 1 ton leaving all equipment and legs behind 450 isp.\n\u003E \n\u003E The transfer capsule will be 4 tons.. \n\u003E \n\u003E engine \u002B tanks \u002B solar panels, truss \u002B docking ports, etc, 8 tons (does not need much thrust 380 isp). It can have stages so it goes back lighter.\n\u003E \n\u003E If we use 1 delta4 heavy launch to just allow the half of the moon transfer deltav, and then we complete the transfer with an equal booster, then we have 2 extra delta4 heavy launchs to include the transfer vehicle and landers, and we can also increase the landers mass.\n\nOk."},{"CreatedByName":"Kaos","CreatedById":110849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T22:23:53Z","Content":"First of all I have plenty more ideas what to do and all within the given budget. But I tried to keep it simple in here and reduce the number of developements. Furthermore I have calculated some numbers but leave a lot out here for sake of shortness of description.\n\nHere I use only two rockets, that already existed back then.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_orbital_launchers_families](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_orbital_launchers_families)\n\nName LEO TLI Cost\n\nDelta II 6000kg 1508kg 151M$\n\nTitan 21900kg 8600kg 350M$\n\nFurthermore I use only\n\nspace logistic boxes (SLB), an own concept\n\nNautilus-X ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautilus-X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautilus-X) )\n\nMoon Hopper, an own concept\n\nLunar space station (LSS), an own concept\n\nMoon communication satellites (I would not call this a concept)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_NASA)\n\n2014 constant dollars. Take 25% of budget for manned space exploration. Allocate a huge reserve for failed starts or miscalculation of costs or bad numbers in converting $ of different sources, so only 15% of the numbers there: So I have a budget of 3000M$ (Million dollar per year).\n\nI will not include transport of astronauts from earth to ISS or back in my planning, as I take only 25% of the budget and do not change more than 6 Astronauts per year at the ISS.\n\nEach SLB is a cube with a sidelength of 1.5m. On each side are connectors to attach it androgyn to other SLB. SLB mass may not succed 4t. Each SLB has small solar panels on each side for emergency power.\n\nOn each side are connectors at defined possitions for\n\ndata: Some data adapter. In the capability range of USB or Ethernet\n\npower: small: 10A, 12V DC; big: 50A, 500V DC\n\nwater, hydrazine, bipropellant, xenon: with a flow rate of 12g/s (or 1t/day)\n\n(Not every SLB has all connectors)\n\nWhile all SLB are of same size and maximal weight, they can contain different interiors, which helps logistics.\n\nThere are SLB for automatic construction of robot stations out of SLB.\n\nWith the SLB a network of slow transports from LEO to LLO with the help of ion thrusters is realized (resulting in 120M$ for a five year transport from earth ground to LLO) or direct transport to moon with bipropellant (380M$ for a SLB within some days to LLO).\n\nMoon hopper is a transfer vehicle that can go from LLO to the moon surface and back without refueling and leave some payload there.\n\nIt can be equipped with 4 astronauts but has to be tanked at the ground then.\n\nThe lunar space station (LSS) can dock with up to two Nautilus-X and two moon hoppers at the same time. Furthermore it can dock with a gigantic number of SLB, as a SLB does not use up docking ports. In fact they normaly provide more than they use.\n\nCommunication satellites have a mass of 800kg each. Beside communication they can take images. A network of 10 can already provide a good communication on the moon. 6 start within a single Titan.\n\nMy programm:\n\n2006:\n\n1000M$ SLB developement\n\n1000M$ Nautilus-X developement\n\n500M$ Moon hopper developement\n\n500M$ Developement of: communication satellite, ISRU units, modules for LSS, ...\n\n2007:\n\n1000M$ SLB developement\n\n1000M$ Nautilus-X developement\n\n500M$ Moon hopper developement\n\n500M$ Developement of: communication satellite, ISRU units, modules for LSS, ...\n\n2008:\n\n1000M$ multiple SLB starts with fuel\n\n1000M$ Nautilus-X developement\n\n500M$ Moon hopper developement\n\n500M$ Developement of: communication satellite, ISRU units, modules for LSS, ...\n\n2009:\n\n1000M$ multiple SLB starts with fuel\n\n700M$ Nautilus-X developement\n\n500M$ First moon hopper construction\n\n300M$ Developement of: communication satellite, ISRU units, modules for LSS, ...\n\n500M$ Construction of the core module of LSS\n\n2010:\n\n600M$ multiple SLB starts with fuel\n\n1000M$ First Nautilus-X into orbit\n\n200M$ Developement of: communication satellite, ISRU units, modules for LSS, ...\n\n400M$ Send moon hopper to the moon (arrives nearly empty there)\n\n800M$ Construction of the core module of LSS\n\n2011:\n\n100M$ construction of unmanned ISRU test unit for at least water extraction on the moon.

Moon hopper docks back with LSS before Nautilus-X departure.\n\n800M$ start of 6 communication satellites\n\n200M$ Developement of: communication satellite, ISRU units, modules for LSS, ...\n\n2012:\n\n1500M$ multiple SLB starts with fuel\n\n500M$ first moon housing unit. Can be transported as payload in the moon hopper. Enough for 2 People.\n\n1000M$ Nautilus-X flight to the moon, 2 Astronauts. Moon hopper lands the housing unit there. Afterwards astronauts take moon hopper to land there. Construct housing, check water ISRU. Mission time on the moon: 2 weeks, if ISRU is not working, 3 Month if ISRU is working. Flight back to earth then.\n\nFrom then with less detail: Every year one Nautilus-X transfer to the moon and back. Take modules there sometimes. Construct a solid moon base with ISRU capabilities for at least water, fuel, concrete, iron. Expand moon base with stuff from there and from earth. Especially ISRU capabilities. Eventually increase the number of people in the Nautilus-X and per moon hopper. Further milestones:\n\n2014: First greenhouse experiments on the moon\n\n2015: Moon base starts to deliver fuel to LSS. SLB send more tools and stuff and no fuel any more\n\n2016: From now on Nautilus-X is docked round the clock and a second one docks for short periods of time\n\n2017: Permanent moon base with 4 Astronauts. Delivery of second moon hopper.\n\n2018: Different things can be manufactured on the moon by now. From now on the base is expanded by 1 Astronaut per year. This is possible, as the neccessary supply per Astronaut decreases by this.\n\n2019: Fuel production on the moon has increased to a degree that two flights to the moon are possible per year.\n\nNow the moon program budget is decreased to 2000M$ per year and the mars till 2029 program begins. Construction rate of the moon base is keeped and eventually increased by local workforce for this decreased costs."},{"CreatedByName":"ChrisSpace","CreatedById":140622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T09:43:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What rocket is used for LEO Missions?

It can deliver around 30 Mg to Lunar orbit - enough to send Orion on Lunar orbital missions. Eventually begin developement of a lander designed to be inserted onto LLO for rendezvous with Orion. Two launches, rendezvous at Moon for a landing!\n\nGrr actually some modifications due to incompetance:\n\nA detanked \u0022LEO version\u0022 of Orion can actually be launched on Delta IV Medium\u002B (5,4) to Space Station. Which is good because it costs half as much per launch! In the future, DIVH could launch a modified version of Orion - unpiloted and optimized for cargo, like an American ATV.\n\nAlso what I meant to say was how much payload the SDHLLV could deliver to Trans Lunar Injection - Orion and Lander would have to perform their own LOI, but that shouldn\u0027t be a problem!\n\nHonestly this two-launch scenario seems pretty favourable to me, as long as Lander could be made to have an extended life-span dormant while waiting for Orion. It would use storable fuels anyway! Maybe if NASA committed to a piloted Moon landing program it would be worth it to delay EUS, human-rate SLS Block I, and focus developement on a lander?"}]}
