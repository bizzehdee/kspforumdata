On the flip side, if the Mars colonization plans never quite pan out, SpaceX will still need a use for their methalox engines. So either way, we need a Raptor-derived fully-reusable TSTO with payloads roughly equivalent to the Falcon family. It will need to be man-rated, too, since there will surely be a need for sending passengers to orbit in numbers lower than the 100\u002B capacity of the ITS/BFR/BFS system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne problem with this is that a single-engine upper stage has a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E too high to use for propulsive landing, even if it wasn\u0027t overexpanded at sea level.

You need biconic re-entry a la ITS. But if you\u0027re already using auxiliary thrusters and biconic re-entry, you don\u0027t necessarily have to align the aux thrusters with the main engine vector.

Minimum initial \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E for the boostback burn is 2.7:1 with both Raptors at minimum throttle; maximum landing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E on thrusters alone is 3:1 but it can easily hover. I\u0027ve factored in the masses of the thrusters and everything else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe upper stage is where it gets really interesting. Rather than using Raptor engines, which would be way oversized, it uses a pair of the Raptor Development engines (1,000 kN SL thrust) with vacuum nozzle extensions. I\u0027m estimating their mass at 638 kg each. Total stage vacuum thrust is 2,292 kN. Dry mass is 6.6 tonnes and propellant capacity is 141 tonnes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause the vacuum engines cannot be used at sea level, I gave the upper stage eight SL-expanded methalox thrusters in addition to its vacuum-optimized \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters, with a combined SL thrust of 688 kN. But I didn\u0027t want to cluster them around the devRaptors in the tail, both for space considerations and because of damage to the engine bells.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSee the wing extensions shown in the above line drawing? The landing thrusters are placed underneath the wing extensions, pointing down. For re-entry, the upper stage enters biconically, on its belly. It then glides/falls to the landing site before hydraulically-actuated panels open up underneath the wing extensions, both exposing the landing thrusters and providing rear \u0022legs\u0022 for the vehicle to land on, so it lands vertically but in a horizontal attitude, eliminating the risk of tip-over. The landing would look like something out of Star Wars, because it drops, winglets open, and it lands on the wingtips with rocket propulsion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBased on my simulations using this \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.silverbirdastronautics.com/LVperform.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecalculator\u003C/a\u003E, the launch system could deliver up to 6.8 tonnes to GTO with full reuse\u00A0or up to 24 tonnes to LEO with full reuse. For LEO launches, the upper stage can also recover up to 30 tonnes of downmass. This is obviously plenty of margin to have a crewed version, which would use the same tank and body as the rest of the orbiter but have a crew cabin in place of the cargo bay. Payload capacity\u00A0is high enough that the crew cabin could carry at least a dozen crew members plus unpressurized cargo and still have independent \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E and re-entry capability (lifeboat).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKnow what else is great? Due to the vertically-oriented thrusters, the upper stage could both land on and take off from the Moon or from the surface of Mars without needing a launch pad. On Mars, it would need to be refueled on the Martian surface; the lower gravity means that the thrusters have enough thrust to lift it off the ground so the main engines could be fired up. For lunar missions, simply being refueled once in LEO would give it ample \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to fly to the moon, land, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, and return to LEO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-21T21:26:49Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2017 09:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by sevenperforce\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Benjamin Kerman","CreatedById":172792,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-21T21:44:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157695-sevenperforce/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022157695\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157695-sevenperforce/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@sevenperforce\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0that\u0027s pretty intense.

On the flip side, if the Mars colonization plans never quite pan out, SpaceX will still need a use for their methalox engines. So either way, we need a Raptor-derived fully-reusable TSTO with payloads roughly equivalent to the Falcon family. It will need to be man-rated, too, since there will surely be a need for sending passengers to orbit in numbers lower than the 100\u002B capacity of the ITS/BFR/BFS system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne problem with this is that a single-engine upper stage has a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E too high to use for propulsive landing, even if it wasn\u0027t overexpanded at sea level.

Minimum initial \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E for the boostback burn is 2.7:1 with both Raptors at minimum throttle; maximum landing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E on thrusters alone is 3:1 but it can easily hover. I\u0027ve factored in the masses of the thrusters and everything else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe upper stage is where it gets really interesting. Rather than using Raptor engines, which would be way oversized, it uses a pair of the Raptor Development engines (1,000 kN SL thrust) with vacuum nozzle extensions. I\u0027m estimating their mass at 638 kg each. Total stage vacuum thrust is 2,292 kN. Dry mass is 6.6 tonnes and propellant capacity is 141 tonnes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause the vacuum engines cannot be used at sea level, I gave the upper stage eight SL-expanded methalox thrusters in addition to its vacuum-optimized \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters, with a combined SL thrust of 688 kN. But I didn\u0027t want to cluster them around the devRaptors in the tail, both for space considerations and because of damage to the engine bells.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSee the wing extensions shown in the above line drawing? The landing thrusters are placed underneath the wing extensions, pointing down. For re-entry, the upper stage enters biconically, on its belly. It then glides/falls to the landing site before hydraulically-actuated panels open up underneath the wing extensions, both exposing the landing thrusters and providing rear \u0022legs\u0022 for the vehicle to land on, so it lands vertically but in a horizontal attitude, eliminating the risk of tip-over. The landing would look like something out of Star Wars, because it drops, winglets open, and it lands on the wingtips with rocket propulsion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBased on my simulations using this \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.silverbirdastronautics.com/LVperform.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecalculator\u003C/a\u003E, the launch system could deliver up to 6.8 tonnes to GTO with full reuse\u00A0or up to 24 tonnes to LEO with full reuse. For LEO launches, the upper stage can also recover up to 30 tonnes of downmass. This is obviously plenty of margin to have a crewed version, which would use the same tank and body as the rest of the orbiter but have a crew cabin in place of the cargo bay. Payload capacity\u00A0is high enough that the crew cabin could carry at least a dozen crew members plus unpressurized cargo and still have independent \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E and re-entry capability (lifeboat).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKnow what else is great? Due to the vertically-oriented thrusters, the upper stage could both land on and take off from the Moon or from the surface of Mars without needing a launch pad. On Mars, it would need to be refueled on the Martian surface; the lower gravity means that the thrusters have enough thrust to lift it off the ground so the main engines could be fired up. For lunar missions, simply being refueled once in LEO would give it ample \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to fly to the moon, land, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, and return to LEO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like the idea, but stability. It\u0027s the one thing that also irks me about ITS, how the heck do they control the attitude during reentry. The CG/CP positions must be \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E tightly controlled for such a thing (forget forcing things propulsively if you are trying to brake aerodynamically), and you have, at the very least, a cargo bay that might or might not be full. You need something ballast-y on the nose to balance the engines, but you need that to stay put and maintain its weight. Oh, and you need to account for varying fuel levels, or a tank at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E. And last but not least, it would be nice if the thing more or less stays rigid during reentry, which means it is capable of maintaining shape when empty and decelerating laterally at some 3Gs or more. Or with a full payload bay and doing the same, which would be more impressive, if you want downmass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean, if you can work it out without too many structural efficiency sacrifices, yeah, great concept.

It\u0027s the one thing that also irks me about ITS, how the heck do they control the attitude during reentry. The CG/CP positions must be \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E tightly controlled for such a thing (forget forcing things propulsively if you are trying to brake aerodynamically), and you have, at the very least, a cargo bay that might or might not be full. You need something ballast-y on the nose to balance the engines, but you need that to stay put and maintain its weight. Oh, and you need to account for varying fuel levels, or a tank at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E. And last but not least, it would be nice if the thing more or less stays rigid during reentry, which means it is capable of maintaining shape when empty and decelerating laterally at some 3Gs or more. Or with a full payload bay and doing the same, which would be more impressive, if you want downmass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nElon said that the ITS Spaceship and Tanker will both use \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/590wi9/i_am_elon_musk_ask_me_anything_about_becoming_a/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esplit body flaps to control roll and pitch during re-entry\u003C/a\u003E. It will have plenty of yaw authority from its auxiliary thrusters. One nice thing about using a biconic\u00A0re-entry is that you do get substantial body lift, which is \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAOA\u003C/abbr\u003E-dependent. So there\u0027s an element of pitch self-correction in the overall design: if your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E is farther back than it should be and it kicks your nose up, your lift increases, which raises your altitude and decreases your drag, allowing you to pitch back forward. Split flaps are best at giving roll authority, perhaps aided by auxiliary thrusters, so hypersonic attitude control shouldn\u0027t be too difficult to manage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith my design, it might even be possible to actuate the four underside panels differentially to provide the same sort of attitude control. If not, split flaps on the tail would do the job well enough. The overall aerodynamic design would most likely be tuned to passive re-entry with a crewed-version mass distribution, since that\u0027s the one version you are most concerned about re-entering safely. The cargo version would rely more heavily on the split flaps or actuated panels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223031487\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022159536\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221492941197\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002252690\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rune\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, Rune said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean, if you can work it out without too many structural efficiency sacrifices, yeah, great concept.
