If confirmed, the discovery is the first sighting of water clouds beyond our solar system. The clouds shroud a Jupiter-sized object known as a brown dwarf and should yield insight into the nature of cool giant planets orbiting other suns.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClearly discovering clouds in the atmosphere of a brown dwarf isn\u0027t quite as exciting as discovering them in the atmosphere of an Earthlike planet but still pretty cool!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
