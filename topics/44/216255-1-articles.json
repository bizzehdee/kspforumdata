Imagine you had an efficient mass-to-energy conversion that you wanted to use for a drive. Photon drive is a natural choice, but suppose you want to go to a hover over a colony\u0027s landing platform. Well, a 100kN thruster you\u0027d want for a modest shuttle is a 30TW beam. You can cover that landing pad with your best reflective material, and it will still melt like a stick of butter in front of a blow torch. That\u0027s not ideal. And forget about using it in the atmosphere. Air might not burn exactly, but with tens of terawatts of input, even with the tiny absorption you\u0027re likely to get, it\u0027s still going to be a plasma tornado.

For all intents and purposes, that shuttle\u0027s going to hover in the air like it\u0027s on grav plates, with no noise, no dust, no moving parts at all. Just 10 tons of pure thrust pushing against the engines that can be fully concealed within the body of the craft. The cross-section is just that small for weak interactions. Other than the fact that you still need an energy source to fuel all of that somehow, such a drive might as well be reactionless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, all of that said, that\u0027s also precisely why it\u0027s so hard to imagine something like this working. The weakness of interaction is what makes production of neutrinos so difficult. And for something like this, you need to be ridiculously close to 100% efficiency, or you\u0027re just going to die on thermals. You might be able to dissipate, what, a few MW of heat from a landing shuttle without causing problems? So you need to be better than 99.9999% efficient. Something like Mossbauer Effect might give you a recoil into the lattice at the right sort of efficiency. But now we\u0027re trying to invent a Mossbauer neutrino laser (naser?) that also has power in terawatts instead of milliwatts, which is what you usually get with these kinds of techniques even with optical devices?

And this would absolutely work. Get a bunch of baryonic matter that beta-decays - neutrons being probably the most energy-efficient, but something like tritium would be easier to store, shove it in a strong magnetic field, enclose it to prevent any leaks, and it will produce thrust by emitting more neutrinos in one direction than the others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s also going to have an absolutely abysmal efficiency, since only a tiny amount of decay energy is going into neutrino production, and they aren\u0027t emitted in a single line - merely preferentially kicked out more in one direction than the others. Neutron decay releases a few hundred keV of energy, of which a few eV go to neutrinos. So we\u0027re looking at something like 10\u003Csup\u003E-3\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0efficiency here, and then the recoil momentum bias is less than 10% (I don\u0027t recall the exact number, and this will pain me to look up, as this is starting to get a bit obscure, but lets just take 10% as an upper bound). So for every 1N of thrust, you\u0027d be releasing something like 300GW\u002B of power as electron recoil, which in this case is just guaranteed to be heat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich on one hand is really cool. Yeah, 300GW is energy production of a medium sized country, but I can imagine some sort of a huge colony ship producing that much power for various uses, and 1N of thrust will probably be measurable even at that scale. So with the right type of a reactors you can magnetize it and get a little bit of thrust out of it. On the other, I wouldn\u0027t call it practical, because you\u0027re dumping waste heat to space anyways, and if you paint your radiator panels black on only one side, you\u0027ll be literally getting a lot more thrust from asymmetric IR radiation than the neutrino flux.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that\u0027s why I brought up the efficiency in the initial post. To make this kind of propulsion practical over photon drive, it has to be really, really efficient, and I just don\u0027t see a practical way of achieving that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerkyJerkyWreaksHavoc","CreatedById":207646,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-07T16:28:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224269523\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022216255\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221680782895\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002278715\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NFUN\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 4/6/2023 at 8:08 AM, NFUN said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif you stored neutrinos they\u0027re not moving so they\u0027re no better fuel than anything else. ion thrusters take considerably less magic to build and less magic to generate thrust from\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCorrection: Ion engines require no magic to build and no magic to generate thrust from.

You have to be incredibly near 100% efficiency on whatever means of neutrino production you go with to make this practical. Given that, I don\u0027t know if there is any reason to think that 0.5MeV neutrinos are going to be any easier to produce than 0.1eV neutrinos. And if you can dial down the neutrino energy, you can get to the point where it\u0027s non-ionizing. Since they are not entirely massless (theoretically, but well-established), you do expect a roll-off, but our upper bound on mass is below 0.13eV, so even with room-temperature neutrinos (a little under 0.03eV), you\u0027ll still have at least about a third of maximum thrust.

Want to send a message through to the other side of the planet? No problem! Use a a neutrino radio and so long someone on the other side of the planet has a neutrino receiver and you aimed right you\u0027re golden.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is one of those things that appear to make sense until you connect the dots.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, neutrinos are generated by radioactive decay. Good luck creating a modulated signal from that process. I guess you could have some type of nuclear reaction run full blast at all time, and just flicker the shielding like one of those old naval Morse code signal lamps, but that seems kind of difficult to do at a rate that would give the signal any reasonable bandwidth. After all, it\u0027d be a shield that stops\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eneutrinos\u003C/em\u003E, it sounds like you need approximately all the power you can get, which leaves little room for finesse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut more importantly, there\u0027s the matter of the neutrino receiver. You have already noted that you can put a planet in the way of the neutrino beam, and the two won\u0027t interact at all. That makes it tricky to create an antenna. A hundred trillion neutrinos pass through a volume the size of a human body every second, but it takes years between each time one of them interacts with an atom. Just to observe this phenomenon, you need to fill a giant volume with a clear liquid, line its walls with detectors, and wait. The \u003Ca href=\u0022https://icecube.wisc.edu/about-us/facts/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EIce Cube detector\u003C/a\u003E is a cubic kilometer in size, and detects about 275 neutrinos per day - out of approximately a trillion trillions that pass through it\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eevery second\u003C/em\u003E. That\u0027s not a very good rate of interception.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat also implies that if you ever were to build a receiver that detects neutrinos at an appreciable rate to facilitate communication, any signals would completely drown in the deluge of solar neutrinos that would ping the receiver constantly. Imagine the Niagara falls with ping-pong balls instead of water. Then you try to communicate with a friend downstream by taking a few more ping-pong balls, writing a single letter on each, and throwing them in one by one. He\u0027d have a vastly better chance of picking up your communicated message than a neutrino receiver would have to collect the intended signal among all the solar neutrinos out there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
