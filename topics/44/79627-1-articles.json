Also, when travelling at extreme speeds (i.e - light speed), time slows down. This could be seen as lag. Lag found in computers.

Not even remotely. Not only can we not simulate things with perfect fidelity, a hard requirement for this to be true (we could detect errors, and have been looking for decades), the computers aren\u0027t close to powerful enough to simulate anything of any real size. Moore\u0027s Law isn\u0027t magic, nor is it really a law. There are practical limits to what you can do with any technology, and we\u0027re getting damn close to the end of the road for silicon computer chips. Most industry experts, including Moore himself, are astonished it\u0027s held up as long as it has. It\u0027s very likely we\u0027ll see the end of Moore\u0027s Law at 5nm, which Intel projects will hit the consumer space in 2020. After that, we\u0027ll need something new. Graphene is promising, but expecting consumer products in time to pick up the slack from Si in another ten years, when not one graphene product is yet on the market, is a techno-polyannaism. The hard truth is that in the very near future, computers are going to stop advancing as quickly as they have in the past.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut forget about the future, what about today? Just how far off are we from doing something like this? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s think for a moment about how to store the data to represent the state of the universe. Let\u0027s say that we\u0027ve got some compression algorithm that\u0027s so good it\u0027s mathematically impossible, storing all information about an atom with a single byte, with no overhead to read or write. Position, momentum, spin, charge, temperature, quantum states, chemical bonds, vibration, all in one byte. Further, we\u0027ll say there\u0027s nothing in the universe but atoms (laughably false, 96% of the universe isn\u0027t even matter, and atoms themselves are quite complex arrangements of even smaller particles, which are themselves made up of even smaller particles). So, for every atom that exists in the universe you want to simulate, you need exactly one byte of storage. I\u0027d use bits instead of bytes to be even more generous, but I don\u0027t want to deal with the factor of 8. I\u0027m going to write out each number the long way so the sheer size sinks in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so how much storage is that? Well, as it happens there are around this many atoms in the universe (10^80)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the largest hard drives store around this many bytes (4 * 10^12)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4,000,000,000,000\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, just to store the data for the simulation, you need this many of the largest hard drives in the world (10^80 / (4 * 10^12) == 2.5 * 10^67):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E25,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat number is too big for human minds to comprehend. Literally, it\u0027s meaningless to us. Even a number like a million is too much for us, but that\u0027s a \u003Cstrong\u003Etrillion trillion trillion trillion trillion million\u003C/strong\u003E. So let\u0027s say we can build these hard drives for free, and they weigh a nanogram. Just how much is that? Unsurprisingly, a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10^67 hard drives at 0.000000001 grams each has a mass equal to this many Suns ((2.5 * 10^67 / (10^15)) / (1.98 * 10^30) == 1.25 * 10^22):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12,500,000,000,000,000,000,000\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a billion times more massive than the most massive thing ever observed, \u003Cem\u003Ewhich is a whole galaxy\u003C/em\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APM_08279%2B5255\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAPM 08279\u002B5255.\u003C/a\u003E So just to store the data needed in this impossibly easy scenario stacked in your favor by a factor of more than a billion, you\u0027d need billions of galaxies worth of hard drives. And what about the rest of the computer? How do you stop this thing from collapsing into a black hole? Just storing the state of your simulation will take up a much of the mass of the universe. We haven\u0027t even begun to talk about execution resources, how to power the thing, how to cool it, how to deal with the second law of thermodynamics in such an enormous, well ordered machine, how to deal with errors in the simulation, how to deal with the inevitable star crashing through your computer the size of a billion galaxies, how to deal with the propagation delay on a computer whose traces measure in the gigaparsecs, etc. etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut all this was stacked in your favor. In a real scenario, you could never simulate a universe as large or complex as your own, because doing so would require more matter than there is. The lower bound on how much matter you\u0027d need to store the state of the universe is actually the universe itself. At best, you could use each particle to represent itself, and run the simulation using the laws of the universe already in place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to put it mildly, it\u0027s ludicrous to say we\u0027re anywhere close to being able to do this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere are other reasons too, some of which scientists haven\u0027t thought about.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s very arrogant, don\u0027t you think?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOne thing is that, when close to matter, time slows down. Also, when travelling at extreme speeds (i.e - light speed), time slows down. This could be seen as lag. Lag found in computers. It\u0027s slowed because of the computer we live in is processing every atom in a given space and is calculating where it should be at a certain speed\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy do you think determining the position of an object moving in a straight line is so hard? Simulating relativistic motion is only difficult \u003Cem\u003Ebecause of\u003C/em\u003E the effects of relativity. It\u0027s a trivial matter to analyze Newtonian motion. And your simulation has to be perfectly accurate anyway, so it shouldn\u0027t matter how fast things are going. If there\u0027s a \u0022time step\u0022 to the universe, it\u0027s the Planck time. Which, for the record, is the amount of time it takes to move one Planck length at the speed of light. The Planck length is the distance between which it\u0027s not possible to measure a difference in position between two points. So there\u0027s no need to slow things down that are moving quickly, because even if they\u0027re at the maximum possible speed, they won\u0027t produce an error in measurement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut anyway, wouldn\u0027t it make a lot more sense for the folding or proteins, complex gravitational interactions (n-body problem, black holes are easy because they\u0027re singularities) or the motion of an object through a fluid to cause time to slow down? They\u0027re far, far harder to simulate. But wouldn\u0027t that slow down the whole universe if it were so hard, not just the offending participant? And this doesn\u0027t even match up with what lag is, because lag is a delay between initiating an action and it happening, not the slowing down of events. Lag is also not caused by processing load, but \u003Cem\u003Elatency\u003C/em\u003E. This is commonly confused, and is a huge pet peeve of mine. Doubly so when somebody uses the nonsensical qualification \u0022frame lag.\u0022 There is no latency, just a reduction in frequency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis metaphor is tortured, and makes no sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso, pixels.

Why doesn\u0027t it turn into different particles, or stay there forever?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally, all of the forces you\u0027ve been talking about have been the same one, electromagnetism, and it needs no invented \u0022energon\u0022 because its force carrier is the photon and science already has a good idea how all this works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing pixels as a metaphor is even more tortured than the last one. Pixels are a method of displaying something, what does it have to do with the forces that drive the universe? I seriously can\u0027t follow your logic. You hypothesize a new fundamental particle with no reason, then abruptly declare them to be the same as pixels for again no reason.

A pixel is an abstract concept related to the particular way in which we tend to display images to the end user using an imprecise grid of finite points and mapping continuous space onto it. There are formats that use continuous curves, have no resolution and can be scaled infinitely with no loss of quality (vector graphics). Pixels are no more fundamental to computer science than printers are. It\u0027s just a way to visually represent the underlying data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t want to sound rude, but it\u0027s clear you have very little knowledge of physics or computers.

Because each universe simulation must be less complex than the last, you have an exponential decay of the complexity of nested universes. No matter how complex the first universe is, somebody has to build it out of some amount of material they spend a finite amount of time collecting. Even if the first universe is infinite, the computer they build must be finite. Even if you were able to gather up all the matter and energy in your universe and were able to simulate a universe 99% as complex as your own, in only 1000 generations of universes, you have 0.004% of the complexity left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can use some basic algebra to determine how many nest levels you can go with a given starting complexity and efficiency.

The first universe must build a computer of finite complexity and power because it must be built in a finite amount of time, and thus have a finite number of nested universes it can sustain.

Simulations incur overhead, because you must always do more work than a computer purpose built for the task.

Specifically, it means it\u0027s not possible to produce a lossless compression algorithm that can operate on arbitrary data and also guarantee any factor of compression, no matter how small. There will be some sets of data for which the algorithm is unable to produce any compression at all.

Doubly so when you consider that it\u0027s objectively unreasonable to expect any universe to be converted in any appreciable fraction to any one thing (especially if the second law of thermodynamics holds, which precludes perfect, unchanging megastructures), much less a giant computer that never makes mistakes or suffers damage.

And that\u0027s still being hopelessly generous to you. 0.01% (still generous) gets you 25 generations. Multiply the complexity of your universe by a thousand and you get...26.

Or a threadlock because people kept at it.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst: One of the big complaints about all this is the massive power requirements it would take an above system to run our universe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComputer scientists who believe the simulation theory have been working on ideas for quite a while on how to go against this argument and one of the most compelling ones is that generally speaking you really don\u0027t NEED to simulate the universe as a whole down to the subatomic level. You only need to simulate in depth that which is experienced. Anything else can be done in a simpler way. Radiation for example, something used as an inherantly random thing with predictable curves (you can guess how radioactive a given block of material will be over time, but not accurately predict where any given particle of radiation will fly). For the purposes of modeling the radiation field you start by taking the \u0022radiation value\u0022 of that brick of material, just a measure of how strong it is, and calculate a fading sphere (the whole inverse square law with the distance) centered on the brick. Now put in the surrounding objects (walls, floor, etc) and then take their densities and volumes, calculate appropriate \u0027shadows\u0027 for the blockage. You have a crude simulation of the radiation now (of course you can somewhat trivially make this better, but lets just continue from here). Toss a person inside, you can easily calculate how much radiation their body is absorbing and roughly \u0027where\u0027 based on their position and orientation inside the field. Assign a random probability that they will get cancer, another to what kind (weighted probabilities here), and to where (weighted by individual body part exposure). Your number comes up, bam! Cancer. But since there is no detector that cares about which particle hit what cells DNA, they don\u0027t bother modeling it. However, if for some reason we built a sensor that can be used to determine exactly this information, then the instant the \u0027sense!\u0027 button is pushed, the universe pauses and calculates down to the atom which cell was hit, how it was effected, etc, and propagates it through, so that when the sensor looks, it sees exactly what is expected as if the calculation had always been done in the first place. Why not always calculate this? Because not everybody is going to get this test done, so why waste the computations on it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, you can reduce the calculations you need to run about the universe down to simple rules (macro object collisions like video games do instead of modeling out every atom in your foot touching every atom in the floor), and you only go hyper-detailed when something in the universe would otherwise check or care (IE: When a person looks.). But you only need to do Just In Time calculations, because you can just pause the universe if you need in order to make sure a given calculation was done \u0027as though it had always been done\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink of it this way. We have a video game called The Sims. Look how similar that is to the real world. People (in general) don\u0027t suddenly fall through the floor, fire spreads, objects can break, etc. And we certainly don\u0027t model out the atoms within. Now, if there was a capacity for the Sims to reason and to arbitrarily inspect objects and things super closely, they would quickly figure out something wasn\u0027t necessarily right unless we provided them the data they would expect to see. But a desktop computer can run this \u0027simulation\u0027, now if we tried to up that simulation to go atomic scale, we don\u0027t have a computer powerful enough on the planet to do that in anything approaching real time from our perspective (though of course to the sims everything is real time).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo as far as the inhabitants of the simulation are concerned, their simulation is a perfect recreation of the over-world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve read articles that declare that taking this thinking into account certainly brings the calculations required for a universe simulation down from impossible to simply astoundingly large, yet possible within a couple hundred years if not sooner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond) There are plenty of real scientists that take this idea very seriously and are attempting to provide experiments to help prove it. One example is a scientist who is trying to make ever faster atomic clocks under the assumption that we will eventually make a clock that operates faster than the refresh rate of the universe. The result would be a clock that SHOULD operate at X ticks/second but it does not actually (for unknown and undescernable reasons) have that precision. Another example is that astronomers assume the universe would be divided into \u0022chunks\u0022 much the way Minecraft does (Minecraft worlds CAN be infinite, but to do this, only the area that the player occupies and the surrounding 8 areas are actually loaded into memory). As a result, it is predicted that certain super small/lightweight particles or even light would be able to show this chunking effect due to super small position errors that accumulate as they pass through millions of chunks. Both of these scientists receive a great deal of funding for their work, primarily because regardless of their attempts at the universe sim system, their research is valuable in many ways (faster clocks, better GPS.

Lets say that FTL is impossible, just flat out is, period. We could run a simulation of the universe that provides its inhabitants a method for moving FTL. We do this because we are curious how a species with this ability would actually develop. Now we make the universe as accurate as we can, and to the limitations that I mentioned above in point one, we do. But the important point is that we now have additional complexity to the universe and a logical reason for it to be added. So really the argument that every universe down the chain quickly becomes useless through lack of complexity is a bit silly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LaytheAerospace","CreatedById":108355,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-31T01:24:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mazon Del\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mazon Del\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EComputer scientists who believe the simulation theory have been working on ideas for quite a while on how to go against this argument and one of the most compelling ones is that generally speaking you really don\u0027t NEED to simulate the universe as a whole down to the subatomic level.

Anything else can be done in a simpler way.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want life to arise and evolve, you need to simulate the entire space of the universe at a pretty low level. If you abstract away the lowest levels to approximations, you lose the value of the simulation. It seems likely that if this is the case, that our universe is a simulation fudging the numbers at the lowest level to make computation possible, then that level is probably the Planck units. This has the unfortunate consequence of meaning we could never measure an error if we were, in fact, in a simulated universe. I\u0027m very surprised you haven\u0027t taken the position that these Planck units can be seen as an expression of more limited physics imposed by the simulation. Within the framework of simulated reality, it\u0027s a valid interpretation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHowever, if for some reason we built a sensor that can be used to determine exactly this information, then the instant the \u0027sense!\u0027 button is pushed, the universe pauses and calculates down to the atom which cell was hit, how it was effected, etc, and propagates it through, so that when the sensor looks, it sees exactly what is expected as if the calculation had always been done in the first place.

How do you determine if an event will be detected? What is a detector, really? Is a scientist a detector if he\u0027s daydreaming and won\u0027t remember the observation? Do we only run a high resolution simulation in areas intelligent beings are currently looking? Can inanimate objects be detectors? You can\u0027t have life evolve otherwise, so I suppose they must be. So why isn\u0027t every particle in the universe considered a detector? What about effects of single particles that can be checked later? Like, say, a high precision camera dealing with dark counts on its CCD? Single particles must interact with it as single particles should, because it produces an immediate effect, but then again so does every interaction in the universe. So do we just wait until the result of that interaction would matter to calculate the result? Does it only matter if something intelligent would notice?

Doesn\u0027t the simulation need to maintain consistency regardless of whether or not sentient beings inside it notice? Abstracting the details away in order to simplify the simulation will inevitably cause errors, and the more you abstract away, the easier they\u0027d be to detect. The details matter regardless of whether or not an intelligent being is watching at that moment. It seems a bit arrogant to think the universe takes special notice of life and that things don\u0027t matter until we look at them, and they only matter as much as we care to investigate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThink of it this way.

Now, if there was a capacity for the Sims to reason and to arbitrarily inspect objects and things super closely, they would quickly figure out something wasn\u0027t necessarily right unless we provided them the data they would expect to see. But a desktop computer can run this \u0027simulation\u0027, now if we tried to up that simulation to go atomic scale, we don\u0027t have a computer powerful enough on the planet to do that in anything approaching real time from our perspective (though of course to the sims everything is real time).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you may be badly understimating the problem of complexity.

There\u0027s a serious problem with intellectual honesty there. Without any more information, I\u0027m going to guess that the articles abused Moore\u0027s Law, which I mentioned in my first post is expected to not hold very much longer. Using Moore\u0027s Law to predict the state of computing more than a decade or two out (and even that\u0027s a stretch) is a mistake.

In fact, I\u0027ve gone to great pains to speak generally in terms of overall complexity. Overall complexity is monotonically decreasing, which precludes an infinite chain of simulated universes.

Change the physics of your nested universe all you like, the capabilities of the simulation are still bounded by the laws of the universe which runs the simulation, not the universe being simulated. The easiest way to visualize this is simulating our own universe, but with less stuff in it. You can simulate a totally different universe, of course, trading complexity from one place to the other, but you can\u0027t change the overall budget. Otherwise you can just simulate a universe with different rules that then simulates a computer better than your starting computer, an obvious impossibility. Each universe is more restrictive than the last, even if individual areas are relaxed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother way to put it is that the overhead increases with each successive generation. The universe running the simulation must host the computer, which incurs overhead (not all of the universe can be the computer, at the absolute least you\u0027d want somebody alive to see the result at the end), and the computer must perform the simulation, which also has overhead. You\u0027ll never reclaim that overhead in nested universes, for obvious reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
