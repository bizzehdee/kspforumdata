reliable now than they were then.\u00A0 Back then, it was all about the space race and beating the other superpower, and the astronauts/cosmonauts were mostly current or ex-military, and they were willing to tolerate levels of risk that would be absolutely insane by today\u0027s standards.\u00A0 Taking a spaceship that\u0027s, say, 95% safe and making it 99.5% safe may not seem very

astronauts died on the launchpad in a training accident.\u00A0 It was a terrible tragedy.\u00A0 However, as awful as it may sound to say this... in retrospect it may actually be fortunate that it happened.\u00A0 Because it happened \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eon the pad\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E while the craft was right there in front of all the NASA engineers, and they could see what happened, and they could figure out what the problem was afterwards, and then fix it so it wouldn\u0027t happen again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the aftermath of the tragedy, NASA went over the entire spacecraft design with a fine-toothed comb, looking not just to fix the specific problem that killed the three crewmembers of Apollo 1, but any other potentially fatal design flaws.\u00A0 It wasn\u0027t fast and it wasn\u0027t fun.\u00A0 It delayed the rest of the Apollo program by nearly two years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd you know what problems they found?\u00A0 \u003Ca

original Apollo capsule design had been an accident waiting to happen, and nobody realized it until somebody died.\u00A0 Sooner or later it was going to kill someone... and if it had happened
