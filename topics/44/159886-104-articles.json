Of course investing in such infrastructure would change this dynamic, but considering that Mars missions are likely to be flags and footprints and occur at intervals of years... well it\u0027s not worth it for Mars. Maybe for the Moon, but again with a launch cadence of 1 every 2 years, or even 1 every year, you\u0027re not getting enough use to really justify the kind of deep space infrastructure we would need to really make in-depth lunar exploration practical. And of course you\u0027re not getting nearly enough launches to even build the infrastructure in the first place... though building it in LEO and sending it to deep space with an electric propulsion bus could work.

If ULA can launch Vulcan-Centaur Heavy at a similar cadence to Atlas V that\u0027s 314 tonnes of potential payload (minus some margin for other extraneous stuff) in LEO, though most of that capability will likely go towards GTO/GEO launches. If New Glenn can keep up with Falcon 9 at 21 launches per year then that\u0027s potentially 945 tonnes per year. Falcon 9 could provide another 400 tonnes or so. Atlas V and Delta IV could add another few hundred tonnes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-04-04T17:36:07Z\u0022 title=\u002204/04/2019 05:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EApril 4, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Silavite\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ENinja\u0026#039;d!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-04T18:10:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan anyone with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u002B\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E do a mockup and a couple of\u00A0screenshots of Dragon 2, still attached to a Falcon 9 upper stage, mating with Orion and its service module in elliptic orbit?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-04T18:12:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223575887\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022159886\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221554388297\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022103726\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ZooNamedGames\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, ZooNamedGames said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u2019s still more productive than waiting for two companies to make a SHLV as they could stop or end up going bankrupt and then we go an additional 10\u002B years without a launch capability.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt ain\u2019t ok\u201D, then do something.

This reminds me of Shuttle. When first discussed, NASA said Shuttle would break even vs expendable LVs if they could fly at least 28 times a year. Their upper limit of flights was 55/yr, in which case the Shuttle looked really rosy as a vehicle. They only fell short of their lowball launch estimate by around 10X. Even at 2X/year, the cost (including program costs) per launch of SLS are so excessive, that the payloads need to be similarly valuable. No one is going to launch a 250 million probe for 3 billion $ launch cost. The payload is supposed to cost MORE than the rocket. There are no 10 billion dollar payloads, and no money to buy them if there were.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll per-launch costs are theoretical at this point, and there a tons of different methodologies to measure them. Do you just measure the marginal cost of the parts and labor that goes into a single launch? Or do you divide the total costs of keeping\u00A0all the supporting infrastructure and staff operational per-year among the number of launches you plan? Or even more radically, do you do all that and include in R\u0026amp;D costs? Each one of these metrics has their uses, no doubt, but they\u0027re not comparable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNASA, for example, thinks the SLS will cost $500M per-launch.

Do you just measure the marginal cost of the parts and labor that goes into a single launch? Or do you divide the total costs of keeping\u00A0all the supporting infrastructure and staff operational per-year among the number of launches you plan? Or even more radically, do you do all that and include in R\u0026amp;D costs? Each one of these metrics has their uses, no doubt, but they\u0027re not comparable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNASA, for example, thinks the SLS will cost $500M per-launch. I am skeptical of this number - even just as a \u0022per-hardware\u0022 measure - for the early missions. Though I do think costs will likely go down with later launches, I cannot say if they will ever reach that point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I am\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ealso\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0skeptical of the $1B\u002B estimates I see thrown around often, because the Saturn V was a $1.2B rocket, and I struggle to see any metric (aside from maybe non-inflation-adjusted spending) that the S-V\u00A0\u003Cu\u003Ewouldn\u0027t\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0be more expensive than the SLS on a per-launch basis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I have no idea where you\u0027re getting that $3B figure, unless you\u0027re rolling the entire program\u0027s costs into one figure and dividing it by launch, at which point neither Apollo or the STS program\u00A0are going to look very good either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA test article flew.

Pad 39B is going to be empty 90% of the time. Literally the only \u0027pure infrastructure\u0027 thing I can think of that would bottleneck the process is the lack of converted high-bays in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, which can be fairly easily remedied considering that there\u0027s three currently sitting empty. Maybe you\u0027d also want another super-crawler? I don\u0027t think you\u0027d need one, though. One crawler could easily take care of two flights per-year.

The super-low prices SpaceX\u00A0quotes are only possible with an incredibly frequent\u00A0launch cadence, and to\u00A0meet those you\u0027d need to increase the total amount of\u00A0launches per-year by at least an order of magnitude.

There was significant political pressure to make the Saturn V\u00A0succeed and make it succeed fast, where there is no such urgent, pressing drive for SLS. The S-V\u00A0used relatively simple gas generator engines (F-1, J-2) rather than the insanely complicated RS-25 engine. Its operational tempo was much higher than SLS, and shared an entire stage with the Saturn 1B. The military-industrial complex was not quite as entrenched, and not quite so practiced in sucking every possible drop of money out of cost-plus contracts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) It\u0027s not like the Shuttle was a roaring success of cost-effective launch either. The best thing that can be said about it is that it was an\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eattempt\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to push down the cost of space access, whereas no such claim can be made about SLS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Redundant assembly lines\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0infrastructure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) Even though that post of mine you quoted had\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enothing\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to do with Starship/Superheavy, it\u0027s still nonsensical. There is a very clear business case for it: rapid and total reusability. It might not work. Its operational costs are almost certainly going to be higher than what Musk predicts. But: even if Starship/Superheavy costs 10x more than claimed, it\u0027s still cheaper than F9, Atlas V, etc, while clearly having far more capability. SpaceX doesn\u0027t even need to come close to Musk\u0027s estimates to obsolete anything currently out there save the cheapest light LVs (\u003Cem\u003Ee.g.\u003C/em\u003E Electron).
