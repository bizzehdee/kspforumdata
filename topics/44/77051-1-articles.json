I have had a life long fascination with the stars and space and what the future may bring for humanity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Now it seems that in the last few years the debate for Active SETI has started to revive somewhat, and it poses some interesting questions. For those of you who arent aware of what it is, Passive SETI aka what we do now, involves just listening to signals that could indicate techonology or activity of another civilization, but thats it, LISTENING.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActive SETI involves sending focused carrier signals encoded with information or patterns, at high energys toward particular star systems/exo planets. This has become more on topic again since the amount of confirmed exo planets is rising, making the possibilty for life to exist as we know it, more likley.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe part of the debate im talking about is what is in humanity\u0027s best interests, should we just listen, wait and watch, or start announcing our presence. Now, any decision would require the consensus of humanity in priniciple, but how that would be acheieved is not what im trying to get at in this post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is - Who is For, Against, couldnt care for Active SETI to resume?

We are the masters of this world. We have thousands of years of experience in warfare on this planet. While the various SciFi movies are amusing they do not resemble reality. Aliens would be limited to the laws of physics like we are. And the fight would be on our territory which we know best. Also i highly doubt that if there is ET out there any of them will have the resources to start an invasion on a planet that is that far away. Even if they had it would be an requirement for them to have FTL technology (if it is even possible to have). I guess by the time an planet reaches that tech level, war would not matter anymore for them. In any way we don\u0027t have to fear anything. The worst but most unlikely case that could happen is that we get exterminated. I would call that just when i recall what humankind already destroyed on this planet. The more probable scenario would be that ET gets his butt kicked.

I believe it depends on the civilization. Perhaps the civilization has regressed on weaponry but excels at space travel, or has regressed in some other area that we have not (And so we take advantage). However, even sub a alien invasion will meet with heavy losses from the worlds military and total mobilization of a wartime industry. Aliens may come here in interest of observing a species advancing from a electronic to a interstellar era, or may come to Earth to uplift/subjugate us, or may simply just prefer to respect our wishes and keep their activities to the Outer Solar system and a good distance away from our probes rather than risk more resources by waging a war.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d personally doubt they\u0027d do anything but longer for a while around our gas giants, refueling and collecting resources before leaving.

There\u0027s a theory which postulates that the dominant species on any planet is necessarily also the most aggressive; after all, you first have to not only survive, but thrive, before you can build up a dominating infrastructure. But to reach that point also requires an incredible amount of collaboration which, hopefully, eventually breeds out the aggression.
