To briefly recap: It\u0027s really hot, it\u0027s got an absurdly thick atmosphere, it rains sulfuric acid in the upper atmosphere and \u0022snows\u0022 metal on the surface, etc., etc., etc. In addition, the atmosphere would quickly thicken, subjecting any paratrooper to enormous G-loads and temperatures of thousands of degrees. You would probably die long before you reached the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Mars, the atmosphere is far too thin to rely solely on parachutes to reach the surface. If you were to pull a conventional human-rated Earth parachute in the lower layers of the atmosphere, you would hit the ground at over two hundred miles per hour. If you had some sort of retro-rocket belt, then the scheme could work... although with all of the variables involved in landing on a planet, it likely wouldn\u0027t. A human can only carry so much fuel and guidance sensors around his or her waist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Titan, the atmosphere would be rather thick, enough to allow a parachute. However, entering the atmosphere would provide massive G-loads and high temperatures, both of which would make it quite difficult to survive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind, the fastest that any human being has ever been while travelling in free-fall is a \u0022paltry\u0022 800-ish miles per hour. The slowest possible entry speed from orbit would be almost ten times that fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words: it\u0027s possible, but highly unsafe and highly unlikely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[EDIT: Ninja\u0027d and Ninja\u0027d and Ninja\u0027d.

With single-lander missions, you have to be careful not to damage the engine on landing or you might never be able to go home, but with separate vehicles, you\u0027ll know before you even launch the humans whether or not the uncrewed ascent vehicle landed safely. If it made it, you\u0027re good to go; if it didn\u0027t, nobody was relying on it to get home because they haven\u0027t even left Earth yet. That also opens up some nice ISRU possibilities - the lander could make methane/LOX fuel from stored hydrogen (or found water ice) and CO2 from Mars\u0027s atmosphere while it waits, for instance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for parachuting to the ground, it\u0027s technically possible (albeit \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E kerbal), but for reasons of safety and also being able to carry a lot of scientific equipment down too, it\u0027s probably better to land a full habitat with just enough fuel for touchdown.
