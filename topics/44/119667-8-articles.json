This is a hard law of thermodynamics and there is no way around it, save by avoiding using a heat engine altogether (fuel cells, for example, can achieve higher efficiencies).\u003Cp\u003EYou might be thinking of the \u003Cem\u003Epropulsive\u003C/em\u003E efficiency of a rocket engine, which is not the same as the thermal efficiency. Propulsive efficiency can, in theory, approach 100%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022efficiency\u0022 you see quoted for turbopumps isn\u0027t for their ability to convert heat in the exhaust into mechanical work. It is what is known as the \u003Cem\u003E\u0022isentropic efficiency\u0022\u003C/em\u003E, which is how they perform their pressurisation process compared to a thermodynamically ideal model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a nuclear reactor operating at, say, 1500K (which is \u003Cem\u003Eextremely\u003C/em\u003E high, and will require a very high flow rate of coolant, which costs mass), you can easily calculate the Carnot efficiency of the power conversion cycle for a range of heat sink temperatures. For a heat sink of 500K, the Carnot efficiency is 67%. For a heat sink of 300K, the Carnot efficiency is 80%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the Carnot efficiency isn\u0027t a limit you can ever actually reach, only approach. And the closer to the Carnot efficiency you get, the more cumbersome and heavy your equipment becomes. The best that is usually achieved in practice is with a combined cycle gas turbine, which uses a gas turbine running on the Brayton cycle, with a bottoming Rankine cycle powered by the Brayton cycle\u0027s exhaust. These achieve thermal efficiencies of about 50% from a 1400K heat source, or in other words, about 60% of the Carnot efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The \u0022turbine efficiency\u0022 I mentioned about the SSME turbopumps is indeed the isentropic efficiency.

You can indeed get far higher thermal efficiencies by exhausting through a high-expansion nozzle into vacuum (this cools the exhaust down big-time, and increases the Carnot efficiency). However, this still isn\u0027t practical for power generation, as in a power generation cycle, you don\u0027t throw away your working fluid, you recirculate it. If you expand it to extremely low pressures and temperatures, you have no way of getting rid of the heat and making the working fluid ready to be recirculated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Rankine Cycle is the most commonly used thermal cycles. The others are broadly similar. It consists of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Pumping liquid to high pressure -\u0026gt; Boiling the high-pressure liquid using a heat source -\u0026gt; Expanding the resulting high pressure vapour to produce power -\u0026gt; Condensing the resulting cool, low pressure vapour to a liquid, ready for the pump again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want a closed-loop system (and you do, because otherwise you might as well just use a rocket engine and skip the extra step of generating electricity), you need that condensation/heat rejection stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you expand your working fluid to near a vacuum, it\u0027s going to be cold. Very cold. The radiators needed to shift the necessary megawatts of heat from such a cold working fluid stream are going to be ridiculously large and heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy concerns over the lifetime of the reactor aren\u0027t really fuel-based, they\u0027re more around the survivability of the components. It\u0027s pretty trivial to make nuclear fuel that will undergo fission for an extended period, and even have high burnup. What is harder is making heat exchangers, pressure vessels, expanders, etc. that will operate at high temperature for extended periods of time without problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason the burn time on the NTR you linked is so low is because, after that time, the nozzle will be soft, the moderator cracking, the turbopumps nearing the end of their fatigue life, the heat exchanger tubes beginning to warp. It\u0027s not because the nuclear fuel is no longer able to undergo fission. Making things that perform at high temperature for extended periods of time is very difficult, which is why earthbound power plants operate at only a few hundred degrees. It would be easy to get over 2,000 degrees out of a fossil fuel plant, but harnessing that temperature is very difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kibble","CreatedById":131042,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T16:42:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022More Boosters\u0022 data-cite=\u0022More Boosters\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe title, \u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/132918-39-days-to-Mars-possible-now-with-nuclear-powered-VASIMR/page18\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E39 days to Mars possible now with nuclear-powered VASIMR.\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#3E3E3E;\u0022\u003E\u0022 is highly misleading as there\u0027s no clear cut demonstration that it actually is possible.
