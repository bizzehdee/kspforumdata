You can make one launcher more flexible by giving it side boosters to adjust the thrust for each mission. Or you can choose other strategies that accomplish the same goal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pros of the side boosters are that the main booster (sustainer) does not have to have as much thrust, and therefore can be lighter and cheaper.
