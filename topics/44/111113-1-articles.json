I was going outside because I wanted to observe Saturn and it was at opposition which meant it was close and bright, so I could easily find with my telescope. Suddenly I saw a very fast red light fly across the sky. I knew it was no plane, I never saw airplane fly so fast that this red light flew at. I then saw a white light fly by and then vanish in the middle of air. I saw some more white lights. I tried to communicate by turning my flashlight on and off\u0022\n\nI can see that some people might be skeptical to the belief that alien life is visiting or even have UFOs flying around in our Solar System. I\u0027m not saying for sure it was alien. All I\u0027m saying it was a UFO (Unidentified flying object). Doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s alien or human. It\u0027s just not known what it was.\n\nHowever, I can assure everyone that infact it was not a airplane. What makes me so sure? Due to the fact it was ***flying upwards*** and ***flying at incredibly fast speeds*** that I\u0027ve only seen ***very few*** aircraft do and ***they were not capable of VTOL.***\n\nI only seen lights, no identification of what model of aircraft it was. However, it did flicker it\u0027s lights and appear to \u0022dance\u0022 with it\u0027s white light on. Whatever it was, it was ***attempting to communicate.***\n\nFurther more, I\u0027d like to bring to the board a thread about UFOs. Also, I\u0027d like to ask other Amateur astronomers or anyone really that stargazes to present their stories about what they may of have seen. Also, I am open to questions and skeptics regarding my encounter.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T09:06:10Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 09:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Bar27262**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T08:01:45Z","Content":"If it was night and all you saw was a light, it\u0027s extremely difficult to estimate distance and altitude, which also means that extrapolating speed and vertical direction is pretty much impossible.\n\nBTW, where do you live?

Until very clear cues appears.\n\nApprox. 6:30 pm local time last Saturday (23/05), we watched planets and the waxing crescent Moon using a small telescope at the west sky. I point at stars instead, trying to revive my own memories of their names (and trying to tell where\u0027s true north / south, nobody took a compass). Then I saw Arcturus, alone. A few minutes later, someone asked me about a star near Arcturus, I believed it was Nekkar (\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B2 Bootis) - the position somewhat fits for Bootes\u0027 legs, and as Nekkar is quite dim I expect I haven\u0027t adaptated for the sky. Then, ten minutes later, someone asked me again of a star near Arcturus - and there it was, very close (like it\u0027s a naked eye double star) to Arcturus ! It\u0027s also wiggling up/down (on the \u0022sphere\u0022, indeed one can\u0027t differ horizontal motion and vertical motion on the sky), we wondered what it is.

First one happened when i was a child - during one particularly dark, rainy night my grandmother and i noticed a ball of bright, orange light shining over nearby forest. It was stationary despite strong wind - it could be moon shining through the clouds like my grandma insisted, but it lasted couple of minutes without changing the brightness.\n\nAnother one happened couple of years ago. It was a beautiful summer night, so i went to my backyard for some stargazing, hoping to see Andromeda galaxy. Instead i noticed four yellow, not blinking lights clustered together - they were moving very fast from north to the south. It took them only several seconds to cross the sky and disappear in the glare of streetlights behind my house. And despite quietness of the night, i did not hear any sound of the engines. More than that - couple of days later i talked with my cousin living in nearby town just north from where i live. He was returning from his girlfriends home that night and seen the same thing. And before anyone says it was just a plane: there is an international air traffic corridor above our neighbourhood. Also jets from nearby Air Force base often train in our area. We are well accustomed to the planes, both civilian and military flying above our heads - but none of us ever seen a plane with positioning lights in uniform colour (yellow), none of which were blinking.\n\nNewest weird encounter happened last year. It was during the day this time, and all i\u0027ve seen was a bright, ruby-red flash of light between cumulus clouds. Nothing more. I didn\u0027t noticed anything more despite watching that area for several minutes.\n\nAnd of course there was another ball of bright, orange light flying above my street - but it was during New Year night when everyone were shooting fireworks. So i admit - it could be a paper hot air baloon with a lit candle inside (though i still have my doubts)."},{"CreatedByName":"peadar1987","CreatedById":81207,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T09:51:49Z","Content":"Hmm...

I mean, we never see toilets on their spaceships, so...?\n\n***The Titan Theory:***\n\nAliens could originate from within our own Solar System. So close, actually that it may be right under our noses. Specifically, I\u0027m talking about the Saturn moon of Titan. The reason I suggest such a close target? Simple. During the Opposition of Saturn yearly.. There is a slight increase in UFO sightings as I found out during research regarding my sighting to make sure that I wasn\u0027t seeing the ISS or some other orbiting object. These UFOs could originate from the Titan moon. Some evidence (but not fully solid) to back up can be found in some of the Saturn Radio emissions which is eerie themselves if it isn\u0027t ET. ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUaE9hoWvpQ:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUaE9hoWvpQ:) 4:39. Saturn should appear.). The radio emissions have according to some people garbled text that says some spooky words. Now. If aliens were indeed to come from Titan. They would most likely be Aquatic-based ET that could possibly breathe Titan\u0027s atmosphere and also Earth\u0027s atmosphere. This seems unlikely, but it would explain the vast majority of UFO sightings around water. Perhaps the Aquatic ET are abducting fish? Maybe they need to refill water, similar to whales? However, this blows a deep hole in to the grays theory. What if the Grays and said Aquatic-ET are rival factions that battle for Titan as a outpost of some sorts? I\u0027ll make some points in how this theory could be deemed plausible and not so plausible.\n\n**PLAUSIBLE THINGS ABOUT THE TITAN THEORY:**\n\n- 1. *Explains UFO sightings on open sea or UFOs seen leaving from under water.*\n- 2. *Explains UFO sightings around Saturn\u0027s Opposition.*\n- 3. *Could possibly explain the Saturn Radio Emissions if the source is not from Saturn\u0027s weather patterns as originally thought.*\n\n*\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9*\n\n**IMPLAUSIBLE THINGS ABOUT THE TITAN THEORY:**\n\n- 1. *Does not explain the Grays nor the vast majority of abduction stories regarding Grays and their home in the Zeta star-region despite no exosolar planets.*\n- 2. *Does not explain UFO sightings outside of Saturn\u0027s Opposition.*\n- 3. *Does not explain previous alien theories set in history.*\n\n*\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9*\n\nI know it seems quite far fetched, but worth a thought. The anatomy of said aquatic creatures could be Humanoid or resemble something like a Squid with arms. \n\nPerhaps as of now, we are in fact in the middle of a intergalactic battle that\u0027s taking place right under our noses?"},{"CreatedByName":"Albert VDS","CreatedById":74055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T13:34:10Z","Content":"Once I had an encounter with a UFO.

As I\u0027m turning my head around, I see a big ball of fire up in the sky. It was just around sunset, but very up in the sky and not even close to where the sun was setting. Then I hear a scream or something coming from the match so I turn around to see where the ball is (it would have been quite embarassing had I conceded a goal because I was looking up). Luckily, the ball was still far away, so I turned back, and it was gone.

The leaps in logic here are just ridiculous. More UFO sightings when Saturn is at opposition = aliens come from Titan and are abducting fish? Seriously? Here\u0027s an alternative explanation: when Saturn is at opposition there are more UFO sightings because there\u0027s a bright light in the sky that isn\u0027t there usually and the majority of people don\u0027t know it\u0027s Saturn so report it as a UFO. Radio waves coming from Saturn? The Earth makes radio waves too. I don\u0027t fully understand the process by which it works but wouldn\u0027t it be reasonable to assume that a much larger planet would produce more powerful radio waves? \n\nSeeing a UFO (Unidentified Flying Object - emphasis on the UNIDENTIFIED) and claiming that aliens are behind it are completely different things. Claiming that aliens are visiting us or that we\u0027re in an \u0027intergalactic battle\u0027 or something require such vast leaps of logic that they are almost completely untenable. If aliens visit us all the time and have visible lights (which many of you make the astounding claim are used for communication - how could you possibly know that?) then how comes no one who watches the sky for a living ever sees them? How come there is never any definitive documentary proof other than a handful of eyewitness claims? For any of it to make sense you have to believe in so many things which are so unlikely to be true; that the government is covering up these sightings, that thousands of astronomers and scientists across the globe are under pay of the government to keep quiet about what should be abundantly obvious evidence of extraterrestrial activity. \n\nAlternatively, the aliens are cloaking themselves in their voyages across the stars until they reach a few thousand feet above the Earth, something which is completely ridiculous. In space there is no medium to lose heat by convection into and so heat lingers around and is pretty easily detectable. Just look at the number of radiators the ISS needs to keep itself cool. Now imagine the orders of magnitude more energy required for a futuristic starship (presumably with some sort of FTL warp drive) and how you could possibly get rid of that amount of heat without revealing yourself. Cloaking in space is basically impossible unless you believe in some sort of advanced magic technology which circumvents the laws of physics as we know it. Now, that might well be the case, sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic etc, but it requires far too many jumps in logic. Which is simpler; that the laws of physics as we know them are wrong, that the entire world is engaged in a mass conspiracy, or that the human mind is easily tricked into believing it saw something it didn\u0027t see, or misinterpreting something it did see as something inexplicable? We are not objective creatures. We live in a subjective world. It is easy to see something wrong or misinterpret what we are seeing and then make wild jumps of logic to seek to explain it. That\u0027s how our brains are wired. But we live in a world of science and reason now and some of you really need to apply that to what you are seeing (and saying) more thoroughly. \n\nTLDR; you saw a UFO, great. It was unidentified. Probably given the right information you would be able to identify it, and probably it would be something perfectly reasonable, but as it stands you cannot. **THAT DOES NOT MEAN YOU SAW ALIENS OR WE ARE IN A GALACTIC CIVIL WAR WHERE SQUID FROM TITAN FLY TO EARTH TO ABDUCT FISH**"},{"CreatedByName":"Frida Space","CreatedById":60943,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T14:53:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Honestly guys I\u0027m disappointed.\n\nI agree, I absolutely don\u0027t believe in alien UFOs or anything like that.
