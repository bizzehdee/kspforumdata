Also, and there\u0027ll be notable mechanical stresses on the rocket just from being supported and propelled from the side. Plus, after release the launch vehicle would require much more aerodynamic control than your typical \u0027flying cylinder\u0027 vertical launcher. All this sounds like a lot of extra structural requirements on the rocket, which\u0027ll raise drymass considerably. The question is, are these increased structural drymasses somehow less than the drymass of the extra fuel tank that would have been needed to hold the \u0027wasted\u0027 fuel of a normal launch.... despite being less awesome somehow I think the normal launch would win out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a lot of stuff on this particular site that doesn\u0027t quite sound right to me, though I\u0027m admittedly no expert on the topic. One example as case and point, they posit that the first stage speeding up along the ground is actually a good thing for the crew\u0027s safety, and to be honest, that\u0027s bizarre! With a proper \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E, your chance of escaping a rocket catastrophe is really quite good. If you were traveling mach 2 only a few dozen meters off the ground, and the launch vehicle or its rocket-sled breaks or explodes or otherwise falls from track, what could you possibly do to save the crew? The webpage says the crew could \u0022... eject from an escape capsule, similar to aircraft ejection seats\u0022. At mach 2 just off the ground? With the upwards inflecting track?

In order to make the curve they\u0027re talking about (it\u0027s a family of curves, but for one that looks reasonably like the one in the picture,) you\u0027d need ~3.5-5G of acceleration upwards, including to our normal gravity. This force would normally be supplied by the track as it follows the shape of the mountain. When the escape system fires, it\u0027ll need to provide the force instead in addition to the force to actually escape. So, our escape system would need to have the ability of our current escape systems with the following extras:\u00A0 Let me know if you\u0027d like the derivation!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would need an additional 2.5-4G worth of force, which is not too nasty on its own because \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E in reusable systems are ~7G applied already. However, it would need to do this in a supersonic cross wind (meaning it will need to be aerodynamically stable in the \u0027forward\u0027 direction while the escape rocket is firing out the bottom.) It then needs to be able to bleed off off the supersonic speeds without falling into the curved mountain approaching at 3.5-5G, meaning it will need to boost up a considerable distance so it has enough time to (somehow) deploy drogues, then chutes and finally land starting in those high-G conditions. When it lands, we\u0027ll be on a steep (45 degree) grade so we somehow need to keep it from rolling off! Now all the while we\u0027ve been slowing down our astronauts, the wreckage has been splattering and slowing down as well, so somehow we need to avoid this.

There\u0027s no easy way to cut it. This is an engineering nightmare. Can it be done? Maybe, but there will be a ton of concessions on the craft design because of it.

There are some truly amazing roller coasters that are feats of engineering (and large budgets) , but when we compare their plans to a typical roller coaster, we see they\u0027re hugely different in scale. The rocket sled rail would be as far removed from a roller coaster as a roller coaster is from a thick plank of wood. It\u0027s fine to not agree with the exact estimates I\u0027ve made, the point still remains that they\u0027re extremely different magnitudes of project.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheir example craft is the little suborbital X-33, which weighs in at 130tonnes fully fueled. By the time we factor in the sled and actually getting to orbit with a payload we\u0027d be talking several times the launch mass, which I\u0027m rounding roughly to 500tonnes. The curved track will increase the experienced gravity to ~3.5-5G. So this would need to do ~100 times the normal force, 20 times the speed, and be dramatically longer and smoother than any roller coaster. From a conceptual standpoint they may be similar, but when you sit down to start pondering the brass-tacks of actually building it, this would be a very different beast. Maybe more akin to building the Shinkansen rail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProperly designed, I certainly don\u0027t think any of this is impossible, and I think there\u0027s a lot of good things to be learned by trying to figure out options for all these little troubles, but it\u0027s definitely not the slam-dunk easy that the webpage presents it as!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n~3-5G, 500tonnes, 5km, 680m/s.

How large would the tunnel need to be for the transonic shockwave of a passing rocket to not have damaging or destabilizing effect on itself and the rocket? Even small planes can shatter windows across a good distance (~100m) of open sky, what about a massive orbital rocket ramming through a closed tube? I think a lowball would be 3 times the diameter of the rocket\u002Bsled, and even this would result an insanely large tunnel the likes of which has never been seen!

Some researchers would get to make their careers by them! Nothing wrong with that. Why am I a fan of rocket sleds though?

Rather than being based on the X-33, it\u0027s based on Skylon, the fully reusable \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E space plane coming out *soon* (tm).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rocket sled (Methalox or turbojet powered) is supported on a ~15km long, perfectly flat and level high gauge rail with one rail electrified. The rocket sled cradles the fuselage of a space plane that is exactly the hopes and dreams of what Skylon could be. A few launch clamps hold the two together. Skylon spools up its engines while the rocket sled fires, pushing forward at 2G! 5km down the rail (22 seconds later) they\u0027re traveling mach 1.3, then the launch clamps unlock and Skylon lifts away by aerodynamic forces. The rocket sled engages brakes (reactive brakes maybe) and slows down at 2-3G over another few km, dumping most of the power into the rail, where it\u0027s used for something cool back at base camp... lasers maybe? Then, after stopping, the rocket sled uses electric motors to drive back home. Meanwhile, Skylon does what Skylon does (why mess anymore with an already awesome plan). It picks up altitude and velocity up to mach 5 with its miraculous jet engines, then it switches to closed combustion and rockets into orbit. Once there it drops off a payload (or acts as mothership to a returning GTO second stage) , and then flies home. Because it\u0027s nice and light weight by now, it\u0027ll have an easier time of this than the shuttle. Finally, it uses powered flight to land back at the starting blocks. A crane or something drops it off on the rocket sled again, they\u0027re refueled and flown again!\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027d have no launch escape system, because it wouldn\u0027t have passengers! Just cargo and a computer at the helm. In the case of an emergency, it would try to save the spaceplane by having it lift away, or having the rocket sled put on the breaks, but it definitely wouldn\u0027t be human rated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat advantages does this have over Skylon as it\u0027s currently envisioned? This would let the designers optimize the aerodynamics and engine profile for super sonic flight without worrying about takeoff, subsonic and transonic conditions. It would need to be able to fly in subsonic conditions on return, but not efficiently! As much as the free deltaV, removing the subsonic design constraints is what would really add value to the system. Also, the landing gear (= dead weight) could be made much smaller because they would only need to support the spaceplane _after_ it lands without the fuel/cargo. Additionally, there wouldn\u0027t need to be a large launch-abort braking system in the landing gear, because it would be on the rocket sled instead. All of this translates to a huge boost in deliverable payload fraction, which translates to money money money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdvantages over contemporary flyback boosters: Fully reusable, no lost upper stages.

It\u0027s a freebe! That is, unless ground effect causes massive amounts of excess lift that somehow aren\u0027t experienced in other regimes (like reentry). Next, the rocket sled will certainly experience drag, but even a (very) highball estimate would be .5G worth when at top speed in addition to the of the 2G acceleration. On the other hand normal rockets generally work up to many G of acceleration in addition to both gravity and aero drag. By comparison this sled\u0027s gonna be toodling! Fuel-wise, since it\u0027s only responsible for ~450m/s deltaV, the aerodrag won\u0027t kill us through the exponentiality of the rocket equation either. Just bring along some more fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the flip side,\u00A0 plane-based launchers would need to deal with both its own drag (parasitic), as well as the lift induced drag to keep everything floating. The current state of the art, VMS Eve, isn\u0027t able to break the sound barrier-- It provides the height without a ton of speed. Adding in the further constraint that it would be carrying an enormous Hydrogen-fuelled vehicle makes it a tricky sort to imagine. It\u0027s already the biggest composite air frame ever built, but it would need to get much larger! Spruce Goose eat your heart out, style thing. It would definitely provide the additional advantage of dropping off the launch craft at a higher altitude (= lower pressure) so perhaps the added difficulties are worth it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s actually put some numbers on these engines and the fuel mass of a rocket sled.

Preface, this is how I remember it working, but it may be a bit off...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s two varieties, and both can provide magnetic levitation. The first (and the kind I\u0027m much less familiar with) is a \u0027linear motor\u0027 type, where there\u0027s permanent or electromagnets in the track and electromagnets in the train. The other rarer kind is called the linear induction motor where there\u0027s electromagnets on the train and a conductive but non magnetized track (like plain old aluminum). As the electromagnets on the train turn on, the electrons in the nearby conductive track experience the sudden magnetism, and (by the way of things) rush in circles (called eddy currents) to create an opposing magnetic force. This causes momentary levitation, but it\u0027s not a stable situation. Quickly afterwards though, the electromagnets on the train start to turn off, and just in front of them another set turns on. The new set also opposes those eddy currents , and because it\u0027s a little in front of them, pushes forward off of them (moving the train forward), while simultaneously creating a new set of eddies very slightly further forward. The process repeats, and the magnets keep pushing off old eddies while creating new ones.\u00A0 The rate these eddies move within the track is called \u0027slip\u0027 and is a defining factor in how the motor functions. In real situations, the motor will use electromagnets turning on in alternating directions (poles) rather than simply on/off. Also, the above is from a stationary perspective. Because the eddies move much less quickly than the train, the electromagnets on the train need to sweep backwards to keep up with the track.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is all what I remember, and it should be mostly correct but may be off in a little detail. I had to study LIMs for a project a good while back, and wound up prototyping one in my garage. What stuck with me most was how to choose wire gagues and wrappings rather than how the blasted things worked! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022^_^\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_happy.png\u0022 title=\u0022^_^\u0022\u003E Sometimes life is like that. An LIM to support 500Tonnes of rocket would be truly gargantuan and require enormous amounts of power. There are, however, many things in this world that can supply and handle enormous amounts of power so it\u0027s certainly a possibility! It would be interesting to calculate just how much electric power would be involved, but I\u0027m expecting from a paper I just glanced at ~1-2kW/ton of levitation assuming a typical slip (optimized for pushing the train forward by magnets). So, probably 1/2 to 1 megaWatt for my proposed 500T rocket sled ... As a reference, your house probably pulls ~1kW on average, enough to maybe levitate a very small car.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: The 1-2kW/ton value sounds a little low to me. Maybe the ones I made were really low efficiency though! That would certainly sound likely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think... I could be wrong, but I seem to remember you could get better levitation efficiencies if your track was ferromagnetic (like carbon steel). The downside was magnetic saturation could be an issue, and you couldn\u0027t use high slips so forward motion got a little funky. Still, I think the first thing I\u0027d look into would be this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor fun, back at home, It is possible to levitate an object in place using a single electromagnet which simply turns on/off quickly by this same effect. It\u0027s a common physics demo, called the jumping ring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-08-02T06:37:26Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2018 06:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Cunjo Carl\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-02T06:14:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4839534/China-s-supersonic-flying-train-travel-2-500mph.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4839534/China-s-supersonic-flying-train-travel-2-500mph.html\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EDaily Mail\u003C/em\u003E, but about a high-speed Chinese project.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-08-02T06:15:18Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2018 06:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by kerbiloid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-02T12:42:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223426312\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022177041\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221533190474\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129408\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerbiloid\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, kerbiloid said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EDa\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Ei\u003C/span\u003Ely\u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003E Mail ...\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ehigh-speed Chinese project.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBanal, and...
