The approaches differ in how they tolerate errors in accuracy. Legs fitted to the planet have to aim for a very small contact area on the rocket; legs fitted to the rocket can tolerate several meters of error and still land the booster in one piece. Therefore there is a level of landing accuracy at which it\u0027s worth paying the cost of the few crashed boosters in exchange for an enhanced payload of all the flights; I expect that rocketry will reach this level of accuracy in the not too distant future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the launch pad is not the only part of the planet that you could attach the landing gear to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the booster crashes, it\u0027s not just the cost of the booster than has to be paid - the cost includes whatever else the booster hits: from something cheap like flat concrete with circles painted on it, to something more expensive like a barge, or worst case something that is valuable, scarce, and needed right now - such as a Mars launch pad just before the transfer window. The higher the landing accuracy, the less chance of paying this cost, of course. With perfect accuracy the cost of errors would not matter, it\u0027d never be paid. The benefit to landing on the launch pad isn\u0027t saving carrying the legs - either choice of landing site could be equipped with these - it\u0027s only saving a trip of a kilometre or two from the landing site.* I just don\u0027t see the known accuracy ever getting so high compared to the difference in cost of the assets in the at-risk area. Even if the real accuracy were 99.9999% and you therefore had a perfect flight record, you\u0027d need many many flights before you had the data that proved it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222777804\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002288441\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221475064878\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022145422\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nefrums\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, Nefrums said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving a paved landing field a few km from the pad makes more sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExactly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* There\u0027s also a performance benefit to landing the boosters downrange of the launch site, whether that\u0027s a barge, or transcontinental (Vandenberg to Canaveral?), or transatlantic like the shuttle abort mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-28T17:00:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI said this in the other thread, but I think that the ITS component is interesting as a VTVL transport concept---Earth transport.
