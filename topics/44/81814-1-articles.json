Worth seeing, but after a couple of iterations, three will be better ways to spend your time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Allocate a couple hours for just wandering around the rocket garden with your mouth gaping open on awe. About half that time will be spent starting at an F-1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Go on every tour you can. My particular favorite is the \u0022Then and Now\u0022 tour, which takes you (along other things) to some of the very first original pads and bunkers. Very, very cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Follow the advice from above--schedule your visit around a launch, if you can. The simulators are also neat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - You have to see the Atlantis. I just saw the Endeavour up close for the first time today, and it was more amazing than I ever could have hoped.

Otherwise, you\u0027ll likely end up standing in line for a good hour or so. If you aren\u0027t used to the kind of weather we get down here (I live literally like 20 minutes away from KSC.
