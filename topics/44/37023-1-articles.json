This is the problem I run into when explaining the double slit experiment. As soon as I say, \u0022The results are different depending on whether or not the electrons are observed,\u0022 people go, \u0022Ah! Well, observing them must have changed something.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be fair, that argument does make sense. If we assume the change has a cause, and the only thing we have changed is whether or not we are observing, then does it not \u0022make sense\u0022 that the act of observing must have caused the change? Especially if we consider that there is \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eno\u003C/span\u003E case without observation where the change occurs. I am aware, of course, that correlation does not imply causation, and I am not arguing against the implications of the experiment. I am just wondering, what do you say to people who insist there must be some sort of interference? EG, the observation device has a nonzero magnetism, or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a slightly different note, I read an interesting interview a few years back which had a section on this experiment. It was essentially an extrapolation of the observer effect. Namely, the interviewee suggested that if there are aliens in a distance universe, then they could be causing changes in our universe simply by observing electrons that make it over here, and we could be causing changes in their universe QED. I really wish I could find that article again, it was really interesting. Of course, the more you extrapolate, the more people resist (sensibly: The more you extrapolate, the less evidence you have.
