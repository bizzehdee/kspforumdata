We\u0027ve had a number of incidents involving space travel, and these have raised many questions about the dangerous part of the \u0022final frontier\u0022. Here\u0027s where we\u0027ll discuss them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-03T22:42:02Z\u0022 title=\u002212/03/2013 10:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Needles_10\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tipsyMJT","CreatedById":25743,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T04:18:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think there is any problem at all with launching humans into space. No ethics problem whatsoever. The astronauts know the danger of what they are doing and they understand that something could come along on their mission that was unforeseen and could make them endure a very torturous death. I dare to bet that if you ask any astronaut they will tell you that anyone who believes that space travel is unethical and cruel to the astronaut is ridiculous. It\u0027s the same as saying being a soldier, race car driver, construction worker, or crab fisherman is unethical. They all know the risks of death going into their occupation and they still choose to do it. It\u0027s their life and their life only that they are putting in danger so why stop them. This proposes a peculiar question for the issues of suicide but i\u0027m not going to go into that because it is a much too touchy topic. BUT Now that that is out of the way we get to the root of the question. The only logical reason i can imagine having anything to do with the good or bad ethics of space travel would be with the launching of animals into the dangers of space to test the ways their instincts may freak out upon interaction with the foreign environment such as space and this breaks down even farther to just the basic animal rights and anti animal testing movements. Is it unethical because of the harm that may come to the animals? Is the fact that they are in more danger then they would be if they were sitting on your couch make it cruel? i don\u0027t know, but, does letting your dog run into a crowded street make you a cruel person? No matter your answer to the previous questions I have another for you. Does making an animal freak out and spin violently because it\u0027s natural instinct is to right itself but then it can\u0027t because there is no direction to right itself to in the zero gravity (okay fine outward inertial force equaling gravitational attractive force inward) situation of space, cruel? I sure don\u0027t know the answer. I foresee this conversation possibly branching of into religion, animal rights, and maybe even civil rights. I\u0027ll be coming back often i know that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"meve12","CreatedById":65193,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T08:09:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA good samaritian tradition seems like a good start.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Karriz","CreatedById":58036,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T09:43:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think a manned spacecraft should always be designed with safety in mind, and the ground team should pay extra attention to any anomalies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI read an interesting article about Shuttle Atlantis, which was almost lost in 1988, just like what happened to Columbia: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts119/090327sts27/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts119/090327sts27/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrankly, I think Space shuttle was dangerous.

The risk allowed on a robot mission is far larger, for ethical reasons, so you can save mass on safety systems. A robot doesn\u0027t have to COME BACK, so you can send one-way missions where doing that with manned flight requires the astronauts to volunteer for suicide. (Not just \u0022there is some risk of death\u0022 but \u0022the risk of death is 100%\u0022.) Not having to come back saves an enormous amount on fuel mass. Also, the requirements of life support are large. Keeping a human alive while adrift for 6 months is going to take quite a bit of equipment and stores, whereas a robot can just be turned off during the trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then there\u0027s the extra volume needed for psychology reasons. While it may be possible to keep a human alive in a chair for 6 months with barely enough room to stretch arms and legs out, you\u0027re almost guaranteed to end up with an utterly insane human by the time it\u0027s over. And even ignoring the ethics of doing that to an astronaut (even a volunteer), an insane human won\u0027t be useful for completing the mission goals. So you need a lot more living space than that just to keep the human sane. Probably the closest analogy to the long term spaceflight in cramped space problem we\u0027ve already seen here on earth is nuclear submarine sailors. But even THEY don\u0027t have to spend 100% of that time in their bunks not moving. There are corridors and other rooms. Tiny rooms, but its still quite a bit more space than, say, the Apollo astronauts had and they only were expected to have to live in that space for about a week. Lifting something the size of, say 3 submarine\u0027s bunks, 1 submarine\u0027s toilet, 1 tiny kitchen/dining/meeting space, and 1 cockpit area, is still quite a hefty payload. We\u0027ve never sent anything to Mars anywhere near that enormous before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd of course, radiation. That means shielding. And that means even more mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically, yes I think manned spaceflight is a good thing despite the dangers, BUT those very dangers themselves are the things that make manned flight so incredibly expensive and bulky. Therefore I\u0027d rather see effort concentrated MORE on the research into cheaper ways to lift things into orbit. That\u0027s the key linchpin that\u0027s restricting manned flight right now. As long as getting a single kilogram of mass into orbit is as expensive as it is now, the extra kilograms needed for manned versus unmanned flight will continue to make manned flight very hard to justify. The way to reduce the risks, and also to make it more feasible, is to attack the problem that getting mass into orbit is too expensive. Currently it\u0027s way cheaper to have craft that operate using very expensive but very small engines that burn very expensive but very small amounts of fuel than it is to have them use cheap engines that use cheap but bulky fuel, just because those kilograms cost more than rare materials do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
