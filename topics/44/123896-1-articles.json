They envisioned medical and other applications for the device.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022As a mechanical wave, sound can exert significant forces on objects. Just remember the last time you were in a concert and your chest was vibrating with the music,\u0022 said study lead author Asier Marzo of Britain\u0027s University of Bristol and Spain\u0027s Public University of Navarre.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMarzo said this sonic tractor beam has manipulated objects up to about 4 millimetres in diameter and can control the position and orientation of the levitated objects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tractor beam uses ultrasound at a frequency of 40 kilohertz. People can hear only below 20 kilohertz.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe researchers used sound waves from 64 miniature loudspeakers called transducers to create what they called \u0022acoustic holograms\u0022 to control an object without touching it. These waves took the form of tweezers to lift an object, a vortex to hold a levitating object in place and a cage to surrounds an object and hold it in place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022A simple wave will just push the particle in the direction of propagation. However, multiple waves will interfere with each other and create complex, acoustic 3D shapes that exert forces from all directions and keep the particle in place,\u0022 Marzo said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMarzo said the largest object moved using the device was a 4 mm bead made of a light plastic called polystyrene.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022With special high-power transducers it would be possible to levitate even steel balls,\u0022 Marzo said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMarzo described possible medical applications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sound cannot travel through the void of space but it can do it through water or human tissue.
