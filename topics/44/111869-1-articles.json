Now, I\u0027m not sure that SpaceX is quite there for it to become a model for a wave of imitators yet. I think it needs another year or two of successful launches to establish it\u0027s cred, but just for fun, what do you think a \u0022me too\u0022 company would be like? What kind of rocket would they build?\n\nPersonally, I would imagine someone, learning from SpaceX\u0027s experience, going straight to a methane fueled deep throttle main engine in a cluster of 5 to 7 engines on the first stage. I think they would aim for a payload a little larger than F9 and plan for RTLS of the first stage from the beginning. I could see them maybe diverging from the SpaceX method by making the second stage aimed at re-usability from the beginning, maybe with a lifting body shape and internalized cargo.\n\nI think they would try and find a plant location suitable for water transport of stages to the launch site in order to avoid the size limits that SpaceX has had to deal with by transporting on trucks.\n\nThoughts?"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T18:01:10Z","Content":"Somebody else popping up in the same size class as F9 or F9 heavy is unlikely. The market isn\u0027t too big at that range, and the focus on reliability makes entering it with an unproven vehicle very difficult. There may be an opportunity to enter the market after ILS collapses (given no Protons have been ordered since 2013 outside of Russia, that can\u0027t take too long now); but by that point Blue Origin are likely to be ready. Anybody trying to get in after that will have to either outprice Arianespace for the third place or start at the smaller end of the market, probably the latter."},{"CreatedByName":"sojourner","CreatedById":65674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T18:13:34Z","Content":"Oh sure, take the fun out of the exercise..."},{"CreatedByName":"xenomorph555","CreatedById":103080,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T18:37:38Z","Content":"It\u0027s too late for another \u0022SpaceX\u0022, they\u0027ve already got hold of the market and will completely monopolize it over time.

There is more than language. \n\nHowever, you do NOT outsource everything. \n\nDevelopment can\u0027t be outsourced and although countries like india have a growing number of personal capable of working in the space industry, they are still behind in terms of know-how and experience. You also need lots and lots of companies for high quality material, equipment and infrastructure. India isn\u0027t there yet. They will be in maybe 10-20 years, but until then I doubt we will see an indian competitor.\n\nEven then they would still have to catch up in the recovery area, which requires even more development. The bariers to enter the market are stupidly and it\u0027s a real miracle that SpaceX got this far this quickly.\n\nEitherway I\u0027m not rly sure that SpaceX will do space stations and infrastriucture anytime soon, even if somebody can make a profit out of it. They are rly focused on launchers and the transport business. That is their big strength as it makes them very specialised, helps with scale effects and lowers the costs. Ultimately the falcon has a very good chance of being launched a lot and therefor to actually break even. They may be even able to make a real profit on a less subsidized market at some point.

Part of the reason satelites are so expensive is that they are built of ultralight superoptimized components- but a lunar sweatshop knockoff can be much cruder and heavier, making up for the lost DV with a lower DV requirement.\n\nAs for how, I would imagine you would launch the cable in spools, rendevous and link them, send them out to L1, and unwind in both directions at once.
