Walking costs barely more energy than merely standing as it is basically a pendulum motion that uses its own energy to move forward. In short, you just control falling forward. Driving, on the other hand, means continuous friction between the wheel and the surface, friction within the wheel (deformation) and loss of energy due to the suspension.
