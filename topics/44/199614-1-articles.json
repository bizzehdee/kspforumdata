The only bell would be a very slow release opening, possibly extra wide to limit wear and expand life, that can last as long as possible to maintain the atmosphere to have as long a burn time to get to the speed of light to test it. Could we do this with current tech?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the bell/ opening needs more life we can use spray concepts to recoat the bell to reduce or get rid of wear. vacuum can be used with material in a coil then with electricity through it in order to heat up and spray a material on the bell to coat. Use of magnetics could help build to reduce waste etc. Permanent or other magnets could be used if needed for extra power or back up power in case you need to functionally not use the main nuclear battery.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m assuming the nuclear battery could provide the propellent naturally. Or is that where the flaw in the design is. This could allow omni directional thrust and more complex thrust using magnetics and control computers to gain efficiency if it help make it viable over other designs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis could be either very small to reduce resources and needed thrust or very big depending on where the most efficient equipment comes in. This weird design could also allow other combos to get the most efficient sized equipment if a lack of a direct thruster helps. Although it could be the opposite way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe point of this would be either a really good solar system tug boat. Or to get to the speed of light to test it with relatively conventional means.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf a propellent is needed you could always use something that is magnetic with some sort of propellent that is less magnetic so it leaves while the oxidizer doesn\u0027t. Maybe in a way to create as close to infinite oxidizer/other for long term burning. Even if it\u0027s very low thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have a nuclear battery you also have heat differentials to play with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, some process could be applied to make one of the parts less magnetic as opposed to pure propulsive forces from magnets. If done right you cold control the direction. Whatever is useful or efficient. something odd could always aid in countering other collective forces. Especially if you large or long standing power sources like permanent magnets or a nuclear battery. Even if it\u0027s very low thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, any coating methods could be done in way to produce thrust. And magnetic forces could be used to keep stuff from hitting the bell if that is what causes wear. Assuming this does not also create wear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could also shrink down the atmosphere to just behind the release area in order to limit needed material or containment. Unless having it around a ship has other uses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother part of such a design is the use minimal to no parts in the production to reduce mass. Although magnetic holding may act similarly. Or am I mistaken. Would magnetic couplings reduce thrust or counter thrust in any way?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe light would be useful as you may have lots of power for keeping it going and little matter. Would a laser propulsion be ideal for this. You could keep an atmosphere and maximize the efficiency of the thrust with the laser and a very thin atmosphere or similar chamber. Possibly outside the ship to increase life of parts. The thin atmosphere could be used to make sure it doesn\u0027t produce thrust ineficiently if it helps. Not sure how that would work though. Either way that could all be controlled with magnetics if possible to maintain it until the light or other forces(maybe from heat?) forces the propellent. Then maybe a slow burn could be used to thrust. As long as it can be powered long enough and has enough to push off of. Or could similar be done with a physical plate instead of an atmosphere of some sort and just recoat it over and over?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsince you are in space could nuclear exhaust be used as a coating to save on mass? then the propellent could be used to regen/repair the ship if needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-01-18T05:44:48Z\u0022 title=\u002201/18/2021 05:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 18, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arugela","CreatedById":133381,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-15T03:17:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn fact what about laser against a solar sail. If you can recoat or regenerate the physical coat. If the spray of the sail is efficient you could use the physical loss of material as part of thrust. then you coat in a way that doesn\u0027t loose thrust if possible. Or use other temporary thrust to counter the coating process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mf5Fbx0nl50?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is already being worked one, but would it help to add the other concept of atmosphere into the mix or in place? Not sure if it could be done lighter or longer. I\u0027m almost assuming the power from this laser is not self contained and need to be in range or something, but solar sails and this could be combined potentially. Or does that not matter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother concept would be if you can use magnets themselves to propel against a set of plates. One side has more magnetic force than the other applied to produce thrust. This could be used in the atmosphere idea also. Could this use something as simple as magnets physical positioning to produce thrust? If permanent magnets and or a long term battery are applied in case it can run out on very long term trips. Maybe something that can get to the speed of light can be produced. maybe if the movement of the magnets is pushed in one direction by light sensitive materials and then powered on\u00A0 to pull with magnets. Or with released very small atmospheric materials also propelled by light. Not sure if it would help then. It would have to be very light I would imagine. Or would it just act as a converter for something? Or a switch? I guess if it relies on a on and off release of material it could power the release. If it helps orients the thrust in an ideal position then in a less ideal position and back and release with a magnetic field or something. Assuming that is useful. Maybe it could get rid of connecting parts as it\u0027s held magnetically to reduce mass. Assuming the pull of the magnetic field does not counter the thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould an EM drive work or be explained if it\u0027 ripping off tiny amounts of material from the bell slowly? If you combined it with a coating system to replenish it you could use metal bells as propellent hypothetically. Maybe maximize this reality. Or create it on purpose to have a longer lasting propellent source. If it\u0027s not happening under current EM drive test you could potentially make it happen on purpose. Then it\u0027s just a solid propellent storage device. Made of magnetic metals. Or even other materials that can be changed from magnetic to not magnetic or other things if needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also don\u0027t get the argument about em drives being impossible. We are at least in a solar system filled with giant magnets. It should be deemed impossible not to work as it should be pushing off of them. It should be a matter of time. I would imagine there are a few or will on day be some applications for this. As there could be certain probes or legions of problems scanning the system for things and propelled along natural magnetic trajectories. It could even be for measuring such a thing. If it takes 10 years to get up to speed maybe that could be acceptable for long term use. If it works it could be useful for very long probe work if we can\u0027t find anything better after a certain point. Can we presume at least some small magnetic field all over the universe. If not maybe it can hop from system to system or galaxy to galaxy for obscenely long probe work? Maybe use magnetics or similar to propel it far from the bel and then lasers to hit it for more propulsion. Or the other way around. Heat it to release the material then use magnets to propel from it. Basically and atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you can get the nuclear batter to last long enough why not use molten metals? Loosley held in place with a magnetic field and pushed with other forces to propel them in a very controlled manner. At that point you have a bunch of heat and a bunch of cold. What fun things could be done with controlling that carefully?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-01-15T04:38:54Z\u0022 title=\u002201/15/2021 04:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 15, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-15T04:36:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223909180\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022199614\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221610680672\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022133381\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Arugela\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Arugela said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn fact what about laser against a solar sail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis has been proposed before.

Just a matter of how long. If we could ever get fusion going. You could even have it move along the axis of north and south pole of the sun with the system rotating around it and then have the planets slowly apply acceleration from their poles(unless the opposite somehow helps with planetary motions). Just enough to move but not enough to break orbit. I wonder how long that would take. You could then use a maintenance model based on planetary crusts. And then grow things on it to help.

However, the energy required for that impulse is proportional to the exhaust velocity, so that more mass-efficient engines require much more energy, and are typically less energy efficient. This is a problem if the engine is to provide a large amount of thrust. To generate a large amount of impulse per second, it must use a large amount of energy per second. So high-mass-efficient engines require enormous amounts of energy per second to produce high thrusts. As a result, most high-mass-efficient engine designs also provide lower thrust due to the unavailability of high amounts of energy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;text-indent:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;text-indent:0px;\u0022\u003E\nIs there anything more energy producing than a tiny fission/fusion sun generator?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;text-indent:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;text-indent:0px;\u0022\u003E\nEdit: what if the universe is the result of such a device trying to produce the speed of light.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;text-indent:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;text-indent:0px;\u0022\u003E\nSo, I\u0027m guessing if you can\u0027t get the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E high enough the solar sail concept would be best.

No need to loose emisions as the fusion/fision hybrid is a recycler for as close to closed loop as possible with all movement based on a solar sail... 8)\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, it\u0027s the solar laser based transport but with it\u0027s own powersource. And it could have a pretty long lasing power source. If the propulsion is closed loop it could be shrunk more potentially. And the solar sail could just let it fly away as the close source only needs to be stronger than the distant sources. And you can make the rest of the system as efficient as possible as it only needs sustain the sun as long as possible as opposed to burning as much thrust as possible. So hybrid fusion/fision lazer pointer. the solar sail could also be adjusted to change directions or decrease thrust etc. It could easily go to half way around the solar system for pure forward thrust. And the sun could only burn on the front end if it helps preserve fuel. The corona/light source would potentially only need to be for propulsion. So, it could be controlled. Then only lit on the back to change directions if desired.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat could simplify the system design also as you wouldn\u0027t need artificial structures as much. Just enough to hold planets and the solar sail potentially. Maybe. You could simplify it to pure inertial containment if that is more efficient. Or a partial sun with the ability to only go foward or only forward facing items. This could be rotated from the sun itself as it could have a corona over a half disk shape that can turn. then the solar sails can go around it and hooked up into the sun. If you want to add a magnetic field. Not sure if you can mix pure inertial containment with a half disk though. I\u0027m don\u0027t really know in any direction though. If that is like a pure solar sail concept it may be possible to get similar or better distances. I wonder what balance of burn vs potential radioactive materials would be needed. Or could you go back to pure recycled low end helium in the sun itself to get acceleration? Don\u0027t you just need as long a burning power source as possible then?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, could an ort cloud between the solar sail and the light source amplify the light like a lense to increase thrust? then it could be a laser amplifier and a potential recycling method.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if all of your material is radioactive decay or other parts of the fuel source or adds to thrust, you can get the empty weight down to basically nothing as it will eventually be fuel.

Hydrogen powered with fusion/fission hybrid with some sort of light source and a lens if needed to amplify. I was presuming you could use a magnetic held fusion hydrogen/helium plasma source if it\u0027s efficient as a light source. Or maybe because it\u0027s efficient mass wise. You could also possibly hold a gas lens to save on mass if that is possible as you already have the material. Or a water based lens,\u00A0if it\u0027s powerful enough, as it\u0027s minimal potential extra mass in the form of oxygen(I assume it will take a lot of oxygen though(here in lies the atmosphere concept again to save on storage tank weight) or other material. This could be made with the fusion reaction if it can be controlled and stuck between the light and sail. And with a smaller sail you could make similar very light lenses going near the sail if needed. I\u0027m sure I\u0027m missing lots of stuff here. This looks too easy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;text-indent:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;text-indent:0px;\u0022\u003E\nAnd as mentioned earlier water could be frozen into ideal forms. Including as a form to keep the sail physically in the correct position/curvature for ideal light contact. Unless that risks ripping or something. with enough lenses even a weaker light source could be made strong enough. This could also mean a lighter reactor/battery in the flashlight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;text-indent:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;text-indent:0px;\u0022\u003E\nIf the sails are optimal with other light an atmosphere could be between the lens(es) to filter light with the lenses. Not sure if you would want to carry the water or convert the oxygen into water. I assume you could limit the storage means though. Especially if the lights are in place at all times. Could you keep the light low enough, or additives to the water to keep it\u0027s melting point high enough to avoid the light melting it? Salt might help. Or would we then have some nice radioactive material to stop melting?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;text-indent:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;text-indent:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/25123/how-to-raise-the-melting-point-of-water\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/25123/how-to-raise-the-melting-point-of-water\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;text-indent:0px;\u0022\u003E\nIf there was a way to increase pressure maybe you could increase the melting temp so you can get more light. You could also increase it and use water in other layers. This could also go with compacting the gas in the first place to have enough to combine with the hydrogen for making water with oxygen if needed. this could allow stronger amplification of the light if needed potentially. You could aim for a smaller lense/gas area to save on mass projected out to the sail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess the sail could be right on the end of a cone with the water/ice/gas inside it. Then the hottest gas might be near the end to hold it taught. If you add enough lensing you could have ice at the start then water then gas/air at the end near the sail if you have the correct heat at each layer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could also do multiple sails going out from the cone if you have multipe light sources. If it\u0027s a magnetic contained plasma source you just need to get the fuel to it and keep it from touching or overheating the walls and previous sails. Then you could make a longer cone with more sails in it. depending on how much room you need between each sail. Each sale could then be bigger than the previous.(unless you use a straight tube) This could also give varried acceleration in new ways if you can turn them on and off. plus redundancy if you get a rip. Especially if you have a means for repair or replacement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m calling this a fusion/fission hydrogen/helium hybrid solar sail/flashlight/laser pointer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve literally just designed a ship the opposite of my ciggarette ion ship in ksp...

And, if you have a solar sail tube, you can put it on a surface instead of free floating to make it ideally shaped. This might allow more means to maximize pressure on the sail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would also allow you to potentially open one end of the tube to melt ice if there are ice asteroids and mine water in space. If you can open them all you could make a real giant laser pointer and the collect the results instead of shipping the water up. The innitial ship could be minimally fuelled with hydrogen/helium/water if that can\u0027t be mined also. Or use the nuclear fusion reactor to get to the mining source. The hybrid reactor might be good for initial transport around the system to gather materials until it can get to full power with a fully closed loop solar sail ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if you could simply rotate the solar sails by rotating a surface they are held to you could also decelerate easily in a tube/cone ship. Especially if there is no permanent equipment between lenses and the light source. although if you need equipment to contain a magnetic light source without wasting mass you might have slower deceleration from positioning. Unless being really close is that efficient. Then you don\u0027t need the lenses potentially. Or as much of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother possibility is one light source and sails that aren\u0027t fully solid. Then you use several of them one behind the other that pick up the slack as light goes through them. I\u0027ll assume this is only good if the overall design is lighter or the light is not straight enough and it catches more light. Then you have sails that are like a crochet blanket instead of a solid one. It might also work if each is designed to catch only certain light frequencies. Especially if they are clear accept for the frequency it\u0027s supposed to catch and don\u0027t block other light somehow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the sails are plastic and solid/stiff maybe they could act as lenses for the next light frequency(or if the sails each have multiple frequencies on each sail patched together) you could then get rid of the need for gas/water to save mass potentially. Each lense coudl be a flat surface or similar with a bunch of curved/bubbled color lenses to react to the different colors. Each then amplifying the remaining light into a different color behind until you exhaust the light source.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://weldtalk.hobartwelders.com/forum/equipment-talk/general-welding-questions/47721-helium-versus-argon\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://weldtalk.hobartwelders.com/forum/equipment-talk/general-welding-questions/47721-helium-versus-argon\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you need to repair stuff you could use magnetics and basically a plasma are welder concept to patch up holes in the ship if something happens. Depending on materials. either way you could create an arc welder. Maybe if you stick to just gas and recycle the gases throughout the closed loop tube with a fusion/fission hybrid reactor you could make a real arc bolt for a brighter light source.

At least hypothetically.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWait, why not make a ship designed to use electro static convert it to light and then power a solar sail? Maybe a really tiny probe. How long can you collect this in space? Heck could you also do this to power a laser in orbit to proptell it. You could combine everything to get maximum flight. Maybe use the sun a laser around earth or other places in orbit and then fly it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr better yet, put these around the solar system, and instead of flying straight, fly in an orbit to see how close you can get to the speed of light. If you are staying at a certain distance you just need stationed lasers to keep it going on it\u0027s path. then you can ditch any need for a light on the ship potentially. Although maybe you can also get rid of the downsides of having one and do both. This could get sun, laser, onboard power all working together. If not just sun and lasers. Or just sun if it\u0027s possible. A preliminary test could be done with a tiny solar sail with just enough to have optimal weight to speed for the equipment it needs and fly in an orbit to get as fast as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe in the long run ships could get to near or faster than the speed of light, if possible, going around the sun, the shooting off to their destination having used the sun to get up to speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would think this could be good for mars also. If you take a longer trajectory but use more speed could you slowly get to mars, avoiding the asteroid belt, and then capture it in a more or less spiral pattern?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other possibly options would be to recycle thrust and try to collect some of the oxidizer or a smaller fuel additive to make it run through the burn to get to use some of it a second time. If you are dealing with enough fuel a small efficiency could get more life out of something potentially. You have lot so heat and other elements to play with. Maybe you can make the engine recycle some things to extend tank size effectively.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEditx: In atmosphere on lower stages could you use the heat and other forces/pressures to force oxygen into the bell as an oxidizer. Why store it for the parts you are already swimming in it for. You could potentially extend the fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHypotheically, you could add some forms under the current engines and even use gimballing/positioning to help collect or even mechanically push fuel in a way to aid flight. If you pool it in this form and in areas inside the engine you might be able to get it into the thrust. And if you add some solid or foamy materials that can mix with the collection you could make that turn into a liquid and drip and mix with the thrusters of existing rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anything maybe it can even out gimballing burns and if anything is left help with small end stage burns. Maybe even after it separates. Uses would probably depend on how much can be collected and what types of fuel or additives can be made. Even if it\u0027s a small amount it might be useful for something. Like small deorbit burns or something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis cold follow the logic of taking a weakness and turning it into a strength. Anything you have to deal with by definition means you have more information collected on it from doing so. This could lead to better things to adapt to utilize as you may find solutions more quickly or more correctly. So take all resources you normally deal with and utilize them. Whatever causes the biggest problems you technically know how to generate and could hypothetically find a source of fuel or something else. It\u0027s also potentially what exists around you in the most abundance to utilize.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-01-20T12:28:16Z\u0022 title=\u002201/20/2021 12:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 20, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
