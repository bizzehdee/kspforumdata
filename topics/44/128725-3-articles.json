I personally don\u0027t think we will ever see a person launched on a used F9-v1.1-FT. However, I firmly believe we will see a person launched on a reused Falcon 9 first stage. We may only see v1.1-FT boosters be used again a handful of times, and after a lot of inspection. This is not because re-use is not feasible, but because re-use will likely come to fruition in an F9 v1.2.

But SpaceX is not the kind of company to throw their hands up and say, \u0022This one didn\u0027t work! It can\u0027t be done!\u0022. I mean, the current recovery system is so far removed from how they originally thought about how to get a booster back, it\u0027s crazy. In the first flights of Falcon-9 (1.0), the used parachutes! Version 1.1 only came about because they had to nail RTLS/RTDS, because the parachute method was not viable. You may remember, that they released their plans for a flyback booster\u003Cstrong\u003E after\u003C/strong\u003E the F9 v1.0 had flown twice.\u00A0Even their ascent profiles have changed significantly over the course of the operation of the vehicle, presumably, because they dissect the in flight data from their load cells, and adapt to assure the minimum possible air-frame stress.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLook at the CRS-7 failure for two points.\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E1.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EDisintegration of the second stage did not mean first stage failure.

They have a much better platform for GTO missions than Centaur, because of the immense savings in gravity losses from their high thrust stage, but they are not in the same league for GSO, because of their short coast time, and high \u2206V fraction spent on initial ascent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh, ok, I see what you mean now. You are completely factually wrong then, BTW. The F9\u0027s second stage \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E take the coast and relight to make the full GSO insertion, as the one on v1.2 was tested to do so in the very last flight. It made the news, even, right at the end of some of the more in-depth articles. And Centaur is not a \u0022high thrust\u0022 stage, it is a high \u003Cem\u003EIsp\u003C/em\u003E stage, which means it has \u003Cem\u003Eless\u003C/em\u003E thrust if anything. It also has heavy insulation, and leaks fuel as it makes the climb to GSO, like any deep cryogenic tank, and of course has a relatively awful mass ratio compared with soft cryogens like LOX, or storables that can get crazy tankage mass ratios.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222344494\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022128725\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221451639744\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022143381\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022fredinno\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, fredinno said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan\u0027t SpaceX use a STAR motor, or make their own Kestrel-derived Post-boost stage for GEO Missions?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo need to, the Merlin has a great capability to restart multiple times, and they should get little to no boiloff.
