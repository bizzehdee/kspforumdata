It\u0027s not hard to get above it. The gravity turn optimizes the ascent, going up initially for a small amount of\u00A0time and then turning over, gaining both horizontal and vertical speed, and eventually almost all of the gains are horizontal. Having to add that vertical portion increases Delta-v by large amounts, as well as having to burn engines for long periods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might also start turning a bit early for safety reasons so an fail will not hit pad or complex. This is also\u00A0important in KSP hard mode as our rockets are less reliable, however they tend to fail in other ways, mostly loosing boosters than engine fails.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
