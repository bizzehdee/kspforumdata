well, in space you get a slight boost to power since there is a vaccum on the outside. also, a long cannon is heavy, and weight is a huge concern, even in sci fi. if the barrel doubbles the weight, why not half the length and get 50% more cannons?. a recoilless rifle could be better due to it not affecting the orbit, but it would restrict loading and then also the combat eficciency of the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qsVIiAG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qsVIiAG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei\u0027m no engineer, so lots of stuff is overdimentioned or underdimentioned, but the bore diameter is on purpose. a huge bore helps with the short barrel length. the sabo round would be burried deep inside the cartridge/shell in a perforated flash tube surrounded by solid fuel, so the barrel is effectively a little longer than it looks since the projectile starts further back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei havent covered the autoloader here (it obviously cant be manually loaded), but i imagine it being an arm that lifts the new shell up to the cannon while catching the remainder of the spent shell for storage (we dont want unnessecary debris do we?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eammo: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe obvious choice for a cannon on a space warship is a heavy penetrator projectile as it is the hardest to intercept (if you use a shape charge, why not just use a missile? you loose some penetration ability and a lot of survivability for the projectile. versus a hardned, armoured target you would obviously prefer a tungsten penetrator, but that is hard to get and is maybe unnecessarily heavy. hardned steel should do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe sabo doesent have to be discarding since its only job is to accelerate the projectile and there is no air resistance. the sabo would have to be made from mild steel, aluminium, copper, lead or maybe tin. it just needs to be able to gyrostabilize the whole projectile. the sabo should discard on impact, if it stayed with the penetrator it would defeat the purpose of a penetrator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei might have overdimentioned the penetrator a tad, it could probbably do with being a lot smaller.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JDFfD18.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JDFfD18.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei\u0027m not covering the turret this would be mounted on either as that is common amongst most sci fi weapon systems.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T10:51:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to add to this the issue of heat, heat dissipation is a real problem in space where there is no atmosphere to allow for convection, all heat dissipation is via radiation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI bring this up because directed energy weapons will generate a lot of heat which has to be removed, radiative heating would be slow and having a store of gas to pass over the hot elements of a laser to then dump into space would limit the number of times the laser could be used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA mechanical weapon with solid projectiles would not get anywhere near as hot, even the heat from a heavy machine gun barrel in space would be manageable, so having to deal with heat from such a weapon would not be a concern.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, an energy weapon would dump a lot of heat into your target, but a tank round can also cause a lot of thermal trouble to whatever it hits due to the extreme velocity of the impact.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ravener","CreatedById":44766,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T11:08:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027d like to add to this the issue of heat, heat dissipation is a real problem in space where there is no atmosphere to allow for convection, all heat dissipation is via radiation.\u003Cp\u003EI bring this up because directed energy weapons will generate a lot of heat which has to be removed, radiative heating would be slow and having a store of gas to pass over the hot elements of a laser to then dump into space would limit the number of times the laser could be used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA mechanical weapon with solid projectiles would not get anywhere near as hot, even the heat from a heavy machine gun barrel in space would be manageable, so having to deal with heat from such a weapon would not be a concern.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, an energy weapon would dump a lot of heat into your target, but a tank round can also cause a lot of thermal trouble to whatever it hits due to the extreme velocity of the impact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe heat from the cannon is easilly dissapated with some heat pipes, the issue at the recieving end however are pretty dire as it is concentrated on a pretty small area. it it was to hit a fuel tank it would not only vent the fuel, but also bring a large amount of it to quite high temperatures. if it hits the crew compartment (assuming there is one) the overpreassure would be the greater problem, that would probbably also rupture any liquid holding tanks when i think about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit also turns out that a cannon is an eficcient way to accelerate a projectile. it is lighter, cooler, more reloadable and more reliable than a railgun and a LOT cooler than a laser (temperature).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-26T11:11:11Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2014 11:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ravener\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rtxoff","CreatedById":107622,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T11:09:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat about the propulsion method of the projectile?
