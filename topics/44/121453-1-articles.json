Both are pressurized with helium. There\u0027s a valve coming from each tank, with a servo motor on it. Both feed into a rocket nozzle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou want to fire the engine? Send power to both valves. Turn it off? Cut the power, springs close the valves. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is as simple as it can possibly be. Well, not quite, a single tank with a single valve is simpler (monopropellant) but there is less performance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can wait for years in between engine burns. You can lose power to the capsule and do the burn if you ever restore it. It\u0027s reliable and will get you home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure, cryogenics have better performance, but the complexity is much greater. More complex tanks, there\u0027s a vacuum insulation layer that can fail, the valves have to be made of high quality material, and you need a cryocooler, heat radiator, and always on power source to keep the liquid cold. Or, you constantly lose propellant the longer you wait. That\u0027s a negative, no competent aerospace engineer is going to sign off on that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kibble","CreatedById":131042,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-23T02:23:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat would the point be?
