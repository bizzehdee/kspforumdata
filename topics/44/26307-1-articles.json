In Fukushima, on the other hand, there was almost no damage to the primary containment system, and only water used for cooling was released. The biggest part of the core is still safely inside, cool and contained.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to radiation levels and long-lasting effects, what many people have said: a few months after both accidents, there are no people subjected to significantly dangerous levels of radiation. And right now there are people studying how to turn Chernobyl into a natural park, since the lack of humans is doing so much good to the animals on the area. The Japanese case has a much higher population density, so perhaps more people have been bothered, but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a big deal co pared with keeping the nuclear fuel safely contained.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune. The biggest radiological damage at a global scale, however, probably comes from the extra coal plants that got built as a response in the following years, so it\u0027s hard to judge.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-11T11:27:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EChernobyl was an epic disaster.

The region in which any leaked radiation might actually be potentially harmful is miniscule compared to the size of the Fukushima exclusion zone. Japan, on a worldwide scale, has relatively low background radiation compared to many other places which makes for great headlines when you express the rise in percentage terms but a tiny numbered multiplied by 2 or 3 is still a tiny number. Only through absolute dose is a meaningful comparison achieved and when you look at Fukushima in this regard, things look a whole lot less bad.\u003Cp\u003EI, for one, doubt that the headline \u002250% of Fukushima Exclusion Zone less radioactive than Cornwall\u0022 would have sold too many newspapers. Natural background radiation can easily reach 5\u002Bx the 20mSv experienced within much of the exclusion zone with no statistically significant increases in health problems amongst the populations within those regions as a result. On the other hand, the hasty evacuation of the elderly and ill from homes and hospitals in such regions can and did claim lives - actually the only lives lost that will ever be attributable to Fukushima.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is depressing to consider that nuclear energy gets such bad press, while fossil fuels go on killing at a rate of many times the number of people killed in the entire history of nuclear power every month! Why isn\u0027t that in the news every single day? Why are we going on building these things when we have an alternative that is orders of magnitude safer? It\u0027s absolutely insane policy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn many western countries, the UK, the US, Germany, debt is cheap right now. We have the perfect opportunity to make long term investments into energy infrastructure that will produce a solid return for the next 40 or 50 years while simultaneously decarbonising our energy sector. Instead, we\u0027d rather build cheap gas plants and tie ourselves into rising prices. It\u0027s bad economics, it\u0027s bad environmentally, it\u0027s bad for our welfare.
