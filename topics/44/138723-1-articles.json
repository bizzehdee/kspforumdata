No, they want to dive into the topic and explore what people have to say about it - including differing opinions and grey areas. And most of all, they want to meet and mingle with like-minded people. They want a social connection.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCompare a common KSP gameplay question: why does my rocket keep flipping?, accompanied with a screenshot of a rocket without fins. Would you answer this by telling the person to mount control surfaces at the bottom of the rocket, then ask a moderator to lock the topic since it\u0027s ostensibly answered? Would you supply a single-line link to one of the various rocket building tutorials along with a request to the person to stop being lazy and look it up themselves? No, of course not. Because neither of those answers is as good and as complete as multiple people chiming into explain about fins, about gimbaling engines, about following the markers on the navball and the importance of a proper gravity turn, about aerodynamic shaping, about center of pressure and center of mass, about how fuel flows in KSP and how you can temporarily lock tanks during launch to keep some mass further forward, about wobbly joints and ease or difficulty of piloting induced by attaching parts in various symmetry configurations, about manual throttle control and the concept of the sound barrier and the transsonic regime, and so on and so forth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImmediately the poster is exposed to a wealth of information that he never even knew was related to their problem, and would never have thought to look up on his own, because he simply didn\u0027t know it existed. Even if he only needs fins to fix his problem, he now also understands \u003Cem\u003Ewhy\u003C/em\u003E the fins fix his problem, and is armed with extra knowledge for when the day comes when fins don\u0027t happen to fix his problem for once. And immediately, the poster is made to feel welcome, because multiple people came to his thread for the express purpose of helping them out, sharing stories of how they had the same problem in the past, and hey, everyone goes through that phase!

I\u0027ve never placed people on my forum ignore list for something I\u0027ve read anywhere on the entire KSP forums, except for the Science forums - where the urge strikes me regularly, and the general browsing experience is vastly improved by doing so.

The alien megastructure thread is an example, and now we have two. The lead scientist basically said she does not thinks its aliens, and yet both titles create the alien perjorative.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean many of the threads mirror science fantasy, some do so by the very nature of the topic, for example the alcubierre warp drive s ience basically stems from an attempt to mak ST warp Drive workable. But the basic problem is that the tachyonic particles need do not exist,and if we created particles of them, as i learned yesterday, by definition could never exist much outside of quantum space. The science of many of these types \u00A0threads follows the humor of the actual fantasy, the infinite improbability drive. If this, that, the other thing could exist then we can do this. Having said that they do encourage further study, its just that some folks idealize function before theory can synthesize an actual credible functional model. I think the threads on fusion are particularly good for showing how difficult physics problems are solved.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceception","CreatedById":152800,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-02T11:01:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222554165\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138723\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462141951\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002227914\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 hours ago, Vanamonde said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuoth \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/59088-camacha/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002259088\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/59088-camacha/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Camacha\u003C/a\u003E, which began the following discussion.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/98962-streetwind/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002298962\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/98962-streetwind/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Streetwind\u003C/a\u003E Gave the best explanation!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-02T11:43:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222554289\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138723\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462144934\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002259088\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Camacha\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 hours ago, Camacha said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat would be a gross misrepresentation of the value of the forums.

Also while a lot of things regarding rocket science can be answered with a google search everything that goes into rocket engineering and making all your systems work together and how they all work is not something that be regularly be answered especially not when you want to apply it to specific circumstances.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis game has helped get so many young\u00A0people excited about space or at least more curious and I think that is fantastic. Some of the people here may eventually want to pursue careers involving space be it engineering or physics, sounding vehicle, space launch vehicles, satellites, deep space systems, etc and I think that is fantastic as well. I can sit here and help people better understand how certain systems, namely propulsion, work and function and maybe they learn something valuable from it, and if they do that can only be good. I honestly don\u0027t care much for the game itself, I haven\u0027t played it much in like 3 or 4 years, except for sitting near \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/31055-b787_300/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002231055\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/31055-b787_300/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@B787_300\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0and mashing the space key to blow up his rockets, but I think that having this subsection of the forum to talk with these people who are excited about space, real space, and real engineering is a great thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-02T21:23:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI propose we name it \u003Cem\u003EThe \u0022Science\u0022 Labs\u003C/em\u003E and leave it alone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-02T21:23:47Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2016 09:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by NovaSilisko\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-02T21:28:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222555020\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138723\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462181169\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002298962\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 hours ago, Streetwind said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould you supply a single-line link to one of the various rocket building tutorials\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes.\u00A0Well, not a tutorial, but the previous thread on the topic, and not out of annoyance at seeing the same topics over and over, but because when the exact same question is asked again, referring to the sort of valuable in-depth free-for-all\u00A0discussion that you mention is\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethe best answer\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003EI can provide\u003C/em\u003E.

That would be unneccesarily terse. However, dutifully responding with a long and detailed answer when the question was asked without any effort put into it at all is at least equally harmful. Like I said, fostering the inquisitive mind is much more valuable than simply providing answers. That has nothing to do with being elitist or rude. In fact, it is almost the exact opposite. As a community we have a responsibility to provide a pleasant environment in which all levels of knowledge are accepted, but where we also strife to educate people how they can help themselves find these answers. Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day, teach a man to fish and you will have a valuable and productive member of society. If you keep handing someone fish, however, he will not further himself, nor his environment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy steering someone towards of doing a bit of research himself, and then presenting the information and any questions that resulted from this search, is beneficial to both the question asker and the community. The skill to find sources and to evaluate the value of these sources is one of the most important and useful tools you can have in life. Being a critical thinker will pay dividends whatever you do. Meanwhile, having a steady stream of facts and information presented along questions also grows the community. Rather than just to provide answers, we also learn from our newest members, who in turn learn from the community. Everybody wins.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yes, I do notice the tendency that sometimes people simply want to one-up the next guy, without any interest in the actual knowledge. The community has the responsibility to display self restraint. Stroking ones own ego by showing off the knowledge one has is very tempting, but cuts short the process described above. The long story short is that we need to build that growing environment together. Together, we can help new and often young members find the information that interests them. Instead of just one forum providing answers, they could learn discover information on the entire web, unlocking a veritable torrent of new and wonderful facts and information. The beauty of a community is that members help each other and help each other grow in more ways than one. Or we could be Google for lazy people.
