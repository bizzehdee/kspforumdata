My calcs above slopped some stuff \u003Cem\u003Eup\u003C/em\u003E quite a bit for SLS vs Shuttle, and finally I wondered about engine costs, and why they are so high, so I assume much lower RS-25 costs than NASA pays, and I called the EUS a reasonable price at 60M (75% the cost of a Vulcan launch).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe SSMEs should cost at most what they did for Shuttle, but in 2020 dollars, so 200M for that.

Well, 5.4m Centaur apparently costs $20.5M, of which presumably 2/3 are the 2 RL-10 engines, so RL-10 are way cheaper than rumor had them, at only the same price as Be-4s. EUS has 4 of those, so EUS has $27M in engines, and that should be 2/3 of the stage cost.
