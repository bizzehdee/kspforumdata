However, it may be in the best interest of money to direct the blast, as then, it may take an mere 10 grams of anti-matter to reach Mars, and around a dozen tons for Alpha Centauri. These fuel ranges are easily within reach of our HLLV\u0027s, and so if we use anti-matter as a fuel, we will easily be able to send inter-stellar probes and take humans to Mars with less fuel, freeing up room for supplies and life support systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis, might mean we can possibly do MUCH more than previously expected.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"drakesdoom","CreatedById":57297,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T23:15:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThough the fuel is much more efficient if you want to bring people along you are going to need so much hard radiation shielding I think a fusion pulse drive would be better suited for interplanetary distance.
