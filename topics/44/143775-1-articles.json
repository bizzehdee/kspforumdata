Something to read to get familiar with this topic?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhat equipment do I need for starting?

There are so many different ways to go about with hobby astronomy, most of them expensive, if you just read other people\u0027s opinions online you\u0027ll have a hard time getting to what you want.

A good book that gives an overview covers the topics: what things are there to observe (how is the galaxy/universe composed), how are things mapped, (coordinate systems, measurements), our neighborhood, how to observe and document, optical/physical basics, instruments (which ones exist, how do they work), mountings (they are in some cases the most pricey part), technical hints. An extensive part is usually the orientation in the night sky (constellations).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t let other\u0027s indoctrinate you like \u0022only newton !\u0022, \u0022only refractor !\u0022 or \u0022only alt/az mounts\u0022. Such \u0022tips\u0022 are usually useless. I spent a lot of money on useless nonsense until i got what i wanted. Though that\u0027s expensive. If you\u0027re caught by the hobby you\u0027ll probably end up with more than one telescope for different uses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAstrophotography is the second step, when you\u0027ve had your first experiences, curses and frustrations :-)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDepending on your possibilities (money) and the conditions under which you will be watching plus your personal attitude like \u0022do i want to adjust on my own or just plant it and watch\u0022 influence your decision.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure many here will help you if you have specific questions :-)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: if you want to do it right and money is the limiting factor then i\u0027d say first read a book to get a feeling, then decide on spending money for a specific equipment. Furthermore i find that you\u0027ll have far more fun when joining others or letting others join you. Carrying 30kg out in the field in -5 degrees C needs enthusiasm.

There\u0027s a lot to see with only your eyes, though. If you go out soon after it gets dark, you can often spot at least a few satellites in orbit. They look like stars, but they drift across the sky over several minutes and don\u0027t have blinky lights like airplanes do. You can also find out on the internet when the ISS will be overhead. Several nebulae and galaxies are visible in areas with lower light pollution, although some are bright enough to be seen closer to the city. If you want to go for a telescope, you might want to start small if you\u0027re only going to be looking for basic stuff like the visible planets and the Moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
