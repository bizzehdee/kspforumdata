The first is that, with linear staging, you can get high specific impulse in vacuum by using vacuum-optimized nozzles. As an example of this, consider Falcon 9. The Merlin 1D engines used on the first stage of Falcon 9 have a sea-level Isp of 282s, and a vacuum Isp of 311s. The vacuum-optimized Merlin 1D used on the second stage, on the other hand, has a vacuum specific impulse of 345s, which is much more efficient. In KSP, where a good half of your burn to orbit is done in the atmosphere, it\u0027s reasonable to use sea-level optimized engines for the whole flight. On Earth, however, only perhaps a sixth of the burn to orbit is done in the atmosphere, making vacuum efficiency important. The second reason is that rockets in real life tend to have small upper stages, which aren\u0027t really practical in an onion configuration for structural reasons. The third reason is that onion staging (a.k.a. asparagus staging) in KSP usually involves fuel crossfeed, which we haven\u0027t really worked out how to do in real life. It\u0027s much easier said than done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, onion staging is impractical for a bunch of reasons that don\u0027t matter too much or at all in KSP but are very important in real life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-24T05:31:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNuclear engines in KSP are weaker than those in real life for balance reasons.

Specifically multiple re-starts, deep-throttling, and long run times were part of the design criteria. Timberwind was different kettle of fish with a set of different design criteria, pretty much none of which were met in reality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-03T05:17:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223479658\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022179218\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221541117293\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022190194\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022farmerben\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 11/1/2018 at 6:08 PM, farmerben said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reactor design of the NERVA is different in several important respects from a conventional power plant.\u00A0 It uses a different control rod mechanism and higher enrichment fuel.\u00A0 Still, lets consider the decay heat problem is roughly similar to what the people on quora are describing.\u00A0 This implies that a nuclear engine requires a cooling system that can dissipate secondary decay heat about 5%-7%\u00A0 of critical heat.\u00A0 If we have that type of cooling system, then we can shut off the hydrogen flow within about one second, before the reactor temperature has dropped significantly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe NERVA shutdown was supposed to take about 45 seconds. Afterward there would be a cooldown phase that would\u00A0span many hours (or a few days)\u00A0where there would be thrust pulses (something like a dozen or a hundred-something, depending on how long the main burn was)\u00A0as liquid hydrogen was run through the engine to carry off heat.
