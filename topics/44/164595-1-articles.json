Space is at 100km. A typical rocket only spends a few seconds in the lower atmosphere after it has passed Max-Q, so you want to optimize the cones for the long time you spend at subsonic speeds and low atmosphere. Their higher drag at supersonic speeds is insignificant above 20km as the air becomes so thin, aerodynamics matter much less.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-20T01:17:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRocket aerodynamics are lame.

A rounded nose cone might be marginally better, but will use more material and could be heavier, more expensive and harder to produce than a simple cone. In engineering, there is no single best design. Engineering is about meeting requirements, and each R\u0026amp;D team has different requirements. Therefore, an actual design is always a matter of compromise and defining priorities: performance, cost, schedule, pick two. This is why different engineering teams figure out different solutions depending on their different requirements, and some rockets are cones and others are ogives.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-20T03:37:23Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2017 03:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-20T04:22:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPointed is somewhat better in supersonic flow, but only if the angle of the cone is less than the Mach angle.
