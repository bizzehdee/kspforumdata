In that case, Blue Origin and LockMart are getting people tot he Moon, not SLS. If the vehicle that lands on the Moon doesn;t fly on SLS, then SLS was never needed in the first place. Orion is too big for SLS without enough capability. Even if SLS can get up to equal Apollo throw to TLI, SLS with Orion cannot do even Apollo. If the goal is to exceed Apollo with SLS, then even if we allow a 2 SLS architecture per flight to the Moon (which is fine), it should be cheaper than each Apollo, or we wasted our money considering that a rocket with 10-20% more mass to LEO might be able to do a lunar mission with the sort of capability we want. That\u0027s the clean sheet test. Given the goal first (whatever sort of lunar surface crew duration you want for X crew), what rocket/capsule/lander do you build? I\u0027d say the fixed variable after the people required on the surface and stay time are set is COST. If the all up in one cost would take a rocket that cost 5 billion every flight, and a slightly smaller rocket that took 2 flights cost 3 billion each flight (so 6 for each complete mission), the all up in one wins. If 10 launches of smaller vehicles costs 1.5 billion for the same thing?

In that case, Blue Origin and LockMart are getting people tot he Moon, not SLS. If the vehicle that lands on the Moon doesn;t fly on SLS, then SLS was never needed in the first place. Orion is too big for SLS without enough capability. Even if SLS can get up to equal Apollo throw to TLI, SLS with Orion cannot do even Apollo. If the goal is to exceed Apollo with SLS, then even if we allow a 2 SLS architecture per flight to the Moon (which is fine), it should be cheaper than each Apollo, or we wasted our money considering that a rocket with 10-20% more mass to LEO might be able to do a lunar mission with the sort of capability we want. That\u0027s the clean sheet test. Given the goal first (whatever sort of lunar surface crew duration you want for X crew), what rocket/capsule/lander do you build? I\u0027d say the fixed variable after the people required on the surface and stay time are set is COST. If the all up in one cost would take a rocket that cost 5 billion every flight, and a slightly smaller rocket that took 2 flights cost 3 billion each flight (so 6 for each complete mission), the all up in one wins.

Assuming Boeing were to develop their SLS based lander that would surpass LOP-G, that would leave only Boeing to develop their lander and the EUS, then we\u0027d be ready to land on the lunar surface. With the current mission architecture, we require LOP-G, however it only uses a few pieces of new technology like the AEPS engines being developed by AJ-RD, meaning LOP-G can be quickly developed and launched. Permitting quick development of Artemis, leaving only the lander and EUS needing to be developed (as per the earlier scenario), but in this instance, the lander can be developed by Blue Origin while Boeing develops the EUS leaving more of their budget to focus on the EUS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStarship is a great idea but without Super Heavy, they\u0027re just Delta Clippers that\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eone day\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0will glide before making a powered landing... something I remain skeptical of until I see it in small scale. Orion is ready for BLEO, Starship, is not. It currently isn\u0027t in any position to be ready for even orbital flight. Number of units being produced is great, but if they aren\u0027t ready to even enter LEO, then they can\u0027t compete. It\u0027s a larger Grasshopper. To begin to push SLS out of the launch market, it would not only need to have Super Heavy produced, but create a crew living space, life support, radiation shielding, and\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eabort modes\u003C/strong\u003E. Right now SpaceX is struggling to get D2 ready for it\u0027s only flight to orbit, meanwhile NASA, an agency with decades of manned spaceflight development, production and oversight experience is producing Orion. There may be mismanagement, but the vehicle is guaranteed to work to spec the first time since NASA has put it\u0027s best engineers and developers onto it. Those who have experience developing manned spaceflight systems.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso NASA can test a lunar lander in Earth orbit Apollo 9 style, which means it can be launched by any commercial launcher (Atlas V perhaps?), and if NASA was really determined to throw crew onboard, maybe they could work with SpaceX/Boeing to modify the docking node on their spacecraft to match that of the landers, and dock with the lander in Earth orbit, transfer crew, go out 100 miles, stop, turn back, redock and then return to Earth. It isn\u0027t in lunar orbit, but the only difference is radiation hardening. Even Apollo 10 only came within 10 miles of the surface, and we had little experience as to what challenges we had to expect having sent roughly a dozen spacecraft into deep space by the time Apollo 11 flew.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-15T20:34:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223705679\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022186560\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221573847292\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022103726\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ZooNamedGames\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, ZooNamedGames said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t trust anything from a political front since the current term is coming to a close and if the current administration has shown me, it\u0027s that you can\u0027t predict what they will do (granted that\u0027s always applicable to any administration).

At all. It\u0027s a tube with engines that can\u0027t even get off the pad by itself (with nothing else bolted on). Hopefully soon it will do a series of static fires. BTW, SLS Block 1, which flies soonest probably the end of next year, is ~95t to LEO (ref orbits for these numbers vary), and ~26t to TLI. Falcon Heavy, which is already fully operational is just shy of 64t to LEO and probably in the low 20t range to TLI. The number I usually see is ~23t to TLI. So for 150M$ we can send 88% of what SLS can send to TLI. 88% of the mass to TLI for 7.5% of the cost (and I\u0027m being VERY kind to SLS for the cost there).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d say that 88% of the cargo to TLI totally compares.

The core has to handle massively greater thrust, atmospheric heating, vastly higher accelerations, atmospheric pressure, atmospheric drag- EUS only deploys once in space, where most of the stresses on the core are absent. I return to my earlier comment- if such dumb boosters are so simple, why is NASA the only one with a completed lunar capable vehicle in 2020?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBlue Moon\u003Ci\u003E\u00A0\u003C/i\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ecould\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Elaunch on New Glenn, but that doesn\u0027t mean it will. If pressures mount, I don\u0027t see why Blue Origin would be against ULA launching their payload. Yes, it\u0027s money they have to pay to ULA that they could spend in house, but undoubtedly a half decent contract negotiator would be able to include that cash payment in any NASA contracts for developing lunar landers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the logic of \u0022SLS doesn\u0027t take us to the moon, Orion does\u0022 is utter nonesense. If a crew launches in a Space Shuttle and returns in a Soyuz, you don\u0027t say that the ISS carried them there, or the Soyuz. The Shuttle did the heavy lifting of crew into orbit, which is what is considered the start of a crewed mission. The ISS\u0027 crew habitation didn\u0027t start when it was launched, but when the first crews boarded the vessel. SLS is also the only SHLV capable of sending a vehicle\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Edesigned\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to operate BLEO. There are other vehicles that could go to lunar orbit (Starliner, Dragon 2, Soyuz moreso technically), but none of them are rated to operate in deep space beyond LEO. Meaning, until a vehicle designed to protect crews from radiation, operate in those kind of radioactive environments (yes, new digital technology is more resilient to ionized radiation, but not immune). A vehicle needs to prove it can withstand deep space radiation and not suffer a major fault in coding since ionizing radiation has proven to cause serious potentially catastrophic faults on the ISS and it\u0027s onboard equipment- radiation and issues in deeper space will only get worse, not better. If the fault occurs with a mission critical system, the whole mission goes under- and Orion is built to survive in that kind of environment- D2 and Starliner are not built to the same spec.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFH may have similar payload margins, but payload space is tiny, even smaller than that of the Atlas V. Eventually with payload sizes, you get to a point where the only way to utilize most, if not all, of the payload mass is by launching pure lead. A large payload margin is meaningless if you can\u0027t put enough spacecraft into the small fairing to utilize the size benefit. Not to mention, SLS at least has the promise of additional payload mass in the future once EUS is developed. FH is about as good as it\u0027ll get, price can drop, and maybe a ton or so of mass can be added, but SLS 1B and B2 will make those improvements moot.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat can Orion do that a probe can\u0027t? Uhhh... return man to the moon? Manned exploration? Manned vs robotic exploration is a completely different topic with completely different merits. To which, I don\u0027t think really belongs here in this thread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom what I\u0027m hearing- Boeing intends on making another SLS core just to launch their lander. Which has the promise of skipping LOP-G, but the cost of another core, the time it\u0027ll take to make it, and so forth. I don\u0027t really support that approach, as much as I like SLS- it isn\u0027t time conducive and doesn\u0027t utilize NASA\u0027s commercial assets. With that approach, the glory is largely heaped on only NASA and Boeing. Artemis should be a diverse and international (where reasonably feasible, ESA having proven to be a pain to get the Orion SM ready, but there are other nations that could develop NASA hardware). Artemis should be using all vehicles, ranging from SLS, to Falcon Heavy and the Atlas V. Though what will happen, is, as mentioned, up in the air.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI say small scale, because my business sense (which I know means piddle here) suggests that I should put a new theoretical landing method to test on something that costs \u0026lt;$1000 before I spend millions on a larger scale version, not knowing if it will even work aerodynamically. Musk claims it will work, and he\u0027s given us CGI video feeds of it landing, but neither are even using real aerodynamic modeling indicating what the forces are, on what part of the vehicle, what stresses are involved, is it stable, if so, at what speeds. For example, what happens if fuel sloshes, and it becomes unstable in it\u0027s intended configuration; what if it becomes\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0stable in a nose down configuration (a fair point, since it is basically a dart with moveable wings, but a dart becomes aerodynamically stable in a nose down angle, not with fins down like Musk is proposing). So I\u0027d like to see how it works with something small. Though progress is smooth, I am bearing in mind Musk scheduling, and adding a fair amount of time from whatever he claims.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nothing on SLS has flown yet\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nEngines are literally from flown Space Shuttle missions\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOrion SM engine was flown on a Space Shuttle mission\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSolid rocket motors are merely lengthened Shuttle boosters\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOrion flew (albiet in a basic framework) in 2014 on EFT-1\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOrion\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E has been flown multiple times on test flights\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nParachutes in drop tests\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nICPS engine is just a modified DCSS.

It\u0027s a first launch, not even SpaceX or Blue Origin reused their first engines, they impacted the oceans and were lost. Artemis is not about reuse- although, with the development of other technologies, for example, ULA\u0027s SMART reuse, that could be applied to SLS\u0027 main engines. However,\u00A0 reuse is completely irrelevant if it never flies in the first place.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003ESo I think SLS is more ahead of the game than you think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally I think Grasshopper looks better than all of the Starship mockups. They all look like they\u0027re gonna do an Atlas and collapse in on themselves in a strong breeze.\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EGranted, this is a personal opinion and I understand \u0026amp; respect that others like its look.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EArtemis 1 is a test flight to prove it can. I think it would be great to have crew, but if something did go wrong- NASA would be at the full brunt of government criticism for flying crews on a vehicle that\u0027s never been flown before. Some people still chastise NASA for flying crew on STS-1 rather than leaving it to a test launch. As a result, NASA\u0027s intent to appease, leaves it to test the vehicle solo. Artemis 2 puts the vehicle to task, get it to do things that a crew-\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0mission control want it to do. Crew may want to observe certain areas of the moon, alter their orbit to get precise altitude, speed or inclination. Yes, A1\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0do this, but crew operation is different from MC operation, not to mention the additional loads of crew operation, crew LS, and so forth. It\u0027s a lot more intensive on the vehicle than flying empty.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor Starship to compete still requires it to have Super Heavy since without it, it only reaches LEO. For delivering landers, Orion for LEO tests, or delivering space station modules, that\u0027s great- but without Super Heavy- SLS is operating in lunar orbit with Starship in LEO. If it\u0027s going to haul large stages inside, then it needs to prove it can support such large payloads since at that scale, new stresses and strains are imposed since (as I understand it)- payloads are mounted vertically, bolted down to the fairing base, but the taller you get, the more likely you are to have the payload shift off axis, meaning some sort of support above the base is necessary.

We don\u2019t have that luxury with LOP-G and it forces us to survive in an environment where the crew are the only ones keeping them from encountering for example, micrometeorites.

For example, the bottom of Orion where the heat shield and service module are attached will provide more shielding than other areas, and stowage bags can be used for parts of the spacecraft\u2019s interior with less shielding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-11-16T16:44:24Z\u0022 title=\u002211/16/2019 04:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 16, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by tater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-16T18:38:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey should take operation manuals for that purpose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-16T22:01:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223706070\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022186560\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221573929527\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129408\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerbiloid\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, kerbiloid said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022#\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/a\u003E \u003Cspan\u003EReveal hidden contents\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey should take operation manuals for that purpose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPrinted on polyethylene I presume?
