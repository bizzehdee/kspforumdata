The lighter the black hole the greater its surface gravity - and the more interesting the associated physical effects.

But you\u0027re right, it\u0027s even longer because it tends to grow bigger. By the way, here\u0027s a nice article about formation of supermassive black holes soon after the Big Bang : \u003Ca href=\u0022http://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.7787v2.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.7787v2.pdf\u003C/a\u003E . And it\u0027s even worse than you said (that was worse than i wrote before lol) ! Because it seems that these black holes have moved a lot around young galaxies, and caught a lot of matter directly in it without accretion disk. So they eat, and they used to move to eat even more matter, so it seems that Hawking radiation will start to evaporate black holes when there is few matter remaining outside of BH in the universe (that was the main hypothesis before Hawking radiation, BH are going to eat all matter, then bigger BH will \u0022eat\u0022 smallest ones, and then the universe will end as a BH containing all matter? Because it breaks thermodynamic laws, entropy should always grow with time).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway that means that even if it seems much too long to evaporate completely, i guess it\u0027s even longer because i don\u0027t take in account matter that fall inside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Hell yeah, a 200t BH would evaporate so quickly that it would be more like an interstellar nuke lol. Again, i just wanted to show that smaller BH are far more unstable (theorically) than big ones. And i have to tell again that it\u0027s only hypothetical, like naked singularity. To create the smallest BH, assuming 3dimensions of space and 1 of time, it would require 10^19GeV, for proton-proton collision, LHC can reach 14*10^3GeV, so not even in dream....It\u0027s been theorically calculated that with extra-dimensions though, the energy to provide would be far less because of extra gravitational energy provided (source : \u003Ca href=\u0022http://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.1780v2.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.1780v2.pdf\u003C/a\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, all these calculations are a bit useless because we can\u0027t prove them by experience at the moment, no one has ever prove the existence of small, micro and primordial black holes, and i guess we won\u0027t get an answer before a very long time....if we ever manage to get one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ZetaX : mathematics can seem \u0022nonsense\u0022, it is indeed when you can\u0027t prove them by physics, but i rely more on them than on \u0022guess\u0022 \u0022thought\u0022 or \u0022what should be\u0022.
