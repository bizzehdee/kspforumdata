Most of the Chinese and Japanese populations are atheists. Together they have most of the world\u0027s atheists, people rather different from the type of atheists we have in the West who are almost all apostates. Since the New Atheism began (ironically, with the writing of an important book, in 2005) it\u0027s had a measurable impact on the numbers of atheists and nonbelievers in the West, but the West in general is just a tiny fraction of the total human population.\u003Cp\u003EReally though, the facts are irrelevant.

As we are all devotees of the space program, we can all understand his anger, even if we do not approve of it. We all share his frustration at 40 years of regression, even if we do not agree on what caused it or even know the facts of the matter. Many of us may hold some form of religion close to our hearts, or at least take issue with openly criticizing it, but when a person is this angry, the force of his anger forces me to assume he was personally and irrevocably hurt by some form of religion. Even if we do not approve of that, or even support it, we must understand and respect it as an elemental force of nature.

In fact, anti-theism is practically a religion of its own. But when majority of the population are keeping various religious symbols and worship in their own ways, whether or not they go to specific temples makes no difference. They are religious people.
