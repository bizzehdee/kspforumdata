Specifically, I need to know \u0027when\u0027 \u003Cem\u003ESpace Odyssey: Voyage To The Planets \u003C/em\u003Etakes place. Specifically, I need to know if there is a way the \u0027grand tour\u0027 can take place with a launch date in the 21st century. Here is what I can find so far about the voyage depicted in the film:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe spacecraft \u0027Pegasus\u0027 is a fusion-powered vessel that begins its voyage with a 41-day trajectory to Venus, followed by another trajectory out to Mars. This is then followed by the spacecraft refueling in Mars orbit and then dropping to within 5 million miles of the sun, where it accelerates to nearly 300km/s. This slingshot takes it out to Jupiter where Pegasus endures a long aero braking manuver to get it on an elliptical orbit intercepting Io, where it enters orbit for a brief period of time before moving out to Europa, and then leaving the Jupiter system altogether. The vessel reaches Saturn and, after a less intense aero brake, enters a stable orbit in the Cassini Division before moving outwards to Titan, where it refuels and leaves for Pluto. After entering orbit around pluto the spacecraft returns to Earth (it also had a rendezvous with a comet but since said comet doesn\u0027t actually exist it can\u0027t be taken into account).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore info about the spacecraft: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/spaceodyssey/pegasus.shtml\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/spaceodyssey/pegasus.shtml\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EExtra rep for the first person to find a working planetary alignment and can hence put a date on when the events of the film take place.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GeneralVeers","CreatedById":148918,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-05T05:05:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPluto is a good way to figure it out: in the first episode, when the map traces out the ship\u0027s path and the planned flight path reaches Pluto, Pluto (yes, it\u0027s a PLANET, dammit!) is shown as having crossed Neptune\u0027s orbit a short but noticeable while before, perhaps ten to fifteen years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s right about where Pluto is today.

There is one problem: My current video-downloading software can\u0027t handle videos of more than 20 minutes or so, and the only clips from the film that have that part that I can find are 57-59 minutes long. So that leaves us with two options: Either we find a shorter clip from the film with the trajectory scene in it, or someone with better video-downloading software can download it and shorten it to just that scene, then give me the shorter clip file.
