For starters, the territorial limit is, and has always been 12 miles. However, back in the 1970\u0027s, the world agreed that nations could have an \u0022Exclusive Economic Zone\u0022 which extends 200 kilometres from shore, which means that any fish, oil/gas or whatever in that zone belong to that nation. Where two nations are closer that 200K then an agreement is reached so the zone border is exactly half way between the two. New Zealand, where I live, isn\u0027t that big, but thanks to owning Islands in the Pacific, we have the worlds fourth largest EEZ .\n\nNow... to the question... this is why missile Submarines were/are popular, especially during the cold war, they are hard to find, and if sitting off the coast, would only give the USA or USSR (at that time) \\*MINUTES\\* warning... the only consolation at the time was that the Sub would need to surface and prepare the missile for launching... if detected, well, they would be at the mercy of anyone nearby with a Destroyer or the like. \\*\\*POLARIS changed all that, however, the world first underwater launched ICBM, The USSR followed soon after with its own version\\*\\* \n\nProbably before your time, but this is why the USA objected to nukes being kept on Cuban soil, resulting in the \u0022Cuban Missile Crisis\u0022 (October 1962) These missiles would only have been 90 miles from US soil... which is further than any enemy sub, but these would have actually haver been harder to destroy or protect against than sub launched missiles.\n\nFor safety, most Soviet subs didn\u0027t get closer than 20 miles to the coast, in case they made a mistake and ended up inside US borders and triggering a war... at 20 miles, the USA would only have had minutes... Washington, New York, the Pentagon... were all at risk. The USSR was slightly better off, as Moscow is so far inland.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nEDIT: As for detection.... the USA had, for years, an underwater detection system called SOSUS... link here...\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOSUS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOSUS)\n\nExtending from Canada to Iceland to Europe .... and they also had them along the US coast line. This means no enemy sub would DARE come closer than the 12 mile limit.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-16T22:26:43Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2015 10:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by kiwi1960**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T22:40:58Z","Content":"In practice, non-US missile submarines are usually deployed in areas where they\u0027re easily defended and quite far from their targets, sometimes referred to as \u0027bastions\u0027: Chinese subs are deployed in the Bohai sea, French and British in the eastern Atlantic, and Russian ones in the Barents and White seas.

Only the later generation SSBN\u0027s and missiles, which could reach the US from areas near the Soviet coast, were deployed in bastions. In fact, as the cold war wore on, they tended to deploy less and less (Soviet SSBN patrols are generally accepted to have peaked in 1983 and declined sharply thereafter) instead relying on a \u0027surge\u0027 strategy in times of crisis.\n\nGiven their current status, it\u0027s not clear that the Russians are deploying their SSBN\u0027s that often, and nor does it appear they can defend them adequately.\n\nThe Chinese are not currently known to have ever actually deployed their SSBN\u0027s, nor are their missiles known to be operational. There\u0027s a lot of rumors and grave pronouncements of potential capability from US officials, but nothing firm from either side.\n\nThe eastern Atlantic does not, in the naval sense, constitute a bastion. There\u0027s not known to be any defenses or standing defensive patrols or sensor networks.

ICBMs are, as the name implies, ballistic. In other words, they follow Kepler\u0027s Laws. Mid-range ones tend to have pretty high apogees, because that reduces dV requirement. So they spend all their time in the slow part of their sub-orbital trajectory. Fifteen minutes just doesn\u0027t give you a lot of range with ICBM. Typical inter-continental times are closer to 30m, and that\u0027s the sort of thing you need to have for global coverage with a \u0022few\u0022 subs."},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T23:35:41Z","Content":"I was always more curious of how they actually hit satellites with a missile to begin with.
