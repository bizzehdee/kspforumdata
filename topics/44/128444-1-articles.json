Be warned, This has little, But existing and convincing evidence for it, This is why im keeping it a hypothesis, insted of a theory. (note, unless you give credit, if you mention lots of things from this, it will technically be plagurism.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe beggining: Before the beggining (yes, before), there was dark matter, and dark energy, The dark matter was evenly split into matter dark matter, and anti-matter dark matter. (think of it as little packets that only interact gravitationally of matter/anti-matter) When enough dark matter is in one place, and is stimulated by dark energy, the dark matter will turn into matter/anti-matter based of weather its an anti-matter packet or matter packet.\u00A0 When this happens, a white hole spawns, than spews out that matter/anti-matter. Luckily for us, Most of the anti-matter packets hasnt been spewed up, but enough matter packets spewed out for galaxies, stars, planets, moons, asteroids, dust, etc. The first white hole was the one that caused the big bang, It was ALOT of matter-dark matter in one place stimulated by a load of dark-energy. This was the beggining.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe end: Because white holes have spewed out most of the matter dark matter, there is only anti-matter dark matter left. This stuff. Will be the stuff transformed into anti-matter when white holes spawn. Eventully, once ALL the dark matter has spewed out via white holes, there will be an equal number of anti-matter and matter particles left in the universe. Eventullly these will annihalate and spell E N D for the cosmos.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn addon to this hypothesis is that when matter and anti matter annihalate, they simply go back into there dark matter form, ready to be stimulated again and restart existance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-22T19:44:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027ll have to work on this a bit more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe that currently most accepted model states that there was no before the beginning.

It is already well known what comprises them and what happens when they interact.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMatter and antimatter are simply different types of stuff that can be formed from the various elementary particles. I\u0027d call them forms of matter, but uh... naming problems. Both consist of quarks, antiquarks, electrons, positrons, etc. which have all been observed and studied, and when matter interacts with antimatter it produces a flurry of photons and other bosons, plus sometimes some leftover matter and antimatter debris. On the other hand, no mechanism has been observed by which (anti)matter can be converted into dark matter or back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the topic of white holes, not only is there no observational evidence, but the laws of physics that govern black holes only produce their opposite - white holes - as a mathematical artifact, which the same laws of physics also prohibit. To start with, any large collection of mass (which both matter and antimatter have) in a tiny space will have positive gravity that causes it to draw things in. In order to blast out cosmic quantities of matter, the object would have to either be so dense that its own gravity would make it a black hole (and thus fail to expel anything at all) or be some sort of entity that continuously converts dark matter into matter (which as detailed above is currently outside the realm of Science).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLast, observational evidence of the universe on a large scale doesn\u0027t point to galaxies being spawned from localized white holes, but rather all originating at a single point. In fact the data point very strongly to the origin of the universe being a very, very small and dense region of space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLong story short your hypothesis is very imaginative and would make for a great sci-fi origin story or mythological creation legend, but it\u0027s unlikely to apply to this reality, even compared to many of the other esoteric ideas out there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-23T06:44:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the beginning, there was a Word.
