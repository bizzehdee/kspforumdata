Beyond that, since all jet engines eat air at \u0026lt; 0.3 Mach and many fighters use complex variable geometry inlets to slow intake air, it\u0026#39;s probably possible to make an electric ducted fan that would produce thrust at up to Mach 2-2.5.

The main reason we\u0026#39;re not doing that is because while the payload is useful compared to the cost of the flight, it\u0026#39;s also not very large, meaning you will need to fly a large number of times to amortize the investment... a larger number of times than with conventional planes. Additionally, you need multiple electric planes to move the same volume as a conventional plane can - even if they are amortized and running very cost efficient, this creates additional ground crew and hangar overhead, as well as putting additional strain on airport capacities.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSince all of this makes airlines unlikely to be motivated to buy all-electric planes, no company has yet stepped up to try and build one for real (although multiple manufacturers are running research programs right now). However, as battery energy density grows at a steady 5% year over year (sometimes even exceeding that), the payload capacity of such a hypothetical plane continues to increase year over year as well, as less and less of its own weight is taken up by batteries. Right now I think I heard Elon Musk quoted that such a plane would require 70% of its own weight in batteries, but in 10 years, it may only be 30%. I\u0026#39;m fairly sure we\u0026#39;ll start seeing such planes come to the market by then.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs for the question of how fast it can fly - I\u0026#39;d like to ask: how fast does it [I]need[/I] to fly? Supercruising is ideal for getting passengers across the oceans, but cargo likely doesn\u0026#39;t care if it is in flight for 5 hours or for 10. Additionally, intra-country flights are too short to really make it worth pushing for supersonic flight, and any supersonic overflight of any populated area at all is going to face massive regulatory issues because sonic booms are [I]loud[/I]. Even planes supercruising at 15km up and higher are very audible, while conventional subsonic planes at that altitude fall below the threshold of human hearing. The Concorde wasn\u0026#39;t allowed to break the sound barrier until it left the continent behind, IIRC, because of the sheer noise level that produced. So I would wager that for the largest part of flights - 90% and up - our planes are going to stay subsonic for the foreseeable future, even if we switch to all-electric propulsion.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-18T10:14:18Z\u0022 title=\u002211/18/2015 10:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T10:09:08Z","Content":"\nAirbus have actually built an E-Fan plane.
