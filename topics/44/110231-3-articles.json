I suppose it also might be a little \u0022early\u0022 to send of lander, we need to identify promising landing spots first, and determine whether the Europa \u0022geysers\u0022 were real or not (unfortunately, right now it looks like they were probably just a transient cloud of water vapor following a small impact).\n\u003E As a KSPer, I have to wonder why we couldn\u0027t send an orbital with a radar and powerful cameras and spectrometers, and identify the best landing spot, and THEN drop the lander down to the surface, all in one mission? If it\u0027s in a polar orbit, every spot on the surface is accessible, though the delta-V requirement to land is a little higher (at the least because of Europa\u0027s rotational speed, 32 m/s at the equator).\n\nOrbiting at Europa is very complex due to the radiation levels-it\u0027s tough to get the actual instruments hard enough, and you can\u0027t meaningfully shield them while still allowing them to function."},{"CreatedByName":"ChrisSpace","CreatedById":140622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T06:03:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Pff. Two billion dollars is only 1/6th the cost of a *Gerald R. Ford* - class supercarrier. Uncle Sam\u0027s just cleaning out the couch cushions.\n\nIIRC the Apollo, space shuttle and ISS programs were in the $100-200 billion range\n\n\u003E \n\u003E What are the DV requirements for Enceladus?\n\nDepends how fast you want to get there. For a 2 year voyage the Dv is about 50km/s. (Source: *Human mission to the outer solar system: designs and implementations*)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Any actual scientist will tell you that what you need is a good solvent for the given temperature range. At 300K of typical Earth life, you need pretty strong bonds in things like DNA and complex proteins to hold them together against thermal excitations. And to break these apart, you need a strong, polar solvent. Water is by far the best option, and the only available one that\u0027s naturally abundant. So at terrestrial temperature ranges, life means water.\n\u003E \n\u003E  In contrast, if you are at less than 100K, such as on Titan, hydrogen bonds are frozen solid. Your complex molecules will be held together by van der Waals forces. A polar solvent would ript that stuff to shreds, and no life would be possible. Fortunately, there are non-polar solvents, such as liquid methane. So if we are talking cryogenic life, life means liquid methane. And that makes Titan a perfect place to look for cryogenic life.\n\u003E \n\u003E  Granted, life at high temperatures has huge number of advantages. There are more potential energy sources, all of the processes are faster, and you can dump excess entropy way easier. Which means life will be more complex and far further evolved on Earth than it could ever be on Titan. I would not expect anything past simplest bacteria there. Something similar to Earth\u0027s Archaea.\n\u003E \n\u003E  So finding life on Titan would tell us two things. First, that our definition of \u0022habitable\u0022 is a bit too narrow. Second, that two planets within a single star system have developed completely different life independently. And while former has very limited impact, because planets/moons like Titan are unlikely to ever produce complex life, that second statement is extremely powerful.\n\u003E \n\u003E  We live on Earth. Which means odds of us finding life on Earth are 100% ab initio. There is no way any species could ever find itself in a barren star system. Which means that us knowing that there is a habitable planet here is absolutely useless. Even if there is just one in all of the universe, we\u0027d be on it. But two planets? Odds there being very few habitable planets out there, yet there being two, so vastly different, in our star system are minimal. If we find life on Mars or Europa, we\u0027d still have to figure out if it had the same origin as life on Earth. For all we know, it did. Panspermia isn\u0027t very appealing on global scale, but within confines of a single star system, it\u0027s quite plausible. But if we find life on Titan, we know it didn\u0027t come from Earth. We know it\u0027s not contamination from one of the probes. Life on Titan cannot exist in water, and life from Earth cannot exist on Titan. Simple as.\n\u003E \n\u003E  If we find life on Titan, that\u0027s two data points from which we extrapolate a very simple fact. When you look up into the sky and look at the stars, more of the stars you see probably have life than don\u0027t. There is nothing we can find on Mars or Europa that would be anywhere close to this impact.\n\nLife on titan, indeed, would be a greater discovery than on mars or Europa. However Europa is closer and easier to get to. To get to titan you need more Dv, Heat shields, Parachutes, and the knowledge you can\u0027t have a cheap-ish sample return because of the thick atmosphere. Europa has a very high potential, and even if its life came from earth millions of years ago, it still is alien life as it has spent millions of years adapting to its environment and becoming a new species.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://www.planetary.org/press-room/...t-Request.html](http://www.planetary.org/press-room/...t-Request.html)\n\u003E \n\u003E  It\u0027s Official: We\u0027re On the Way to Europa.\n\u003E \n\u003E  President requests $18.5 billion for NASA in 2016, an increase of $519 million.\n\u003E \n\u003E  Posted by Casey Dreier\n\u003E \n\u003E  2015/02/03 02:55 UTC\n\u003E \n\u003E  NASA\u0027s Mission to Europa May Get More Interesting Still.\n\u003E \n\u003E  Posted by Van Kane\n\u003E \n\u003E  2015/04/11 21:08 UTC\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest...teresting.html](http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest...teresting.html)\n\nWait, the American government actually wants this?
