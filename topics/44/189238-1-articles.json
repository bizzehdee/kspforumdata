Not sure if there is any correlation to burning fuel at hotter temperatures to use it longer as it relates to strength (unless you\u0027re trading strength for endurance). Yet perhaps there is! If a scifi humanoid\u0027s body could run hotter before overheating maybe they could do superhuman feats without gorging massive amounts of food. Although their clothing may catch fire though... so there is that downside. And they will likely be glowing too, long before they actually start vaping away to cool down. Which would do little good.

I would say that the great apes count as humanoid and they\u0027re (on average) much stronger than humans. Animals - including humans - with defective \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myostatin\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emyostatin\u003C/a\u003E expression have increased muscle mass and are consequentially stronger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI fail to see the connection between strength and gestation time - gorillas, for example, have a gestation period of about 8.5 months.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn general, to use your rocket analogy, muscle output is limited by propellant flow rate and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E rather than combustion temperature.

Once that\u0027s used up, they\u0027re dependent on glucose transported by the blood.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDifferent muscle fibres are also set up to metabolise their \u0027fuel\u0027 in different ways. Broadly speaking, fast twitch (high output, short duration of output) fibres rely more on anaerobic (without oxygen) respiration for their energy which is quick but inefficient. It results in lactic acid buildup in the muscles which (if I remember rightly) is what is happening when you get a stitch. Slow twitch fibres (lower output but much longer duration of output) rely more on aerobic (oxygen using) respiration, which is way more efficient but also slower.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOxygen supply can be improved by improving oxygen transport. This is why athletes will take EPO (erythropoietin) - it stimulates red blood cell production. More red blood cells, more haemoglobin in the blood, better oxygen transport. It\u0027s also why certain athletes will train at altitude - their bodies respond to the lack of external oxygen by producing more EPO naturally, in order to increase oxygen transport through the blood.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL:DR.\u00A0 Strength is a function of muscle mass. Muscle mass can be increased through training or by pharmaceutical intervention (anabolic steroids, myostatin blockers) and, with proper training, the human body can make proper use of that increased muscle mass. The great apes demonstrate that \u0027superhuman\u0027 (if 5-6 times stronger counts as superhuman) strength is possible within normal metabolic and physiological parameters. Beyond that, we\u0027re moving into sci-fi territory - more on that later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-24T08:05:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we\u0027re talking about actual \u0022superhuman\u0022 strength - that is, a level of muscle power that\u0027s definitely well above what the human body should physically be capable of - then your body mass limits you in various ways. Having more weight is actually an \u003Cem\u003Eadvantage\u003C/em\u003E, and often required to make super strength work at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThrowing punches and kicks has less to do with strength and more to do with body mass than you think. True, you can just accelerate your fist to ever higher speeds... but there\u0027s a limit to that, based on how quickly your muscles can contract and extend. You have super strength, after all, not super speed! Though those two would not be entirely unrelated... Anyway. The reason we have weight classes in boxing and similar sports is because the physical mass of the arm or leg you throw at your opponent makes such a huge difference in the impact energy that it becomes completely unfair to let a lighter opponent fight against a heavier one. Actual strength is a secondary consideration. So if you had super strength but normal weight, your ability to make use of that strength in unarmed combat would be severely diminished. In fact, you\u0027d probably want to skip punching and kicking styles entirely in favor of wrestling styles, where you go in and grapple/pin your opponent, or perhaps throw them. That would let you make use of more strength, in ways that are harder to counter.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUsing melee weapons also lets you use your full strength, since you can just pick up a really heavy one! ...Or can you? Hmmm. What happens if you pick up something really heavy and hold it away from your body? Your center of mass shifts forward. If the object is heavy enough, or held far enough away from you, then it doesn\u0027t matter if you can effortlessly lift it... you will simply tilt and fall over! The heavier your weapon gets, the closer you must hold it to your body in order to stay on your feet, which becomes an issue when you realize that you actually want to guard against your opponent\u0027s attacks, or swing in their direction. Now, if you were really heavy, then you would not have that problem... but the question was super strength at normal weight. And that definitely has this problem.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt doesn\u0027t stop here, either. Because when you do swing such a weapon, you get into another physics concept that super strength cannot counter without having matching body mass: inertia. Swing your giant buster sword like Cloud from Final Fantasy 7? You have strength enough, but the sheer inertia of the swing will yank\u00A0you clean off your feet. Your own body has too little inertia of its own, and your soles do not have the grip on the ground they would need to counter that force. Grip is another thing that increases with body mass. If you continue upsizing your strength and weapon without upsizing your weight, you will eventually encounter a point where trying to swing your weapon will leave the weapon stationary while your body swings in the opposite direction instead.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s an interesting trick you can pull off with super strength, though. And that is making yourself heavier by carrying more stuff. Try a super-heavy suit of armor that weighs several times\u00A0as much as you do. No normal person could wear this, but you can. And suddenly, your weight multiplies. Your heavily armored limbs have\u00A0a huge mass, and you can throw devastating punches and kicks. Your center of mass is harder to shift away from you, so you can hold heavy weapons comfortably. You have significant inertia and downforce, so you can swing heavy weapons without worrying about becoming unbalanced. All while also enjoying the protection that super-heavy armor would give you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for energy output and heat: yes, that would also be an issue. It is in fact an issue in nature all around us, one that life has had to tackle wherever it exists. Any given creature has a given number of cells, each giving off a certain amount of heat. The creature also has a surface area, which rejects heat. As the creature gets larger, the amount of cells (and thus heat produces) scales up far more quickly than the surface area, resulting in ever-increasing difficulty to stop overheating. To combat this, the metabolism of a creature runs more slowly the larger it grows, in order to produce less heat per cell. There can also be additional tricks employed to reject more heat, such as panting, sweating, or specializing for cold environments, but the rule of the thumb is that your own cell\u0027s heat output is tuned for your body size.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErgo, your human body has a metabolism rate that is tuned for your human body size and mass.

The more strength you have, the quicker you\u0027ll overheat.

There are two\u00A0kinds, actin and myosin and they\u2019re interleaved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActin is essentially a straight fibre, myosin is studded with protrusions. Think of three golf clubs in a bundle, shafts aligned, heads pointing outwards, 120 degrees apart. Now take a whole lot of bundles and arrange them end to end. That\u2019s a (very) rough picture of a myosin fibre.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen a muscle cell contracts, the actin and myosin filaments slide together, thus shortening and thickening the cell. Each\u00A0myosin head\u00A0grabs\u00A0onto the nearest actin filament,\u00A0moves it a short distance, and let\u2019s go.\u00A0The cooperative effect of many many myosin heads working together, many times a second,\u00A0causes that sliding movement mentioned above.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCrucially, that sliding movement is one way only - the actin/myosin system works like a molecular ratchet.

Maybe the shape of those heads could be changed to give them more of a lever effect, thereby producing more muscle contraction per cycle. Maybe we could have a completely different system for generating movement. Think of a rubber band for example - the more you twist it, the shorter it gets.

Having more weight is actually an \u003Cem\u003Eadvantage\u003C/em\u003E, and often required to make super strength work at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThrowing punches and kicks has less to do with strength and more to do with body mass than you think. True, you can just accelerate your fist to ever higher speeds... but there\u0027s a limit to that, based on how quickly your muscles can contract and extend. You have super strength, after all, not super speed! Though those two would not be entirely unrelated... Anyway. The reason we have weight classes in boxing and similar sports is because the physical mass of the arm or leg you throw at your opponent makes such a huge difference in the impact energy that it becomes completely unfair to let a lighter opponent fight against a heavier one. Actual strength is a secondary consideration. So if you had super strength but normal weight, your ability to make use of that strength in unarmed combat would be severely diminished. In fact, you\u0027d probably want to skip punching and kicking styles entirely in favor of wrestling styles, where you go in and grapple/pin your opponent, or perhaps throw them. That would let you make use of more strength, in ways that are harder to counter.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUsing melee weapons also lets you use your full strength, since you can just pick up a really heavy one! ...Or can you? Hmmm. What happens if you pick up something really heavy and hold it away from your body? Your center of mass shifts forward. If the object is heavy enough, or held far enough away from you, then it doesn\u0027t matter if you can effortlessly lift it... you will simply tilt and fall over! The heavier your weapon gets, the closer you must hold it to your body in order to stay on your feet, which becomes an issue when you realize that you actually want to guard against your opponent\u0027s attacks, or swing in their direction. Now, if you were really heavy, then you would not have that problem... but the question was super strength at normal weight. And that definitely has this problem.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt doesn\u0027t stop here, either. Because when you do swing such a weapon, you get into another physics concept that super strength cannot counter without having matching body mass: inertia. Swing your giant buster sword like Cloud from Final Fantasy 7? You have strength enough, but the sheer inertia of the swing will yank\u00A0you clean off your feet. Your own body has too little inertia of its own, and your soles do not have the grip on the ground they would need to counter that force. Grip is another thing that increases with body mass. If you continue upsizing your strength and weapon without upsizing your weight, you will eventually encounter a point where trying to swing your weapon will leave the weapon stationary while your body swings in the opposite direction instead.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s an interesting trick you can pull off with super strength, though. And that is making yourself heavier by carrying more stuff. Try a super-heavy suit of armor that weighs several times\u00A0as much as you do. No normal person could wear this, but you can. And suddenly, your weight multiplies. Your heavily armored limbs have\u00A0a huge mass, and you can throw devastating punches and kicks. Your center of mass is harder to shift away from you, so you can hold heavy weapons comfortably. You have significant inertia and downforce, so you can swing heavy weapons without worrying about becoming unbalanced. All while also enjoying the protection that super-heavy armor would give you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for energy output and heat: yes, that would also be an issue. It is in fact an issue in nature all around us, one that life has had to tackle wherever it exists. Any given creature has a given number of cells, each giving off a certain amount of heat. The creature also has a surface area, which rejects heat. As the creature gets larger, the amount of cells (and thus heat produces) scales up far more quickly than the surface area, resulting in ever-increasing difficulty to stop overheating. To combat this, the metabolism of a creature runs more slowly the larger it grows, in order to produce less heat per cell. There can also be additional tricks employed to reject more heat, such as panting, sweating, or specializing for cold environments, but the rule of the thumb is that your own cell\u0027s heat output is tuned for your body size.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErgo, your human body has a metabolism rate that is tuned for your human body size and mass. If you wanted to put out a lot more energy than a typical human though, in order to have super strength, then you would\u00A0not be able to reject that waste heat. The more strength you have, the quicker you\u0027ll overheat. If you had more body mass, this would help keep you in the fight longer, because your surface area increases slightly, and your temperature increases more slowly due to simply having more raw matter to heat up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow.

If your center of mass moves outside the area spanned by your feet, you will fall over regardless of strength, unless your foot is somehow gripping the ground. And since you only have two feet, that area would always be long and narrow. No good if you\u0027re trying to lift, say, a concert piano without crawling underneath it first. To lift something big, you\u0027d have to find its center of mass, get a handhold right underneath it, and lift straight up. Otherwise, you\u0027d be throwing yourself off balance and falling over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut your grip on the object in question is a difficult matter too. Not all materials are rigid enough that they are practical to lift as they scale up. Imagine trying to lift a beached whale, for instance: You can lift up a small corner of blubber if you find a good handhold, but the rest of the whale would still sag and rest firmly on the ground. And if you tried to drag the poor whale by gripping its tail fin and pulling with your super strength, you\u0027d be more likely to tear off a hand-sized chunk of the fin than to move the whale anywhere. Actually, due to the grip issue not even that would happen - you\u0027d simply pull yourself towards the whale instead, as it is a lot more firmly anchored to the ground than you are. Now, not all heavy objects are whales, but even seemingly rigid objects behave somewhat like them on a larger scale. Try lifting a car by its side mirror, for instance, you\u0027d just tear it off. Try pulling a Superman and lifting a plane with your bare hands - the plane\u0027s hull would just buckle around them. And lifting a building would be completely out of the question. Your average flimsy LEGO building is much, much more rigid relative to its size than a real-life building is. No matter how you gripped it, without carefully placed supporting structures you\u0027d just tear off a chunk. If you try to lift very heavy things, you have to ensure that the piece you\u0027re gripping is solid enough to carry the entire weight of the object.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA secondary ability that would be required for practical super strength is also super durability. For instance, say that you try to lift one of those cartoon weights of one ton lying on the floor in front of you. You\u0027d probably tear your arms off before you got the weight off the ground. Pulling a tree out of the ground? Same story. That tree is a lot more firmly anchored to the ground than your arm is to your shoulder. You can\u0027t win that tug-of-war by strength alone. Of course, this assumes you manage to brace against something, otherwise you\u0027d just pull yourself towards the object instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen for really heavy objects, you\u0027d run into problems with the ground itself. If you somehow were to find the center of mass of an airliner, had a convenient and sturdy handhold to grip, and you were solid enough to handle the load, you still wouldn\u0027t be able to lift it over your head and walk down the road with it. Then the entire mass of that airliner would rest on your foot, which would be similar to balancing your entire weight on the point of a knife. You\u0027d step right through the pavement and sink into the ground until the airliner came to rest on the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah, with super strength you could probably be better at throwing things (although the recoil would knock you off your feet) and doing slightly more heavy taks than a regular human, but physics would limit how much your ability would scale up. Don\u0027t expect anybody to be able to hold back a jumbojet from taking off or lifting trucks over their head with one hand or anything like that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-24T22:24:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223694043\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022189238\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221571939438\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022197504\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spacescifi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, Spacescifi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for chimps, being I read somewhere that they may be stronger but lack endurance.
