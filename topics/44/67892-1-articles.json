Once these pieces are in place, delivering fuel, water, air, parts, and at least some of the food to the Lunar Orbital Station can be almost as cheap as delivering them to LEO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPutting it all together, conservatively, you get crew and perishables delivered to the station at about 1/10th of the cost via way station, and non-perishables, which is most of the supplies, at about 1/50th compared to direct launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll save enough to cover costs of the way station in under a decade of operation, and seeing how it\u0027s something we can use for various Mars missions as well, there is just no contest. Way station is way better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WestAir","CreatedById":59115,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-07T04:34:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was told that, \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eand someone will correct me if I\u0027m wrong\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E, but I was told that the moon has these random pockets of intense gravity.
