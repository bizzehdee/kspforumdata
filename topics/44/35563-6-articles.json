I think the angle differences you can start seeing at 5 seconds onwards might just be reactionary as whatever is causing the rocket to go off course is already having a great effect by that point. I was paying close attention to the flames and not the angle of the rocket. It looks like it is already off course in the first few seconds. By 5 seconds in, that one nozzle is probably just attempting course correction. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis doesn\u0027t really rule out the guidance system, but my earlier analysis doesn\u0027t seem to apply.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
