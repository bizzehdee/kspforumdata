We present global glacier projections, excluding the ice sheets, for shared socioeconomic pathways calibrated with data for each glacier. Glaciers are projected to lose 26 \u00B1 6% (\u002B1.5\u00B0C) to 41 \u00B1 11% (\u002B4\u00B0C) of their mass by 2100, relative to 2015, for global temperature change scenarios. This corresponds to 90 \u00B1 26 to 154 \u00B1 44 millimeters sea level equivalent and will cause 49 \u00B1 9 to 83 \u00B1 7% of glaciers to disappear. Mass loss is linearly related to temperature increase and thus reductions in temperature increase reduce mass loss. Based on climate pledges from the Conference of the Parties (COP26), global mean temperature is projected to increase by \u002B2.7\u00B0C, which would lead to a sea level contribution of 115 \u00B1 40 millimeters and cause widespread deglaciation in most mid-latitude regions by 2100.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a lifelong fan of the Cascade Mountains, this makes me incredibly sad. There is nothing quite like climbing around or even camping out on a glacier. Descending on a rope into a crevasse is an unforgettable experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-06T23:38:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome ski hills will be running into trouble\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DGood bye, glaciers\u201D \u00A0[repeat two more times to the tune of \u201CGoodbye Sunshine\u201D]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-01-07T03:10:58Z\u0022 title=\u002201/07/2023 03:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 7, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by StrandedonEarth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"farmerben","CreatedById":190194,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-07T13:43:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.7C by 2100 is a lukewarm scenario.\u00A0 There are two ways to look at it, we could hope to slow down the melt, which is hopeless.\u00A0 Or we could work on increasing the snow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Codraroll","CreatedById":163815,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-09T09:43:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224216349\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022211347\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221673048317\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002289439\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022StrandedonEarth\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 1/7/2023 at 12:38 AM, StrandedonEarth said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome ski hills will be running into trouble\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWill be?
