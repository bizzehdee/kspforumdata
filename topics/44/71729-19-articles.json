That\u0027s why it gets only 1 hour 30 minutes of light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Philae is almost vertical (as reported earlier), but not perfectly parallel to the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 2 legs are touching ground, one is most likely in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- They can still move lander using the flywheel. They\u0027ll probably try to reorient the lander for better exposure to the sun light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- They still don\u0027t know an exact position of Philae\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- First jump: 1:50, 38cm/s acceleration, up to 1km altitude, 1km distance, Philae was slowly rotating during this jump. They know exact location of first touchdown, less than 100 meters from ideal point. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Second jump: few minutes, around 3cm/s. Comms link was lost 30 minutes after the touchdown, Philae stood still.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Cometary nucleus scan was successfully completed. It\u0027ll help estimate position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Today signal link was perfect after locking it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- This evening, around 7:30 they\u0027ll get new contact window and upload new set of commands to the Philae.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Currently Philae is near the side of a crater - probably on a rim - that\u0027s on a southern lobe of the comet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- They\u0027ll release full-res images to the public after the meeting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Surface of the first landing side is covered with dust and rocks (from small to several cm in size).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Rosetta performed flawlessly and the Philae descend trajectory was amazingly accurate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- They got a nice sequence of descend photographed by Osiris, where you see the Philae slowly rotating and a shot of Philae right next to 67/P. And one very nice, well exposed photo of Philae on it\u0027s way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- First landing spot is flat like hell...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Rosetta/Osiris photographed the area around original landing side hoping to find Philae. They\u0027ll keep on taking additional photos trying to find it, got 2 strong candidates for possible landing locations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQA session:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u0022Cliffs\u0022 are very low density. They can\u0027t really say if it\u0027s a crust or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Bounce could be caused by hitting a higher strength surface right under a very thin layer of dust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Lander can jump by extending the landing gear. But in current position they wouldn\u0027t dare to operate it without knowing the position exactly. Most likely they won\u0027t be able to analize the consequences of such jumps before running out of power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Drilling without being anchored is dangerous, they might just tip over. They have to analyze the situation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Drills and harpoons will not be activated in coming hours. They will go through experiments from least risky to most risky. They might try something tomorrow. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- They have some flexibility, hoping to optimize position of the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Solar panels are not damaged\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- They don\u0027t know how long primary battery will last. Noone knows what happens after tomorrow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Speaker highlights that we can\u0027t talk about a failure - this mission is an amazing success, they\u0027re doing things that are on the edge of what human kind can achieve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Thanks for reading, feel free to click \u003Cimg src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/buttons/reputation-40b.png\u0022 alt=\u0022reputation-40b.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVideo for those who want to see the whole thing: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://new.livestream.com/ESA/cometlanding/videos/67965864\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://new.livestream.com/ESA/cometlanding/videos/67965864\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-13T14:59:03Z\u0022 title=\u002211/13/2014 02:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Sky_walker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andersenman","CreatedById":61273,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-13T13:44:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI still struggle to understand the orientation ... the image with the pictures arranged around the lander, is it a top view or a side view?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-13T13:45:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a panorama with Philae digitally inserted.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
