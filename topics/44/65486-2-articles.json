The LEM was tested in conditions very close to its final use, but not quite either. Spirit and Opportunity also vastly outlived their intended livetimes. My point is: You don\u0027t have to test things for the time they will be operating for, and most of the time, you can\u0027t. You can merely design them in such a way that they will survive the expected stresses for a given ammount of time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-12T16:38:14Z\u0022 title=\u002203/12/2014 04:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SargeRho\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-12T16:56:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SargeRho\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SargeRho\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt could be useful two-fold.

We do not know what happens to transistor type electronics over such an extended period of time in a hostile environment. Our oldest anecdotal evidence is a little over 60 years old and that is hardly comprehensive. We know little about what to expect when it comes to the external factors of the interstellar void and we do know even less when it comes to our own equipment. We are pretty much clueless.
