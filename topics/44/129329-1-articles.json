Intuition tells the layman that the other end moves instantly, so the end of the pole on the other end of the solar system will receive a force faster than light (and then the universe would explode?).\u003Cbr\u003E\nReally the layman\u0027s intuition is an illusion caused by the fast speed of sound. When you push on, twist, or otherwise manipulate one end of an object, the other end will not react until the mechanical stress has propagated all the way through the object - and it does this at the speed of sound in that object. Since this is very fast, particularly in the case of a steel rod where it\u0027s significantly faster than the speed of sound in air, the rod \u003Cem\u003Eappears\u003C/em\u003E to react instantly. Really, what\u0027s happening, as can be verified with an extreme high-speed camera, is that the rod is squishing and flexing like a big floppy noodle, or a slinky that someone\u0027s flicked at one end, and a wave is traveling along it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo with the giant steel rod, you\u0027d grab one end and run off with it (in your EVA suit or whatever) - feel free to go quite a long distance: compared to the rod that distance will be rather small - and you\u0027d create a huge wave moving along the rod at the speed of sound (again, in the rod). For real materials, the speed of sound never exceeds the speed of light (even for Unobtanium ;P ), so the other end not only would remain still for several minutes, but due to the flexibility of the rod would have no trouble traveling below the speed of light and gradually shifting over to where you wanted it to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-05T21:31:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGuys, your explanations are not relevant.

The question is, can the end of the stick break the speed limit of c?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile the answer is still a \u0022no\u0022,\u00A0it is because of a different reason. Even if your stick is very strong (but still flexible) and angular acceleration is low enough to not cause the break in the stick, the end of the stick will still never surpass c because as any mass approaches c, its mass increases and approaches infinity, so it would take an infinite torque to swing a stick and break the c barrier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-06T04:28:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n^ Yes, all of the this.
