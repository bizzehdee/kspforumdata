It\u0027s a pretty average launcher who can be outperformed by a Proton in most aspects. But it\u0027s a Russian-built rocket using completely Russian-made parts, which means sanctions by NATO or the United States do not affect production of the launcher while it can have a pretty disastorous effect on others. Considering the recent crisis in Ukraine, Putin is making a very wise investment to be independent of other nations for space exploration or satellite launches.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-25T20:30:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t proton date back to the Soviet union? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably two issues here, 1) it has been upgraded with many western parts 2) some parts are made in Ukraine\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NASAFanboy","CreatedById":57300,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-25T20:35:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magnemoe\u0022 data-cite=\u0022magnemoe\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDon\u0027t proton date back to the Soviet union? \u003Cp\u003EProbably two issues here, 1) it has been upgraded with many western parts 2) some parts are made in Ukraine\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack then, Ukraine and the other nations were part of the USSR, so the Proton was self-sustainable.

Proton can only launch from Baikonur in Khazakstan, which the Russians are planning stop using over the next few decades. It is being replaced by the Vostochny site in the Russian Far East, but the trip from factories in european Russia involves many bridges and tunnels, which Proton is simply too large to fit through. Angara\u0027s modular design allows smaller diameter parts to produce an equally capable rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
