However, I want those to be as realistic as possible, and i\u0027m not sure if I made them to work correctly - I was never that good in physics or chemistry - so, I\u0027d like to discuss whether those disastrous outcomes would actually occur when in the right situation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2022 The main risk, and arguably the one who set everything moving foward, is when the planet\u0027s star, previously a red dwarf, suddently swelled into a red giant, consuming the inner worlds and causing the surviving ones to be burned into a crisp. The homeworld survived, but its temperature was far higher than normal, its plants have been withering away under the heat, the seas and lakes were drying up, and the ozone layer was being destroyed. In order to stop the chaos from happening, they created a force field to serve both as a makeshift ozone layer, and to hold up against the increased heat. This force field later ends up struggling a lot as the red giant continues to grow bigger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2022 Also in a bid to prevent the previous risk, they made artificial plant life to replace the previous one. Made to be far more resistant to the current climate *and* to filter hot air into cold air, they were spread across the entire planet to rebuild. Alas, even though it was a noble attempt, it did little to stop both the next risk and to calm down the population, which agreed that their homeworld was lost and that it\u0027d be better off to just leave. This ends up being the risk that destroys the world, as one of the leaders - there being six in total, due to the government being a technocracy - grows rabid and too attached to his homeworld, and takes control of the plants to \u0022assimilate\u0022 those who don\u0027t agree with him - at this point being everyone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2022 The final risk, while not exactly related to the star, was almost certainly caused by it. By mixing the tidal forces of the star with that of the homeworld\u0027s biggest moon, the result wound up being far, far more potent tidal forces storming against the homeworld, causing numerous cracks to open on its surface, releasing both molten lava and abominations which resided deep underground - and as they were primarily adapted to survive in such hostile conditions, the overground was easy prey for them, and became essentially an invasive species, taking over large swatches of land at alarming rates. The ravines also continued to crack open due to the relentless tidal forces, eventually taking down entire cities in the process. The planet was basically becomming swiss cheese.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis all sounds pretty macabre, but my abilities to make characters suffer is not the key point in here - and most of the plot would not take in that world, anyway. Would those apocalyptic scenarios actually work in real life, presented in appropriate circumstances, or they ultimately end up being fantastic and unrealistic?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-26T15:30:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHum.

So your impending doom might very well be a slowly swelling star, still far from full-fledged red-giant, creating a runaway greenhouse effect, increasing the acidity of oceans, thus killing plankton, which causes the entire biosphere to collapse in short order once some critical isolation level is reached. In the meantime, the climate swings will create plenty of natural disasters like supertornados and that kind of thing.

Stars don\u0027t go unstable at the drop of a hat. And stars unstable from the beginning, create a harsh environment for the life\u0027s development. Also, stars on the smaller end of the main sequence type have small ecospheres hugging close to their surfaces. Which means even relatively minor instability can become catastrophic with little warning. It\u0027s hard to imagine a civilisation able to survive on the surface of the planet from the hunter\\gatherer stage to space age in such conditions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah.
