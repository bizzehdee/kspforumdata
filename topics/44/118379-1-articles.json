We also expect there is such a thing as a binary planet, where two bodies of similar mass orbit a point outside the body of both objects, an example (if only they were classified as planets...) is Pluto and Charon.\n\nThis got me thinking, would it be possible for there to be a contact binary planets? If they were gas giants they would share an atmosphere, and probably have crazy weather and electro magnetic interaction. Or two water worlds could share an ocean. Or two rocky planets that are warped out of shape and touching, maybe with crazy volcanic activity.\n\nWould it be possible or is my imagination getting carried away? What effects would it have on different types of planets?\n\n![Barycentric_view_of_Pluto_and_Charon_29_May-3_June_by_Ralph_in_near-true_colours.gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Barycentric_view_of_Pluto_and_Charon_29_May-3_June_by_Ralph_in_near-true_colours.gif)\n\n![w-uma-binary-1.jpg](http://www.space-art.co.uk/img/full-sized/w-uma-binary-1.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Frida Space","CreatedById":60943,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T13:49:50Z","Content":"My guess is that gravity would want to make that thing spherical (a single sphere, that is).

Also, even if there was one, the term \u0022shared atmosphere\u0022 can be misleading: Charon would simply collect the N2 molecules escaping from Pluto (so not part of Pluto\u0027s atmosphere) and forming a very transient layer of gas which would be lost to space quite quickly.\n\nEDIT: Think of it this way; it\u0027s like finding a Martian meteorite on Earth.
