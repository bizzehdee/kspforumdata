There was no true grass form of them, their buttons were poorly edible.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe first mammals (we too) and reptiles were entomophagous, eating insects populating that dull green inedible bush,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs reptiles have more primitive body (no thermal regulation, primitive limbo joints, thight skin), they had short-term evolutionary advantages.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, they had grown up first and occupied the world.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs they were enough large, they could eat and digest poor inedble ferns - just as a cows does. A small animal quickly loses energy and cannot wait while its inner bacteria digest the cellulose, it needs more caloric food.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs they were too large, they needed and could eating large animals, not only insects.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, once a mammal appeared to be bigger than a rat, it became a lunch for a dino.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen flowering plants spread around. They produced much more fleshy and caloric buttons, which became an important food for all small critters, including the mammals.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSome of them appeared to be neotenic form \u2014 grass, and those spread especially wide and fast, almost at any place where something can grow at all.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA grass lives fast, dies young. Its button (and thus, seeds) makes a large part of the whole plant. So, when grass covered any empty place, small critters got a demographic burst thanks to such huge amount of food.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce small herbivorous mammals (\u0022rats\u0022) spread around, there quickly appeared small carnivorous mammals (\u0022ferrets\u0022), eating any creature enough small to be eaten: no matter, a mammal, an insect, a bird, or a reptile.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs mammals are homothermal beings, they hunted in the night when lizards and small dinos get cold and sleep, while big dinos just don\u0027t notice those miserable hoppers.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs a result, they have successfully eaten small reptiles and dominated in a small size class.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, they weren\u0027;t a direct danger for big dinos, but even the largest dinos have small eggs and small chickens - as a chicken by size and taste.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThus, big dinos couldn\u0027t protect their eggs and youngsters against this plague, and small mammals were a nightmare of their future.
