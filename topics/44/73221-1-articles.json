Then, sometime later, a meteoriod or another object crashed into Venus and put it in a retrograde orbit. I was wondering how such a thing would happen. Venus\u0027s current average orbital speed is about 35km/s (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/venusfact.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/venusfact.html\u003C/a\u003E). So, if Venus was in a similar prograde orbit, then it would require 70km/s of delta-v to change Venus\u0027s orbit, I think. If I am wrong, please correct me. What I really want to know is how big/ how fast a object would have to go to deliver that delta-v at once. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a similar note, I was also wondering the delta-v required to blast off a piece of mars and put it into a trajectory to intercept earth and land, like several meteorites have done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks everyone in advanced! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-24T05:17:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E...what?

It is then necessary only to account for a much smaller change in angular momentum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wish I remember where I read this, but apparently some simulations have shown that multi-body interactions with the other planets may be the cause, rather than an impact. Perhaps someone around here knows the details. There are also some other ideas, such as the manner in which the planet formed by accretion or interactions between tides and solar atmospheric heating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShort answer: We\u0027re not really certain why Venus rotates the way it does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince you got confused, lets work out the angular momentum of Venus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll pretend it\u0027s a uniform, rigid sphere.

Actual values can be somewhat lower if the meteorite spent a long time drifting and was sent towards Earth\u0027s orbit by multi-body interactions, or they can be higher. It should definitely be at least 5.021 km/s, which is the surface escape velocity of Mars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m ignoring atmospheric drag during ascent.
