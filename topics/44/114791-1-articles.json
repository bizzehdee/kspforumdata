Ie. could an induced voltage or an applied current be used instead of (or to augment) a pressure swing. \n\nWe are working on developing a proof of concept for a novel O2 concentration device. These things exist already; they typically use Li-subsituted Zeolites on a rapid pressure swing cycle to adsorb N2 out of ambient air and create a stream of relatively concentrated oxygen. Portable models can generate about 3 liters per minute of 90% O2. This patent [http://www.google.com.sv/patents/EP2485794A2?cl=en](https://www.google.com.sv/patents/EP2485794A2?cl=en) describes the current devices fairly well. We are planning on building a similar device but utilizing a different Zeolite, Cu\u002B Substituted ZSM-5, which has demonstrated great N2 adsorption characteristics, but has the added benefit of not using spendy Lithium. Adsorption isotherms and some other data on these Zeolites are here:\n\n[http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/jz100467w](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/jz100467w)\n\n[http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2001/cp/b009942m/unauth#!divAbstract](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2001/cp/b009942m/unauth#!divAbstract)\n\nSo back to my main question. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m wondering if there is a way to cause the N2 to desorb off the zeolite without using a pressure swing. The N2 adsorbs due to ligand formation with the Cu\u002B in the zeolite framework; could it be desorbed using a voltage swing or a current? I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve found literature that mentions electrical swing adsorption for CO2 scrubbers, but the electrical swing only works by creating heat, so it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s really a thermal swing. If anyone has a good working knowledge of this kind of thing (it is used for CO2 scrubbing and gas management on the ISS after all!) it would be greatly appreciated. \n\nSome background: I work in a medical research lab. The Gates Foundation has certain problem areas in healthcare that they fund research in. They focus on developing countries, particularly in Africa. One of the biggest healthcare problems in rural setting is maintaining supplies of O2. They\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve promised to fund (and I mean 6-7 figures kind of fund) further research into novel technology to cheaply and renewably generate O2 without using much power. Thus, my boss gave me this as a ridiculously ambitious side project."},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T16:07:52Z","Content":"Bit of a stab in the dark here but would laser or (probably cheaper) microwave desorption work?"},{"CreatedByName":"Businfu","CreatedById":116782,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T21:10:51Z","Content":"It\u0027s an interesting thought... do you have any theoretical reason why it could?

I figured that using lasers would be expensive (as you said) so wondered about microwave desorption instead. \n\nNot even sure if microwave desorption is a thing but my, kind of ad-hoc, theoretical justification would be that microwaves should provide enough energy to desorb the N2 without heating your zeolite (which you seemed to be looking for alternatives to). Microwave spectroscopy is all about rotational quantum states, so it would make sense to me that microwaves should be absorbed more by the N2 molecules (which are free to rotate) than the zeolite framework (which isn\u0027t).\n\nEdit - from a quick online search it seems that Microwave Swing Adsorption *is* a thing so might actually be worth reading up on more seriously.

It\u0027s an interesting prospect, and you are right there is quite a bit of literature out there. Most of what I came up with focuses on systems designed to pull volatile organics out of air, but that doesn\u0027t mean the concept couldn\u0027t be applied. Since you seem to have a solid background in physics I\u0027ll pose another question. I know microwaves themselves aren\u0027t very high energy, but how much energy does it take to *make* microwaves? Brief googling yielded that a home microwave oven runs on something crazy like 1200 watts. I don\u0027t have a good grasp of this kind of hardware.\n\n**SciMan:** Zeolite is a molecular sieve! It\u0027s like the first one listed on the wikipedia page you linked. I would assume that the nitrogen generator you describe actually uses Zeolite as well, or possibly active carbon. The whole issue is \u0027discarding the other components\u0027. Molecular sieves adsorb certain molecules into pores, but once everything is saturated, no more can be adsorbed. A pressure swing adsorbtion device removes the unwanted stuff by lowering the pressure which causes unwanted gas (N2 in my case, O2 in the automobile case) to vent out. \n\nInterestingly though, I found this article about capillary condensation of N2 on multiwall carbon nanotubes. [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp973319n](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/jp973319n). Unfortunately I don\u0027t have access to that journal at my institution. Can anyone else view it? I got a crazy idea about building a device that would use the capillary action in these guys to wick N2 out of a stream of air... but I have no idea if that\u0027s even how it works!"},{"CreatedByName":"SciMan","CreatedById":12748,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T17:09:55Z","Content":"Here I thought the molecular sieve actually let the molecules of gas actually pass thru it, but blocked anything larger from passing.\n\nSomething like how a Reverse Osmosis filter works (only water can get thru the membrane).\n\nThanks for correcting my misconception."},{"CreatedByName":"Businfu","CreatedById":116782,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T17:47:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Here I thought the molecular sieve actually let the molecules of gas actually pass thru it, but blocked anything larger from passing.\n\u003E Something like how a Reverse Osmosis filter works (only water can get thru the membrane).\n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks for correcting my misconception.\n\nWell that kind of thing does exist. For example dialysis tubing has pores designed to block cells and large molecules (read proteins) but allow small molecules like water and gas to pass through. The issue is that diatomic gasses like nitrogen and oxygen are too small and similarly sized to filter in this way. Briefly poking around on the webz I found that the bond length for N2 is 1.098A and in O2 it is 1.207A. I\u0027d guess the molecules themselves are very similar in size. \n\nBecause of this, you need some way of selectively attracting one and not the other, physically blocking is not enough."},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T19:38:28Z","Content":"I\u0027m not a physicist I\u0027m afraid - just a chemist with a decent general science background and a good poker face. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nSo I don\u0027t have much of a feel for power requirements either, although [this](http://www.microwaveresearch.com/index.php) website, seems to have some decent numbers and your 1200 watts looks about right. Not a problem in a lab or a hospital or anywhere you can plug them into a wall, maybe not as useful in the kinds of environments you might be looking at using them in.\n\nDoing some quick Internet digging, I found [this](http://www.urc.cc/pubs/URC-2002b.pdf) prototype air purifier which uses microwave-thermal desorption to regenerate the various beds. For CO2 and water, incident microwave power was reported as 300W, so maybe double that for required wall plug power to drive the thing. That\u0027s getting better but 600W is still quite a lot ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"}]}
