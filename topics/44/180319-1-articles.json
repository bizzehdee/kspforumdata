That program has literally no payloads being worked on right now. None. SLS is the rocket to fly Orion. Orion can do nothing by itself except go someplace to do nothing at all. Even when block 1b allows co-manifested cargo, it\u0027s to build a station... to do nothing. BY the time crew flies on it they will have spent what, 42 \u003Cem\u003Ebillion\u003C/em\u003E dollars on it (Orion has already cost 17 I think, and SLS about the same, and a few B a year until 2023 with crew). The point of course is that cancelling SLS/Orion doesn\u0027t mean 40 billion worth of awesome robots, it means NASA would simply have gotten 40 B$ less. The single best investment NASA has made in decades was the 396 million $ they spent on COTS with SpaceX. That\u0027s what produced the Falcon 9, and indeed SpaceX only really exists because of that small investment by NASA (and the following few billions in launches by contract).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe new CLPS program is designed to do the same.

If they drop further, this can enable science missions at lower prices, which IMHO would be a great thing. The current paradigm is that launches are expensive, and big payloads (and/or high C3) end up being made to the highest possible standard, since if you spend 350 M$ sending it to the destination, you don\u0027t want it to fail. If the launch cost is substantially lower, maybe the mindset can eventually become to send \u0022good enough\u0022 probes that cost vastly less money to fabricate, and hence the same budgets could allow more, and more varied missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IncongruousGoat","CreatedById":157062,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-05T03:37:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s also all the non-medical research that can only be done in an extended microgravity environment.
