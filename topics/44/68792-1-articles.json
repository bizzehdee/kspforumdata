It\u0027s really that simple. Another way to think of it, imagine a centrifuge that\u0027s already spinning. It starts out completely empty, vacuum, and you start filling it with liquid until it\u0027s almost completely full.

You are also correct with your above point that if any vapor is formed, it cannot have a negative pressure, so any hypothetical negative pressure in the liquid will be relieved by vapor formation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I don\u0027t think negative pressure is outright impossible. In a solid, negative uniaxial pressure is easy to achieve: just stretch your sample with a piezo. The amount of negative pressure you can achieve is very small, because the sample will break. Negative hydrostatic/multiaxial pressure is more difficult, but by no means impossible, just use more piezos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a liquid, in theory the same thing is possible. But void formation would kick in even sooner, because liquids are usually held together by weaker forces. To allow negative pressure you would need the energy of \u0027stretching\u0027 the liquid to be less than the energy of the void formation (whether that is a vacuum void or a void containing vapor). The former depends on the compressability and is going to be a large. The only energy cost I can think of for the void is surface tension, which is normally a much weaker thing. Worse, the compressability energy scales as the whole volume of the liquid (l^3), whilst the surface tension scales as the surface area of the void necessary to relieve the stretching (l^2). I don\u0027t know of any theoretical upper limits on the energies of surface tension, nor any lower limits on the compressability of a liquid, and I would be surprised if no such liquid was possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: further thought. I rather doubt that any macroscopic-sized equilibrium system can show negative pressure in a liquid, as it will always be unstable to formation of a single large void. I do think that a non-equilibrium state might be metastable, with no void formation unless nucleated. Because of the scaling laws above, it should be possible to achieve a system where small voids are unstable, and decay, but voids over a critical size grow rapidly and release the negative pressure. If the critical size can be made large enough, voids will not occur unless nucleated by an external peturbation (such as a high energy particle strike).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe above mentioned paper by Hahn indicates that this is certainly possible in a quasi-1D system, where the scaling laws will be different: l^1 and l^0 probably. I bet a literature search would show up 3D theoretical work at least.

I\u0027m more familiar with heating a liquid at constant pressure above its boiling point, but it can also be achieved by dropping pressure at constant temperature. The liquid needs a nucleation site to start the boiling process: a scratch on a solid surface that trapped some atmospheric gasses, a suspended dust particle with gas absorbed on its surface, etc. In the absence of a nucleation site, any bubble embryos that form in the liquid due to fluctuations quickly collapse again due to surface tension -- since the pressure difference across a surface due to surface tension goes as the inverse of the radius of curvature, the pressure difference pulling these nanometer-scale embryos closed is enormous. This situation can persist (again in the absence of nucleation sites) up until the limit of superheat, which can be predicted using an appropriate thermodynamic equation of state (thermodynamic limit of superheat) or kinetics (kinetic limit of superheat).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was a bit to the side of the original question asked, sorry. But it\u0027s kind of related an area I used to do research in so I have it on the brain. Metastable liquids and the limits of superheat have been studied experimentally for decades. Usually they\u0027re studied by heating liquids at constant pressure; a common apparatus is a column of heavy oil that is heated unevenly so that its temperature rises steadily from bottom to top. Then you can introduce a droplet of a lighter, low-boiling-point liquid at the bottom, and as it rises through the oil it gets hotter and hotter until it reaches its limit of superheat, and goes \u003Cstrong\u003Epop\u003C/strong\u003E! The beauty of the apparatus is that the droplet doesn\u0027t ever touch a solid wall when its superheated, so it doesn\u0027t come into contact with any nucleation sites there. (See Blander, Hengstenberg, and Katz\u0027s paper in J Phys Chem 1971, for one example. Katz and Blander had a number of papers on the subject.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, if you have a liquid that isn\u0027t anywhere close to its critical temperature (water at room temperature, say), you can reduce its pressure quite a ways before reaching the limit of superheat. In many cases the limit is at a negative pressure; the liquid is in tension. This situation wouldn\u0027t last for long, because the liquid will find a nucleation site on the walls of the container. But the situation of liquid in tension has been produced, I believe using acoustic waves (which don\u0027t last for very long, and can be arranged to focus on a region in the middle of a container).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally getting to the original question, talking about the boiling point in this situation doesn\u0027t really make sense in the first place! The boiling point is the dividing line between where a fluid at thermodynamic equilibrium will be liquid and where it will be vapor. But the fluid at negative pressure cannot be at thermodynamic equilibrium; while it is liquid it is in a metastable state, and as a vapor it must have a positive pressure. So the concept of boiling point loses its meaning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr at least that\u0027s my take on it, FWIW.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-10T04:23:10Z\u0022 title=\u002204/10/2014 04:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Mattasmack\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T11:21:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENegative pressures exist in certain situations.
