What we call \u0027breakthoughs\u0027 in our history is a result of scientific experiments that had been conducted to test some theory.

Scientists die out of old age without achieving their goals and we make a step backward. Seriously, the average human lifespan hinders the scientific progress now more than ever and it would only get worse. Progress is a complex thing, you can\u0027t get a breakthrough only in spacecraft propulsion without having similar successes in neighboring branches of science.

Then 6 years to Alpha Centauri\n\nMatter/antimatter drive? \n\nLets think about this. Assuming you have the technology to store antimatter (nope) using relativistic theory you would need approximately 10 times your payload to reach 0.1-0.2C to have enough energy to both accelerate and decelerate on arrival. 4 LY to AC means 20.5 years at 0.2C assuming you acceleration is no greater than 1g. \n\nAnd BTW that is something like 10 exajoules of power magnitudes and more power than humans have ever produced. Its not realistically possible. And this power is going to be utilized in an ion drive, one of the slowest accelerating devices we have at our disposal. \n\nWarp drive, worm holes and matter/anti-matter drives are something that Hollywood comes up because the reality of space flight is about 6 magnitudes to weak to have Shattner or Lorne Green zipping from planet to planet between tea servings. If we improved modern technology 100 fold, it would still take the entire time the human species has been on this planet to reach another potentially habitable world that would need to undergo eons of terraforming before humans could settle. \n\nYou want to get to the next star, make a long range probe, fill it with stable lyophilized microbes, put in some of the best engineered electronics and a really durable photocell and find a suitable target, 1,000,000 years later it arrives and does its job. You could do this for every goldilocks planet discovered. If the cannae drive works you can use the photocell to open solar panels and help guide the probe to its destination."},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T05:45:48Z","Content":"PB666, where are you getting these numbers from?

This is the worst it could be. That factor 10 sounds entirely made up. Which brings to question your ability to gauge other factors as well.\n\nFor the record, realistically, we can get up to .5 c/g if we can get it to lase, perhaps higher with other trickery, and there are free braking alternatives, such as Bussard Ramjet.
