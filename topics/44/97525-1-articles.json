Granted that standard candles and redshifts are fail-prone if lights emitted from a star in some phase behaving as a coherent light; but then, space is big, and even a few nanoarcsec of different direction would ends up a lot (guess a few of photons each square cm isn\u0027t really a coherent light anymore). Also, the problems within these methods itself (luminosity variability for standard candles, variable hubble parameter for redshifts) would yield a larger error than problem arises from a slower coherent light.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-23T16:27:07Z\u0022 title=\u002201/23/2015 04:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by YNM\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-23T16:37:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe speed of light through a medium is slower than that in a vacuum because the light is interacting with the medium, no?

When a wave propagates, it can diverge in different manners. In 3 dimensions, a wave that is NOT diverging is a plane wave. Its wavefront is planar. The wavefront progresses at the propagation velocity of that particular kind of wave. However, really you\u0027re never going to observe any true plane waves in nature, though many wavefronts can be approximated as planar. For sources far away, wavefronts you observe are usually going to be diverging spherically (but over short distances can still be approximated as planar- for example, if you climb a ladder at night, you should not expect the stars to become measurably brighter because you\u0027re closer to them). The magnitude of the wave will decrease by 1/r, thus meaning the energy in the wave will decrease by (1/r)^2, leading to the \u0022law\u0022 that the intensity of distant sources of light will decrease by a factor of 4 if you double the distance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, there are other ways that waves can diverge too, such as if the medium is bounded in some way. Imagine you\u0027re a whale. The sound waves you produce are bounded by the ocean surface (a pressure release surface with a reflection coefficient of -1) and the ocean bottom (a pressure doubling surface with a reflection coefficient of 1)- as long as there is not a thermal layer (which can also reflect sound). Relatively close to the whale, the sound the whale makes will diverge spherically, but at distances much beyond the distance between the sea surface and sea floor, you actually get into a cylindrical divergence regime. The sea surface and the sea floor acts as a crude waveguide, preventing the sound from escaping in three dimensions, and reducing the rate at which it decreases with distance. Instead of 1/r for the sound intensity, you get 1/r^0.5. Whales use this waveguiding effect to help communicate long distances. (In reality, I think I\u0027ve simplified this a bit and that whales actually frequently use two thermal layers or a thermal layer and the surface as the bounds for their planar waveguide, since the seafloor and sea surface are far apart and there is usually a thermal layer anyway.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy I bring this up is that because of this wave guide effect, the wavefront of the sound is NOT aligned with the sea surface- the wavefronts are bouncing between the top and bottom surfaces. This means that, transverse to the surface of the ocean, the sound is NOT propagating at the speed of sound in water. It\u0027s instead propagating at the \u0022group velocity\u0022. The group velocity is determined by the angle between the wavefronts and the ocean\u0027s surface. Only at 90 degrees is the group velocity equal to the speed of sound.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for the long, drawn-out examples, but the end message is that light is a wave, and the same wave theory rules apply. If the wavefront is not aligned with the group propagation direction, then the speed of the light-MEASURED IN THE GROUP PROPAGATION DIRECTION- will not be \u003Cem\u003Ec\u003C/em\u003E, even in a vacuum. I never considered that this applied to gaussian beams too (lasers emit gaussian beams), but of course it makes sense that it does. From what I\u0027m reading all this research group did was reduce the intensity and/or duration of the beam till it was a \u0022single photon\u0022, and noted that the group velocity remained unchanged. Whooptie-freaking-do. However, while the science is unimpressive (well, there is no real science), the usefulness of this paper is to help point out to people working on precisely pulsed laser systems that they should not blindly assume that the laser beam propagates exactly at \u003Cem\u003Ec\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be honest though, what I am still confused about is why the velocity would not be exactly \u003Cem\u003Ec\u003C/em\u003E at the center of the beam.
