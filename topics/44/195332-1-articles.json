Your first order estimate is going to be that the ship just collided with hard surface and bounced off. You don\u0027t care about the details of the interaction. You do care about energy lost, which is a function of angle of incidence and impact velocity. To get that, you might want to run a bunch of simulations for with different starting conditions and fit an approximation formula to the results. This is sufficient to start solving for fly-by trajectories and come up with candidates for near-optimal solutions. Once you have these, you start actually numerically solving for a flight through atmosphere and adjusting parameters - basically, it\u0027s just a multi-variate optimization problem at this point, so you\u0027d use a standard method.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou will need to factor in lift in your simulation for energy lost estimate function and in final optimization. Aerodynamic forces are conventionally split into drag and lift. Drag is component of aerodynamic forces matching direction of relative wind and lift is component perpendicular to relative wind. The equations for both are very similar Lift = (1/2)C\u003Csub\u003EL\u003C/sub\u003E\u03C1v\u00B2, Drag = (1/2)C\u003Csub\u003ED\u003C/sub\u003E\u03C1v\u00B2, where C\u003Csub\u003EL\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0and C\u003Csub\u003ED\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0are lift and drag coefficients respectively. v is velocity of relative wind.\u00A0\u03C1 is density of air. Both C\u003Csub\u003EL\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0and C\u003Csub\u003ED\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0are functions of angle of attack and of mach number (more generally, velocity, density, and temperature of air stream, but modeling it as just mach number is surprisingly accurate). Generally, very non-trivial functions, so you\u0027ll have to have some fit formula. Typically, these would be obtained from full aerodynamic simulations, but there are a lot of ways to get a back of the napkin estimates that aren\u0027t bad. That\u0027s a whole topic in itself, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo for the energy-lost simulation, I would probably select alpha for given mach number that gives you best glide ratio = C\u003Csub\u003EL\u003C/sub\u003E/C\u003Csub\u003ED\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0for given mach number and integrate flight through atmosphere with that for each choice of incident velocity and angle. Get your data, fit a formula, and use that to estimate energy-loss in your fly-by optimizer, treating each encounter with atmosphere as a hard, elastic impact. Once you have an approximate plane that works, you start simulating in earnest and optimizing all of your parameters, as well as making sure you don\u0027t exceed structural limits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: If you\u0027re doing this in KSP, your best bet for getting accurate simulation is just spawning the ship under conditions of interest and going for it.
