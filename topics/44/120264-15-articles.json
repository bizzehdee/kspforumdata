If it is, I imagine gaining dominance of the enemy planet\u0027s sphere of influence (killing enemy spy satellites and other probes, with adequate observation and coverage by your own spacecraft) would be for the ultimate goal so that you can send capsules full of nuclear bombs or something on orbit and threaten them into surrendering.
