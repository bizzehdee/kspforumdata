But to get a good view of them, you need to be in the dark (no bright lunar landscape, or Earth vistas, or lit up spaceship in your field of vision).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe extinction of starlight straight overhead is only a fraction of a magnitude, so you aren\u0027t going to see a whole lot more stars in space than you see from really dark sites on Earth. You can see maybe 6000 stars naked eye from Earth (if you are in an area that\u0027s dark enough...down to around 6th magnitude). Some people claim to be able to see 7th magnitude stars, and that would make about 20 thousand visible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBUT... I expect that the visors of most space suits or the windows of most spaceships would absorb as much light as the Earth\u0027s atmosphere does, so I wouldn\u0027t expect the view to be that much better from space. You will be able to see more stars from a dark site in space though because on Earth, atmospheric extinction of starlight increases as you look further away from zenith, but you won\u0027t have that limiting effect in space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-07T08:27:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe reason you don\u0027t see stars in most photos taken from space is because of photographic exposure. When you take a picture of a bright object (the Earth\u0027s horizon, the lunar surface, or another spacecraft), you set the exposure for the subject. This means that the backdrop (the dark sky) is underexposed and the stars disappear. If you\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can take pictures of the stars from space by setting the exposure on the dark sky. That\u0027s what telescopes do. But then, if you have another bright subject in the frame, it will be overexposed and the picture will be ruined. You would need to take HDR pictures to get both the stars and the bright subject.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAstronauts see the stars fine (on Apollo, they even used the stars for navigation) because the human eye adapts to what its seeing and the brain combines all that information together seemlessly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-07T08:30:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2014 08:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dkmdlb","CreatedById":70275,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-07T14:07:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is an approximation of what they look like. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\u0022https://player.vimeo.com/video/45878034\u0022 width=\u00221920\u0022 height=\u00221080\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 title=\u0022View from the ISS at Night\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"}]}
