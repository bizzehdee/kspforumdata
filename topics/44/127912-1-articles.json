Nature\u00A0broke me of that in 1986 with thier article about homeopathic behaviors of IgE and the followup test of the lab using the magician the Amazing Randy. Henceforth i consider the Journals to be coffee table science magazines. I read the editorials and i follow the collections, for example the NASA exposee on plutos new horizon, and some of the paleonstuff, always good to search the\u00A0authors names\u00A0in other journals though \u00A0like JHE AJHG AJPA, etc and see if you can find an article that would have the best field specific peer review. \u00A0Science claims they seek\u00A0the most qualified referees for each paper, however thier very high rate of retractions suggests otherwise.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey always can come up with an answer for you to explain thier failures, the best answer is caveot emtor.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-15T14:31:41Z\u0022 title=\u002212/15/2015 02:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
