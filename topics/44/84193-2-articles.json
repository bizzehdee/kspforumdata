And read a bit about changing levels of CO2 in the past. What we have now is well below CO2 levels before Ice Age started. And way, waaaayyyy below what was in the air during Jurassic ad Cretaceous periods. Most people imagine environmental changes turning Earth into desolate, barren desert baking in the sun.
