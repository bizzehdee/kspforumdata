It\u0027s pretty prevalent in my machine though. It can both accelerate and decelerate swing speed by doing cycles. However, when you turn off the gyroscopes (video 21) that phenomenon more or less disappears. This means that the pendulum test should be pretty easy to pass, and I probably do pass it in one or more of these videos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Can you do a quick overview which video contains what?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure. Video 9 (00009.MTS) is a short introduction. Showing the setup and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 11 I try to get it to swing and then get it to stop swinging by doing cycles either when it\u0027s swinging to the left or right. At the end of the video I have to abort it as something went wrong with the gyros.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 12 I do the same thing. Because I do cycles during the entire forward swing (left), it\u0027s hard to analyze. I also seem to stop it manually. Still shows the \u0022braking\u0022 though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 13 I attempt to pass the pendulum test. I only do cycles when the dot is in the far most left position, meaning the dot should be easy to track once it passes over the middle line. At 1:25 I stop doing cycles and just let the camera run for 13 minutes, waiting for the dot to stop by itself. The camera is only able to record 15 minutes at a time, and the dot doesn\u0027t come to a complete standstill before that time, unfortunately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 14 I did the same thing, with the difference that I tried \u0022braking\u0022 the backwards swing, meaning you wouldn\u0027t have to wait so long for the dot to come to a standstill. I started breaking at 1:56.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 15 I tried seeing if the dot would move more to the right than left for some reason. Eventually I just try to see how much further the dot moves when you add cycles. Turns out it\u0027s 2-3 cm each cycle. Pretty significant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 16 I tried passing the pendulum test again, but I had to cancel both runs that showed the dot (zoomed in). You could probably still analyze the footage I got even though even though I never waited for the dot to come to a standstill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 17 I got a new laser pointer! This one is interesting and well worth analyzing. Dot is clearly visible and I try to make it easy to track. I basically avoid doing (shaky) cycles when the dot is about to cross the middle line.

The brigth laser dot in video 17 was easy to track. It was very hard to put the perspective into account and calculate accurate length values. Keep in mind that the distance between two drawn lines is 20 mm. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI took the phase after the machine was turned off to calculate the rest position of the dot: 3.0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B10.9 mm to the right of the middle line. (so 3.3 \u00C3\u00C6\u2019 from the line) It could very well be that the rest position IS at the middle line, but the video doesn\u0027t allow for a better estimation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe median position of the laser dot (during the time the machine was on) was 9.3\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B11.8 mm TO THE RIGHT of the middle line. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETaking both values into account, the average deflection from the rest position (during the time the machine was on) was 6.3\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B12.0 mm TO THE RIGHT. This is just 3.2 \u00C3\u00C6\u2019 (borderline) from the rest position, so one could argue if the measurment is significant or if its just an statistical artifact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn summary:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe there is a very small effect that favors a position to the right of the line (maybe has something to do with the cable of the controls). But there is no clear proof, that there even is a deflection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is clearly no evidence whatsoever (in video 17) that the machine has an average deflection to the left (the machine is intended to deflect to the left). So there is no evidence for a reactionless propulsion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a small margin of error, because i didn\u0027t tracked the dot until the very end, because even with autotracker it would take to much time. ( the autotracker isn\u0027t reliable and needs babysitting). But I tracked EVERY frame of the machine-on-phase and every frame of a good portion of the machine-off-phase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes the dot leaves the picture.

All I really have to do is reverse the rotation direction of the screwdriver, and the gyros will want to precess towards it.

The average displacement to the right was 6.3\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B12.0 mm. Don\u0027t you think that a real working machine would show very very clear results? As it stands, we are arguing over displacements in the range of mm. Do you really think the effect your machine has (if it works) would be so insignificant? Or are you saying to yourself the displacement to the left is easily like a few cm, but it is hidden behind the incorrect movement of the dot?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I understand you correctelly, the correction I made in this graph by hand would show the actual movement of the center of mass:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/ljhx6Oj\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/ljhx6Oj\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn average position to the left with this correction isn\u0027t clearly obvious, and I can\u0027t easily do the analysation with this hand drawn picture. And even if I could make the analysation, it would be limited evidence, because this isn\u0027t real data, but just hand drawings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut look at the graph, are you really convinced, that there is an average displacement? It looks to me just like an ordinary swing movement, without any anomalies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the describtion of your Youtube Video, you write:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027 These experiments show that the machine is able to accelerate in one direction only. If you start a swing and accelerate as the machine is swinging backwards, the swinging motion will decelerate, that is, brake. This is interesting because it suggests this is a functioning reactionless drive. \u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd in an earlier post, you wrote:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027 It can both accelerate and decelerate swing speed by doing cycles. However, when you turn off the gyroscopes (video 21) that phenomenon more or less disappears. This means that the pendulum test should be pretty easy to pass, and I probably do pass it in one or more of these videos. \u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan you explain why? How does the observation suggest a functioning reactionless drive? Stopping and starting a swing motion doesn\u0027t lead to the conclusion of reactionless drives. So being better at stopping and starting the motion if the gyros are on hasn\u0027t anything to do with reactionless drive or the pendulum test.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn comparison: Imagine for an object traveling to the north and south would be considered impossible. You test it, and find out that you can go to the west. And you measure, that the object can go to the east. From that you think it suggests it could go the the north. Then you cripple your machine. Now it can\u0027t really go to the west and east anymore. From that you conclude the north-south test would e pretty easy to pass.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-12T15:09:50Z\u0022 title=\u002204/12/2014 03:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by N_las\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
