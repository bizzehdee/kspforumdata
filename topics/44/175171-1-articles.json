So we made up a lot of the stuff and ran it through the wringer, characterizing it as well as we could, which was pretty well. We ran card-gap tests\u00A0on it, and found that it was quite shock insensitive, in spite of all that oxidizing salt in it. It seemed to be a reasonably good answer to the problem, so we code-named it \u201CHydrazoid N,\u201D and stuck it on the shelf for the engineers when they would need it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, one day, I got a phone call from Stan Tannenbaum. \u201CJohn, will you do some card gaps for me?\u201D (RMI wasn\u2019t equipped to do them, and RMI and my outfit always had a comfortable, off-the-cuff, forget the paperwork and what the brass don\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt them, sort of relationship, so I wasn\u2019t surprised at the request.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSure, Stan, no problem.

By the nature of research more tests are going to fail than at\u0027e going to succeed, and more combinations are going to ignite slowly than are going to light off in a hurry. And when the result of each delayed ignition is a demolished motor, a screening program can become a bit tedious and more than a bit expensive. So the initial screening moved from the test stand into the laboratory, as various agencies built themselves ignition delay apparatus of one sort or another. Most of these devices were intended not only to determine whether or not a combination was hypergolic, but also to measure the ignition delay if it was. In construction they varied wildly, the designs being limited only by the imagination of the investigator. The simplest tester consisted of an eyedropper, a small beaker, and a finely calibrated eyeball \u2014 and the most complicated was practically a small rocket motor setup. And there was everything in between. One of the fancier rigs was conceived by my immediate boss, Paul Terlizzi, at NARTS. He wanted to take high-speed Schlieren (shadow) movies of the ignition process. (What information he thought they would provide escaped me at the time, and still does.)\u00A0There was a small ignition chamber, with high-speed valves and injectors for the propellants under investigation. Viewing ports, a high-speed Fastex camera, and about forty pounds of lenses, prisms, and what not, most of them salvaged from German submarine periscopes, completed the setup. Dr. Milton Scheer (Uncle Milty) labored over the thing for weeks, getting all the optics lined up and focused.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCame the day of the first trial. The propellants were hydrazine and WFNA. We were all gathered around waiting for the balloon to go up, when Uncle Milty warned, \u201CHold it \u2014 the acid valve is leaking!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGo ahead \u2014 fire anyway!\u201D Paul ordered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI looked around and signaled to my own gang, and we started backing gently away, like so many cats with wet feet. Howard Streim opened his mouth to protest, but as he said later, \u201CI saw that dog- eating grin on Doc\u2019s face and shut it again,\u201D and somebody pushed the button. There was a little flicker of yellow flame, and then a brilliant blue-white flash and an ear-splitting crack. The lid to the chamber went through the ceiling (we found it in the attic some weeks later), the viewports vanished, and some forty pounds of high-grade optical glass was reduced to a fine powder before I could blink.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI clasped both hands over my mouth and staggered out of the lab, to collapse on the lawn and laugh myself sick, and Paul stalked out in a huff. When I tottered weakly back into the lab some hours later I found that my gang had sawed out, carried away, and carefully lost, some four feet from the middle of the table on which the gadget had rested, so that Paul\u2019s STIDA could never, never, never be reassembled, in our lab.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe book itself (I got the softcover) is nice, they made new cover art which is fine, although not as nice as the original.\u00A0It does include the image of the test firing and the engraving from the original, although in the front rather than the back and in black and white rather than color. The font is a little small, but not too bad. The chemical formulas have been typeset rather than scanned, except for one, which is odd, but not a problem. There are a few typos I\u0027ve notices, but nothing major, and they may have been in the original as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would recommend it even if you have no knowledge of chemistry, (I have very little) since the stories are still funny and interesting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
