They have full disclosure on what assumptions and simplifications they make in their models (they have to make assumptions and simplifications or else they wouldnt even be able to start), but how to model this complicated a phenomena is not easy. When making a complicated model such as this, you often take past experimental data and \u0022calibrate\u0022 your unknowns in the model to match (i say this as someone who has done expensive modeling work on the PhD level).\n\nThese scientist are not like a group of dudes who try to prove that events in the bible real existed for TV shows that are transmited in the holydays.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s not always possible to obtain values for these \u0022fudge factors\u0022 from theory or direct measurement (**especially** on the scale of the globe), so they have to use average values which need to be calibrated. They do not receive any \u0022real data\u0022 for this modeling work; after all, one requirement of all models is that it **needs** to be independent from experiment (except in the case of initial conditions). \n\u003E As someone who conducts extensive modeling, I know full well it\u0027s limitations and drawbacks. I don\u0027t believe modeling results all the time, especially when the modeling task is **so complicated** that their is no way it could have been done completely correctly. I have seen, in my field, people not really being so careful and rigorous with the values they use for models.\n\nThere are errors when they make these math models to work in supercomputer, if all calculations and variables (size) are not well designed, they can drag big errors.. \nBut they do this in many parts of the worlds, and they try to correct any mistake they did.\n\nBut is very unlikely that all are wrong.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Predicting climate trends is not easy. They are numerous feedback loops (some positive, some negative), many capacitances, convective terms (which themselves are affected by changing climate/temperature) etc... Predicting short periods is even more difficult...\n\nIs the same that I said.. you just change the range of the adjectives ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\nBut you did that question, so you are answering yourself with my same words?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This just goes to show my point that the climate scientists and modelers dont yet completely understand everything. Their could easily be additional negative feedback loops that resist climate change or large capacitances that havent yet been tapped (like the pacific ocean). \n\u003E Furthermore, how on earth could people claim the surface temperature is warming, without measuring the surface temperature of the whole globe? They are basically saying that yes, the surface temperature has been warming, but it stops every 30 years, because it has to pause to warm the pacific. Wait, werent they measuring the pacific ocean temperature already when they said the surface temperatures were warming? I\u0027m confused...\n\nIf you read the current paper you will understand.. Or just read it to see if you find an error. And in case you do, that is the way to contribute to science.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Ideally, if the amount of money we had to spend to stop climate change and the effort on the part of every citizen was minimal, i would say, yes, we should put in the money and the effort. But clearly, the amount of change required is huge (all the green efforts most countries have taken have been pitiful and dont actually reduce anything). To make a difference, the industrialized world would have to reduce emissions by 10x, which is just not going to happen. Coupled with that, china and india are in the process of industrializing. If everyone in China and India used as much energy as we do in the US, the whole globe is F\u0027d.\n\nMerge it with --\u003E\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Based on relatively small scale projects and ignoring the needed ressources to build, deploy and maintain enough solarcells, windturbines and energy storage to replace to a high degree or all of global conventional powerproduction (taking in mind that solar power has to be dimensioned with eg. 14 percent efficient loss over 7 years). Not to mention that energy usage will increase by a great deal (double or triple global use) as more and more people get relatively richer and from changing eg. heating from central heating to electrical.\n\nIn a big study requested by the goverment, **Finland found that is possible a 100% renewable convertion (mostly solar and wind) in 35 years**, this takes into account all the energy that the country spent as transportation, etc.\n\nAll this just increasing a 20% of the current energy budget, which is similar to the money that NASA will spent in the SLS-Orion program.\n\nNow we need to consider that Finland has an awfull level of anual irradiance. So if they can achieve it, also the rest of the world.\n\nThey take into account all strategies, Including nuclear to the case, it was only a 2% to 3% difference with full solar and wind.\n\nThey keep some thermal plants and they will need also fuel for vehicles, so they will capture co2 to make the fuels with electrical energy. They will use also hydrogen and different way of storage.\n\n[http://www.lut.fi/web/en/news/-/asset_publisher/lGh4SAywhcPu/content/fully-renewable-energy-system-is-economically-viable-in-finland-in-2050](http://www.lut.fi/web/en/news/-/asset_publisher/lGh4SAywhcPu/content/fully-renewable-energy-system-is-economically-viable-in-finland-in-2050)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/wcRuTnNYMqI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n[http://www.neocarbonenergy.fi/](http://www.neocarbonenergy.fi/)"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T01:02:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I dont think that can explain this large of a discrepancy... since there is no reason to assume that plants can suddenly matabolize faster just because there is more CO2 in the atmosphere (in addition, i dont know if there is even enough photosynthesizing life on the planet to absorb this much CO2 with photosynthesis).

Mass of CO2 increases by 1% per year. Since current concentration is 400ppm, CO2 concentration should increase by 4ppm/yr. It actually increases by 2-3ppm/yr due to ocean absorption.\n\nCO2 tends to dissolve in cold alkaline solutions, Sea water being alkaline. CO2 is absorbed in the arctic and is eventually carried into the deepest ocean layers which take decades to come back to the surface. There are already report that some of the cold upwellings in the northern latitudes are so acidic that calcium carbonate shell formers have difficulty growing.\n\nThe ocean is a giant buffer, it will suck up CO2 until the pKa range of carbonate and borate buffers, once close to the acidic end it will no longer support absorbtion and all emitted CO2 will simply linger in the atmosphere. As the oceans heat up the CO2 retention capacity will diminish."},{"CreatedByName":"arkie87","CreatedById":103434,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T16:23:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You said \u0022Keep in mind, 10 years ago, 97% of scientists thought global warming was a pseudoscience.\u0022 That doesn\u0027t make it clear at all that . It\u0027s a very specific number.\n\u003E Ever since surveys have been carried out, the vast majority of scientists (over 65%, even in the lowest results) have agreed that anthropogenic warming is occurring. The results in no way back up your very emphatic statement that 10 years ago, an overwhelming majority of scientists thought AGW was pseudoscience.\n\nMy use of 97% was meant to reflect the \u002297%\u0022 now that believes in anthropomorphic climate change. It was not exact, but rather, intended to illustrate that global opinion of climate change has undergone drastic changes over the past decade or two.\n\n\u003E Well if there\u0027s a systematic error in the data acquisition, or indeed with *anything*, it shouldn\u0027t make a difference when we\u0027re looking at trends. Unless it is not only present, but *growing in magnitude*. And also relatively consistent across several different ways of measuring temperature, mercury thermometer, thermocouple, satellite measurements, etc.\n\nVery good point. Thank you.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Because it doesn\u0027t exist? The change in the slope of the graph of a noisy signal over a period of a few data points doesn\u0027t imply that global warming is \u0022on hold\u0022 or not happening.\n\nIf you look at the raw data, it does. That\u0027s why it has to be explained. And its not only a few data points, its been 17 years.\n\n\u003E Not really. There are various correction factors in place, to compensate for things like urban heat islands, ocean mixing, and the geographic distribution of sensors, which is not uniform over the surface of the globe. These all have a small amount of uncertainty associated with them, making the signal slightly noisy.\n\nI maintain my concern that is hard enough to do IR measurements in a lab (controlled environment) to accuracies within 1C. In space, they cannot control or block reflected, transmitted, and absorbed components. They are also dealing with a much thicker layer of atmosphere, which interacts with a much larger component of the total radiative flux. Water vapor is also a greenhouse gas, and without knowing the humidity content, this effect cannot be accounted for. \n\nI have seen reports of such satellites reporting clearly inaccurate temperatures due to mis-performing equipment; those temperatures have been removed from the record, without looking into what caused the problem."},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T16:26:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E --snip--\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E My biggest problem with global warming is the dogma; there is always room for a rational, respectful debate (that is what science is), but what happens with global warming debates is closer to condescending dismissals, insults, bullying, and name calling which is reminiscent of politics. \n\u003E \n\u003E Keep in mind, 10 years ago, 97% of scientists thought global warming was a pseudoscience.

We wouldnt have any evidence at all left! Accordingly, i dont think we should discount any sources, we should argue with the facts. For instance, the EPA displays this graph: \n\n![CO2Temp800Kyrs.jpg](http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/images/science/CO2Temp800Kyrs.jpg)\n\nwhich goes back 800,000 years.

Isn\u0027t it possible that the antarctic could have had a different climate than the rest of the world at different time periods?\n\nOf course. That always confused me how people could take one measurement and claim it to be average for the whole planet. But this applies to data showing global warming as well (see EPA graph above). If one graph is questioned, so should the other one, no? \n\nFurthermore, in general, it has always confused me how ice core measurements can **even exist** during periods when the earth is warming. Theoretically, if the average temperature is warming, then old ice is destroyed and no new ice is created (on average and long term). Even if locally, somewhere, it is getting colder, how would the scientists know that this is new ice whereas the other ice is old ice? Moreover, doesnt CO2 dissolve in ice/water? What makes us so sure that CO2 hasnt been leaking out? \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Also, the only climate data that really matters is that from a few million years ago to now, when pre-humans started to evolve into modern humans, showing that the average temperature and Atmospheric CO2 changed over the past 600 million years isn\u0027t much of an argument.\n\nI really dont see why the climate only matters from a few million years to now. Of course it is relevant. Climate models predict a \u0022runaway\u0022 effect when CO2 levels raise above a critical point; however, CO2 levels in the distant past were 10X their current values and there was no runaway (granted the earth was 10C warmer, but still not as hot as Venus). \n\nSecond, the graph shows a complete lack of correlation (let alone causation) between CO2 and temperatures, implying a fundamental lack of physical evidence of the existence and/or strength of the greenhouse effect for CO2.
