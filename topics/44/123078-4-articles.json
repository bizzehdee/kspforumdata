THE SIGNATURES AND INFORMATION CONTENT OF TRANSITING MEGASTRUCTURESJason T. Wright1, Kimberly M. S. Cartier, Ming Zhao1, Daniel Jontof-Hutter, Eric B. Ford1Department of Astronomy \u0026amp; Astrophysics, and andCenter for Exoplanets and Habitable Worlds, 525 Davey Lab, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, 16802Submitted to ApJABSTRACTArnold (2005), Forgan (2013), and Korpela et al. (2015) noted that planet-sized artificial structures\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC which might be used for stellar energy collection, propulsion, or as beacons \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC could be discovered with Kepler as they transit their host star. We present a general discussion of transiting megastructures, and enumerate nine potential ways their anomalous silhouettes, orbits, and transmission properties would distinguish them from exoplanets. We also enumerate the natural sources of such signatures.Several anomalous objects, such as KIC 12557548 and CoRoT-29, have variability in depth consistent with Arnold\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s prediction, and/or an asymmetric shape consistent with Forgan\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s model. Sincewell motivated physical models have so far provided natural explanations for these signals, the ETI hypothesis is not warranted for these objects, but they still serve as useful examples of how nonstandard transit signatures might be identified and interpreted in a SETI context. Boyajian et al.2015 recently announced KIC 8462852, an object with a bizarre light curve consistent with a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cswarm\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2of megastructures. We suggest this target is an outstanding SETI target. We develop the normalized information content statistic M to quantify the information content in a signal embedded in a discrete series of bounded measurements, such as variable transit depths, and show that it can be used to distinguish among constant sources, interstellar beacons, and naturally stochastic or artificial, information-rich signals. We apply this formalism to KIC 12557548 and aspecific form of beacon suggested by Arnold to illustrate its utility. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www2.astro.psu.edu/~jtwright/Dyson/GHAT4.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www2.astro.psu.edu/~jtwright/Dyson/GHAT4.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-16T19:16:00Z\u0022 title=\u002210/16/2015 07:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Aethon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-16T20:04:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022baggers\u0022 data-cite=\u0022baggers\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve assumed this is a remain of a destroyed civ\u0027: it\u0027s unlikely we have spotted a \u0022in construction\u0022 Dyson sphere because galactic timeline.

The durations of the events and the lack of repetition require the objects to be on long-period orbits. A depth of 22% for the deepest event implies a size of around half the stellar radius (or larger if, like a ring system, the occulter is not completely opaque). The asymmetries imply that either star or the occulter deviate significantly from spherical symmetry\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The light curves of KIC 8462 clearly show multiple reversals (seethe events between (BJD-2454833)= 1500 and 1508 inFigure 2), indicating some material is undergoing egress prior to other material experiencing ingress during a single\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cevent\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2.This implies either occulters with star-sized gaps, multiple, overlapping transit events, or complex non-Keplerian motion.The large number of events requires there to be a large number of these occulters \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC at least 8 just from the events shown in Figure 2, plus an uncertain number from lower-level events (but at least another 8).\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom the original paper \u0022Where\u0027s The Flux?\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022the several-day duration of the events for KIC 8462852 suggests that the clumps are either close-in and large compared to the star, or far-away from the star and small. However, clumps that are too distant move too slowly across the stellar disk to explain the observed duration regardless of their size; e.g., a 3-day duration dip cannot arise from a clump beyond \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C2\u00BC 15 AU.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The middle solid line (for tdip = 3) and a depth of \u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u017E = 20% therefore decreases the outer limit on the clump locations mentioned above to closer to 8 AU.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The high rate of change in the KIC 8462852 light curve translates to a lower limit on the transverse velocity of the orbiting material of about 9 km s\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u21221,which corresponds to an upper limit of 16 AU for material on circular orbits.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The lack of evidence for periodicity in the dips in the observed light-curve excludes orbital periods shorter than \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C2\u00BC 1500 days, which thus constrains the location to lie beyond about 3 AU.
