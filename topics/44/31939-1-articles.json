And the answer is also tied with the fact that the current first stages were disintegrating once they reentered the dense parts of the atmosphere (they were supposed to be recoverable, remember? Heat protection and everything, only they were getting shredded by air pressure). Apparently (and I\u0027m gong by various hints and tidbits of info here and there, so don\u0027t quote me as source), the Falcon 9R will have a different flight profile than Falcon 9. Less delta-v on the first stage and a straight up profile, and a beefier second stage which does most of the job of getting orbital velocity (~7km/s). When I heard it it reminded me of the DH-1 fictional design proposed in the book \u0022The rocket company\u0022. It\u0027s almost a SSTO with a rocket assisted air launch, frankly, which must make the whole SSTO thingy much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to news or no news, well, as it has been said, there has been a lot of speculation about what MCT stands for since he dropped the acronym.

As if he needed any more. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESize is anyone\u0027s guess (he has not made any public declarations as to how big the heavy lifters he is planning are, only that they will be significantly bigger than the Falcon family), but running the rocket equation, LEO to Mars surface (with aerobraking and heatshield) takes about the same as Mars surface to Earth reentry, and is very doable on single stages with chemical engines running on, for example, methane fuel like the Raptor will use. IIRC I got a mass ratio of around 5, which means decent payload fraction. Add ISRU, and you get a sexy operations concept: Reusable HLV takes ship to space, ship goes to Mars, ship refuels and goes back to Earth. Refuel, inspect, restock, and put it on top of another HLV to go again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.

Apparently the flight profile of the reusable F9 includes a less pronounced gravity turn than the current F9, then a canceling of the horizontal velocity after first stage separation, leading to a high apoapsis, then another burn right before hitting the thick part of the atmosphere, and then the final suicide burn when touching down. Something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=30350.0;attach=487263;image\u0022 alt=\u0022index.php?action=dlattach;topic=30350.0;attach=487263;image\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd because of the extra mass the first stage needs in fuel and infrastructure, making it reusable would reduce the payload mass to orbit by a significant amount, something like 40% (should still bring down costs per pound overall).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the MCT goes, I think Elon might be getting a little ahead of himself. He might be a billionaire, but even he doesn\u0027t have the capital needed to design and build a super-heavy lift rocket as well as a deep space hab and Mars lander. You would need something like Bill Gates\u0027 wealth for something of that magnitude. NASA is building a heavy lift rocket made out of recycled Shuttle parts for $20 billion, and while SpaceX can probably do it a lot cheaper, doing it ~20 times cheaper is a pretty big stretch. Maybe if the reusable Falcon 9 posts huge profits for the next many years and Elon puts all those profits into designing a Mars vehicle, but that would still be a long way out.
