I could make a pretty strong argument for earth, too, though that might be somewhat biased. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVenus is often referred to as the Earth\u0027s sister planet. And it practically is in terms of size and history. It may be a inhospitable furnace today, but once Venus was home to a climate which may have been friendly towards life. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had watched a program about Venus, and several other planets. In it a space probe was mentioned, one which recently began orbiting the planet. In fly-by missions, as well as the mission this probe was on, small amounts of hydrogen and oxygen were detected escaping the atmosphere. This suggests that liquid water once existed on the surface of the planet, and as things heated up the water evaporated. Over millions of years, the solar wind was able to assault the surface, stripping hydrogen from oxygen and carrying it out into space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVenus is so similar to earth, and if a magnetic field were present it would have more water in the atmosphere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVenus is the hottest planet in our solar system, and it\u0027s atmosphere is 96% carbon dioxide. Volcanic eruptions may have led to the buildup of carbon dioxide in the planets atmosphere, eventually resulting in a runaway greenhouse effect that set the atmosphere ablaze. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVenus is beautiful at dawn and dusk, which is misleading. In truth, it is the dark twin, the evil, violent sister of planet earth. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVenus also serves as a chilling vision of what our future may look like. The excessive amounts of carbon dioxide in the planets atmosphere led to global temperature rising. This probably forced the water on the surface to evaporate, adding more gasses to the atmosphere. With volcanic eruptions spewing out more and more carbon dioxide, the surface of the planet heated up, and wouldn\u0027t cool down. This may be the fate of planet earth if emissions are not reduced, and too much carbon dioxide is expelled into the atmosphere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, these are just a few reasons why Venus fascinates me. Space in general fascinates me- The Ice7 that may be beneath the oceans of Europa, Super Earths, the crater on Mercury... It\u0027s simply amazing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T14:34:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPersonally the only thing I ever found fascinating about Venus was imagining what its landscape might look like without all the clouds in the way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I\u0027m still a fan of Mars myself. It too gives us a glimpse at what may come for our planet, but at the same time gives off this ominous feeling of impending rebirth. I don\u0027t know if we\u0027ll ever really develop what we\u0027d need to terraform Mars, but somehow I can\u0027t imagine that we won\u0027t still have people living on it indefinitely sooner or later.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Transits","CreatedById":104718,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T19:06:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf I had to pick a favourite planet, then it would be Venus.

It\u0027s safe to say that every large body in our solar system has (had) water. Or atleast Ice. And most possibly that\u0027s true for anywhere else in the universe although that obviously isn\u0027t documented.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if venus had liquid water hundred millions of years ago (or 1\u002Bbillion years ago) it would still have a retrograde spin that takes venus longer to spin around compared to orbiting the sun. So you still have one side of the planet cooked while the other half is in cold. It is theorized however in search for extraterrestial earths that this effect would cause high altitude atmospheric recirculation but even then on venus you had to cope with some very hard challenges to survive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA second problem to venus slow rotation would be the cause for a lack of a strong magnetic field. In venus current state the magnetic field is negligible. And apart from some plants and bacteria other complex lifeforms would not be able to survive or flourish regardless of heat and pressure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m now about to say is completely theoreticall. But it also lacks the necessary facts so I just point out the following.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVenus is shown to have been extremely vulcanic. And is said to have been the most vulcanic planet in the solar system. The sulpur dioxide is just plain proof of vulcanism in bizarre proportions. Many data on vulcanism on venus was gathered by the Magellan probe. I think that vulcanism is so active on venus and theirfore still is exactly for the reason that it doesn\u0027t rotate and usually one side of the planet faces the same tidal directional forces caused by the sun for approximately 117days in a row. Also the planet venus has no tectonic plates. So the internal fabric of Venus it\u0027s mantle goes through a completely different process then that of earth. Some of those add ups leads me to conclude that venus is a recipe for vulcanism. And non of those formulas for vulcanism on venus are naturally changed but for ever be the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I think venus was Always vulcanic, still is and will Always be until the sun goes red giant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo long as evidence regarding this matter lacks I feel strongly hold on to this theory. And sadly that theory more or less predicts that venus is never ever going to get better or ever was unless venus did have a faster axial spin in the past. Some theory arised about a large interplanetary collision with venus in the past. I don\u0027t get that theory as that would mean there should be remains of that collision down to mercury and up to the orbit of earh. The spin of a planet initially is more or less dictated by random collision events in the protoplanetary era of the solar system. And most likely the rotation speed of venus is just a random that can occur and turned out badly slow and in a opposite direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Actually I do in fact Like venus. Because it\u0027s so bad and evil and hellish.

Earth will NEVER look like Venus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first thing I need to remind anyone of, is that when we\u0027re talking CO2 emissions on Earth, we\u0027re talking emissions from burning coal, oil, natural gas, and peat- all of which are ultimately biogenic sources of carbon. Meaning, they came from decaying plant/animal life being buried, \u003Cstrong\u003EAND ALL OF THAT CARBON WAS ONCE ON THE SURFACE\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarth was never a steaming cauldron like Venus, however, and never will be due to CO2 emissions. What Earth \u003Cstrong\u003Emight\u003C/strong\u003E become is a swamp planet again- like it was way back before the formation of all that coal and peat (Earth used to have a VERY swampy environment- which was conducive to the burial of all that organic matter under layers of mud and sand...) \u003Cstrong\u003ENOT\u003C/strong\u003E a volcanic planet or a steaming cauldron like Venus though- there are other atmospheric/oceanic/terrestrial limiting factors on Gloabal Warming that eventually start to kick in once the climate becomes warm enough, that prevent the effect from becoming so extreme or runaway as to change the planet to such an absurd degree...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYou must also keep in mind Venus orbits 0.723 AU away from the sun (72.3% the distance of Earth).\u003C/strong\u003E What that means, in practical terms, is that due to the Inverse Square Law, it actually receives 1.913 times (almost TWICE) the solar energy of Earth.
