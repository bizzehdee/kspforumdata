The main hatch always had an explosive charge (ever since the Apollo 1 fire, NASA has wanted a way for the white room crew and the vehicle crew to get the hatch open NOW in the event of a fire on the pad), complete with a recessed, covered T-handle on the outside that would allow it to be blown by the white room crew (hence the \u0022RESCUE\u0022 arrow on the side--at the point of it is the cover for the T-handle; you open the cover, grab the T-handle, and run ten feet away from the vehicle while pulling it with you, and the hatch blows, just like the canopy on any airplane with ejection seats would when you pull the corresponding external handle). However, NASA also considered the possibility that the Shuttle would end up landing off-runway someplace, leaving the main hatch blocked. For that contingency, they made the port docking window (the overhead ones seen in the OP photo) able to be removed in an emergency, with a thermal blanket and escape rope that would allow the crew to crawl/slide down the side of the vehicle to evacuate in that situation. I don\u0027t recall it having a jettison charge then, but apparently one was added at some point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, all of this blithely ignores the fact that there was no way in hell that an off-runway landing of the Shuttle would be in any way survivable, but hey, it weighed next to nothing, and had to be good for morale, right?

Officially, the docking window exit was also supposed to be used in the event of a ditching (water landing), and there are plenty of photos of the water evacuation trainer at the Cape with astronauts clambering out that window during training, but again, there\u0027s NO WAY IN HELL that a ditching would have ever been survivable in the Shuttle (hence the escape pole added after Challenger)--I\u0027ve seen films of some of the model tests at the Navy\u0027s David Taylor Model Basin, and regardless of the angle of descent, deck angle, and speed at impact, something about the design of the vehicle\u0027s belly causes it to slap the nose down, dig it in, and either start tumbling end-over-end, or yaw sharply to one side and then violently roll when the front wing digs in. In some cases, it was enough to cause the models (which are capable of handling far greater structural loads than the actual vehicle) to at least partially break apart... anyone on board would have been unconscious at best, and chunky salsa at worst, and the cabin would have sunk before anyone could have evacuated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lexif","CreatedById":65533,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-07T02:52:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rdfox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rdfox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOf course, all of this blithely ignores the fact that there was no way in hell that an off-runway landing of the Shuttle would be in any way survivable, but hey, it weighed next to nothing, and had to be good for morale, right?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can change a runway landing into an off-runway landing pretty quickly if you manage to miss the runway or run off the side...

The 747 even has a hatch in a similar position on the roof. (It is sometimes used to clean the cockpit windows from above,too...)
