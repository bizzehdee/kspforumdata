It sounds like they are considering just reusing the engines by bringing them down on parachutes as they are pretty much the most expensive part of the rocket and easier to bring down than the entire thing. He didn\u0027t talk much about it and we can really be certain what they are going to do quite yet but sound like this could be very interesting to see develop. Also sounds like they will be releasing info on their next generation of spacecraft in April. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-05T04:40:29Z\u0022 title=\u002202/05/2015 04:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DerpenWolf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-05T04:29:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYup, Elon Musk IS a trendsetter in space industry \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Now everyone can feel SpaceX breath on their necks, and are frantically scrambling to get some of the reusability cake for themselves.

Th BE-4 is supposed to use a LNG/LOX staged combustion cycle. This cycle has a lot of inherent technical difficulties and logistical complications, however LNG has less of a coking problem than RP-1 and thus should be intrinsically easier to reuse but is only low-cryogenic, avoiding the logistic nightmares of a LH2 system. It seems telling to me that the only other people in the world pursuing this technology are at SpaceX, with their enormous Raptor engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"B787_300","CreatedById":31055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-05T04:49:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eit is not a bad idea and they actually did a white paper on it a while back \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.ulalaunch.com/uploads/docs/Published_Papers/Evolution/EELVPartialReusable2010.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.ulalaunch.com/uploads/docs/Published_Papers/Evolution/EELVPartialReusable2010.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.ulalaunch.com/uploads/docs/Published_Papers/Evolution/PartialRocketReuseUsingMidAirRecovery20087874.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.ulalaunch.com/uploads/docs/Published_Papers/Evolution/PartialRocketReuseUsingMidAirRecovery20087874.pdf\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif you want to read more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue was that the RD180 is cheap so there is little benefit in the extra cost and weight of recovering it and refurbishing it vs just buying a new one\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Airlock","CreatedById":101601,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-06T05:15:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESlightly off-topic, but obligatory.
