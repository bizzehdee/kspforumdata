Short of huge, Apollo stacks, EOR is a way to go that minimizes risk (since all components can be tested in LEO), and maximizes the use of as many contractors as possible. This is non-trivial, because instead of making a single vehicle that is partially expensive because it uses so many contractors, it can have several vertically integrated LVs (from an mfg standpoint, not how they are stacked) that are more cost effective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLikely the only way Vulcan can beat NG (given that they\u0027re using the same engines and ULA is paying extra) for any purpose is if they can master IVF.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP players take IVF for granted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-24T15:48:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote also that the proposed DSG architecture has them eventually assembling an exploration vehicle at DSG for a possible Mars mission (The Deep Space Transport (DST)). That was on the proposed manifest for EM-6 as a cargo 1b, with a same year Orion flight (LOL). The year is 2027. So NASA is apparently already considering orbital assembly of a complex craft (to go to Mars in 2033, lol, EM-11), not in LEO, but around the Moon. I think EOR assembly is easier than building the DST around the Moon. If they can build a Mars craft (plan to) in 9 years around the Moon, they can make the Moon architecture use EOR assembly sooner (if for no other reason than practice).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-24T15:50:20Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2018 03:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by tater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerekL1963","CreatedById":57091,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-24T18:50:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223362715\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022159886\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221524581247\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022119411\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tater\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, tater said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShort of huge, Apollo stacks, EOR is a way to go that minimizes risk (since all components can be tested in LEO)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich must be balanced against the increased risks of multiple launches,\u00A0rendezvouses, and assembly operations.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTANSTAAFL no matter how hard you keep trying to handwave one into existence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-24T19:31:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223362863\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022159886\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221524595806\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257091\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DerekL1963\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n37 minutes ago, DerekL1963 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich must be balanced against the increased risks of multiple launches,\u00A0rendezvouses, and assembly operations.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTANSTAAFL no matter how hard you keep trying to handwave one into existence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was talking crew risk, not schedule risk.

I am saying that vehicles that are more cost-effective to buy for launch offer the possibility of orbital construction for substantially lower cost than SLS offers. SLS launches are literally billions (launch cost of the specific LV, plus the associated program cost which is what, 2\u002B B$/year, even with no flights?). Since the payloads don\u0027t yet exist, they can be designed to suit the appropriate architecture, if it matters.

Well within the capabilities of many extant LVs to orbit. So if the first several EM missions are block 1 SLS, then EM-3 will already be 2 launches, and Orion with ICPS will have to dock with the hab module pre-placed in LEO by another LV. Oh, wait, no, that\u0027s not true, since I don;t think ICPS can take Orion AND 10t of cargo to cislunar...

My guess is that ULA gets thrown a bone for delivering PPE, and SpaceX gets the hab (assuming they ever line item the thing and build it). This will allow SLS to fly Orion as nothing but a crew taxi until EUS/Block 2\u00A0allows comanifested cargoes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich will never happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223363041\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022159886\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221524607780\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022115084\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022_Augustus_\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 hours ago, _Augustus_ said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDIVH is retired for all intents and purposes.

FH can easily send that to nrho. The hab would require a propulsion bus to do all the maneuvers upon reaching the Moon. Such a bus will be required for anything sent ahead there without Orion, and Orion can\u2019t send anything there til block 1b, so it\u2019s come up with a small, disposable bus,!or dump dsg until block 1b.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou only need about 300\u00A0m/s to brake from TLI into NRHO. That\u0027s well within range of solid kick stages for a 5-8-tonne hab, I believe. Or you could buy a cheap hypergolic stage from the Russians.
