Look at how long it takes to do most EVA activities on the ISS. The Apollo astronauts could only venture 7 km from the LM because they were limited by life-support. Mars astronauts would also be limited to a range around their landing site. On the other hand, you can drop dozens of automatic rovers all over the planet to get a much wider variety of data, and they can keep going for months or years without having to go back to the landing site. So effectively you can cover a much wider area with multiple automatic rovers than with a single manned mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SargeRho\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SargeRho\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting a robot to do science as well as a Human could, that\u0027d a little harder.

The \u0022science\u0022 that humans would be doing on Mars is basically an extension of what the Apollo or ISS astronauts do: they tend to experiments, make observations, and pick up samples. The actual analysis and research work is still done on Earth. The science equipment and experiments are designed on Earth to minimize astronaut interaction. Most of the work done by astronauts on the ISS is maintaining the equipment that allows them to stay alive, running the experiments and transmitting the results to the labs on the ground who actually analyze it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Mars expedition would be similar. A part of their work day would be picking up samples in a limited radius around their base/lander, running predefined experiments with the equipment they have, following instructions from the ground, and transmitting the results back. However, the major part of their time will be spent running the base, maintaining equipment, and keeping themselves alive, including all those human inefficiencies like sleeping, eating, cleaning, and performing other bodily functions. The equipment just to perform those bodily functions represents more than 80% of the mass of the mission. That\u0027s a major inefficiency that trumps any gain that you might have from having an human on-site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERobots are getting smarter and more mobile everyday. There is no reason a robot couldn\u0027t be designed to perform the exact same sample gathering and science mission or to return soil samples from much wider locations than a manned mission ever could. In addition, a robot doesn\u0027t get tired, it doesn\u0027t get sick, it doesn\u0027t need to eat or go to the toilet. It can cover a much wider observation area for a much longer observation period, which is important for siesmic or climate research. It doesn\u0027t need rescuing if something goes wrong and it doesn\u0027t need bringing back. A robot is only limited by the actual experiments and instruments that you add to it, but then so is a manned mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd lastly, there\u0027s an emotional/political reason behind putting humans on Mars: It satisfies our need to explore.
