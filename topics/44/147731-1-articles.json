You can only precisely map the current positions of objects whose velocity is similar to our sun, given space-time. You can map their position at a given distance (@distance/length of\u00A0 light year)t years ago. But without the velocity and acceleration vector you cannot know where they are now, and even if you had these that now is irrelevant because no spatial-temperol reference frame exists in our visible universe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll stars in the Milky Way galaxy are moving relative to one another, all stars in the milky way are accelerating relative to one another (even though they are in typically non-inertial reference frames, those reference frames themselves are in motion). You might be able to discern parallax and astronomical position over several years, but on the scale of local clusters, that precision declines greatly as distance increases. Lets say those distances are accurate to 1/1000000. If we use the equation (xk/4)^3 = y when y = 1 then then k = 4 and when y = 1,000,000,000 then xk/4 = 1000, then x = 4000 ly. Note there is no absolute way of knowing how inaccurate your distance measurement is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt a error rate of 0.0001% the distance error is 1/250 of a light year or about 2.5 x 10^14 meters. If the distance error is \u00A0 1/10,000 is 1/4th of a light years and 1/1000 (which I strongly suspect is the high end of their accuracy it is 2.5 ly. If we then consider a probable range it means stars have distance measurements of 2.5 to 25 ly in error at the minimum outside boundary of distance. the star field in not flat, and there is a preference against red stars at a distance so the reality is the error on the furthest stars in the billion is more like 100 ly in distance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAsk yourself this question. How is it possible to know with precision the current position of a star at 1000s of ly from Sun whose velocity relative to our sun is different and constantly changing. So imagine you had a space ship and today, right now, you could go 0.1c to a star at a distance of 5000ly based on this precision (50000 years of travel).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPrecision is this, if I have a high powered rifle and I mount it in a device where the barrel is firmly placed, and repeated clean and fire the weapon, the bullets every time hit the same target (barring hurricances, changes in gravity, and highly unexpected geological events). Its track per unit distance is precisely (key the word) the same, it never changes. But all my targets for a high powered rifle are the same, they coexist in a definable space-time relative to the rifles position. In long distances of space space-time reference frames are not easily defined because of things like dead stars,\u00A0 black dwarves, black holes, and dark matter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo as you travel to your d= 5000ly star you would miss the target by 10 - 100 ly (that would be 100 - 1000 more years of travel) because you got the velocity and arc of motion wrong. Over a period of 50000 years stars in our local cluster travel 3 or 4 light years and we know their positions \u0027precisely\u0027, but a star whose velocity and acceleration aren\u0027t know precisely would not be were we expected them to be. First, their original position changes by the time their light reaches earth, and then as we travel their position changes during the travel.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt takes more than a few years of study by an orbital telescope to accurately measure distances and relative velocity, there are anomalies in between stars that alter our measurements (warping in space-time). Lets not feed their hype machine. It takes years of measuring stars and their motion to discern variations in velocity that reflect its space-time and the variation of space-time between the\u00A0 object and the sun over time.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-15T16:52:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI remember, that for a palaeanthropological exhibition \u0022Roots of Mankind\u0022, 2006 in Bonn, Germany, they built up a huge screen in the entryhall showing the movement of the brightest stars of the constellations over the last few hundred thousand years (i don\u0027t remember the exact number), to illustrate the timespan which the exhibition covered.
