It\u0027s always best to start with something simple that you can really understand. The most basic way to compute Pi is a geometric one. Start with a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle of radius 1. Its perimeter is 6, which gives you first approximation Pi=3. Then drop a perpendicular bisector on each side to construct a regular dodecagon inscribed in the same circle. You should be able to use Pythagoras\u0027 Theorem to compute the new perimeter. Keep going. As the polygon gets rounder and rounder, your approximation will get closer to the value of Pi.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bad news is that it converges ridiculously slowly, so it\u0027s not something you\u0027d use for thousands of digits, but it\u0027s a good start to see how the algorithm works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you can sit down and try to understand more advanced formulae and where they come from. Most of them are highly non-trivial, and programming them is much easier than understanding.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"falofonos","CreatedById":57821,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T18:21:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E103993/33102 is apparently a good approximation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Idobox","CreatedById":80299,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T18:39:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere an even simpler way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuild a large square matrix, of size r*r.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow count how many points of this matrix are less than r away from the origin, you can do that by checking if x\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2\u002By\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2\u0026lt;=r\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe points that fit that rule are within a quarter disk of area pi*r\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2/4, and the whole matrix has an area r\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo take the number of points in the quarter circle, multiply by 4, divide by the number of points in the whole matrix, and you get an approximation of pi.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe more points in the matrix, the more accurate the result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can optimize by:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edoing that only for one half of the matrix (it\u0027s symmetric along the diagonal)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emeasuring the surface of a ring with r1 \u0026gt; distance \u0026gt;r2.
