Perhaps you had a long road of personal and physically development to get there, which is likely a worthwhile and interesting story in of itself. If you pay to get in a rocket (and for the sake of example, assume just as risky), and make it all the way into space... you got lucky and managed not to die? Maybe it\u0027s satisfying for the engineers. The odds might be the same, but the effect and point is very different, making comparing the two and little difficult... the actual journey into space would be thrilling, sure, but it\u0027s not what people are paying for. In that sense, it\u0027s still much more like\u00A0a holiday to an exotic location that an adventure holiday, but naturally far, far more expensive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223114179\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022162599\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221499453576\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022133850\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022wumpus\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 7/7/2017 at 7:52 PM, wumpus said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoesn\u0027t matter. \u00A0Humans simply are lousy at that type of analysis. \u00A0This is why the airlines have to be so obsessed with safety: one downed plane sticks in the mind so much more than tens of thousands of car deaths annually. \u00A0They *see* the crash on TV, they don\u0027t hear about the crashes (when a car crashes that isn\u0027t news. \u00A0That\u0027s expected. \u00A0So of course humans aren\u0027t afraid of it).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA similar effect applies here - part of the reason people perceive airplanes as \u0027dangerous\u0027 and some people feel very uncomfortable flying in one is they have \u003Ci\u003Ezero control\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0over what happens on that journey.
