The maiden Indian satellite is still going strong with all sensors still functioning and ISRO predicts that it will remain in service for several years. To celebrate the occasion, ISRO has released a Mars Atlas with more than a hundred pictures of Mars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022 The images from Mars Color Camera (MCC) have provided unique information about Mars at varying spatial resolutions. It has obtained Mars Global data showing clouds, dust in atmosphere and surface albedo variations, when acquired from apoapsis at around 72000 km. On the other hand high resolution images acquired from periapsis show details of various morphological features on the surface of Mars. Some of these images have been showcased in this atlas. The images have been categorized depending upon the Martian surface and atmospheric processes. \u0022 \u003C/em\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.isro.gov.in/sites/default/files/article-files/pslv-c25-mars-orbiter-mission/celebrating-one-year-of-mars-orbiter-mission-orbit-release-of-mars/Mars-atlas-MOM.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELink \u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T12:16:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile I congratulate ISRO on the milestone, I can\u0027t help but find this thread\u0027s title to be inappropriately hilarious \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tech Support","CreatedById":89874,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T12:21:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E ahhh, you should hear some of the ISRO scientists talk about their \u0027mom\u0027 and \u0027naughty boy\u0027\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cirocco","CreatedById":100285,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T13:43:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMust... resist.... \u0022your mom\u0022 jokes....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eseriously though, all power to all people at ISRO for making this possible.
