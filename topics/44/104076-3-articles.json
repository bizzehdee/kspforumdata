I\u0027m certainly not an expert, but a purely balistic approach might lack the necessary precision. Afterall, the recovery aircraft has to be quite close in order to perform such a maneuver within a limited window of opportunity. If the stage leaves it\u0027s flight path due to wind or if the forecast isn\u0027t exact they might miss the targeted area by a couple of km. Probably another pro for the c130 over the ch47 due to it\u0027s higher speed, but it still seems risky to rely on an unguided descent\n\nedit: @nibb: THAT would have been one big helicopter O.o But I doubt that this would be even remotely realistic, even with todays technologies\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-14T08:48:56Z\u0022 title=\u002204/14/2015 08:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by prophet\\_01**"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T09:45:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I agree, mid-air retrieval on this scale has never been done, although there was a crazy plan in the 60\u0027s to build a [giant helicopter to recover Saturn V first stages](http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1045/1).\n\u003E \n\u003E I think a C-130 might be more capable.

Also, it lacks range and would need to be operated from a ship, which adds to the cost. Plane recovery was routine in the days of Corona capsules, so the agility and responsiveness must be adequate. The other option is to design a drone helicopter purpose-built for the task, but that wouldn\u0027t be cheap either.\n\nStill, as spectactular as it is, I\u0027m willing to bet that the \u0022SMART recovery\u0022 concept is going to gradually vanish away over time, like flyback boosters and SpaceX\u0027s upper stage recovery did.

Still though, Ariane 6 is not reusable at all and will be used in a similar time frame. I think it\u0027s good that we\u0027re seeing a multitude of very different systems. Not because I think Ariane 6 or Vulcan will really be able to compete, but because it will further underline which general design is the way to go.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what China will do in the coming years. On one hand, they can possibly cut costs in other ways that are not available to western manufacturers so that they don\u0027t need reusability to be competitive.
