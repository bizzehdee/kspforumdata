Radiation is proportional to 1/r\u00B2, but the orbital speed increases as well (at ~1/r, but that\u0027s a rough approximation); thus they stay that close only for a comparably small amount of time. Hence the amount of radiation might be comparable to that of the other parts of the trajectory (still not good if it heightens cancer chance by another 10% per person).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it could be that more radiation in less time increases the risk significantly, e.g. due to the body having no chance to regenerate.
