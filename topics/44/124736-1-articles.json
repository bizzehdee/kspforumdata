And then we get into the rather nebulous area of comparing the \u0022amount of damage\u0022 done by various environmental incidents--most of which can\u0027t be measured in dollars. An extinct species doesn\u0027t have a measurable dollar value, and the amount of damage done by, say, coal and oil is impossible to measure accurately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther, there have been so few nuclear accidents that we can\u0027t make a reliable comparison. In a city where, for example, there hasn\u0027t been a murder in ten years, when that first murder happens it\u0027s a huge news event that draws a lot of attention and makes it appear like the city has a problem--when it doesn\u0027t.

Yeah, nuclear waste is nasty. Though, again, we get into more of that \u0022sounds worse than it is\u0022 business, because the nuclear waste generated in a year by the entire American nuclear power industry weighs around 2,000 tons and would fit in your garage. And yeah, nuclear meltdowns are nasty. But then, few people in here would contest the claim that greenhouse gases are also nasty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt gets right down to a question of \u0022which problem are you willing to put up with in order to avoid the other\u0022 because there\u0027s no way to avoid both.

The more I study and read and research the more I realize that we are still a LONG, LONG way away from a safe reliable reactor that can replace coal as a long term base load generation source. I\u0027ll get really excited from watching one particular video or reading one particular blog only to get just as disappointed from reading another blog or watching another video. It is extremely complicated with numerous factors involved, including startup costs, waste management, and the inevitable shut down and disposal costs. We still have to invest in the research of new materials that can improve the function and safety of the reactors as well as the research into the designs of new reactors. There are advantages and disadvantages. So, in summary, its way above my pay-grade. But, I don\u0027t think we should give up nor exclude any one particular idea. In order to continue the standard of living that we have set for ourselves, we are going to have to explore all of the energy sources that we can, including solar, wind, nuclear, fossil fuel, and other stuff I don\u0027t even know about, as well as my personal favorite, conservation and efficiency.

Reactors can provide large amounts of usable energy from comparatively small amounts of material for construction and fueling, they do not emit carbon dioxide or other damaging materials into the environment outside of the facility, they run 24-7 making it possible to use them without coal and oil for baseload, and they are comparatively safe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the entire history of civilian nuclar energy there has been a total of two accidents in it\u0027s \u0026gt;50 year history that had major civilian impacts, one, according to WHO estimates, caused the deaths of around 2 000 people using the LNT model, and the other killed precisely 0 people not working at the plant, also according to the WHO, and using the LNT model. To put that number in perspective, the WHO estimates approx. 1 million die of air pollution related causes. Now, of course the older designs are... less than good, having been designed over 40 years ago now, but just as CRAY-1 does not reflect on the capabilities of newer computers, the older reactors do not reflect on the capabilities of newer ones. Thus from a safety standpoint, nuclear is acceptable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom a cost standpoint, it is definitely better than wind and solar, both of which, while travelling down the price curve, are still quite expensive and need batteries as backup, a technology that is already quite mature making it improbable that we will see massive price reductions. Wind and solar, being very unreliable, require energy storage, thus batteries are definitely a major portion of any grid involving the use of such energy sources. Another \u0022fun\u0022 thing to note regarding wind and solar is that as the climate changes due to the mess we caused with fossil fuels, the optimal locations for both will change, thus making them even more unpredictable. Nuclear energy on the other hand runs day and night and operates on demand, with current reactors getting a 90-92% capacity factor (installed capacity/average power output), compared to the \u0026lt;30% capacity factors of wind and solar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd lastly, the waste. Nuclear waste is actually one of the more \u0022cool\u0022 things about nuclear energy. The quantity produced is absolutely puny, for fission products, the material actually produced as waste from the reaction, you would get (assuming the products have approximately the same density of uranium) about 1 cubic meter per year per 1000 MWe nuclear reactor assuming a 30% heat to electrical energy conversion efficiency. To put that in perspective, the amount of batteries (assuming a 20 year lifetime and 1 day of battery backup and the energy consumption of a US citizen) needed and the waste produced by their use would be over 3 000 000 cubic meters. While you can afford to store a cubic meter of nuclear waste deep underground in it\u0027s own special containment structure and with multiple redundant barriers, you cannot say that much about 3 000 000 cubic meters of battery waste. Even assuming you recycle as much as possible within reason, you will still be left with huge amounts of waste and wasted energy taking apart each unit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Firwen","CreatedById":140631,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T08:15:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd lastly, the waste.
