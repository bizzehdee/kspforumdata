Please pay attention from now on, Mr. Crown.......\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) The legs are armored, but there is nothing else in the legs except a limited skeleton, so it is still light compared to the tank treads having to support a whopping 60\u002B tons! (Abrams)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) Bicycles are biologically AND mechanically powered. Bad comparison, because a gear and chain system increased speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.) Perhaps, but it is getting closer and closer....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.)

The hits in the \u0022empty\u0022 space are analogous to hits to the limbs of the mech, which even if mostly empty will suffer damage to the structure (monocoques like you describe rely on the skin continuity for strength) as well as the control mechanisms for those limbs. This will seriously impede the mechs ability to continue battle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Hits to the non-critical areas of the mech are complete misses against the tank, which can only be an advantage for the tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I could fold my paper over itself to a greater thickness since I\u0027m covering less area, so the paper has a better chance of stopping any hit to the critical area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Even if 3 above wasn\u0027t true, the critical areas of both objects is equal, but the mech has all that other area where, deny it as you might, hits will affect it. Thus the mech is more vulnerable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Your example doesn\u0027t take into account that the critical area on the tank is low to the ground and more easily hidden behind cover (cover that protects a mech\u0027s legs leaving its torso exposed will protect the everything but the turret of a tank, with no compromise to the tanks ability to maneuver as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) No, they aren\u0027t as these representations are only representing the main bodies of the respective vehicles, counting legs in the mech.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) Yes, but the tank will eventually get hit, and it is more likely to be critical to the tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) Yes, but it is mesh and can barely move compared to my flex armor, which moves to help even more accommodate the blast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.) Actually, hits won\u0027t affect it, as all there is leading from the primary torso (75% of it\u0027s volume is the engine, the rest for the autocannon) a small limb that is flexible mounted on a type of shoulder which itself mounts a Javelin launcher\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.) It doesn\u0027t take cover into account at all for both vehicles. However the tank is wider and longer, so if the tank is caught behind, say a 2 story building longwise it is almost certainly doomed, or width-wise even, as it would need more turning time, whereas the mech can turn it\u0027s legs easily in place.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KASASpace","CreatedById":71352,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-22T03:07:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou\u0027re comparing vehicles of grossly different masses, not a valid comparison.
