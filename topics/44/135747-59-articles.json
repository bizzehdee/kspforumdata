Their website certainly could use some more information and updates about what they are doing though. I have no idea what their capabilities or intentions are besides what I have gathered from the past month or so. However, the claim that they plan to return it to the cape (which I only saw in this thread) just seems a bit odd for a nearly empty stage. All i was doing was questioning it not outright ruling it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said.

No one here is an actual engineer, let alone an engineer at SpaceX. Which means none of you is an actual expert in the field. So before implying something please support it with something. Yes, their website is lacking info, it is because they won\u0027t advertise it as a re-usable rocket until they actually re-use it at least once. They don\u0027t make promises they might not keep. They are still pioneers in spaceflight and are still exploring and developing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo clear up their strategy: the rocket itself has more than enough delta-v to launch something into an inclined prograde orbit, and they did do calculations on how much fuel they can leave in the first stage. Heck, even the 2nd stage is left with some excess fuel in it, because in the future they will re-use the 2nd stage too. The 1st stage mainly gets the rocket up, so it doesn\u0027t have too much horizontal velocity after separation. After it does the boostback, it usess its body like a wing to aim for the barge. By this moment, the atmosphere sufficiently slows it down, and only then does it need to use the engines to land.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
