The radiation concerns seem to have been dealt with adequately, but you still seem to have questions about how the dust reacted to the thrust of the engines. We can give you our best answers as to why we think it happened the way it did, but without another moon landing, we just won\u0027t get the data necessary to find the exact answer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome things we do know: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ethe moon\u0027s gravity is about 1/6ths the Earth\u0027s. This can lead us to believe that any force applied to the extremely light dust will impart a significant dv on the dust, which means the dust will be carried far away from the landing site, which may explain why there is not a obvious dust ring around the nozzle. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ethere is no air on the moon\u0027s surface. Here on Earth, we have a very dense atmosphere, especially near the surface. This produces air resistance which has an extreme effect on objects traveling through the atmosphere at any speed. Things like paper, or dust, or anything that is light weight will appear to gently float to the ground. We can imaging that because there is no air resistance on the moon, and dust that is dropped from a height will seem to fall unnaturally fast, as we are so used to it floating around. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth of these situations can occur. In the instance of the lunar rover, no significant dv was given to the dust, so it would rise, then very quickly accelerate back to the surface thanks to the lack of air resistance to slow it\u0027s acceleration. In the instance of the force of the thrust from the lander, the dust may have been given a significant dv to carry it far from the landing site. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut we didn\u0027t have any cameras on the surface to document these landings as they happened, so we don\u0027t have good data to study to accurately tell you why or why not the dust behaved the way it did, regardless of how smart we may be. The best answer I can give you is to wait for the scientists at NASA to return to their jobs, then send them an email including any questions you may have. As they have direct access to the data from all their landing missions, they\u0027ll be able to most accurately answer your questions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if not enough data currently exists to find these answers, we can always return to the surface to study more. Infact, google will even reward private companies to do so!

Just like how the ISS is giving us valuable knowledge on life support systems, the moon could help us expand that knowledge if we ever intend to colonize another planet, like Mars. We could first send rovers to dig/build us a shelter (like a cave for shielding from radiation) and then practice installing life support systems on the surface to support a long-term visit. The moon is the perfect place to practice colonizing because of it\u0027s proximity and low gravity. So I do feel we will be returning to the moon eventually, but it\u0027s definitely not the highest priority right now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and final note:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LunaTrick\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LunaTrick\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd in the history of aviation, things working perfectly the first time, would be a very rare event.

As an FYI, that thrust you mentioned is at full thrust. That would be a TWR on the moon of 2.0 with a full fuel load, and anyone that\u0027s played KSP can tell you that if you touch down and then shut of your engines when you\u0027re under that much thrust, you\u0027re not on the ground by the time you turn off your engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs others have pointed out, all of this has been debunked thoroughly. If you spent as much time reading the science behind the debunking as you did reading this stuff, you\u0027d realize the same thing I did when I looked into the various claims that we didn\u0027t really go into the moon. I\u0027m not telling you to believe the debunking without research, but trust me, the science behind every \u0022we didn\u0027t go to the moon as reported\u0022 claim I\u0027ve seen has less bearing to real science than your typical Hollywood movie hacker has to the real hackers. They use some of the right buzzwords, maybe a bit of the math, but are blissfully unaware of anything beyond that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe realization I spoke of is that it is easy to come up with a claim that sounds quite reasonable to anyone that doesn\u0027t understand the science the claim is supposed to represent, even if that realization crumbles if anyone with an introductory level understanding of the science involved. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadiation isn\u0027t anywhere near as straightforward as most people think, and you don\u0027t actually have to shield radiation to the point that it\u0027s down to normal background radiation levels. For example, the claims that you\u0027d need feet of lead to stop radiation are ignoring how radiation works. Lead is actually a bad radiation shielding for the types of radiation they\u0027re talking about there. As has been mentioned elsewhere, the types of radiation that lead blocks can be significantly blocked by foil, let alone feet of lead, and for the types that it isn\u0027t good for, other stuff is better by far. So lead would be the worst radiation shielding going. Being on the surface of a celestial object actually shields you from a fair bit of the radiation, and even without that, a round trip to Mars which would take a lot longer than a trip to the moon would leave someone under the federal standard for radiation exposure, and even if they hit the limit, that\u0027s not \u0022OMG you\u0027ve got cancer!\u0022 it\u0027s a 5% increase in the chance of getting cancer. Going through the Van Allen belts are the peak radiation exposure, and the math on that has been done so many times with hard numbers that there\u0027s no real point to hash that out yet again. Every time I\u0027ve seen someone bring up radiation exposure, they\u0027ve either not provided any numbers or provided numbers that no actual scientific authority agrees with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the absense of an atmosphere, dust is going to fall as fast as anything else, and the moon isn\u0027t microgravity. Gravity on the moon is about 1.6 m/s^2, so 80 cm of travel from a standstill in the first second, 240 cm in the second second, etc. So no, there won\u0027t be dust clouds. And unless your experiments were done in a vacuum, then they don\u0027t correlate to what you\u0027re discussing enough to matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolar peaks are a statistical event, not a constant flow, and even during a solar peak, the event rate of anything that would have put any radiation in our direction (they\u0027re not omnidirectional) was low enough that it was very unlikely to happen during the relatively short missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe highest Space shuttle mission \u003Cstrong\u003Eby a large margin\u003C/strong\u003E was the Hubble telescope repair, and lowering their orbit would have meant not repairing the telescope. I think you\u0027ll have to give a reputable link if you expect anyone to consider that anything more than the space version of an urban legend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, if you want your claims to be taken seriously, you\u0027ll need to put a little more work into understanding the science behind the claims. Given how obviously wrong some of these claims are, we\u0027ve got no reason to believe that they aren\u0027t all equally wrong. You say that the photography analysis isn\u0027t your forte, but as we\u0027ve shown, even in the other areas, your understanding of the science is flawed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dharak1","CreatedById":61137,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-13T08:22:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Mars skycrane was pretty high off the ground and had a bit of thrust, it doesn\u0027t surprise me it left marks. Now imagine something with more weight closer to the surface. We have to remember that dust behaves totally different too. These lines went farther because they are in vacuum. On Earth there is air resistance pushing against the gasses coming out of the engine. The footprints are because the landing probably didn\u0027t blow all the dust away.

We\u0027d expect something similar to what you suggested on Earth because any engine firing would create air currents that would push outward from the craft. The 1 atm of air pressure here on Earth plays a big role in air currents. It severely limits vertical movement without impeding horizontal movement, which is why on earth we usually see a ring of dust pushing outward instead of an expanding bubble. Furthermore, the air currents will pick up a lot of nearby dust that isn\u0027t directly affected by the engine thrust. Another major factor to the air currents is the difference in air temperature. Thrust from an engine is usually significantly warmer than the air around it, and after the air heats up, it will begin to create upward currents which will then carry dust upwards after the primary force pushes the dust outwards. After the air cools off, the dust will settle back down. Overall, this will form the ring which will be carried a short distance from the nozzle, then drift upwards a meter or so because of the warm air, then settle back down in a visible ring-shaped pile. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the moon however, with no air, there will be no air currents. So only the dust directly getting affected by the nozzle thrust (which again, is much less than thrust levels we experience on Earth) will drift, and there will be no air pressure to hinder it\u0027s vertical speed, so the moon dust will travel much higher and much further than what we experience on Earth. And finally, because of the lack of air currents, the dust won\u0027t clump up in a nice ring, but it will spread out over a much wider area.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LunaTrick","CreatedById":77902,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-13T08:31:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK.

I have no problem at all with people thinking critically about whether or not the moon landings were a hoax. The problem I find is when they stop thinking critically as soon as their initial criticism produces something they think contradicts the official story. If you\u0027re not thinking \u0022what might I have overlooked or gotten wrong\u0022 until you\u0027re out of arguments and counterarguments, then you\u0027re not following through.

Early on in the segment, one of the people made a statement about the Van Allen belts that anyone that had ever read an encyclopedia entry on them would have known was horribly wrong, and yet was a critical assumption to her theory.

There either was an interaction or there wasn\u0027t.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, I managed to find a resources today from NASA itself responding to questions similar to yours: \u003Ca href=\u0022ftp://ftp.hq.nasa.gov/pub/pao/media/2001/lunar_landing.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eftp://ftp.hq.nasa.gov/pub/pao/media/2001/lunar_landing.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, I already tried to explain this but I\u0027ll try again: dust will not \u0022blow away\u0022 on the moon. Only dust that directly interacts with the thrust from the engine will will be affected, and all neighboring dust will be left alone. This is far different than what happens on Earth. Now, as I can\u0027t find any studies regarding this event, I can\u0027t give you a 100% accurate answer, but I can give you my best answer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Earth, we\u0027d expect the thrust from the engine to generate wind, and the wind in turn would simply blow all neighboring dust away. In a vacuum, the dust will not be affected by any wind. Thrust from the engine will immediately spread out when it leaves the bell, because particles leaving the engine, the propellent, will only experience collisions with themselves. On Earth, the propellent will collide with itself, and the air around the engine, which will in turn greatly limit how much it expands. Without the air, we can be sure the propellent will exit the engine in a generally downward, but random, direction and expand in a mostly uniform circle at a rapid rate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe don\u0027t know how rapid it will expand, but we do know it will expand. And as the propellent expands in its also travels towards the surface where it will soon after collide with the dust on the surface. Here the propellent will collide with dust on the surface over a larger range than expected. Any dust that interacts with the propellent will then \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ebounce\u003C/span\u003E off the surface and leave the area, not forming a \u0022ring of rust\u0022 which is what would later be described as a crater. And since the propellent won\u0027t generate a wind effect as it travels through the surface, \u003Cstrong\u003Efar fewer\u003C/strong\u003E interactions will occur. This is the point I must stress, wind on Earth is the main cause of the dust being blown here on Earth, and that will just not happen on the moon. With far fewer interactions occurring, far fewer dust particles will be affected by the engine thrust, leaving much of the nearby dust unaffected by the event. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther explanation of the bouncing I mentioned earlier. Because on Earth there is 1 atm of air pressure at sea level, a \u0022bounce\u0022 effect would be greatly diminished. But on the moon, with no overhead air pressure, collisions with the surface would bounce off much like how light is reflected off a mirror. Example: On Earth if you blow air at a dusty surface, the air will expand the further away from the source it is, then collide with the surface. After it hits the surface, it will mostly hug the surface as it continues to expand. Had there been any dust on the surface, the dust would then be carried by the air you blew across the ground, gradually dropping out of the weakening air flow and settling on the ground in a visually noticeable pattern. On the moon, we\u0027ll see something very different. If you were to blow air at the moon\u0027s surface at an significantly high speed, then we can assume the majority of the air would make it to the surface. However, once it collides with the surface, it would bounce upwards instead of hugging the surface like it did on Earth. Without the overhead pressure to stop it from bouncing, any dust picked up by the wind would rise into the air and travel very far away (as there is no air pressure to slow it\u0027s travel). The dust would travel through the air like a rock does on Earth. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in conclusion, we can determine:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ethat there will be no cloud of dust, as without air resistance, the dust will continue in it\u0027s direction of travel unhindered, rather than float around as it would on Earth,\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ethat the dust will not settle next to the vehicle either, but will travel much further than it would on Earth, so there will be no ring-like crater forming around the vehicle,\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eand finally, that without the generation of wind, far fewer dust particles will be affected by the thrust, resulting in far fewer visual clues that the thrust had even occurred.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELunaTrick, this is all just a basic attempt at explaining what happened on the moon. I didn\u0027t make any models to run simulations with, I don\u0027t have access to a vacuum chamber for experiments, and I don\u0027t have a degree in physics. I\u0027m just applying basic Newtonian mechanics to particle collisions in a vacuum as a sort of thought experiment. I tried to remain general, and by no means is this the correct solution to your question. This is just my best attempt at explaining why I feel the pictures are accurate representations of the event. Also, I truthfully have no intention of insulting you in any way. At first glance, it did appear as if you were just repeating the same arguments every conspiracy theorist has ever thought of, but as I read through you post I realized you were just interested in the points presented by the hoaxers, and wanted answers to your questions. I very much respect you for that. But again, as I have stated in a previous post, unless someone on this forum as directly working on a Lunar landing mission, much of our answers will be nothing more than speculation.

The ascent engine is also fired at full thrust and has much smaller area.

I was describing the behavior of the propellant after it leaves the bell, not how behaves as it passes through the bell. After it leaves the bell, there will be particle collisions inside the thrust stream (the collisions also happen inside the bell, but the spread will be limited by the bell). On Earth there would also be collision between the air around thrust stream as well, which will act to limit the spread of the particles. These extra collisions will not happen on the surface of the moon, therefore after the particles leave the bell, the collisions will send the particles in an outward direction (still traveling in the direction of the thrust), expanding freely where the expansion would have be limited on Earth. I was just comparing how different the particles would behave in a vacuum. I do not know the degree to which this will occur, however. The particles are traveling very fast so they will quickly collide with the surface before they have time to greatly expand. I just know that the thrust will expand more in a vacuum than it will on Earth. The force of the thrust will still be the same on the engine, but it will be spread out over a wider area than we are used to by the time it hits the ground. It difference may not be that noticeable, but it could be like the difference between a quick burst from a spray paint can inches from a surface, and the difference between a quick burst a foot from a surface.

We have a stream that\u0027s going along the axis of thrust at about 3,000 m/s and expanding at approximately 900m/s.

There were also folks from the international science community as well as foreign military and intelligence organizations who were watching the program very closely, including monitoring the spacecraft from launch to splashdown, intercepting communications from the Moon, and analyzing moon rocks. There are tons of documentation, from blueprints, to meal recipes, to flown artefacts, to procurement contracts for the slightest screw on the Saturn V rocket. The laser reflectors that were left on the surface have been used routinely by astronomers to measure the distance between the Earth and the Moon for decades. There is a lot more data than the handful of photographs that you have seen. All this information is freely available and has been under scrutiny of historians and space geeks from all over the World for decades, yet no credible scientist or organization has ever had any reason the question the authenticity of any of the data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are also pictures of the landing sites taken by the LRO probe that has been orbiting the Moon since 2009, in which you can clearly see the actual LM descent stage, the rover, and even the tracks left by the astronauts walking and driving around, which also happen to match the maps that were included with the Apollo debriefing material 45 years ago. Do you mean that the hundreds of folks who currently work on LRO data at GSFC are still actively faking photographs from LRO today? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo fake the actual landing sites as can be seen today with modern satellites, NASA would have needed to land robots that could deploy flags, ALSEP modules and miles of fake footprints and rover tracks that nobody would have been able to see with the technology of the time, and then return Moon rocks automatically. Do you realize that with 1960\u0027s technology, that would have been harder than actually flying men to lunar surface and back? If they were capable of that, why would they fake footage of engine plumes underneath the LM if they could have simply filmed the same footage with their radio-controlled LM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo keep something as big as fake Moon landings would be harder than actually doing them. You would basically have to spend billions to design everything to make a mission that would be believable by the entire scientific community, and then above that, you would need to add a huge effort to coverup the truth, including bribing and threatening hundreds of people over 50 years, including foreign citizens, intelligence agencies, and politicians from opposing sides. And you really think that none of those people would have spilt the beans after all these years? No whistleblower? No Deep Throat? No KGB? No congressman taking a jab at the administration of the time? No trace or evidence whatsoever? Even on their deathbeds or with the assurance that they would make millions from writing a book about the whole story or selling it to the press? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComing from an administration that can\u0027t even cover up things like Watergate or the Monica Lewinsky affair, which only involved a dozen people or less, I really find it hard to believe. It would have been much harder than actually landing men on the Moon. It also implies that they would have faked the Apollo 13 failure, the inquiries and the expensive delays that came afterwards, and the reworking of Apollo 14. That would have been a particularly far-fetched and stupid thing to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like data in my hands that I can examine.

But obviously the pictures are going to have to come from NASA, there is no choice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo as a regular Joe Layman, I download all the moon photos I could get in one evening. All the missions. I looked into this lack of crater thing. That\u0027s a label I don\u0027t like because I never expected a crater, just evidence of a change. I set aside the fact that as a preteen and teen I was allowed to stay up for all hours of the night watching all the moon footage I could. I witnessed it. I am not like the current generation who learns about it after the fact because of their place in time, I saw it live.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat list of specific photos did not come from some conspiracy site. I made that list myself out of the files I downloaded because I thought they were they best shots to look at for this issue. Some missions didn\u0027t offer the greatest viewing opportunity under the LM, but you can certainly see what\u0027s around it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have not read the NASA PDF provided above, yet. I will. You want to talk science? Then please repeat the experiment. PLEASE look at the pictures I cited. And not to beat a dead horse, but afterwords review the things I said about them, what I found, and what I expected to find, and then we include the historical story line. SEE for yourself WHY someone could come in here and say things that goes against the grain. Gentlemen, I saw both things with my own eyes. I saw the live B\u0026amp;W footage, and I am looking at the archival photos and it still raises an eyebrow. I know what happens if I shutdown my engine too early, even on low gravity Mimnus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I know a good portion of you will say something like, it\u0027s been proven therefore I don\u0027t need to look at it, you\u0027re too lazy to research for yourself, yadda yadda yadda.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I want YOU to understand something, and that is \u003Cem\u003Ewhy\u003C/em\u003E people can think like this. Look at the photos! I swear the ground below the nozzle looks like there has been no interaction \u003Cstrong\u003Eat all\u003C/strong\u003E, regardless of the actual \u0022blast radius\u0022 size arguments, velocities involved, whatever. There was mass. It has to slow down and not gain velocity. And I expect \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E to happen when my thrust, as minor as it is, hits that long undisturbed, dust layer. I think of those very perfectly defined footprints and I know that tells me that fine particle size is needed to leave those sharp 90 degree angles in the flour fine dust that makes up those beautiful footprints. That same kind of dust had to be under the LMs. If it is moved by pressure, I expect to see some pattern or design, or a clearing away; some evidence of a recent change. You never see any of that. In fact the Apollo 11 pic I cite looks like rain droplets have hit the thick dry dust, not a directed blast of some pressure level. Another picture looks like animal footprints under it (and I didn\u0027t say there were any animals involved for those who like to put words in my mouth). But these features are not only immediate to the nozzel but off as far as the edge of the LM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think someone suggested that the LMs came down with some lateral motion. If so, then those 5\u0027 probes should have made some short lines in the ground until the vehicle started dropping straight down. You don\u0027t see any indication of lateral movement from that perspective either. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf science says there would be no change to the surface, fine. I\u0027d find that hard to believe, but would try. If science says there should be a change, then WOW, I don\u0027t see it! That\u0027s where I was at when I came in here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, as a witness to all the live broadcasts, and as one who has looked a long time at those photos I cited, and even AFTER getting the \u0022treatment\u0022 here, I am still going to tell you, and you can quote me \u0022It \u003Cem\u003Elooks like\u003C/em\u003E the LM\u0027s were set in place by a crane, due to the lack of any \u003Cstrong\u003Evisual\u003C/strong\u003E disturbance to the areas immediate to the nozzle.\u0022 It just looks damn odd and unexpected to my eye. And I would really like the reader to understand that someone could come to that conclusion, based solely on what is, and what isn\u0027t in the photos cited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease look.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS Please stop trying to tie me to a fake moon landing. My stance was this. The photos of the LM don\u0027t add up. That just says the photos are in question - not the landing. And that we probably landed on the moon, but I suggested that maybe it wasn\u0027t Neil. Patriotic men will do what their country asks them to do. All that suggestion requires is a swap of personnel and following orders. It\u0027s not my burden to defend a hoax theory, because I never said that. I do not require secret Saturn Vs. You do, You\u0027re going there. I am not. Secrecy? Compartmentalization? I would reference the Manhattan project. Arguably the second most important thing that America ever did. Keeping big secrets is a piece of cake, when you do it like they did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI question some of the archival photos, and the Van Allan radiation thing. That is as far as I am willing to go. I can be convinced. But I also like independent verification whenever possible. I cannot do that with space radiation, but I \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E do that with photos. However, the photos raised more questions than they solved. I am curious about a few other things too, but will probably no longer ask about them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-14T22:29:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LunaTrick\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LunaTrick\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have looked into terrestrial radiation sources, including isotopes found in nuclear fallout, how to shield from that, half-lives, where my local nuke plants are located, what the seasonal prevailing winds are for my state.

There are people living in areas that exceed the official recommended radiation exposure limits without any statistically relevant health effects (which isn\u0027t to say that this is the case in all areas that exceed said limit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LunaTrick\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LunaTrick\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhen you cite NASA, you do the same thing.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, I\u0027m telling you to go read what people have said about this \u003Cstrong\u003Eand check their science\u003C/strong\u003E.

The moon is an alien world for all intents and purposes, and until you take that into account, what we see or don\u0027t see doesn\u0027t matter. You seem certain that there should be more pronounced visible effects. Others here have a different opinion. You\u0027re trying to apply common sense, they\u0027re trying to apply science (that\u0027s not a dig, they could still be wrong). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LunaTrick\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LunaTrick\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESEE for yourself WHY someone could come in here and say things that goes against the grain.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, I said a message or two ago that I understood why people would believe in hoax claims. Given an environment that is alien, it\u0027s very easy to make claims based on things that feel like common sense that don\u0027t stand up to scientific scrutiny. If you\u0027re not a scientist that has studied this stuff, it can very easily not make sense, and I say that as a person quite willing to admit this is not my area of expertise, nor do I consider myself any kind of authoritative opinion on the subject.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LunaTrick\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LunaTrick\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf science says there would be no change to the surface, fine.
