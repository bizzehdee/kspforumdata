Yes, they can be dangerous if built poorly. Yes, Hindenburg will happen again if precautions aren\u0027t taken during flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut hydrogen airships\u00A0aren\u0027t exactly large floating fuel-air-bombs. They\u0027re quite durable, for a few reasons:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Inside the airship\u0027s envelope, the\u00A0gas is kept at barely above local atmospheric pressure. When the vessel climbs, the envelope inflate to compensate. This means if there are any leaks (say, some bloke aimed a machine gun at\u00A0it), leaks would happen slowly and, due to the enormous volume of the envelope (and their pressurized hydrogen stores) , pressure would go down slowly as well. If the leaking gas caught fire, given a fireproof envelope, it would not bring down the ship, since the slight overpressure ensures that outside air do not get into the envelope. It\u0027s still an emergency, since the vessel is on fire, but most likely\u00A0survivable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-The gas inside the balloon is pure hydrogen. This, on it\u0027s own, will not burn; it has to be mixed in with outside air to be able to burn. Even if an explosive charge is set off inside the envelope, all it would do is send a pressure wave spike inside the envelope, popping off safety valves and/or overpressure patches (sections of the envelope designed to fail if pressure exceeds a safe limit). Once on the ground, these are easily repaired and patched over, and the airship is good to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-The airship envelope is a soft material that won\u0027t set off on-contact explosives. Explosive ammunition like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raufoss_Mk_211\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0won\u0027t be set off on impact, simply punching holes in the fabric smoothly and go unmolested all the way to the outer side, unless it hits something solid inside. Even if it does hit something, pure hydrogen gas do not burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo bring down an airship quickly, one would need a warhead that can cut through large swaths of fabric, like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Continuous-rod-warhead.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Continuous-rod-warhead.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would immediately drop the internal pressure of the airship, while also letting a lot of hydrogen mix with the air.
