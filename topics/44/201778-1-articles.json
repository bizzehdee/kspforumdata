Both of which can depend on many factors. Supply, for example will be influenced by the cost of the portal system, the cost of whatever mining and refining gear used to extract the\u00A0propellant and, possibly the physical quantities of propellant available for extraction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen you get into the whole political situation. Is there a free market in propellant portals, with multiple companies in competition? That might lower prices but,\u00A0 at\u00A0first sight, it\u00A0seems unlikely, given that the portal\u00A0 system would appear to be a significant strategic asset, which suggests government oversight and maybe outright control. How benign is that government? How many governments are there? Each government will probably want its own portal/propellant network or at least to have guaranteed access to one, in much the same way that present day governments want access to a satellite navigation system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a somewhat related note, what sort of flow rates can you get through a portal and is there any temperature limit for matter transmitted through a portal? Because I was wondering if it would be possible to effectively\u00A0have remote spacecraft engines. Build the engine next to the propellant depot and then literally fire it into one end of the portal. Hot gases get transmitted across to the spacecraft and out through the other end of the portal. Maybe have the portal exit in the nozzle throat of the spacecraft engine and then have the nozzle function as normal to direct and accelerate the outgoing gas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCouple of interesting follow up thoughts.\u00A0Depending on how the portal network is set up (can it be reconfigured on the fly?) it might be possible to have multiple spacecraft \u0027timesharing\u0027 on the same engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, this might solve a problem that you\u0027ve previously brought up here - how to have personal spaceships when each spaceship can be a dangerous weapon. Remote engines effectively cede control of your ship to the portal network operator, so you\u0027re not going anywhere significant in your personal ship unless you have authorization.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-17T08:44:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell the cheapest would be methane and oxygen, might even air.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nOr as KSK proposed use an remote engine.\u00A0 This offers some interesting options like simply putting portals in the depths of the sea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever to make this a bit more realistic:\u00A0the sender portal will require the power like\u00A0the difference in kinetic energy between the rocket and the sender station.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nIts not an totally free lunch you just don\u0027t need the fuel tanks and to lift them with rocket engines.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nTherefore you will want high performance fuel, one problem with pre burning the fuel is that you can not use this to cool the engine on the rocket.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nI probably use methane and oxygen to get to orbit and hydrogen and oxygen in space.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-17T08:57:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSkype, tram, maglev.
