Sometimes they are (or include) a shower of sparks while in real life, a fireball is often a minor part of an explosion (though not always, as is the case with incendiaries, like phosphorus, uranium, gelled fuels like napalm, etc). The real devastation from an explosion often comes from the force (overpressure) of the blast and the flying debris and shrapnel. Very rarely will explosions look like what they do in real life, an expanding cloud of dust and debris with very little light \u2014 and very little left behind (Grenades are very prone to this in movies, since even a \u0022pineapple\u0022 frag grenade can produce a napalm-bomb\u00A0explosion that throws people around, with ironically, no fragments) . Also, most explosions on TV also burn at a ridiculously slow rate compared to what they would on real life, which conveniently enables one to\u00A0outrun it. In addition, the more powerful the explosion, the more quickly it uses up or blows apart the reactants involved in any combustion, so there\u0027s an inverse relationship between how powerful the blast is and how much fire there is. Oh, and fireballs in space. Perhaps some chemical mixtures can make fireballs in a near vacuum, but it\u0027s unlikely most space explosions are like that. This occurs in 90% of all onscreen explosions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the explanation here is utterly pragmatic.

The only problem is that\u00A0none\u00A0of the shown species are native to French Polynesia (Marine iguanas are native to the Galapagos, Komodo dragons are native to Indonesia, the Chinese water dragon is native to mainland Southeast Asia, the green iguana is native to Central and South America, and bearded dragons are native to Australia)\u00A0In fact, French Polynesia has no reptile species, native or otherwise, making Godzilla\u0027s origin something of a mystery. Also, despite the movie claims the origin of Godzilla is from the French nuclear test on French polynesia (\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#222222;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EPhilippe and his colleagues planned\u00A0to cover up their country\u0027s role in the nuclear testing that created Godzilla in the first place)\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0the footage shown instead was\u00A0the Operation Crossroads nuclear test (Specifically \u003Cem\u003EAble\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0and \u003Cem\u003EBaker\u003C/em\u003E test), which is conducted by US and located on Bikini Atoll, almost 6000 kilometers away\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n4.\u00A0When all the destruction from Godzilla\u0027s first appearance is looked over, the MetLife building is seen with a huge hole through it, implying that Godzilla somehow jumped through it. It looks cool, but it\u0027s still difficult to believe that it would be standing after that, especially with the entire middle section essentially gone. The remaining upper section of the building being held up by the perimeter structural members would have buckled almost immediately.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n5. During the first helicopter chase, Manhattan doesn\u0027t have extremely high, Coruscant-style corridors of skyscrapers taller than Godzilla that stretch for blocks and blocks. Also, the way the movie potrays Apache helicopter is wrong on so many levels. First of all,\u00A0Sidewinder missiles\u00A0aren\u0027t possible to mount on an Apache, the warheads on Sidewinders are\u00A0tiny\u00A0compared to, say, tank shells. They contain only a couple of pounds of explosive, and wouldn\u0027t cause\u00A0monumental damage\u00A0to any building they hit; they would in no way would cause the top of the Chrysler Building to be chopped off, and probably wouldn\u0027t hurt Godzilla either (The Chrysler Building\u0027s destruction itself, while highly memorable, still sees the spire float \u003Cem\u003Every\u00A0slowly\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eand unconvincingly\u003C/em\u003E off its base, and then flattening like a pancake when it hits the streets). Anti-tank missiles like the Hellfire would be more practical; Sidewinders are designed for small, fast-moving aircraft.\u00A0Apaches also don\u0027t have a pair of guns bracketing the cockpit; they have a single 30mm chaingun in a chin mount beneath the front of the fuselage. Ironically, attempts WERE made to increase the Apache\u0027s air to air capabilities by making it able to launch the Sidewinder, complete with test firings. These were ceased in favor of a modified Stinger missile design (also a heat-seeking design; every Stinger variant after the FIM-92A, including all ATAS variants, uses the same seeker head used in the AIM-9X Sidewinder).\u00A0The Apaches is also depicted to carry far more weapons than realistically possible; real Apaches have two wing-mounted hardpoints that traditionally carry 70mm Hydra rocket pods on the inner pylons and AGM-114 Hellfire missiles in racks of eight on the outer pylons, with a 30mm M230 chaingun under the nose. The movie Apaches feature longer wings, fitting two sets of Hydra rocket pods on each wing, a Hellfire missile rack with wing-tip mounted Sidewinder missiles and forward facing chainguns under the cockpit windows, with the aforementioned undernose chaingun still there but unused. The film Apaches are also depicted as maneuvering more like jet aircraft, with sharp banking maneuvers while flying straight and flying forwards at high speeds, with multiple helicopters flying around each other with precision.\u00A0The helicopter pilots seem to always stay at mouth-level of the monster they\u0027re attacking, despite the fact that Apaches can fly as high as 20,000 feet above sea level, meaning there was no reason for them to be flying that low to begin with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n6. The idea that Godzilla can disappear by burrowing into New York\u0027s subway system and sewers is ridiculous; the subway tunnels are not that deep under the streets, with the deepest station being 180 feet underground. Godzilla would have to burrow\u00A0past\u00A0the subway tunnels into the ground underneath to remain hidden, as his size would mean he would be disturb and collapse the streets and would be easily visible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n7. Godzilla is also shown diving into the Hudson River, where he is engaged by three US Navy submarines. The Hudson River is shallow; it can be anywhere from 32 to 200 feet deep at most depending on location, yet Godzilla is shown swimming well below the surface, and is nowhere close to the bottom as if he were out in the middle of the ocean. There is no way submarines would be able to conduct operations in the Hudson as well. On a side note, if you pause the movie at the right moment during the submarine scene, you can see that\u00A0Navy officers on the submarines that engage Godzilla are shown wearing \u0022SSBN\u0022 hats. SSBN is the US Navy designation for a nuclear submarine, which would be far too big and impractical for operations in the Hudson. A fast attack submarine (SSN) would be more appropriate given the situation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n8. The F/A-18 pilot that destroys Madison Square Garden is shown disengaging master arm and selecting\u00A0LGBs which stand for \u003Cem\u003Elaser-guided bombs\u003C/em\u003E. However he is shown selecting his plane\u0027s AGM-84 Harpoon missiles and stating that he has a good laser track on the target. The Harpoon is a radar-guided, anti-ship missile, not laser-guided. The Harpoon missiles that the F/A-18s use are also woefully impractical for destroying a large building, and would not be effective against a large stationary target such as Madison Square Garden, as the Harpoon is designed for anti-ship use. Harpoons are also not practical for engaging land targets; their seeker heads are designed for use over water, which has minimal obstacles and radar interference. Ground terrain creates a chaotic radar picture, which can confuse a Harpoon\u0027s seeker head. A variant of the Harpoon was developed for ground targets, but it didn\u0027t enter service until 2000, two years after movie\u0027s release. The F/A-18 squadron leader says to his wingmen before launching his missiles \u0022save your Mavericks\u0022, referring to the AGM-65 Maverick air to ground missile. However, when shots of the planes are shown, none of the F/A-18s are shown carrying any such missiles. The lead F/A-18 is the only one that deploys Harpoons to destroy Madison Square Garden, yet without returning to base to resupply, is able to fire two more salvos of Harpoons from his underwing pylons at Godzilla on the Brooklyn Bridge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n9. Although the filmmakers apparently tried to make Godzilla more realistic in his design, ironically his more dinosaur-like design is far\u00A0less\u00A0plausible than the old bulky design. The traditional Godzilla design has pillar-like legs and is built in an upright stance with a low-center of gravity, with massive thighs and thick tail support that you\u0027d expect for an animal weighing thousands of tonnes. This Godzilla has a sleek, raptor-like body held horizontally that basically threw all remaining logic out the window. No 300-foot tall bipedal animal would be able to hold a horizontal position all of the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n10.\u00A0The US Army inquiring what a Frenchman is doing at the scene of the clawed freighter. The problem? It\u0027s in Tahiti, a\u00A0French\u00A0overseas territory. The\u00A0US troops\u00A0are the ones who shouldn\u0027t be there. No wonder the French sent their secret service after them. Also, during the \u0022Godzilla\u0027s footprint\u0022 scene, a geiger counter is shown beeping around the footprint, which implies it has a trace of radiation. With how long Godzilla spends tromping about Manhattan, he\u0027d have turned it into a uninhabitable\u00A0ghost island\u00A0if he were at all radioactive like his Japanese namesake (And indeed, the original Godzilla WAS radioactive). And with the leftover fallout from the nuclear bomb tests, he should be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022

There is no way a human pregnancy test would work on a lizard, much less a giant radioactive lizard, as human (and mammal) pregnancy tests are searching for the presence of a hormone called \u003Cem\u003EChorionic Gonadotrophin\u003C/em\u003E, which is only produced in placental animals, as the \u0027chorion\u0027 is another word for the placenta.

So its clearly similar to something conserved among tetrapods. Now a more modern test would use an antibody, not injecting bodily fluid into a frog and seeing if the hormones inside cause it to lay eggs. So, assuming that there are homologous hormones in the reptiles (as the hormones even have an effect in Frogs), and that the antibody used is cross reactive, its at least plausible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know how specific the antibodies are in modern tests, nor how similar the hormones are in reptiles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n3.

During the first helicopter chase, Manhattan doesn\u0027t have extremely high, Coruscant-style corridors of skyscrapers taller than Godzilla that stretch for blocks and blocks. Also, the way the movie potrays Apache helicopter is wrong on so many levels. First of all,\u00A0Sidewinder missiles\u00A0aren\u0027t possible to mount on an Apache, the warheads on Sidewinders are\u00A0tiny\u00A0compared to, say, tank shells. They contain only a couple of pounds of explosive, and wouldn\u0027t cause\u00A0monumental damage\u00A0to any building they hit; they would in no way would cause the top of the Chrysler Building to be chopped off, and probably wouldn\u0027t hurt Godzilla either (The Chrysler Building\u0027s destruction itself, while highly memorable, still sees the spire float \u003Cem\u003Every\u00A0slowly\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eand unconvincingly\u003C/em\u003E off its base, and then flattening like a pancake when it hits the streets). Anti-tank missiles like the Hellfire would be more practical; Sidewinders are designed for small, fast-moving aircraft.\u00A0Apaches also don\u0027t have a pair of guns bracketing the cockpit; they have a single 30mm chaingun in a chin mount beneath the front of the fuselage. Ironically, attempts WERE made to increase the Apache\u0027s air to air capabilities by making it able to launch the Sidewinder, complete with test firings. These were ceased in favor of a modified Stinger missile design (also a heat-seeking design; every Stinger variant after the FIM-92A, including all ATAS variants, uses the same seeker head used in the AIM-9X Sidewinder).\u00A0The Apaches is also depicted to carry far more weapons than realistically possible; real Apaches have two wing-mounted hardpoints that traditionally carry 70mm Hydra rocket pods on the inner pylons and AGM-114 Hellfire missiles in racks of eight on the outer pylons, with a 30mm M230 chaingun under the nose. The movie Apaches feature longer wings, fitting two sets of Hydra rocket pods on each wing, a Hellfire missile rack with wing-tip mounted Sidewinder missiles and forward facing chainguns under the cockpit windows, with the aforementioned undernose chaingun still there but unused. The film Apaches are also depicted as maneuvering more like jet aircraft, with sharp banking maneuvers while flying straight and flying forwards at high speeds, with multiple helicopters flying around each other with precision.\u00A0The helicopter pilots seem to always stay at mouth-level of the monster they\u0027re attacking, despite the fact that Apaches can fly as high as 20,000 feet above sea level, meaning there was no reason for them to be flying that low to begin with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t watched the film since 1998, I remember thinking how dumb it was that the helicopters never flew up... but... what you describe... holy **** that sounds bad, so I looked for images:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConcept art shows the apachies with just 4 underwing pylons: https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc3ZjAzYjctMDhlNC00Yzc4LTkzYTAtZWViYzIwY2I2OWQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjQyMDMzNzc@._V1_.jpg\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfine...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere I see 4 rocket pods, and tip mounted sidewinders: https://c8.alamy.com/compfr/bpgdp4/mise-de-larmee-de-piege-pour-monster-godzilla-1998-bpgdp4.jpg\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s ... ok, tip mounted sidewinders were never adopted, but they existed. 4 rocket pods (2 per wing) is fine, I don\u0027t see the additional hellfire rack on each with that you describe... but its a bad picture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, I don\u0027t think that is bad science fiction... its just inaccurate.
