Last I checked, weather models go off of weather balloons, not satellite images - so attempting to model Venus would require sending thousands of balloons throughout the Venusian atmosphere that would have to survive at least a year of extraterrestrial turbulence, chemicals, and radiation. Studying Venus would be fascinating, but by the time we figure out how to study Venus we will already have tools needed to understand our own planet without the need for extraplanetary exploration. Tools like, satellite soundings, satellite calibrated models, and quantum/photon/organic computer models, are all already in the prototype stage. Wait 20 years and we will have an unprecedented understanding of our atmosphere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe benefit to be gained from studying Venus is a complete unknown.
