Having end, or edges, means non-isotropic (you can always point on that end - end is a well-defined direction in that case). The universe must remain unbound - finite or infinite is another story. Having an end in time is also another story.\n\nFor those who want to fiddle with it mathematically, try fiddling with [friedmann equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann_equations) and all the other equation derived from it. Quite easy as long as you know calculus and it\u0027s still single-component universe.
