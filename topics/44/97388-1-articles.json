During Apollo, the Saturn program had nearly unlimited funds, so to solve a problem, you would just throw more people and resources at it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, contrary to what many people think, engineering tasks today take longer than they did in the 60\u0027s. Today, we have computers, CAD/CAM, fast prototyping and all sorts of technological aids, but on the other hand, everything is much more complex. We have a much deeper understanding of how things work, and as our systems become more complex, a lot of design work has to go into the interfaces and interactions between various systems. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn example is computers. In the 60\u0027s, the Apollo CM computer was very basic. It only had a keypad input system and a few interfaces with various other systems. It had a tiny processor and the software was only a few kilobytes of assembler code. It probably took a small team a couple of years to build it from scratch. Testing was easy, because it was so simple. By comparison, the computer system on Orion will be a network of several specialized calculators connected together through several layers of networking protocols, built on decades of experience in computer networks. Each sensor will have it\u0027s own interface controlled by hardware and firmware. Software is written in object-oriented languages, running on a real-time operating system, with specialized libraries, and all built on several layers of abstraction before you get down to adressing the actual hardware registers. It\u0027s several of orders of magnitude more complex than old systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also the decision making process. During the Saturn V design, if a team had a question, they would go see Von Braun, run the numbers with him, and they would have their answer the same day. No single person is in charge of a design any more. Each design decision has to go through meetings, reviews, approvals with teams from various systems. Nowadays, everything is \u0022designed by committee\u0022 and has to follow \u0022quality control principle\u0022. The result is, in principle, a more rational design. The main aim of quality control is to create accountability and traceability to ensure that procedures are followed. The role of quality procedures is to ensure \u0022customer satisfaction\u0022, which means adherence to requirement specifications. So yes, a lot of the testing is done by computers nowadays, but designing those tests typically takes as much effort as designing the system under test. The test systems need to go through their own reviews and validation processes to make sure that they are testing the proper parameters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yes, people will complain about bureaucracy and red-tape, but most of that overhead is a simple necessity. If you cut the red-tape, you start introducing risks that can be very expensive to fix later.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-22T09:11:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Camacha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Camacha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt is not the suggestion that money might have been tight that bothers me, but that the Soviets could not do basic calculations and ended up with projects that were more expensive \u003Cem\u003Ebecause\u003C/em\u003E of the lack of money.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I never said anything about \u0027calculations\u0027, I said testing and test equipment.
