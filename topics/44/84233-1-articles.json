Another user here said that the proposed Europa Clipper probe may not have the ice-penetrating radar on board when and if it takes off (too heavy compared to the rest of the instruments). This discovery might change their mind or perhaps they can engineer a lighter IPR. I totally agree about it being a good thing to examine in the future. I really hope they put an ice-penetrating radar on a rover if there is a decision to land on Europa. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the post!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RogueMason","CreatedById":45069,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-10T09:05:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomeone\u0027s enthusiastic \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is interesting stuff, though, and maybe at some point in the future, I could be one of those who looks at it in more depth; I\u0027m a geology student aiming to do vulcanology and planetary geology.
