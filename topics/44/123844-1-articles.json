Does this change at all the \u0027mass\u0027 equation, what about dark matter, is this \u0027dark\u0027 matter suddenly made visible (how much does this contibute to the mass of intergalactic space). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs these elements relatively increase, is it easier to form galaxies, smaller galaxies and dimmer stars that are harder to detect. If we get to the point that the elements are dilute will they form jupiter like objects that are virtually invisible at our distance? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery time you see one of these links you should be able to form at least a couple of questions in your head. If 2015 TB145 passes close to earth how good of a target is it for exploration or exploitation?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
