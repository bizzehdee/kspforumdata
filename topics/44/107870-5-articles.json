The Burj is not a scientific device, it is incredibly crude compared to things that are. Did you check out what the LHC cost? It is almost exactly as expensive as the James Webb telescope. You know why it is that expensive? Partly because of its size, but mostly because it had to be build to incredibly demanding and exact standards.\n\nLol, you dont realize that your same argument is giving me the reason to me?\n\nOur you really think that the JWST should cost the same than the LHC??? Yeah I dont wanna hear the answer... \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Stop turning your own misunderstanding into arguments, please.\n\nIs that your argument?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E If you think the JWST is \u0022just a few mirrors,\u0022 there is no helping you. It\u0027s incredibly precise, as are all scientific telescopes. It\u0027s also sensors, power, monitoring, communications, reliability (you can\u0027t repair it, you can easily do repairs to a tower). Frankly, I think you have no clue what\u0027s involved in a scientific project.\n\nIncredibly precise?? So they are very good doing calculations.. Why they estimate the total cost on 1.2b to 3billions when the design was finish? Why in the 2000 they did an estimation that it would be launch in the 2007 to 2010?\n\nIncredibly precise? The same goes for telescopes in earth.. they are much much bigger, they need adaptive optics deforming mirrors in real time, they are all build in top of montains, many in earthquake zones, as all those in chile. The country with the hardest earthquakes on the world, they need to counter the earth rotation and temperature variations.\n\nYou can add the cost of the hardest things about JWST and still is impossible to reach that cost, at least you are dealing with the most inneficient way to do things. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E There weren\u0027t that many engineers on the Burj Khalifa.\n\nI only know this, just for the Exterior cladding of Burj Khalifa, 380 engineers was involve.\n\nIn the peak construction time, there was 12000 workers (all categories) in the site.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s because almost no aspects of it are new in any way\n\n???? There always was a world competition about who had the tallest building. It was always very tight, they always break records with few meters of difference until the Burj come. From 500 meters, they go to 880 meters. And you think that it does not require any new technology? ......\n\n\u003E \n\u003E And the engineers that were there command a much lower salary than those in aerospace\n\nYou have not evidence.. Also you will not find all the people who work in the Burj or JWST with their respective salaries to compare, also is pointless, because we knew that all that money was spent due 18 years of time lost. What I want to said, that this could be done by 1/10 of the price if somebody as Elon Musk would be in charge, he knows how take care the money.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere is something very wrong about how NASA is doing things.\n\nThe missions needs to be time-based, get back to \u0027acceptable risk\u0027 and allow NASA to shuck off the modern \u0027zero defects\u0027 mentality and the tentacles of bureaucracy and regulatory constraints that infect much of government-funded science.\n\nTake a look to the SSC project, costelation program and all other programs who was canceled but this failed way to do things.\n\nIn nasa all scientist are delusional about that does not matter how much time or money they spent due its inefficiency, they think is all justified. Nasa keeps in secret all the missions who had to be skipped due the extra money spent by the JWST.\n\n20 years to plain a mission is not acceptable! I am sure that with all the new tech discoveries done in that time, they can redesign the whole telescope to comply the mission with a much more cheap way to do it.\n\nAnd many of you are defending that same inefficiency that would harm the same NASA and it will delay all new missions.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-09T16:20:40Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2015 04:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AngelLestat**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T16:32:25Z","Content":"Because scientists, engineers and the like don\u0027t expect things like JWSTto get cut so easily.\n\nSometimes cutting funds ends up increasing the cost."},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T16:53:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yes, but that step must be taken.
