Scientists have finally started to acknowledge that anthropomorphism may not that un-scientific when applied to animals. They have brains with very similar structures and properties to our own (especially the mammals), and exhibit similar behaviors. Animals brains feeling certain emotion states are affected by the same neurochemicals as our brains are; functional MRIs show that the same brain regions are responsible for the same perceptions and behaviors in humans and animals.
