To levitate magnetically you need inhomogeneous medium-strong external fields. The geomagnetic field is too weak and locally too homogeneous. In a homogeneous external field, a magnet can only produce torque, not force.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Winter Man","CreatedById":11358,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-01T10:13:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFlux pinning, he means.
