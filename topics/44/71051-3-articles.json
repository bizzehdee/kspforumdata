This is reasonably backed by history but there is no evidence to assume it will hold true indefinitely and significant evidence it is now not holding true anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe introduction of the steam engine and industrial machines first affected agriculture. Automated thrashers, cotton pickers, combines rendering most agriculture jobs obsolete decades to centuries ago. Agriculture employed (or enslaved) over 70% of the America\u0027s population back in 1800\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday it only accounts for 2% of the labor force, yet produces enough food for over 60 times the 1800 population (not including food relief or sales to other countries around the world). So if agriculture went from 70% to 2%, all the workers had to go somewhere and they did: into manufacturing. But by 1950 the so called golden age of US manufacturing 35% of the labor force was working in factories, today that number is 9%. Yet US manufacturing has only risen in production and is still the worlds largest manufacturing center in dollar produced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday 80% of the labor force in the USA is in the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CService sector\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, but automation is making inroads in that as well. In both Federico Pistono book \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CRobots will Steal Your Jobs but that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s OK\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 and Martin Ford book \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThe Lights in the Tunnel: Automation, Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 they provide a break down of the most common jobs in the USA today. For example cashiers, 2nd most common job is 2.24% of all American jobs, but now self-checkout lanes are being installed and can cut down the number of cashiers by at least 75%. Truck drivers (the most common job in the USA) are 2.61% but automated trucks will likely start taking those jobs as well. Even if a truck driver is required in the automated truck as backup the driver could sleep behind the wheel while the truck drives to its destination without having to stop so the driver can sleep, allowing fewer drivers to do more deliveries. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CNo these people will move on to new fields\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 so the anti-Luddite claims. What new fields are there? In the list of jobs from most common to least you have to go down to 34th on the list to get to a career that has not existed more then 70 years ago: Computer Technican/Programmer at 0.74% of the job market.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell maybe people working in service today could get work in intellectual and skilled labour fields. Unfortunately there are in fact a plethora of inroads automation is making in those fields as well: pharmacist replaced by robots, software that is replacing paralegals and lawyers in document review, software that can write journalistic sports and basic business reports, image recognition software that replaces radiologist. It is argued that these things augment and assist people in these fields but if automation helps one person do more of a task then would it not mean that now less people need to do those tasks?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother way to look at this is as a ratio of number of products produces divided by number of people needed to produce said products. Over the centuries this ratio has been going up in general for most products due to automation, but demand went up to match. As a result everyone had been able to get a job even with more and more automation because automation just means more products per producing person. Everyone can be productive because productivity was matched by demand, but can this stay true forever? Every product requires some amount of physical resources and energy to make as well as demand from a limited number of end users. Lets look at energy (as material resources are just a matter of how much energy is needed to to extract, refine and move them): For the last 3 centuries world energy consumption has been growing relatively continuously by ~3% per year. Right now it is at 15\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D10^12 watts (15 Terawatts), at 3% growth it would be at 150 TW by 2091 or 10 times as much in 78 years! By 2345 our energy consumption would be equal to ALL the energy in sunlight hitting the earth (2.7\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D10^17 W)! Even if we could produce all that power by nuclear fusion or something the waste heat would exceed solar heating of the planet! The surface temperature of the earth would raise to boiling, literally boiling in just a few years from our activity alone! If we keep projecting 3% growth by the year 3058 humanities energy consumption would exceed the energy output of the entire sun (3.8\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D10^26 W)! And by the year 3876 humanities energy consumption would exceed the output of every single star in the galaxy (3.8\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D10^37 W)! Hence why there is no such thing as sustainable growth, it is PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE! Pistono does a good job explaining this exponential growth problem but fails to really connect it to automation, I will now do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThankfully world total energy consumption is starting to stagnate (actually falling in 2009!) and consistently falling in many developed countries. World population growth is slowing (and will hopefully plateau this century, and thus save future generations from mass starvation or heat death as mentioned above) and some developed countries even have negative population growth. But though that may save us from physical limits of energy and matter its not good for production. How are we to produce more products if there is not enough power and raw materials to make them and consumers to buy them? If automation keeps growing the ratio but the number of products can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t keep going up, then number of people needed to make them must go down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine for a moment a restaurant where the owner gets a machine to replace most if not all the workers, anyone that has worked at a McDonalds as a teenager can tell you that it would not be very hard to replace the assembly line of human burger makers with a machines that cooks the meat paddies, drops them on the bread buns, drops down pickles, lettuce, tomatoes and squirt of condiments. Now lets say the workers ran off to start restaurants of their own using the same model. Thus multiplying the number of restaurants, everyone gets a high paying \u0022job\u0022 as a restaurant owner but would there be enough consumers for them all? Agriculture has experience several fold increases in products to producers ratio but the number of consumers has increased to match it so the ratio has increased much less if we look at it from a products to consumer ratio rather the products to producers ratio. Still it increased enough that only a tiny fraction needs to work in that field now. As is Americans are eating way too much, many are morbidly obese and dying of diabetes and heart disease: we would need to institute real vomitoriums to get people to \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cconsume\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 more food! But this scenario does not just play out with foods. Imagine cellphone makers replace all there laborers with machines, and that magically those laborers got the education to design new cellphones and manage new cellphone companies, with a production to R\u0026amp;D ratio of greater then 100:1, could we all stand to buy 100 cell phones to keep all those new cell phone companies afloat? This logic can be extended to all products all people even the filthy rich don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t buy incredible amounts of stuff like a kleptomaniac on speed! Everyone\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s (unless mentally disturbed and/or on drugs) consumption will become satiated with enough supply. And because population growth is slowing and will hopefully plateau production will eventual reach the limit of consumer saturation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow some may argue that automation can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t take ALL jobs, well at present and for the near future that seems true. Most automation is done by at best Weak Artificial Intelligence: very \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Csmart\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 at a specific task and completely incompetent at anything else. The IBM\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Watson supercomputer and DeepQA program can and has trumped the best humans at answering even cryptic questions from memorized knowledge, it certainly is smart at that and will likely replaced tech support workers and research aids, but it can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t create new data, or assemble a product or drive a car. Other WAIs though can do each one of those task from Self-evolving software that discovers new technologiess, to image recognizing factor robots, to self driving cars. Yet WAIs can only do those tasks they are specifically programmed and built for: they can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t think about or are even \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Caware\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 of anything else, they have no consciousness. A Strong Artificial Intelligence that could solve or adapt to any problem a human can and/or could qualify as conscious is likely decades away, and some theologians and philosophers say its impossible because of some supposed mystical and supernatural property of the human brain (aka the soul). SAI though is not nessassary: machines don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t need to take all jobs, just enough, fast enough, its simply a matter of automation taking jobs and incomes faster then they can be replaced. Imagine if say 30% of job force are forever safe from automation, that would mean 2/3 of the population would be unemployed and unemployable! If we assume everyone could move to doing what jobs that are left and that somehow those remaining fields could grow to fill everyone\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s employment needs its likely most of those jobs that are left would not be high paying or desirable, as is the service sector switch for most workers has had detrimental affects on the economy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine machines will soon replace most, but not all service jobs, what jobs are left? Maintaining the machines? Sure but only a few people are needed to do that verse all the number of people who did those jobs the machines replaced. Ok how about jobs as engineers, biochemist, inventors\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 but those require extensive educations, above average intelligence and creativity. Ok how about artist and craftsmen? Again you the need for creativity, rarefied skill and talent, not enough people will be around to buy all those arts and crafts. There won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be more people having plumbing problems and needing more plumbers, having electrical problems and needing more electricians, heck if you have a computer problem these day you usually contact a machine first that can answer some of your problems rather then a paid specialist. Even if automation does not replace a job outright it replaces enough parts of that job to make the worker more efficient and effective, and without more demand to match the increase productivity there will need to be less workers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf automation enters an industry but the industry can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t grow to match (because of physical limitation at most), then its work force must shrink, we have the historical drop of agriculture and manufacture jobs as proof of that. The profits that was taken to pay wages now goes up to the owners of the businesses, and the unemployed workers must compete in a shrinking job market, this would cause incomes to drop, middle class to shrink and become poor, the poor grow poorer and the rich to grow richer. That is exactly what is happening today! Stock markets and capital gains are higher then they have ever been before, yet unemployment is up, people are getting lower and lower paying part-time jobs. The middle class is shrinking into poverty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThe top 10 percent of Americans have experienced rapid income growth over the last 40 years, but the bottom 90 percent haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t been so lucky. In fact, average income rose just $59 from 1966 to 2011 for the bottom 90 percent once those incomes were adjusted for inflation.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 - \u003Ca href=\u0022http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2013/03/25/1772521/average-income-for-the-bottom-90-percent-of-americans-grew-just-59-in-40-years/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://thinkprogress.org/economy/2013/03/25/1772521/average-income-for-the-bottom-90-percent-of-americans-grew-just-59-in-40-years/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s right we have not moved our income up for the common American for nearly 50 years now! Yet US farm production has gone up, US manufacturing production has gone up, capital has grown. Most Americans have moved to poorer paying part-time dead-end service jobs, that most of them hate!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuch of this is blamed on outsourcing now, a problem only in that its giving someone else \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cyour\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 job. Outsourcing is a problem for the working population of developed nations, it drives salaries down to the lowest common denominators of the world. But truth be known machines are now competing with developing country\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s cheap practically slave labor! For example Foxcon the Taiwanese electronic giant that assembles all Apple products of all things is beginning to to automate. It is all a matter of when will machines cost less then a practical slave in a undeveloped country. Also unskilled impoverished labors can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t compete in quality verse the precision of automatons, nor will automatons commit suicide or demand pay raises or human rights, machines as long as they are design not to will never feel, never want, never need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo truly determine if automation is a greater problem then outsources simply compare the product to worker ratio there to here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cif 10% of China\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s electronics production was moved to the U.S., China would lose 300,000 jobs. Yet, just 40,000 new jobs would be created in the U.S. Put another way, if all of China\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s manufacturing output was magically transported to the U.S. tomorrow, the U.S. unemployment rate would decline by only 2.75 percentage points after accounting for the effects of automation.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 -http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/rethinking-re-shoring/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t continue for long. If more products could be produced maybe their price would drop and the ever poorer people could still buy them but as I covered before there are fundamental limits in energy and materials that we appear to already be hitting that limit production. As the people get poorer they can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t buy the products anymore. So demand will drop, and that means the rich will start to see profits drop, their only recourse to make profit will be to increase efficiency, automate more, only feeding the fire! In fact the economy of individual nations and thus every nation because of glottalization will become increasingly unstable and fall into recessions one after another. Oscillating wildly or possibly even entering depressions until economic solutions are implement. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat solutions are there? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Increase minimum wage: only a temporary solution and in the long run will push for even more automation for it artificially increases the value of human labor, which value is dropping as machines can do more and more of that labor cheaper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) reduce working hours: All the sci-fi prophets of old (as well as economist like Keynes himself) thought we would live in times of boredom today, with nothing to do because of automation, they assumed (wrongly) that the wealth from automation would distribute evenly enough and we would all be working single digit work weeks. Legally reducing what is a full work wee, 4- day work weeks, might certainly help, its has for many other countries, but we are still someways politically and technologically from making single digit work weeks possible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Progressive taxation: if those that own all the capital are profiting at the cost of the poor, then simply tax the rich more and the poor less, forcibly redistribute the money, this of course is hersay to most conservatives, but lets assume it is done: where do we put the money? More education, again not going to help as our economy simply can\u0027t grow much more to support everyone having well paying high end jobs, worse if strong AI ever comes around all the education in the world won\u0027t make anyone competitive with that in intellect. Perhaps more infrastructure, more services to reduce the prices people pay on things like medical care, sure but that will only help a little.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) People Capitalism: James Albus suggested a way for capitalism to make automation its blessing and not its curse. If the only people who are assured profit from increase automation are those that own the automation, own the capital, then the solution for the ever more unemployed is to have them own the capital too! Basically have the government convert social security and corporate holdings into stock and give that stock to every citizen. In short everyones \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cjob\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 would increasingly become stock broker, managing their own stock portfolio, until the day and age perhaps when \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cuniversal doer\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 aforementioned strong AI comes into being and can replace ALL jobs, then everyone would simply live off their holdings and dividends. Its an elegant solution, its only a solution that will only work for those that can managed their money wisely, shrewdly and with an educated understanding of investment. Everyone else would likely blow all that stock away on bad investment moves and ponzi schemes: The stock market would become even more volatile and likely result in massive losses for all from the idiotic investing of many. The only solution would be regulating how and what people can invest, or even having the government invest for them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Socialism: Just have the government take over more and more of industry and hand out checks in welfare to everyone. It could work assuming we could replaced ALL jobs, or force some people to work some jobs that can\u0027t be replaced. Of course politically most countries have a chance of doing this as a snow ball has not melting in Hel...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Resourcism: even less probable anytime soon then #5. Imagine a world without money, instead machines manage who has what at what time and how. We all are allocated resources invisibly. Lets say you want to go jet skiing, instead of buying a jet ski, you just go to a lake where one is provided for you, enough are built and cared for by machines to deal with demand, if demand increase, people will at first need to be turned away, while more jet skis are made and stocked. Likewise all products could be managed like this assuming we have a FULLY automated economy. Such a future is pure star trek: were things cost so little that money can be abolished and people live to better themselves for self betterment sack and not money. Sounds great but how do we get there from here? How do we deal with limited production of products that have value only because they are human made, a separate \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Crenaissance festival\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 market? And how do we deal with all the people who would just spend their time doing the opposite of self improvement?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7.

Look either the rich start giving in to the poor with any or all the above or the poor eventually revolt and kill off the rich. The rich could counter and kill off the poor first.
