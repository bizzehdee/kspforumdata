My understanding of expansion is rather rudimentary. I can write down a very simple metric which would have expansion consistent with Hubble law, and yeah, such a metric would have a horizon - a distance from beyond which information will never reach you, and which you can never reach. So it\u0027d be like an effective end to the universe you know or could ever know, while the universe can actually be much bigger or infinite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I understand, something like that is expected to exist in our universe.
