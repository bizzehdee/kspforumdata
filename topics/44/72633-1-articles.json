Rotating black holes are more likely to be worm holes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne simple rule: Once you go Faster than Light, we just don\u0027t know what happens. If we follow basic logic, going FTL would mean that we go back in time, staying in the same place. But, this is not the \u0022same place\u0022, because time is one of the 4 dimensions of space. This is also the idea I support, but I am no scientific, and the \u0022logic\u0022 is black-holey mind binding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut why do we go FTL in the first place? Well, it\u0027s because each black hole is in fact a Singularity. A single point of space with infinite density, thus infinite gravity. So if you get close enough of the black hole, you will get attracted, and will not be able to go back. This is known as the Even Horizon. Below this altitude, nothing will escape the Endangered Black Hole - not even light. So what those guys talked about on the first page about the strength of the probe\u0027s antenna, is impossible, because light being electromagnetic, it behaves as radio waves, so nothing the probe will send will be ever received, because eaten by the Black Hole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhysically too, there\u0027s a problem: Spaghettification. This is the tidal forces put to the extremes. The parts closer of the black hole (\u0022on the bottom\u0022 as seen by the black hole\u0027s surface) would receive so much more gravitational pull than the parts on top that the object will stretch until dislocation.

That would imply that somewhere else in the universe (multiverse?) there has to be a \u0022white hole\u0022 that does not attract anything to it spewing out all the stuff that falls into our black hole, right?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo. The other side would also have an event horizon. It might be a wormhole, but nobody said that it\u0027s traversable. You can\u0027t pass through this wormhole without an FTL drive. Anything that goes in, from either side, would just get trapped in the middle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Skyler4856\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Skyler4856\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf this is indeed a wormhole, than where is the exotic matter?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t need exotic matter to make a wormhole.

Actually, quite a few things. There is no \u0022core\u0022. There is a singularity. It can contain a huge amount of mass, but calling it matter is a bit silly. There is no distinction between matter and energy at that point. And wormholes will also have one of these.
