And while magnetic fields would generally be better at transferring momentum, Orion seems like it scales better, considering that magnetic fields have a limit to their strength and lose strength with distance. So for smaller vehicles magnetic nozzles are definitely the superior choice - Mini-Mag Orion for one example. But go big enough and a giant steel plate with shock absorbers starts to look very attractive in comparison. Of course that brings into question whether or not something of that size would ever be desirable, which is actually one of Orion\u0027s biggest problems in general.

Change the length of the spring and you could have higher efficiency for momentum exchange. Change the pulse unit design and you can change performance. Scale it up and it\u0027s also going to perform better. Use thermonuclear pulse units and you can possibly gain even more performance.

Mostly because the antimatter isn\u0027t even needed. But an Orion can be counted as a torchship - mostly because the definition is pretty much nonexistent. If you mean constant-acceleration drive, then no. But if you mean a high thrust, high specific impulse, high thrust power drive, then yes. And while Orion does have a low pulse rate, the entire reason for the shocks is to smooth out the ride. Do it well enough and you could have a human crew just fine. It certainly wouldn\u0027t be comfortable mind you, but any Orion drive ship is only going to be firing its drive for maybe a few hours, and more shocks plus some linear motors could be built into a certain part (if needed) to make it more comfortable.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are numerous advantages to Orion.

Most of them are essentially developments of 19th century technology. Then the entire conception of \u0022dead end\u0022 technology is almost irrelevant - what matters is whether or not said technology is doable and if it meets the requirements. Most technology is a dead end. And even if Orion is a dead end, it happens to be in a performance regime that\u0027s quite favorable for reasonably fast\u00A0interplanetary travel - this fact won\u0027t change no matter what the future holds. Of course other theoretical drives are in that regime too, but Orion is something that could be done in a much shorter timeframe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NFUN","CreatedById":78715,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-28T02:37:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223860135\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022197139\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221601187957\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022147366\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022satnet\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 hours ago, satnet said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKnew elements with fantastic properties - No matter what planet you\u0027re on the atomic elements are the same (different ratios for certain, but the same elements).

In either case, that\u0027ll help, but, as I said, after that the only way to improve is to get rid of the horse.\u00A0Medusa is the only Orion variant suitable for crewed flight (the shock absorbers on the others\u00A0are too short to smooth out the pulses completely), but it\u0027s vacuum-only, and in vacuum, Orion has rather lackluster performance, compared even to nuclear-electric propulsion. Orion was thermonuclear from the start, BTW. \u0022Classic\u0022 nukes virtually disappeared after thermonuclear explosives were successfully developed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInternal combustion engines are not dead ends, mostly because they lead into\u00A0gas turbines, which are one of the more efficient ways of getting energy out of chemical reactions. Funnily enough, neither are steam engines, because they lead into Stirling engines, which are \u003Cem\u003Ethe\u003C/em\u003E most efficient thermal engines in general.

Even then, you can\u0027t make up its \u003Cem\u003Eproperties\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ewithout moving out of science fiction territory. In general, in this genre, you cannot tailor the setting to the plot, because the setting is, ultimately,\u00A0real life (even if the story takes place in the future). You have to take what science gives you, and work with that to create your plot (it actually gives you quite a lot, but you have to work your brain to figure out how to use it).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScience fantasy is inbetween, and is not always the result of the writer not bothering with research. Star Wars is a good example (Star Trek, too, though unlike SW, it tries to pretend otherwise). The setting is, at first glance, like that of a very far-fetched science fiction, but in fact, the writer consciously decided to depart from the rules of our world. Besides impossible technology, this usually takes form of some kind of telepathy and/or\u00A0telekinesis. Star Wars went whole hog with that, and introduced The Force, which is like magic by another name. It\u0027s not quite \u0022pure\u0022 fantasy (though it\u0027s closer to it than to science fiction), because most of its wonders, while impossible in real world, are scientifically understood \u003Cem\u003Ein universe\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFantasy, as generally understood, refers to settings inspired by fairytales, mythology, and certain fellow by the name of Tolkien. Lord of the Rings is the archetypical example. It doesn\u0027t have to take place in the past, and there\u0027s nothing stopping it from taking place in the future, but magic and supernatural are\u00A0primary fixtures of the setting. It might have its own science, but it\u0027s incidental. It\u0027s clear that the world doesn\u0027t work like our own in a big way, and it makes no attempt at doing so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost of your ideas fall into science fantasy. My advice is, if you can\u0027t open up a physics journal and understand, at least on a basic level, the scientific\u00A0papers therein, you probably have no business trying to write\u00A0science fiction. If you try to present it as \u0022real science\u0022, any actual scientists in the readerbase will laugh you out of the room (and a lot of SF readers are scientists, too). If you stop pretending and set out to write science fantasy from the start, your life will be a lot easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-09-29T11:55:01Z\u0022 title=\u002209/29/2020 11:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 29, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Guest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-29T12:32:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u2019s a continuum to be sure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nHard science fiction (\u003Cem\u003EThe Martian\u003C/em\u003E)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSoft science fiction (\u003Cem\u003EDune, Interstellar\u003C/em\u003E)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSpace opera (\u003Cem\u003EStar Trek\u003C/em\u003E)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nScience fantasy (\u003Cem\u003EStar Wars\u003C/em\u003E)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPlanetary romance (\u003Cem\u003EDr. Who, The Space Trilogy\u003C/em\u003E)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEpic fantasy\u00A0(\u003Cem\u003ELOTR)\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUrban fantasy (\u003Cem\u003EHarry Potter\u003C/em\u003E)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe questions you\u2019re asking, Space, are mostly along the lines of what you\u2019d be asking for hard sci-fi.

Most\u00A0science fiction starts from a premise that one or more theoretical or engineering obstacles have been overcome. Your example of \u0022hard science fiction\u0022 includes stuff we certainly couldn\u0027t build today (most especially the ship they use to go back and forth to Mars). If the science gets too \u0022hard\u0022, its not really SF anymore. A novel set in a university physics lab, for instance, isn\u0027t necessarily SF even if all the characters are scientists who are doing science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs a murder mystery which features a forensic anthropologist solving the mystery by examining a skeleton \u0022hard science fiction\u0022?

A small-scale Star Trek story about a landing party running into trouble on a strange world isn\u0027t really \u0022space opera\u0022, but a massive battle between the Federation fleet and a Borg invasion?
