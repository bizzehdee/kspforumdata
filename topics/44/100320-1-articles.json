While there is fuel in the reactor core you have to constantly pump cooling water through it to prevent overheat. Usually, a small portion of turbine electric power is taken for this purpose. If the reactor is shut down for maintenance then it\u0027s powered by neighboring reactors or from outside.\n\nThere are also diesel generators for emergency purpose (power outage). However, they take time to start (1-3 minutes). So, how can the coolant pumps be powered while the emergency generators are starting up? There was a question how much time since the steam stops powering the turbines they would continue to spin and thus provide power to the pumps. So, there was an experiment planned to see how much time the turbines would spin down.\n\nOn the 25th, April 1986 personnel had to test it.\n\nHowever, some load was needed for taking necessary measurements. The second problem was the emergency shut down system which automatically switched off the reactor if its thermal power dropped down to 700-1000 MW and there would be impossible to repeat the experiment because of the xenon poisoning of the reactor core.\n\nSo, the switched off the emergency shutdown system (ESS) and use reserve centrifugal pumps. (First and second mistakes - there was no need to switch off the ESS, and they could use ANYTHING BUT pumps because this led to the tragedy).\n\n1.00 pm: Lowering the power of the reactor\n\n1.05 pm: The thermal power lowered from 3200 MW to 1600 MW. Turbine no. 7 stopped, electrical systems are powered from the turbine no. 8\n\n2.00 pm: ESS blocked. At this time the \u0022KiewEnergo\u0022 operator ordered to postpone the further powering down (the end of week, energy consumption raises). The reactor works on its halved power and ESS has not been switched on again. This was a serious operation error but it had no impact on the outcome.\n\n11.10 pm: The operator allows to continue. Personnel continues to power the reactor down.\n\nApr, 26, 0.28am: Reactor is powered down so low that the personnel had to switch from local control to general (during normal operation they can move the control rods individually, but since the power was so low, all rods had to be moved simultaneously). They didn\u0027t do that. It was the third mistake. At the same time the operator makes the fourth mistake - he didn\u0027t issue the \u0027hold power\u0027 command to the control mahcinery. As a result the reactor power quickly drops down to 30 MW. Water stopped boiling in the rod shafts and xenon poisoning started. Now, the operators make the fifth mistake (or a crime, since all instructions require to shut down the reactor) - they removed all control rods from the core.\n\n1.00 am: They managed to raise the thermal power to 200 MW (remember, the experiment had to be made at 700-1000 MW). Because of xenon poisoning they are unable to raise the power any higher.\n\n1.03 am: The experiment starts.\n\n1.07 am: The pump no. 8 is used as a dummy load. The system is not designed to work under such load and cavitation begins in the pumps (there is simply not enough water). They suck the water from the separator tanks and the water level dangerously drops there. A huge amount of cold water running through the reactor has lowered the steam generator to critical level. The contol machinery removed ALL control rods from the core.\n\n1.19 am: Seeing the dangerously low water level in the separator tanks the operator increases the water supply (condensed water) and BLOCK the automatic emergency mechanism that had to shut down the reactor by the \u0027not enough water\u0027 and \u0027insufficient steam pressure\u0027 signals. This was the mistake (or crime) no. 6\n\n1.19.30 am: The water level in separator tanks starts to raise but since so much cool water runs through the reactor core the boiling process stopped. The last automatic control rods were removed from the core. At this point the operator removes the last manual control rod from the core (mistake no. 7) thus losing the ability to control the processes that take place in the reactor. The reactor is 7 meter high and it responds well when they are moved in its middle. When the rod is farther from the center the reactor response worsens. The rods move withthe speed of 40 cm/s.\n\n1.21.50 am: The water level in the separator tanks raised over the normal and the operator switches off several pumps.\n\n1.22.10 am: The water level stabilizes, less water runs into the core. The boiling starts again.\n\n1.22.30 am: The reactor control systesm are not designed to run in these conditions and only 2/3 of needed water now is pumped into the reactor, and the computer shows that the reactivity level is dangerously low. The personnel IGNORES that (another crime). All instructions tell that the reactor should be immediately stopped.\n\n1.22.45 am: The thermal power of the reactor starts to raise slowly. The operators assumed that they\u0027d managed to stabilize the reactor and they decided to continue with the experiment (mistake no. 8 - all rods are removed, ESS is blocked, the reactivity is very low, all automatic shut down mechanisms are also switched off).\n\n1.23.04 am: Operators block another shutdown mechanism that is triggered when no steam is supplied to the second turbine if the first one has been previously switched off. (Turbine no. 7 has been shut down 12 hours before). This was the mistake no. 9 (and the fourth crime that night). The instruction prohibits to shut down this system for WHATEVER REASON). Simultaneously the personnel blocks the steam supply to the turbine. The experiment has started. The turbine starts to slow down, the supply voltage drops and the centrifugal pumps start to slow down as well.\n\nThe investigation later on has shown that if this last shutdown mechanism had not been turned off the catastrophe wouldn\u0027t have hapenned and the reactor would have been shut down automatically.\n\n1.23.30 am: The centrifugal pumps have lowered their rotation speed and the water flow through the core also lowered substantially. Steam generation increased fast. The three groups of automatic control rods started to descend but they were unable to prevent the increase the thermal power buildup since there weren\u0027t enough of them. Since the steam was not supplied to the turbine its rotation slowed down and the pumps provided even less water into the core.\n\nAt this point the catastrophe was imminent.\n\n1.23.39 am: The chief operator orders to press the shutdown button. At this command the control rods should go down at maximum speed. This should have stopped the reaction.\n\n(see the pic below)\n\n![c3.jpg](http://www.ufo.obninsk.ru/2004/c3.jpg)\n\nHere\u0027s what hapenned: At 1.5 m under each control rod (4) a so called \u0027displacer\u0027 is hanged (5). This is a 4.5 m aluminum cylinder filled with graphite. Its task is to moderate the neutron capture. Graphite also captures neutrons but with less speed than borom or cadmium. When the control rods are raised maximally high the lower end of the displacer is located at 1.25 above the core. In this area the water that fills the shaft is not yet boiling. When all of the rods started to move down when the emergency shutdown button was pressed the parts of the rods that contained borom and candmium have not yet reached the core, but the displacers have displaced all water from the shaft and exposed the fuel pins. The steam generation skyroketed. The steam pressure was so high that the rods could not go any further - the steam pushed them back. They only moved for 2 meters. At this point the operator switches off the electromagnets that held the rods (the rods should free fall into the reactor at this command), but the generated steam pressure held them above the core.\n\n1.23.43 am: The thermal power started to raise up to 530 MW and higher. The last two emergency systems have been triggered, but they did exactly the same that an emergency stop button which had been pressed 3 seconds earlier.\n\n1.23.43 am: Within fractions of a second the thermal power has increased in 100 times and continued to raise. The fuel pins overheated and the casings ruptured. The enormous pressure has pushed the water back into the supplying pipeline, then the steam destroyed the steam pipelines above.\n\nThis was a moment of the first explosion. Reactor stopped being a controlled machine.\n\nWhen the pipelines were destroyed the pressure in the reactor lowered a bit and the water could flow into the core again where it started to react with the nuclear fuel, overheated graphite and zirconium. These reactions led to fast accumulation of hydrogen and CO. The gas pressure in the reactor increased so that it lifted the lid of the reactor weighting 1000 ton (!) and destroyed all the remained pipelines.\n\n1.23.46 am: The gases from within the reactor have mixed with the air oxygen which, due to high temperature, immediately exploded.\n\nThis was the second explosion.\n\nThe reactor lid flew upwards, rotated 90 degree and dropped down. The walls and the ceiling of the reactor hall were destroyed. Some part of the graphite and reactor fuel from inside flew onto the roof of the reactor building and started about 30 fires.\n\nThe chain reaction has stopped.\n\n1.30 The first firefighting squad was dispatched to the site.\n\nResume: RBMK-1000 is a very good reactor and it takes quite a bit of effort and determination to explode it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-21T20:40:06Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2015 08:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cicatrix**"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T22:22:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E As I recall they where about to run emergency shut down tests.

That doesn\u0027t mean you\u0027re home free, as fuel rods are still decaying and releasing heat, but the reaction is shut down extremely quickly, and decay heat is much less than the heat caused by the reaction. Even that doesn\u0027t take too long to be no longer a problem assuming your cooling systems were working properly enough (and most reactors have additional emergency cooling systems that draw water from outsidefor exactly this reason). *Decommissioning* takes time not because it takes time to stop the reaction, but because it takes time to deal with waste disposal regulation, bring enough capacity online to offset the loss in generation, and wind down everything that\u0027s going on at the plant; however, decommissioning is irrelevant here, and the relevant kind of shutdown happens initially in seconds, and then all that\u0027s left is decay heat (there\u0027s no chain reaction anymore)."},{"CreatedByName":"sgt_flyer","CreatedById":57690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T00:19:21Z","Content":"Nevertheless, you still need active cooling for quite some time after a scram to deal with the decay heat ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) (most reactors are maintained below 600\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C during normal operation - to preserve the rods structural integrity.\n\nA scrammed reactor thermal output generally drop below 7% of it\u0027s normal output within seconds after a scram - (not enough to sustain steam generation - so you can\u0027t use this power to drive coolant pumps - you need external power)\n\nAs a reactor\u0027s envellope is designed to limit thermal losses (so they can transfer most of their heat to the coolant) without coolant flow, decay heat would make the core temperature rise up to damaging points (even if it takes some time, without extract\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00AEg this decay heat, the temperature could rise to levels capable of damaging the reactor\u0027s components))\n\nSo scram systems still require careful monitoring for a few weeks (residual decay heat thermal power is still around 0.5% after 1 week)\n\nNow, in case of a problem with the scram system (ex, some rods broke and got stuck, or the reactivity of the core became too high to be suppressed by the rods) modern / modernised designs can also inject neutron poisonning agents directly into the core to stop the reaction (though that a bit more time than the 4 seconds control rods take to be fully inserted during a scram)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-23T00:21:23Z\u0022 title=\u002202/23/2015 12:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sgt\\_flyer**"},{"CreatedByName":"peadar1987","CreatedById":81207,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T11:00:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E But the other reactors in the facility did operate for years after the fact.

With PIPPA, if your reactor goes on fire, increasing coolant flow fans the flames, and makes your problem worse."},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T13:39:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Nevertheless, you still need active cooling for quite some time after a scram to deal with the decay heat ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) (most reactors are maintained below 600\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C during normal operation - to preserve the rods structural integrity.\n\u003E A scrammed reactor thermal output generally drop below 7% of it\u0027s normal output within seconds after a scram - (not enough to sustain steam generation - so you can\u0027t use this power to drive coolant pumps - you need external power)\n\u003E \n\u003E As a reactor\u0027s envellope is designed to limit thermal losses (so they can transfer most of their heat to the coolant) without coolant flow, decay heat would make the core temperature rise up to damaging points (even if it takes some time, without extract\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00AEg this decay heat, the temperature could rise to levels capable of damaging the reactor\u0027s components))\n\u003E \n\u003E So scram systems still require careful monitoring for a few weeks (residual decay heat thermal power is still around 0.5% after 1 week)\n\u003E \n\u003E Now, in case of a problem with the scram system (ex, some rods broke and got stuck, or the reactivity of the core became too high to be suppressed by the rods) modern / modernised designs can also inject neutron poisonning agents directly into the core to stop the reaction (though that a bit more time than the 4 seconds control rods take to be fully inserted during a scram)\n\nYes, as I understand the wast heat was the problem in Fukushima, because the power and generators was down they was unable to circulate water for cooling. \n\nNow the problem is limited as long as you have water as you can went steam, and add more water, this is not something you want to do as the steam contains radioactive particles.\n\nSmaller reactors like the ones used in subs are far easier to shut down fast as they are small and don\u0027t contain much stored heat."},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T18:39:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E A scrammed reactor thermal output generally drop below 7% of it\u0027s normal output within seconds after a scram - (not enough to sustain steam generation - so you can\u0027t use this power to drive coolant pumps - you need external power)\n\nIt is possible to use this energy to drive coolant pumps.

SCRAM actually occurs very fast, often by almost a free fall of the rods. In Chernobyl, however, the graphite pile SCRAM takes a lot longer, perhaps ten seconds or more.

That would take a few minutes. It\u0027s the fission products which decay produces heat."}]}
