If you have a bit more of an angle between the two, but it doesn\u0027t change all that much, you might use a single dish, but have transmitter and receiver in different places in the focal plane of the dish. That will allow receiving from one direction and broadcasting in another. Of course, if the angle changes, you\u0027ll need to be able to move at least one of the two, receiver or transmitter, and that\u0027s bound to have mechanical limitations as well as limited response time, but might still be better than having two separate dishes. There is also a limit to how much you can steer the beam from a dish antenna before you\u0027re no longer getting benefits of using a dish.\u00A0Finally, there are antenna arrays. These can receive from multiple angles and broadcast to multiple angles, while still having all the benefits of having a focusing dish. There\u0027s also almost no time delay in steering the beam, as there are no mechanical parts to move. All you have to do is change relative phases. You can also build arrangements that can cover significantly more angles. In fact, a spherical array can basically be omnidirectional.

Communications is using a store-and-forward mode. For data from Mars back to Earth, Curiosity uses the UHF band to transmit to MRO while within range. Curiosity has about a 6 to 9 minute window for communications about 2 times per day. The data received by MRO is stored in the on-board memory. MRO has allocated 5 Gb per day for storage for all landers. When MRO can establish an X-band link, the data is relayed back to Earth. A similar approach is used for the forward direction, Earth to Curiosity, i.e. sending command and control messages.
