It\u0027s not so precise because I don\u0027t know the current mass of New Horizons, so I had to use its launch mass. Considering that the flyby will be very quick and that the acceleration will be considerably lower before and after closest approach, I\u0027d say Pluto\u0027s influence should be negligible. Obviously I\u0027d expect the JHUAPL folks to have already calculated New Horizons\u0027 post-encounter trajectory, but for us normal space-fans it should be negligible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spock1108","CreatedById":131963,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T14:16:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe dimensions increase as the eye!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rithsom","CreatedById":114646,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T14:27:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is very exciting.
