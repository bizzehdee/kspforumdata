I initially thought the failure might be because of blowback (their oxidizer is also a monopropellant if heated enough, if the fire got to the oxidizer tank it would be bad) but it\u0027s looking to me like a combustion chamber failure followed by the top section of the rocket turning sideways into the airstream and breaking apart. If it was blowback the first boom would have probably caused disintegration due to the LOX tank\u0027s central location, but with the combustion chamber being strictly at one end it had a good chance of staying straight for a while following the failure.\u00A0\u00A0The second event\u00A0could also have been a secondary explosion caused by the oxidizer, like a blowback but not really. Actually, now that I think about it the secondary explosion was probably the flight termination system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was a bit hard to tell on the (infared?) camera, but there\u0027s a chance that could have been the sonic shock wave and the whole thing disintegrated at max Q, but the first event looked more like an explosion then a disintegration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if it was a combustion chamber failure, it could have been either an overpressure caused by a sudden valve opening, a crack in the propellant, or maybe something melting that wasn\u0027t supposed to, or a damaged casing that couldn\u0027t take normal operating pressure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe engine did operate for the first several seconds of flight, apparently normally, though, so the failure likely wasn\u0027t present at the time of launch and likely manifested itself during the flight. Engines like this one have also been tested many times by DARE, so they have been known to work well. This gives the aerodynamics theory a bit more merit, as that would not have been a factor during ground tests.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d put my money on it being damage to the motor grain or casing somehow, causing the first explosion, then the FTS going off.
