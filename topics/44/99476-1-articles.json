This is where technological advances come in. As new ways to improve efficiency are developed, they become the new \u0022expensive high end\u0022, while the previous expensive high end moves down into the mainstream and the previous mainstream moves down into the low cost area. So as a result, as time passes, the panels get you better and better efficiency at the same price point, allowing you to pay less through using smaller installations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there\u0027s economies of scale, which are also tied to technological development of efficiency. When solar power was in its infancy, few companies built them, and only in small amounts, because they simply weren\u0027t viable for mass deployment yet. This made them doubly expensive and doubly unviable for mass deployment (yay Catch-22!). But when you get better panels, and people realize they can get away with buying less panels and therefore paying less, an increasing amount of people suddenly become interested. Despite needing less panels per person, the demand actually \u003Cem\u003Eincreases\u003C/em\u003E. This spurs companies into creating larger amounts of panels, which lets them benefit from economies of scale. Additionally, more companies enter the market to make solar panels, which results in increased competition (we\u0027ve seen a massive surge of this in the last five to ten years). Both of these things further bring down the price, which further increases demand as even more people see solar panels move into their price comfort zone. The previous Catch-22 now turns into a positive feedback loop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then there\u0027s manufacturing techniques and materials. In a highly competitive market environment, companies will look for new ways to ensure their own survival and one-up the competition. One such way that\u0027s gained increased focus over the recent years is not to push for developing something new (everyone else is already doing that), but to \u003Cem\u003Eadditionally\u003C/em\u003E also push for better ways to make what already exists. Imagine two companies that focus on mainstream range panels, while licensing the technology from a developer (like a scientific laboratory). They both produce whatever qualifies as mainstream at the moment, with better and better panel tech filtering down to them from their patent holder. If one of these two companies manages to find a way to produce the exact same thing as their competitor at 20% less cost than their competitor, they can increase both their market share and their profit margins!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECombine all three of them, and you get this very strong reduction in cost per power produced over the years. This trend is very likely to continue, too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-12T20:54:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaking solar panels more efficient is going to be hard. There more to it then a better solar cell. The DC-AC inverter makes up a portion of the cost and is also an area upon which needs to be expanded. Its either have a micro-inverter for each panel which kills reliability, life time and increases maintenance. Or have a single large one the size of a small fridge somewhere. Then theres heat. Which kills efficiency. Distance of the arrays feed. ( longer the wire the bigger the gauge needed and you\u0027ll loose power in translation ). I use to install arrays on houses and farms. And I can speak for the northeast part of the US when I say solar panels are NOT worth it for a residence unless you have a lot of property. You have to get a hundred holes drilled into your roof which will destroy it over time. Many companies actually offer new roofs to go with the solar panels. And by time your finished off paying for your solar panel array ( and possibly a new roof ) they will have lost a great deal of efficiently and are on the end of their lifespan. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELarge ground arrays however are worth it if you have the room and money.
