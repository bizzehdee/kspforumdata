What would we possibly have that would be of interest to such an advanced species? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- They might want to study us, but then making contact would simply ruin the observation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- They might want to trade something with us, but they might as well take want they want and ignore us.

We would just be gone in a few hours and we wouldn\u0027t understand what hit us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo all in all, IMO, the chances of ET ever making contact with us are small, because it simply doesn\u0027t make sense to try to establish a friendly relationship with an inferior species.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still a partisan of the Dark Forest theory.
