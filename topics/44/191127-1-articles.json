All except direct imaging.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe have directly imaged planets before, but not at this scale. I\u0027m talkin\u0027 all the way down to Mars-size planets at Venus-sized orbits (around G-type stars, smaller orbits around like Red Dwarves obviously) (Mercury sound too ambitious). Unbelievably, this may be coming relatively soon- LUVOIR and HabEx in particular are very promising, very real proposals for a telescope that fan do this.\u00A0 HabEx is even specifically focused on imaging whole exoplanet systems like I mentioned.

Every single one of those dots is an entire physical world. Every one of them is unique. We can surmise that\u00A0they exist now, but we can\u0027t see it.\u00A0This would give us something concrete to think of and truly appreciate the sheer diversity of the universe. Not only would\u00A0we know for a fact that that all of these individual worlds exist but we would actually be able to know details about them! Size, color, mass, composition, atmosphere- all of these we can actually figure out from these observations and all of them can help us actually imagine what these worlds are like. There would just be so many details to learn. It would be great for science fiction, too- it would reignite the sense of wonder from the dawn of the space age for our own solar system, but multiplied by a hundred (assuming 7 planets per star- which could be wrong- that\u0027s\u00A0100 stars, which is a sphere with a\u00A0radius of only 18 ly). Just imagine that for a moment. Hundreds of worlds, each revealing\u00A0their own mysteries\u00A0to solve, and each open for imagination. The general public would be captivated as news of especially astonishing exoplanets- WITH IMAGES (even if they are just dots)- hit the press. Perhaps it would motivate\u00A0some to look at these not only as distant worlds, but as\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Edestinations\u003C/em\u003E- it would be the best motivator to work on some technology capable of interstellar travel than just about anything else (obviously that can\u0027t count as my chosen mission because that\u0027s future technology).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd, of course... there\u0027s always a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Echance\u003C/em\u003E... maybe- just maybe- one of those hundreds a dots will be a certain... very familiar... pale, blue color.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat might not be a very likely scenario, but it would be... something else.
