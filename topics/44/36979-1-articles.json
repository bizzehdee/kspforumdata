We can probably apply the normal 64% scale to whatever the right figure is to adjust it for Kerbals. A full complement for the base is 18 kerbals, two of whom are expected to regularly conduct EVAs on foot and with rovers; the rest have jobs managing the station, coordinating Mun operations and doing research but may expect to do EVAs from time to time. There is sufficient equipment available to recycle all of the crew\u0027s waste, and let\u0027s say it is 80% efficient (is that a reasonable figure?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor transportation, my Mun base will use Cal\u0027Mihe\u0027s awesome Starspeeder, safely rated for about 5 tons of payload.
