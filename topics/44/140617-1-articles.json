So that I am going to through in some food for thought.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe key element for any storage fuel is energy density available on its expulsion from the accelerated system.\u00A0 The more energy, the higher the exhaust velocity which we should all know by now is ~10 times the ISP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the most mass efficient engines are the most difficult to use with humans. 1) they either deal unpredictable amounts of ionizing radiation 2) they don\u0027t carry energy of their own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe most efficient ION drives would take literally decades to burn through their fuel. There is actually nothing stopping engineers from having an ION drive that accelerates ions to 0.9c, the only problem is the power required, the mass of the accelerator, and of course the power conversion equation, which at 0.9c has to use lorentz transformations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo why am I posting about batteries, how would they help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs per the argument with Camacha last year (who did not like the links I was posting), I pointed out that it takes technological improvements in alot of areas to take what we have (space craft traveling outward from our sun in interstellar space at 16 km/sec) and make them go crazy faster. Essentially what you are doing is crossmultiply improvements (1.2 x 1.2 x 1.2 x 1.2) = 2.07. So that if you can improve your technologies in each area by 20% and it takes 4 areas to complete an operation you can increase your capability by 100%. So instead of leaving at 16 km/sec you are leaving at 32 km/sec. For the last 40 years we have been basically stagnate at this capability, but the science that currently exists allows us to break this and move on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/05/how-build-better-battery-through-nanotechnology\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/05/how-build-better-battery-through-nanotechnology\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo lets think about this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. If you want to kick an ION drive out of LEO without wasting fuel spiraling out (terribly inefficient you can lose as much as 50% of your fuel mass, more if you have to fight drag for endless periods)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. If you couple an ION drive or possibly Cannae drive to waste energy from an NTG. The problem is that NTGs don\u0027t generate that much power and are sometimes used for experiments, the other problem is that you might want to kick on the ION drives as the approach the periapsis of some planet you are oberth-ing around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me make the first few premises. The mass of an ION drive is hideously low compared to NTGs and Solar panels. But there is a certain load density it about 200 KW per output meter you cannot go over, and safely its about 100 KW.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically a high output ION drive system needs to \u0027roll\u0027 out in space, we could make the system about 1/10th to 1/5th the mass of the solar panels and the would still be underutilized.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what SEP and NEP space craft need are batteries with higher energy storage densities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do we need solar electric power for, quite simple, we should not launch tugs into space that deplete their resources and float around the earth, moon, sun forever. What we really need are ships that sip fuel and run multiple missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is that SEP does not work well in fast decaying orbits, these are the orbits in which you would want them to refuel themselves and capture fuel and supplies from Earth and carry them into clean space. This takes care of so many problems at once, it gets rid of the space junk problem (fuel launches decay back into earth quickly) and since the tug is recycled it can carry fuel out, transfer and then dump the container in LEO before it picks up another, and the ship itself is not wasted. It can carry fuel to just about anywhere in the solar system using ION drives to leave earths orbit and potentially Cannae drives in transfer orbits. But to get out of LEO in orbits that decay within a years time, you really need an efficient battery, because the ION drive needs to both fight drag and increase velocity at its periapsis. So that it needs to be able to push into an eccentric orbit quickly, then keep kicking itself out at its\u00A0 periapsis until it apoapsis is at its target radius.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo optimize this you need more ION drives and a battery that can store Solar and/or Nuclear electric power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs mentioned in the other post to take true advantage from the oberth effect while traveling around the sun you really need to approach the planet from above (relative to the sun), in intering the planets Hill radius and approach a safe distance from the planet you are borrowing thermodynamic energy, converting it into kinetic energy and while going the very fastest (at the periapsis heading prograde around the star) you add dV to that. At that perfect point you need to add as much dV as possible at that moment (the fraction of the KE you have to pay back on exit is alot less than you paid when dV is applied along the prograde at peak velocity). This of course is not possible, but most of the energy added will come on the dark side of the planet where direct SEP will not work. Some ION drives allow the lowering of ISP for greater thrust but there is a practical limitation to the efficient mass of ION drives, but the typical onboard batteries will not suffice to sustain operation of ION drives in complete darkness, the only real way to take advantage of the Oberth effect with SEP is to have highly powerful and mass efficient batteries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust to make these points because some of the arguements get silly. Improving on a well made wheel is quite difficult, this is the nature of space now, dV improvments are not a simple example of improvement in one area, it requires improvement in many areas to get substantial improvements in performance. This is not limited to engineering and technology, but ultimately, better understandings of space and physics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-27T15:59:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI

\u0027burn\u0027 what they make eventually you have to find a way to store and reconvert back the products or you have carried their mass for no particularly good reason. Conversion of water to hydrogen and oxygen s terribly inefficient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRead what i wrote, using an ION drive at 0.9c would only be used in fusion powered craft, it can be done, 99.99% of the time it would be unwisely done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeat efficiency is the issue, but if you read the link they are work on reducing heat, and if your read my past threads on solar power, this is a major limitation of solar power if you keep building bigger and bigger panels, you either have to add weight for power transformers and heat radiators or end up using bare cable copper and operating at near melting temperatures over much of the craft. In this sense batteries definitely are a bonus because they mean fewer panels, shorter wires and less amperage. Secondarily advantagous because with really big panel arrays, the heat radiators will interfere, were as with batteries you can radiate isolated from the insolating areas of the panels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou need alot of dV, that is true, and what\u0027s important is that ION drives need to be able to run at the mass efficiency ISP when entering a gravity well, that means more output at lower ISP. Definitely a problem is SEP and NEP craft. But then an efficient ION craft once out of the gravity well has alot of time and dV to steer itself again into another gravity well as to repeat the process. The point about ION drives and gravity wells, you have to be patient, which means neccesarily they may take longer to get to that destination sector, but they will be going faster once they get there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird you don\u0027t really care if you expend all the power in one cycle, if the battery does not overheat, you have all the time after the fact to let it cool and recharge.

ION drives are a thing, we can expect more use of them in space, so that the new technologies that make them work better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-27T17:23:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, I didn\u0027t read the link. \u00A0None of my calculations depended on a battery, you could have an unobtanium battery that magically stored power and you will still be limited by the radiators and ion engines. \u00A0Thanks to cell phones, batteries are basically a measurable chunk of the GNP and anybody with a thinner/more powerful/faster charging (less so with the last) can expect to charge a significant margin to Apple/Samsung and others. \u00A0Make a battery cheaper/faster charging and you can expect to get a similar sale to GM/Nissan (and Tesla might be interested in buying your tech). \u00A0You could spend all you time reading the latest puff piece on somebody\u0027s latest battery tech, only to find out some other tech beat it to market.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEssentially you have described a system that might be able to get to LM2 slightly more efficiently, but may or may not get there faster. \u00A0Going past LM2 would be pointless for such a craft, at that point ditch the batteries and go pure solar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt LEO, you would have a distinct disadvantage over a pure solar ion ship. \u00A0They both would be firing during the day and the battery-powered system would simply have extra mass in the form of the battery and likely the radiators.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt some point in higher orbit the battery-backed system would have an advantage (we hope), due to much lower times being eclipsed and the ability to store an entire orbit\u0027s worth of power in the batteries. \u00A0The big question is will it catch up before the orbit is big enough that it becomes way more than the batteries can store (if this isn\u0027t a limit than the engines certainly will be. \u00A0And understand that the size of the required radiators are going to become at least as large as the pure-solar solar panels). \u00A0I would be somewhat surprised if this got to LM2 faster, but it is certainly possible (and should be more efficient).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time you get to LM2 (or LTO), there are pretty much two ways to go. \u00A0To use the Obereth effect, you need to dump several thousand delta-v in roughly 30 minutes or so (1k for Mars, 5k for Neptune). \u00A0A vastly more likely situation is that you will be taking months if not years to get to LM2, in which case you might as well rely on gravity tricks to get you to where you need in the solar system (don\u0027t forget to supply the needed capture delta-v). \u00A0Going this route likely means that you are better off losing the unneeded mass of the batteries and extra radiators.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, there really isn\u0027t any way of getting around the time issues. \u00A0Adding a battery (and radiators, don\u0027t forget them)\u00A0to an ion engine means that it will always produce less delta-v/month, just that the delta-v/month will get you farther because of the Obereth effect (assuming you can even use it without getting tossed into escape velocity). \u00A0For the ion engines that are even in the powerpoint stages, you will eventually be better off using gravity tricks to get anywhere. \u00A0And yes, all of this is still true with magical unobtanium batteries (although at LEO they would go equal speeds, if and only if you had magical unobtanium radiators as well).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it might be worth it to build an LEO-(LM2 and/or LTO) space tug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-27T18:39:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022width:589px;margin-bottom:20px;margin-top:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, I didn\u0027t read the link. \u00A0None of my calculations depended on a battery, you could have an unobtanium battery that magically stored power and you will still be limited by the radiators and ion engines.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat says alot right there.

So lets just saw we have a 1.2 megawatt of power, we have 6\u00A0square meters of thruster exhaust area, we set the drive at a perfect eff of 1000 isp, exhaust vel of 10000 at 80% eff.

During the interem we can use the high ISP. You got anything that can match that?

I might even tune that ION drive to its highest rated ISP as I approached Mercury, taking advantage of the high level of

I keep having visions of the eventual elliptic orbit and week-long-charging cycle (out to LTI), I\u0027d guess that a two-three hour charge cycle combined with a 15 minute discharge cycle would probably work best (and the charging cycle would have to deal with \u0022day/night\u0022 issues). \u00A0I also suspect you will spend even more time in the Van Allen Belts (especially in the outer belts, as the craft struggles to escape with a fixed amount of delta-v per orbit).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe biggest problem with this discussion is the idea that you can increase thrust by an order of magnitude without losing efficiency (well, no more than 50%). \u00A0That seems to be counter to all available engineering on electric-powered spacecraft. \u00A0VASIMR makes a whole lot of noise about this idea, but seems to willing to handwave away *all* problems, many of which would greatly change current practice elsewhere (long-term storage of hydrogen, cooling in space at massive power levels, and just how the Isp varies with power. \u00A0None of them seem to be

needing to pump a significant amount of heat out to your radiators (which would then be getting considerably hotter than your spacecraft) during battery use (I\u0027m assuming they are used for the

a one day burn with no further efficiency gains). \u00A0You can take all the time you want for the first 3000m/s to escape velocity, but if you can\u0027t do the last 1000m/s in one burn, you
