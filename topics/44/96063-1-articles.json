One of my first acts for most of the last 850 sols has been to check out the daily images taken and downloaded by Curiosity. Almost every day, images arrived without fail, even during the long drive to the base of Mount Sharp. There were a couple of computer hiccups that caused a very apparent break in this cycle, but were quickly explained. The images kept coming- until just after the Christmas holiday. Since then there have been very few, and no explanation from any of my sources. The only thing I can find that has changed is that John Grotzinger is out as project scientist and Ashwin Vasavada has been named as the new. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have any information on why the images are no longer coming?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T23:51:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe all the picture guys who process them after they receive them are on break. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr aliens were in the photos...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeheh...

I have not heard anything about technical issues on Curiosity itself anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the release of images: it is customary for pretty much all space science missions around the world that there is a lockout period during which the data retrieved is available exclusively to the team that manages the science instrument that took the data. A rover or probe is not operated as a whole by a single team, but you rather need to consider the instruments \u0022payload\u0022 carried on the probe/rover, belonging not to the craft operator but to an external team that won the instrument slot (there are always a large number of teams competing for slots ahead of a mission). These scientists get a period of exclusivity so they can actually reap the benefits of their hard work - that is, they can analyse the data in peace and write a paper about their findings. Important papers get cited in other works, and citations are like \u0022street cred\u0022 in the science world - a currency of reputation, the value of which cannot be understated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo why do we sometimes get to see new images and data hot off the press? Because it is the science team\u0027s right to waive the exclusivity period for individual things. Maybe they say \u0022we believe in open information access\u0022. Or they say \u0022this one is so awesome, the world must see it now\u0022. Or they say \u0022these images have no scientific value, let\u0027s just toss em out there\u0022. Whatever the reason, this is actually done fairly frequently. But you can bet that if some instruments hits a scientific motherlode, it will likely be a while until it gets out in full. All data from the Rosetta mission for example, including Philae, is subject to a six-month exclusivity period. Anything we get to see ahead of that is because the scientists decide to be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is entirely possible that not only was the rover operating team downsized a lot over the holiday season, but the science teams took a break as well. With nobody there to check the images, nobody could mark them for release, so none were released because they\u0027re still under exclusivity.

NASA has an amazingly open policy now about images, with most missions publishing raw images within hours of reception here on Earth.
