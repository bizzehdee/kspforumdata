In a total war, the asteroid inhabitants would have an enormous advantage, so big that Mars would be doomed and it would be insane to start a war, especially if Mars is terraformed and the Martian populace is dependent on a stable environment to survive. The asteroid folks could redirect swarms of rocks into Mars collisions. They only have one target to hit, and it\u0027s a big one. The asteroidal inhabitants have a huge supply of heavy elements (read \u0022nuclear weapons\u0022) too, as they are living on undifferentiated bodies. Meanwhile, the Martians could not easily retaliate against the asteroidal inhabitants, as there would be too many civilian asteroidal targets, and each one would be completely or mostly self-sustaining. The asteriod inhabitants could possibly not even be tied to specific rocks, making them even harder to wipe out.

I am working on a \u0022hard\u0022 sci-fi tabletop RPG (pen \u0026amp; paper). The project is actually one of the things that drew me to KSP! The setting is early 22nd century Earth and solar system. There are no lightsabres, little green men, or warp drives. Mankind has moved out to other planets and moons, as well as the asteroid belt. One of the things I was considering including in the setting is some good old-fashioned war between factions. The question becomes this: in a realistic fictional setting, what are the challenges to something like this? Is it even possible? Mankind has always been his most creative when it came to killing other men, can he rise (or sink) to this challenge?\u003Cp\u003EImagine that \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153for whatever reasons\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 people on Mars were fighting with people in the asteroid belt.

Like vger said, we could stop automation and the computer age, as heavy elements become increasingly rare. The battleground could be in the planetary systems of Jupiter and Saturn, which has lots of hydrogen in their atmospheres (for fusion reactors, which are possible once you clear the efficiency hurdles). The reason they cant missile the planets in orbit is that the infrastructure ( colonies, hydrogen extraction stations, refueling stops) are still there from colonists, and they want to keep it. Expand the battleground to the moons for more interesting stuff. And you don\u0027t have that much troubles with epic space battles because they are in a smaller space, and most of the stuff is on the ground [of the moons] and in LJO anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KASASpace","CreatedById":71352,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-01T03:05:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELJO is probably one of the least safe orbits in the solar system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWant a high dose of radiation?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally high?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThan LJO is perfect for you!

It took 200ish years after finding the new world for Europeans to build up American colonies politically/economically powerful enough to rival the European nation states themselves, and then another 200 years or so for the US to become a superpower, for example. That 400 year span, I think, is largely due to the fact it takes large populations to amass the economical power to participate politically. That sort of thing is limited by our rate of reproduction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that to say, I think interplanetary war will largely take place in the Earth-Moon system, in particular any Space-elevators or important space stations. If naval warfare strategy of the past is anything to go by, and I think it is (maybe not the kinds of ships needed, or what roles are important, but the strategy involved), targets will either be naval staging docks (ie some form of space station; think Pearl harbor of WWII, but in 3D in space) or ports used to transfer resources from orbit to the surface or vice versa, perhaps space elevators(to capture, not destroy; think of railroads or highways in modern warfare). Correct me if I\u0027m wrong, but don\u0027t most naval battles take place quite near to important targets on land (like islands with military bases or important port cities or something)? I suspect interplanetary warfare would follow the same pattern.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think those retrograde scattershot devices, perhaps asteroid redirections, maybe those gig/peta-lasers, and God knows what else would become a new level of WMD, and would be treated thusly in politics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think that any bodies besides Earth would be anywhere near danger from Kessler syndrome by this point, which could lead to tensions if it wasn\u0027t the seat of political/economical power for some reason.

In fact, because I don\u0027t think large scale naval battles feature single operator craft (like a speedboat or something), I can\u0027t really see any reason why a small fighter with fewer than 5 pilots would have any real use in a battle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-04T22:29:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SuperBigD60\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SuperBigD60\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E In fact, because I don\u0027t think large scale naval battles feature single operator craft (like a speedboat or something), I can\u0027t really see any reason why a small fighter with fewer than 5 pilots would have any real use in a battle.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnder\u0027s Game had a better example of a \u0022space fighter\u0022, a disposable remotely controlled drone that is more maneuverable than a capital ship, without the total deltaV of a proper warship but enough to be usable as a parasite weapons platform or as a missile.
