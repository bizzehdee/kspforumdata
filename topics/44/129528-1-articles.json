It would simply turn brown and crumble choking the astronaut in about 20 seconds. The Venusian atmosphere is around 90 times more pressurized than that of earths; for surface density at that pressure and heat the oxygen inside the space suit would instantly begin burning the skin. 160 feet is the practical diving limit which is about 6 atm of pressure, So no, humans would never be walking around on Venus. The best that might be obtained is a heavily fortified rover with an unknown type of air conditioning system, that can leave the surface within a few hours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRead... \u00A0also.. \u00A0try to take few minutes before answer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the way.. many mention the gravity well \u0022problem\u0022, but make a reusable rocket in venus is a lot easier than earth.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLower deltaV needed, there is no\u00A0need to leave \u0022fuel\u0022 in the tanks for a propulsive landing or go back to a pad.. \u00A0the stages just go back and float waiting for being pick up. Other types of nuclear rockets\u00A0can be used\u00A0(no problem with pollute that atmosphere). At that point the cost to send something to orbit is just the cost of fuel... and the fact you can make aerocapture maneuvers with ease, it means that any low gravity rock without atmosphere would require a lot of deltav.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fredinno","CreatedById":143381,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-09T04:37:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222353721\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022129528\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221452289638\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002225468\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SargeRho\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, SargeRho said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose rocks is exactly what\u0027s interesting about them: Easily accessible resources that don\u0027t require multi-billion dollar ultra-high temperature mining equipment.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nVenus has:\u003Cbr\u003E\n-1g gravity\u003Cbr\u003E\n-1 bar atmosphere and resulting radiation protection\u003Cbr\u003E\n-\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPhobos and Deimos have:\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Easily mineable resources\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Close to Mars\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Low gravity, making carrying them away easy\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Radiation shielding can be made from the local materials\u003Cbr\u003E\n-High Tech materials allow the manufacture of spacecraft, without having to carry them out of a large gravity well\u003Cbr\u003E\n-The proximity to Mars provides a potential future customer for the materials\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Easiest place in the solar system to reach, aside of some NEOs, as far as DV goes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntl;dr: Venus is like Spain.
