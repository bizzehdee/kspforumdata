The station begin synthesizing the plastic as is rotates\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pie sections grow at about 10 feet per section, initially, as in grows the rotation of the station slows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually the station is diverts 9/10ths of the sunlight reaching venus and the planet cools.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA violent reaction of atmosheric acids with the mostly alkaline surface is expected. But there will be high spots.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thickness of the atmosphere decreases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could eventually land on venus much like landing on earth. During that period you collect your stuff. the position of the filter at L1 could be shifted to increase or decrease light.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo how feasible. Lets say a diamond is 1.5 gram per cm. So lets say our filter is 1 atom across. One mole of carbon is 12 grams, a diamond of 12 grams would occupy 8 cubic centimeters or 0.000008 cubic meters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is 6.0223 x 10 23 atoms of carbon. Each carbon occupies 1.32 x 10-29 cubic meters. The cube root of this is 2.36E-10 meters. Lets just say is 1 nanometer thick about 10 hydrogen atoms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo imagine the L1 for venus is 2 million miles from venus of a toral of 100 m miles to the sun. The sun is\u00A0 about 100 Venus in diamter and Venus is about the diameter of the earth. So lets just say radius 6,500,000 meters\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthat means 100 x 2/100 =\u00A0 2 addition radii so that makes a total of about 20,000,000 meters. That means we need an area of 3.14 x 20E6 x 20E6 ~ 1.5E15 area in meters.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat would require 1E6 meters of raw materials. That 10E6 would have a density of 1500 kg per cubic meter or require 1.5E9 (1 thousand kilotonnes) of plastic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext how long would it take. 1.5E15 meter, assuming at peak we had 24 machines capable of laying out 0.01M/plastic per second in a length of 100 meters at a time. This would roughly cover a football field in 83 minutes. So covering that\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nlarge of an area would take how long? 24 x 0.01 = .24 M/second\u00A0 x 100M length = 24 M per second. At that rate we would need 200,000 years. Lets say each machine is 1000 kilos (very optimistic for a 3 printer 100 meters in length that also works in a vacuum) in mass. Lets say we can waste 1/3 of the mass of the plastic in machine with machine. That then means we can have 0.5E9 mass of machines or 500000 machines.\u00A0 (therefore total payload to venus is 2 thousand kilotonnes). Thus 500,000 x 0.01 = 5000 M/second. Therefore we need 9506 years to build. Still not doable. Lets say we increase the layout of plastic (this time brought from earth premade) is 1 meter per second. That means 95 years. Lets say we need only to block half the sunlight that 47.5 years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo our disc has to be tangent to the surface of venus and sun at their closest points, its orbiting both and thus it is turning with respect to both tangents, so the system would only be at a blocking for about 1/4 of the venusian year (venus has effectively no days). This means it needs to be wider to so we are talking minimally 1000 years to cool venus down and lower the surface pressure (assuming that some of the gases will react with surface molecules and some will liquify in the surface). Eventually enough gases liquify to neutralize the greenhouse effect and venus cools as if it were in a much higher orbit, with periods of substantial heating. (you could have two of these devices that are perpendicular to each other so that either are constantly deflecting radiation away from venus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now change your scenario abit. we start devising a plan, in say 30 years we begin executing that plan, then in say the year 3000 we reach the venusian surface were we begin mining that mineral. In a period of extreme effort we manage to create a mountain on Venus and lower the surface pressure to 0.001 ATM and achieve the ability to relaunch from venus into venusian orbit (160 km above the surface where the payload is picked up by a ion-driven transfer ship and 10 year later reaches earth L1 were is brought to earth. Total cost I would say 1 quadrillon dollars (given the cost per year is about 1 trillion in current dollars).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeveral cost savers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProvide ION drives can be manufactured from asteroids in space, solar panels from asteroids in space, the material for the deflectors could be made on asteroids and then diverted with ion drives to venusian orbit and insertion maybe lowering cost. The basic idea here is in 1000 years you can easily get anywhere in the inner solar system with ion power and solar panels (though panels are only 10% efficient after 50 years, that should improve). Thus close to the end of the project as the screen is growing its fastest, it can derive product from space based operations that do not require much fuel, thus payload from earth would decline.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe all know the problem on venus is greenhouse effects. The problem is how to thin the atmosphere. Instead of protecting the venusian atmosphere from the sun, lets just wipe it out. THis can be done quite easily and probably more cheaply. The major greenhouse components of the atmosphere have both an absorption frequency for outer and inner shell electrons. Using batteries in space it might be possible to store large amounts of energy, say several trillion small lasers. Fluid dynamics could be used to push molecules into orbit. The molecules and atoms can be excited by huge number of lasers that emmit stripping gases like Sulfer of the outer shell electons. These atoms would repell each other with great vigorousness and electrons would be lost to space causing the molecules to essentially blowout of the atmoshere into interplanetary space. We could use pulse laser arrays every few days to essentiall clear the upper atomsphere equitorial regions of all sulfer and carbon atoms, first ejecting them into high orbit, and then shooting them into space were solar winds pick them up.\u00A0 Once the greenhouse gases are removed a much smaller sheild, say about the diameter of venus should suffice to cool the planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA third means, we all know that venus barely spins, but it might be possible to tidally lock it with the sun. If that were the case you have a constantly cold region on the dark side of the planet, however there is alot of heat within venus, therefore it might be possible to use geothermal energy on the dark side to basically create a laser wall to basically sheild one area of venus from the rest of Venus. That dark area would eventually cool allowing people to work on the surface. You could use both filter systems and lasers to effective create positive pressure of low greenhouse gases inside the shield, lasers creating a wall with hotter parts and a pressure to force the unwanted gases out and radiative cooling into space to do the rest. Another means is simply have those lasers roll on the surface of venus, protecting the coolest area as it rolls along, first it could start small, protecting say 1 km of surface and then expand to protect 100s of km of surface. In the beginning one could use geosynchronous lasers to open up an area, and then very carefully landed craft in those areas (requires a direct down means of decelerating).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA forth means, get a neutron star and place it close to the sun, therefore turning it into a red dwarf wherein there is not enough energy h\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"radonek","CreatedById":84077,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-05T23:40:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222911170\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022154407\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221483602742\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129408\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerbiloid\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 hours ago, kerbiloid said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mentioned above asteroid bombardment would also heat the Venusian atmosphere and pollute it with dust.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis pollution would dramatically decrease its albedo (it would get grayish-brown instead of yellowish-while) and heat it even more.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIts dissipation rate would increase and at some moment the green house effect would disappear, and Venus gets cooler.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, we don\u0027t have any choice rather than start c\u003Cspan\u003Ehicxulubing the Venus as soon as possible.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt gets even better - careful placement of impacts could push planet\u0027s orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-06T10:52:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd every impact large enough to make noticeable effect will deposit a lot of energy into the atmosphere and lithosphere.
