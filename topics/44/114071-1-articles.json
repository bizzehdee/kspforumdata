We have clear evidence of this through gravitational lensing. When 2 galaxies collide all the normal matter slows down thanks to friction, light pressure et cetera. The dark matter only interacts via gravity, so it just flies on without slowing down. This velocity difference separates the galaxy from its dark matter halo. So when you look at the gravitational lensing of 2 colliding galaxies you see 4 spots with lots of mass: The 2 galaxies themselves and the 2 blobs of dark matter.

You have to remember that things happened ridiculously fast back then. It took less than 10^-12 seconds for baryogenesis to end. Your light cone is only about a millimeter wide at that point. How do you propose to separate the matter and antimatter on a galaxy wide scale when every particle can move less than a millimeter?\n\nBesides, we know it is possible for particle interactions to violate CP conservation. Neutral Kaons and B mesons are good examples of particles with a bias towards matter.

Galactic dark matter are quite dubious, for that their existence can be described (uh, substituted) by standard matter like interstellar gasses, a lot of red dwarfs, or stellar black holes. Worse are cluster\u0027s and supercluster\u0027s dark matter, for that intergalactic space is really empty (put another way, the gases are really tenuous), and there\u0027s no star there (only a handful), so standard matter have to be ruled out. Galactic dark matter are deduced from gravitational mass minus luminous mass, and cluster / supercluster dark matter are deduced from gravitational mass (often via gravitational lensing) minus luminous mass. Best part of gravitational lensing is, you can tell the distribution of the dark matter, and it\u0027s pretty bizarre...\n- Dark Energy : First introduced by Einstein to ensure his model of Universe are stable (even so, he stated that it\u0027s a menace, something that makes his equations looks bad), later retracted after Hubble\u0027s discovery of Universe\u0027s expansion. Yet later again, are re-introduced to explain the acceleration of Universe\u0027s expansion.

Hence, when you see a star 1 billion light-years away, you are actually feeling the very,very,very small gravitational influence from that star 1 billion years ago.\n\nSince others have already posted quite good answers about dark energy/matter. I thought I throw some interesting things in about gravity:\n\nYou\u0027re right about gravity exerting its effects with the speed of light. There are many experiments devised in order to test that with the help of gravitational waves. The idea being, that for example two dense stars or even black holes circling each other in close proximity and therefore very fast should send out disturbances very like waves. Consider the famous rubber sheet, but this time two dents close two each other, or maybe for better visualisation you put not a ball (or two in this case) but a stick in the middle, so that the dent looks elongated. If that stick rotates, the elongated dent changes direction, which an observer at the side can feel. Let\u0027s call that observer [LISA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_Interferometer_Space_Antenna) ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nFor large masses to leave \u0022trails\u0022, spacetime has to be somewhat inert or sluggish. In the rubber sheet analogy a ball or dent rolling on the sheet wouldn\u0027t leave a trail, but let\u0027s say rolling a ball on rubber foam or foamed plastic (like a memory foam mattress) would leave a trail in which other small probe balls could roll.\n\nInterestingly you\u0027re theory is not that far off. Space time has a certain sluggishness as the [Lense\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Thirring precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lense%E2%80%93Thirring_precession) perfectly shows. Again with the rubber sheet: Imagine you put you\u0027re index finger on the rubber sheet (and make a dent) and then rotate you\u0027re hand. The rubber sheet would twirl around your finger. Suppose you had painted radial lines from your fingertip outwards before twisting your hand. These lines were straight and are now curved, spiralling to the center.\n\nThat is basically what the Lense-Thirring effect means, large rotating masses \u0022twirl\u0022 the space time.\n\nBut this \u0022sluggishness\u0022 is too small or too weak for \u0022gravity trails\u0022 like you propose, or at least for the effects you want to explain with it. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E -lastly, i would like to point out,my views on why there are more matter than antimatter in the observable universe.\n\u003E -perhaps our observable universe is only a fraction of a bigger, undiscovered universe. Which means that huge pockets of antimatter galaxies and such exist in other areas of the universe. This balances out matter and antimatter perfectly.\n\nYes, that\u0027s a perfectly reasonable assumption. But for now it seems a bit ... useless. I\u0027m very sorry, if this sounds harsh, it isn\u0027t meant that way, but any assumption like that doesn\u0027t solve anything. Obviously it can\u0027t be directly tested, and so long as there doesn\u0027t exist a (mathematical) concept, mechanism, or what have you, that has measurable and testable consequences *inside* the observable universe, it can\u0027t be much more than a side note in the sciences, which it surely is, since it isn\u0027t disprovable either.\n\nThe scientific principle leads to the assumption in cosmology that our universe is homogeneous and isotropic. That means that our universe is everywhere the same (in terms of laws) and that every observer looking in any direction sees the same, basically it says that our place in the universe is not anything special, unlike the assumption of antimatter pockets outside but not inside of our observable universe.\n\nHope that helps a bit, and sorry if my writing style may be a bit weird, I\u0027m an english-not-first-languager ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-25T10:53:58Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2015 10:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Unheld**"},{"CreatedByName":"ZetaX","CreatedById":60692,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T10:37:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Problem only solved by the general relativity that say \u0022gravity\u0022 is not a force, but a space-time curvature, so it\u0027s action is instant, and not delayed (by the speed of ligth).\n\nNo, gravity\u0027s speed is probably c for all we know. General relativity has it move at the finite speed of c; please stop making this claim that it does otherwise, because it does definitely not. If it were instant, you would not have things such as gravitational waves. If someone right now stops the sun with a huge thruster, we would only feel the gravitational change in ~8 minutes, at the same time we see it happen.\n\nClaiming that it is faster because it curves spacetime is an unfounded claim; there is no reason the latter implies the former. Going further, any information transmission faster than c would allow to break causality using special relativity (has been posted so many times, please just search for elaborations); moving something and detecting that change in gravity is obviously a way to transmit information. So your proposal, which as I now repeat is not what general relativity says, has very severe implications and is probably wrong.\n\nSee also [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_gravity#General_relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_gravity#General_relativity).\n\nBut for most purposes, gravity behaves as if it were instant (\u0022no aberration\u0022): up to a high accuracy, a force spreading at the speed of light and being proportional to 1/r\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 behaves like an instantaneous force. Accuracy becomes even higher for the specific properties gravity has (but the former also applies e.g. to electromagnetism).\n\nThis does not mean it travels that fast. It only means that as long as gravity is just doing its thing, we won\u0027t see a notable difference to such behaviour. But as soon as other things come into play, e.g. a huge thruster on the sun, we will; or more accurately, we won\u0027t see the difference for 8 minutes as mentioned above.\n\nFunnily, this instantaneous-like behaviour is what keeps orbits stable, they would only last some hundreds to tens of thousands years otherwise.\n\nSee [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_gravity#Aberration_of_field_direction_in_general_relativity.2C_for_a_weakly_accelerated_observer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_gravity#Aberration_of_field_direction_in_general_relativity.2C_for_a_weakly_accelerated_observer) for some further details.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This mean that a \u0022gravity trail\u0022 can\u0027t be \u0022left behind\u0022 by some galaxy, as the \u0022gravity field\u0022 is a space-time curvature alway \u0022under\u0022 the galaxy mass and has no \u0022gravity trail\u0022 to left behind like a fold in the sheets: gravity \u0022instantly travel\u0022 with the mass.\n\nSure, the \u0022bulge\u0022 is always where the mass is.

Obviously it can\u0027t be directly tested, and so long as there doesn\u0027t exist a (mathematical) concept, mechanism, or what have you, that has measurable and testable consequences *inside* the observable universe, it can\u0027t be much more than a side note in the sciences, which it surely is, since it isn\u0027t disprovable either.\n\u003E \n\u003E The scientific principle leads to the assumption in cosmology that our universe is homogeneous and isotropic.
