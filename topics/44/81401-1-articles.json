The advantage of a rocket is that you can have reasonable acceleration. Transfer to the Moon from low Earth orbit takes something like 3km/s.

Fair enough in that case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI only skimmed the article but I think it refers more to two separate structures with an explosion which does not rely on them being in contact, at least not for the entire time they are being accelerated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alonso Quixano","CreatedById":118573,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-21T09:55:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMany thanks to everyone who replied.
