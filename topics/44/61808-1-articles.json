And there is a 50% chance of them knowing which slot it went through, and 50% where they don\u0027t know. I think that whenever they COULD (they didnt even check, but the mere fact that they could check) which slit it went through, there was a 2 slit pattern, and whenever they could not establish the fact, there was an interference pattern. This is mindboggling because the experiment setup did not change! This means that putting a detector at one of the slits has no effect on the behaviour of the particle! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what the peep is going on?

Dependend on the amplitudes of the propagating wave one can determine the probability of the particle to interact with the wall. For the sake of argument: Say the probability is 80%. If that is the case, than it obviously doesn\u0027t travel further. In the rest of the cases (20%) the particle won\u0027t interact with the wall but propagate throug the slit. Since it hasn\u0027t interacted with the wall, it still resembles a wave originating at the canon, and an interference pattern will form. The Amplitudes of the interference pattern at the back wall now determines the propability were the particle will interact with the wall. If you repeat the experiment with many particles, the pattern becomes visible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you place a detector at the slits, you force the particle to interact with the detector. There is now way of detecting a particle, without interacting with it. So the particle interacts with the detector at the two slits. Now it will propagate as a wave further to the back wall, but the wave doesn\u0027t have its origin point at the canon anymore, but at the point were the detector interacted with it, in front of one of the slits. A wave originating from that point doesn\u0027t create an interference pattern.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo just keep in Mind: Particles ALWAYS propagate as waves, but interact as particles.
