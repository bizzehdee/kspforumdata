I did it by patching together the orbital conics in a MathCAD spreadsheet (we didn\u0027t have manoeuvre nodes yet at that time).

It would not have intercepted Duna at all on the next pass. Depending on the type of cycler trajectory that you\u0027re trying to set up, an intercept may not occur every orbit. I think only an Aldrin Cycler trajectory will intercept every orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this case, the trajectory merely demonstrated that it was possible to set up a transfer with sufficient accuracy to intercept Duna and Kerbin on the same orbit, with very little in the way of orbital trim manoeuvres required to return to Kerbin. A true cycler would have to use a gravitational assist from Duna to set up the next intercept with Kerbin, and the gravitational assist from Kerbin would then set up the next intercept with Duna. Your craft may have to orbit for several years between each set of intercepts, however.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Swifty","CreatedById":57822,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T23:42:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been trying to under stand this Aldrin Cycler orbit.

However, it still requires what ever is being ferried onto the Cycler craft to be accelerated up to this speed. Thus Cycler orbits are not very useful for heavy unmanned cargo as a Hoffman transfer would be more cost effective?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this the correct understanding of the Cycler system, it\u0027s basically like an ocean liner that never stops.

Basically you\u0027re trying to arrive back at Kerbin when Kerbin and Duna are at the same relative positions as when you first launched.

So the cycler orbit should have the same period as the Kerbin-Duna synodic period, which is about 227.4 days.\u003Cp\u003EThere is no easy math way to calculate the exact trajectory since Duna\u0027s orbit is elliptical so you\u0027ll have slightly different orbits each time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
