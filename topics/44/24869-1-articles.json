Flying down meaning you slowly reduce your speed, possibly over several orbits, and eventually glide down to a landing. I am asking this if its possible in a real life (or just KSP/orbiter/other simulators) and I am wondering if it would be possible to do this with the goal avoiding the usual heating (and thus less heatshielding needed if at all) during a standard ballistic or space shuttle type reentry profile.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-30T20:59:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAtmosphere is to thin up in the high attitude where the burning going on for this to be possible.

The idea then was to have large wings to give the spacecraft a very low ballistic coefficient just like you\u0027re talking about.

Which means radiators, and a lot of coolant. The same amount of energy has to be absorbed and dissipated, only you can\u0027t burn your heatshield to do so. Plus, when you slow down in orbit, you fall, so you have to counteract with lift. Turns out that is difficult to do in such thin air. Also, yeah, the height of your reentry is a factor of your ballistic coefficient, Skylon would reenter far higher than the shuttle, because it is bigger and lighter. It would also stay on reentry regime far longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune. Burning away ceramics takes a huge amount of energy, while heating people to death takes very little in comparison.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"squeaky024","CreatedById":57319,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-01T03:37:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay guys thanks for the replies, I haven\u0027t had a chance to try it myself but I was just thinking \u0022what if I just fly down?\u0022 The thin air makes sense, no matter how fast you\u0027re going you can\u0027t get enough lift to get into more normal flight instead of orbital type trajectories.
