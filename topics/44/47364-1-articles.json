It\u0027s a chicken and egg problem, and although a reusable SSTO might reduce the hardware cost of a single launch, that unit hardware cost represents only a small fraction of the cost of an orbital launch.

The Russians benefited from economies of scale by series production of common elements (TKS, DOS, Proton, Soyuz...) instead of building a super duper launcher to launch it all in one flight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cost of the NDA/SIMAC will come down if NASA builds dozens of them instead of 2 or 3. You could also make the orbital tug part of the launch deal, like a smarter disposable upper stage similar to the way Kvant-1 was added to Mir, or something based on ATV or Cygnus. It would be like a COTS plan on steroids but for 20-40 ton payload modules instead of pressurized cargo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree, it adds complexity and has a weight penalty, but the cost of developing a whole new launcher with infrastructure, maintenance and manufacturing facilities for 10 launches over a 20 year period is crazy. SLS is going to suck up all of NASA\u0027s budget even more than STS did, and they will never have any money for the actual missions. Using private launch contractors allows commonalities with existing launchers and allows to share the investment with commercial and DOD launch requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think it\u0027s black and white, but I still think it\u0027s economically pretty clear cut. But more importantly, it forces NASA to concentrate on advancing the state-of-the-art in space technology and biology, which was supposed to be its primary mandate, instead of building yet another booster.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-05T08:07:43Z\u0022 title=\u002210/05/2013 08:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"drakesdoom","CreatedById":57297,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-05T08:46:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think this whole idea of continuing to launch exploration missions from earth is bunk frankly.
