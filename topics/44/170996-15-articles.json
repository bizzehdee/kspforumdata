However, one thing that does seems cheap with this starlink thing in the setup cost. The cost you pay to have the network being brought to your home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo have fiber optics brought to your home here, it\u0027s around 200e. Since it\u0027s a somewhat competitive market, some operators don\u0027t actually makes you pay for it, but they;re the exception, not the rule. And that\u0027s when you\u0027re in a dense urban area where optic fiber is just lying around nearby your home. If you live in a slightly remote area (or in some poor suburbs as I do), you\u0027re out of luck (or you were until recently) and can\u0027t have access to fast internet (the network infrastructure is saturated here, ADSL speed supposed to be at 20Mbps frequently dropped under 2Mbps).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if you\u0027re further away from the city, you might have to pay for one or two kilometers long trenches to connect your houses to fiber optics. So the satellite dishes rig at 350$ seems more reasonable.\u00A0 And it\u0027s a bit cheaper than other internet by satellites operators (NordNet, Eutelsat, and the likes) setup costs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, those \u0022free\u0022 modem and boxes you got with your internet access ?
