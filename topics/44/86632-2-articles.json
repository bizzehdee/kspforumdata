But that\u0027s probably an unnecessarily reductive view. Choice can be totally determined at the basic physical level, but seem free (and for all intents and purposed \u003Cem\u003Ebe\u003C/em\u003E free) at a higher level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) We also know that decisions are made by the brain before the conscious mind is aware of them. If we define free will as the ability of the conscious mind to make decisions, then it surely doesn\u0027t exist. But, this isn\u0027t as problematic as it seems: it\u0027s undeniable that \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003E process occurs inside the brain when making decisions. The a posteriori justification for the decision presented by the conscious mind need not be a false justification. In other words, just because the driver chooses where to go doesn\u0027t mean the passenger didn\u0027t also want to go there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) None of the above matters that much when you consider that it at least appears that we can make decisions. Obviously there is no such thing as a completely unrestrained decision. We\u0027re always affected by our physiological state (emotions, bodily needs, libido, etc), by our particular environmental situation (at work, at home, outside, driving, etc), by our culture and upbringing, by our values, our instincts, the people we\u0027re around, etc etc etc. But we do \u003Cem\u003Eseem\u003C/em\u003E to have the ability to make decisions in the presence of adverse stimuli. I can choose to forgo that donut even though I\u0027m hungry and I really want it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd maybe that\u0027s the best way to define free will: It\u0027s the apparent ability of humans to make decisions in the presence of two or more competing factors in the decision. Or, if we want to include \u0027reason\u0027 in the definition we could say: It\u0027s the apparent ability of humans to choose the option represented by reason when other factors dictate against it. Of course then we\u0027re left with the task of defining reason.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tery215","CreatedById":89094,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-09T21:01:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo people with fewer choices have \u0022less\u0022 free will because the decisions are based on logic and need?

Determinism in such systems is rather probabilistic and after multiple consequential steps we can get relatively wide spectrum of probable outcomes even if we know the initial values well enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother question: is the idea of \u0022I\u0027m doing this not because someone told me to do this, but because my own experiences also agree with this\u0022 manifestation of free will even if it also is rather deterministic?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-Velocity-","CreatedById":74097,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T15:36:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022gpisic\u0022 data-cite=\u0022gpisic\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHmmm, maybe we are determinist automatons but our complexity allows us to analyze and process our sensorial inputs in a very sophisticated way. The product of all this is the human beeing. Even if under exactly the same conditions we would react in the exactly same way this might NOT be an argument for lacking of free will. The question is more like: Is free will compatible with determinism? That is the point where the opinions get seperated. To answer this question we still have to learn more about the human brain because we still do not understand it to an full extend.\u003Cp\u003EAlso some interesting questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan there be a program that acts different every time under the same exact conditions? (Random number generators won\u0027t work when they start with the same seed)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, random number generations can be based on a chaotic system or a quantum state and generate random numbers without a seed. But to equate randomness with free will is ridiculous. If something is random, then NO ONE CHOSE IT. Randomness is just as different from free will as determinism is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, the strictest definition of free will is a calculation/decision/computation made where at least some part of that decision is not decided by the laws of physics, and is instead decided by some non-physical component that embodies \u0022will\u0022 and \u0022purpose\u0022. Without this non-physical component, the decision was decided wholly by pre-determined, known physical laws operating on the decision making \u0022machine\u0022. At \u0022worst\u0022, the decision was only subject to quantum non-determinism, and as others point out, quantum non-determinism may actually be an illusion itself. Quantum non-determinism certainly isn\u0027t under anyone\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Econtrol\u003C/em\u003E, and thus cannot be a component of free will anyway!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy this definition, free will is non-deterministic, but it is NOT randomness. The ONLY WAY it can exist is if there is some \u0022higher\u0022 universe where souls exist and that these souls can be \u0022tapped\u0022 by decision-making machines to empower them with free will. Occam\u0027s razor says entertaining such an idea is ludicrous, so we almost certainly do not have free will under this definition.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-10T15:38:45Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2014 03:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T16:00:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe more I read the more I think that \u0022free will\u0022 is a nonsensical concept that can never be defined.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if you try to get away from the physical or biological factors determining your actions, you can always ask \u0022what is controlling your brain, and what rules does that thing follow\u0022, and then we\u0027re back to determinism again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-10T16:02:45Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2014 04:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Cpt.
