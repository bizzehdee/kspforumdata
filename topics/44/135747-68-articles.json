They wanted to keep the androgynous design like APAS instead of probe-drogue which doesn\u0027t have the same flexibility in contingency situations. IDA permits for the most flexible style, so Russian design was out even though it\u0027s simpler and lighter. On the US orbital segment, they want full IDA eventually. Russia will continue to use probe-drogue. US has Common Berthing Mech, which has a very strong structure. That means a much larger hatch than other ports like IDA, and a strong hatch.

Any longer is almost impossible to determine, but they can use climatology to determine good times if it\u0027s a year out or so, but it\u0027s still quite variable.

Docking is complex because you have to go straight in, so you can\u0027t go too fast but you can\u0027t go slowly either. Though docking now is very reliable, berthing is very simple because you kill your velocity at 10 meters away and then use the arm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, docking can be done in an automated fashion, berthing requires a human to control the arm.
