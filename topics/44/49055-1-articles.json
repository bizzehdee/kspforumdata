Yes, that\u0027s right, NO OBJECT, EVER has been considered by astronomers threatening enough to start warning the public. Even Apophis, the object to achieve the highest score on the Torino scale ever, was not threatening enough, as when it achieved its highest score (4), the impact was more than a decade out, which, according to astronomer\u0027s definition of level 4 on the Torino scale, means that no special attention by the public is required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if the asteroid that hit that Russian town last February had been detected before impact, it would have been the first object to require a special warning (it looks like it would have scored an 8 on the Torino scale), but it wasn\u0027t detected before it lit up the morning skies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happens is astronomers share their data with each other, out in the open (because this is SCIENCE), and the sensationalist media types see the data on newly discovered objects, hyping up unlikely impact scenarios for higher ratings/sales before astronomers get the chance to build a long enough observation arc to pin down the orbit of the object.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-18T21:02:24Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2013 09:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DaveofDefeat","CreatedById":58539,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T20:57:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot to mention we are losing our atmosphere, we need to stop it!

Maybe some things can be made to work with several decades lead time to develop the science and technology, then more lead time to launch the actual mission, and unlimited funding during all that. But that\u0027s never going to happen. It won\u0027t yield a result that can be sold for votes before the next elections, so it doesn\u0027t get funded, it\u0027s that simple.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe if this asteroid mission was put under the same restrictions as most space endeavours, then it probably won\u0027t work. But the reason most space endeavours don\u0027t get that much money or popular support is because the \u0022man in the street\u0022 dosen\u0027t see the immediate practical benefits. A mission to SAVE THE WORLD FROM A KILLER ASTEROID is an incredibly easy sale. More money than what was put into both Apollo and the Manhattan project would be sunk into it if required, because you can\u0027t put a price on the survival of the human species. Experts from around the world, in all fields of science and engineering, would happily volunteer their services, so having a skilled enough workforce is not an issue. Support from the pubic, and government, is not a problem either, because of the obvious implications of a mission failure. Why would any politician not want to support something like this, if not supporting it meant the destruction of the human race?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat pretty much leaves the only possible issues being technological, which is pretty meaningless, since at least some of the people who draw up missions to deflect asteroids know what they\u0027re talking about. If you are willing to put forward every serious mission designed, and explain exactly why they would never work, even if it had universal approval, all the money it needs, and the best scientists and engineers the world has to offer, then I will be willing to read it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-19T00:49:12Z\u0022 title=\u002210/19/2013 12:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Drunkrobot\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mdatspace","CreatedById":83778,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T01:45:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKrakatoa was a volcanic eruption.
