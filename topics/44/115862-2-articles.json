So Neptune has cleared its orbit, because the only things sharing it are Trojan asteroids and Plutinoids locked into a 3:2 orbital resonance (and minor Neptune-crossers which haven\u0027t been fully cleared). The same with Earth, everything earth-crossing is either locked in orbital resonance with earth (like Cruithne), or it is slowly being perturbed either towards an orbital resonance or ejection from earth\u0027s orbit. \n\nThere is a mathematical parameter used to determine how dominant a planetary body is over its orbit, and how likely it is to clear its neighbourhood over astronomical timescales. It is called the Stern-Levison Parameter, and is anything but arbitrary. The major planets have Stern-Levison parameters from 942 (Mercury) to 1.3E9 (Jupiter). The most gravitationally dominant dwarf planet over its orbit is Pluto, with a Stern-Levison parameter of 2.95E-3. So Jupiter is 7 orders of magnitude more dominant than Mercury, and Mercury is 5 orders of magnitude more dominant than Pluto. Pluto, Ceres, Eris, Haumea and Makemake all have S-L parameters of roughly the same order of magnitude, so if you let one in you have to let them all in. Not that I\u0027m against that, but the IAU defined a very clear cut-off point of a Stern-Levison parameter of 100 for full planetary status. It\u0027s not a subjective \u0022yeah that orbit is probably clear enough\u0022 sort of a thing.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-14T18:19:51Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2015 06:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by peadar1987**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T18:51:19Z","Content":"A number of posts had been removed from this thread for attacking each other\u0027s nationalities, being off-topic, and so on.
