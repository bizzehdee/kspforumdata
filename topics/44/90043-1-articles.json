A microscopic examination of the probe would show lacks the complexity to contain an intelligent mind, and isotopic and elemental analysis would show it was powered by the radioactive decay of plutonium 238, whose decay products would still exist, in the correct ratios. It would be a very simple machine to them. Now, perhaps they DO recognize it as a form of life- they might, and some humans already consider machines as having a simple form of sentience. However, they\u0027ll recognize that the probe cannot have constructed ANYTHING itself, it didn\u0027t have an intelligent mind, and it doesn\u0027t appear to have any means of replication. It thus must have been created by something else, something more complex. Meanwhile, if the pictures survive, they show a bipedal creature that uses tools and has five-fingered hands. The most logical conclusion is that these creatures were the ones that created the probe. There are other explanations (such as the message being some sort of deception), but none of them are as simple and likely. You think that the aliens will be so stupid they might not even be able to apply Occam\u0027s razor?

They might have a hard time understanding why we would want to send a message to them, but how is an intelligent civilization ever going to evolve without curiosity, without a drive to explore?
