They both are for different reasons.\n\n1. Any mission to the moon begins with returnable lander on the moon. This is not there to rescue 100 people, its there to take folks back who have a medical need that cannot be treated on the moon. \n\n2. dV. THe moon is a few hundred dV, mars is a few 1000 to land. Getting a lander back in space and back to earth is a challenge. This challenge to a mars landing can be circumvented if Phobos is selected instead of mars. Mars may slow down reentry (not much for the really heavy people movers) but it has alot more dV to stop, more with aerobraking than the moon has without, but the big killer is getting off. On the moon we can do a suicide burn with accuracy, on Mars you going to have to burn above the target and then reburn to land. \n\n3. CO2 without water does not make mars a better choice than the Moon. You can, with difficulty make O2 from CO2, its simply easier to make O2 from water, and you get hydrogen, which can react with CO2 at high temperature. Even if you use plants to make O2, the reaction requires water. Just because Mars has an atmosphere does not make it a better choice. Unless you have a probe that has discovered liquid or frozen water on mars at a high enough density, making fuel for return trip is nearly impossible. The water that is in the martian soil would be depleted quickly for any productive effort without a full fledged surface manipulation technology designed for that application. \n\n4. Establishing a base on Mars moons first makes alot more sense, it is essentially a grounded space station.\n\n5. Time, time is essentially. I am scientist, my objective is collect science, not spend 18 months in flight time doing nothing for a 20 day mission. I would suspect that the type of science done on moon now would be of a probative or astro-observational, the second has a 15 day cycle no need to keep scientist there full time. \n\n6. Micrometeors - dig down on moon, kill 2 birds with one stone, radiation and micrometeors. Or transport a moon dozer and doze moon sand on top of a grounded station. Need to get Dozer to mars through the atomsphere but we see from our studies, Mars does not have enough hv to run serious equipment off of solar. The moon has 15 days of 1.3 kw/m^2^\n\n7. Both Moon and Mars have O and H trapped in their rocks, it a matter of finding an efficient way of getting it out. If you dug a hole deep enough into the moon you could create an atmosphere that would easily be trapped by a trapdoor or lasers. \n\nDrawbacks of the Moon, it solar cycle is 30 days, which mean that solar needs either a massive lithium Ion battery or nuclear assists\n\n8. Technological proving ground-Most important. Its not about CO2 or O2, this is overemphasized, its about surface manipulation. The tools you apply on the moon will fail, but new technologies can be brought in a cycle of a few weeks, and structural failures can be returned to earth within a few days for analysis. You bring a tool to mars it breaks, you make a new one on Mars it breaks again, finally you can\u0027t make any tools. It breaks on the moon, send it back on a space teather to a space station, see if the can figure out why it broke, if not place it on a small scale re-entry vehicle and send it back to earth for analysis. \n\n9. Productivity, once again tether the space station to an orbit between the earth and the moon and if you can manipulate the moon surface it can be potentially be used to create new objects in space."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T23:34:24Z","Content":"Not only is the Moon closer, but it\u0027s easier to get on and off of.

Somebody correct me if I\u0027m wrong.\n\nIn theory, wouldn\u0027t it be possible to build a space elevator from the Moon\u0027s surface, through Lagrange point L1 and all the way to Earth GSO? Such a structure would be nearly 350 thousand kilometers tall. I know this is what Liftport is trying to do, but their elevator only extends from the surface to L1.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-07T03:22:16Z\u0022 title=\u002203/07/2015 03:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainKorhonen**"},{"CreatedByName":"Newt","CreatedById":131025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T03:39:13Z","Content":"Another difficulty is communications. Earth bound technicians and engineers can conduct conversations with people on the Moon, with a slightly awkward but easily managed delay. If the People on the Moon have an issue, Earth can know in a second, and immediately start helping to troubleshoot. When the Mars base has a problem, Earth knows in a few minutes at best, and can only start to help troubleshooting after the astronauts should have made some response on their own. Astronauts are well trained people, and they will not do something damaging just because they do not get that help, but having additional guidance and feedback from fellow astronauts, the people who built and designed your vehicle, and the people who operate and monitor it on Earth, would help a lot.\n\nBuilding bases on the Moon would be helpful so that when the \u0027training wheels\u0027 of rapid communications are let off, we will already know better how to deal with astronauts on a ground base, and with fixing problems that can arise there."},{"CreatedByName":"Kibble","CreatedById":131042,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T05:16:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Travel time might be the number 1 response, it\u0027s only takes 3 days to get to the Moon.\n\u003E So that\u0027s the travel time, but how much time do you need to get a rocket on the pad to safe a Lunar crew in serious trouble?\n\nIn the event of a failure of the habitat, or if an astronaut requires medical attention, you can swiftly and easily abort back to Earth. At Mars if an astronaut requires urgent medical attention they will most likely die, and if the habitat fails when its not a TEI launch window, then they will all die when the resources for the return trip are exhausted. Id est the Moon return vehicle quickly brings the astronauts home, such that life support is only required for a few days, rather than many months.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E In which scenarios can a crew be saved after 5 days?\n\nIf the lander ascent stage doesn\u0027t work. If the ascent stage *does* work, you can just abort back to the Earth.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s atmosphere, it can stop micro meteorites, reduce the radiation\n\nEarth\u0027s atmosphere is not the thing that blocks all that solar radiation, its the magnetic field, which Mars doesn\u0027t have. Plus the atmosphere of Mars is less than 1% as dense as ours.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It has water in it\u0027s soil, which can be used to make oxygen and hydrogen and the CO2 can be made into methane.\n\u003E The Moon has areas with water ice, but nowhere near as much as Mars and it\u0027s mostly in dark places.\n\u003E \n\u003E Not an ideal place if you want to use solar panels or want to use the Sun to illuminate the area.\n\nWater isn\u0027t the only valuable resource out there. Even if excavating water and Moon poles turns out a little too hard for vaguely near-term operations, the dirt on both Mars and Moon is made mostly of aluminium oxide, which can be split for oxygen, and burned with the aluminium as rocket fuel. If you really want volatiles like water, the best place to look is the Minor Planets.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Mars also has a 24h 40m day, instead of 29.5 days.\n\nWe\u0027ve proven space hardware can survive Lunar nights.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s gravity, it\u0027s still only 1/3rd of Earth\u0027s gravity. Again we don\u0027t know what the real world implications, but that\u0027s still better than 1/6th which the Moon has.\n\nIt would suck to go all the way to Mars just to find out the gravity isn\u0027t enough, and the astronauts return years later with major health problems. OTOH Kirk Sorenson\u0027s wonderfully effective, brilliant xGRF concept both makes rotating piloted orbital facilities viable, and makes testing the human body\u0027s response at different levels of acceleration easy. If one sixth of a gravity is enough, that would be the best news for human spaceflight since Buzz Aldrin proved manual labour in micro-gee environments is possible.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-07T05:20:09Z\u0022 title=\u002203/07/2015 05:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kibble**"}]}
