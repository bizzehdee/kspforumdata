The next thought was to tether two asteroids together to make a dumbbell spinning around a common center of mass. Suddenly all the problems of weightless mining and materials handling are moot. \u00A0Each asteroid can be treated as if it were the top of a mountain, and all directions are down. However,\u00A0, there is the problem of\u00A0manoeuvring megaton masses into close proximity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen just the other day I watch Cody repair a broken Crooks tube and I had a couple of ah-ha moments in one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLace a contact binary asteroid into a pair of nets/bags with the mouths toward each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the asteroid spins, apply a thin layer of ice to the widdershins side of each half of the pair whilst it is in shadow, for the sun to evaporate as it rotates into light. Unless I\u0027m completely mistaken, this should slowly accelerate the asteroid\u0027s rotation, eventually causing the two halves to separate. \u00A0Coating the spinward sides with a material that is efficient at both absorbing light and re-radiating it as heat, adds in\u00A0the Yarkovsky Effect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSlowly lengthen the \u0022laces\u0022 until gravity is sufficient for mining. My guess is 5-10% of Earth normal gravity would be sufficient to hold machinery \u0022down\u0022 and keep liquids settled in covered and suitably baffled containers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anything like this been considered seriously? \u00A0Would it work?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-12T04:52:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn \u0022Rose and Worm\u0022 sci-fi they attached a pair of asteroids (16912 Rhiannon and another one caught during a close fly-by) with polymer tether and net produced from the inner carbon dioxide of the asteroid.\u00A0 Caverns which appeared became living chambers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
