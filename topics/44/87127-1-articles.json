Tritium is radioactive hydrogen isotope which can be produced artificially and it is even more sensitive to fusion than deuterium. He3 is light helium atom, which produce less neutrons when fused with deuterium. Neutrons can damage structures of reactor and make materials radioactive. However, He have larger electric charge and is therefore much more difficult to achieve fusion at all. Even easiest reactions are extremely difficult due to high electric potential energy barrier between nuclei. That needs overinsane temperatures (tokamaks have achieved fusion but not net energy production), combined insane temperatures and pressures (hydrogen bombs, no problem is too bad to mankind if it helps to kill others) or exotic muon catalysis (fusions happens but producing of muons takes much more energy).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grimfilth","CreatedById":35000,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-14T15:02:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022fenderzilla\u0022 data-cite=\u0022fenderzilla\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOkay cool, i wasn\u0027t really that worried to begin with anyway.
