Of course this is just my unprofessional opinion, but I would like to see a little bit longer succession statistics before I would land my billion \u20AC spacecraft on Mars with a Skycrane. But on the other hand, space exploration is pioneering work, in which there are no development without brave attempts to do things by new insane ways.
