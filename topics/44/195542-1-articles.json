I wasn\u0027t referring to us. What I was saying (or trying to say) is that any conflict between advanced technological civilizations won\u0027t use antimatter based weaponry. The reason is because antimatter just isn\u0027t worth making. To make 1 tonne of antimatter requires a minimum of 2 tonnes of mass-energy. With that much energy you could produce billions of tonnes of steel, or billions of tonnes of aluminum. Or hundreds of thousands of conventional nuclear warheads. Likely millions of warheads. And that\u0027s the minimum cost. It will undoubtedly require more energy. And energy is effectively a strategic resource. Without it nothing is possible. A less energetic civilization could still win against a more energetic civilization provided clever strategies and tactics, but that can only be stretched so far.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAntimatter production is difficult, not just in terms of energy cost but also in infrastructure cost. It requires large installations and with it large radiators. Not to mention expensive and complex equipment to handle the large amounts of energy. And then there\u0027s storing it. The antimatter production facilities would make an easy target, meaning that the faction that uses antimatter would need to devote even more resources to defending those resources. Antimatter is a trap - any civ that tries to use will regret it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll the weaker side has to do is destroy those missiles. And there won\u0027t be a lot of them - they\u0027re so expensive. For every amat missile the enemy builds the other side can produce dozens, hundreds, possibly thousands of warships or even more. It isn\u0027t just more firepower. Even if every amat warhead takes out a few hundred enemy ships - it will still not be enough. A missile with 1 tonne of amat will be worth hundreds of thousands of warships in energy terms. Possibly millions. Using antimatter is a death sentence - for the side that uses antimatter. It\u0027s the largest waste of resources possible in a technological conflict. The opportunity cost is too great. One warhead that might take out a few hundred or even a thousand enemy ships isn\u0027t worth the hundreds of thousands or even millions of ships that could be built instead. The combat might look like a few thousand amat missiles vs millions or billions of warships. With that many warships they likely have enough firepower collectively to destroy most of the enemy missiles before they can get close. It wouldn\u0027t be hard - they just have to cause the amat to lose containment and the missile will destroy itself.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s before taking into account more realistic efficiencies for antimatter production. A fairly optimistic number is 10 thousand - that is it takes 10 thousand times as much energy as mass-energy. This would only make this relationship worse. Instead of being worth millions of ships a single amat bomb with 1 tonne of amat would be worth billions of ships in energy cost.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo sane civilization will use antimatter as a weapon. The energy cost is so immense that any sane civ will have better things to do with their time and energy. There are millions of better things to do with that energy. And many better uses for that antimatter as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-12T03:18:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm.
