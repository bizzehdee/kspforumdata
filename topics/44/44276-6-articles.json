Yes, you cannot believe in Jesus, that\u0027s fine - you could even believe that aliens created us, okay, but that still leaves the question, who or what created them? Who created everything? I can go even further and say, maybe like in science-fiction movies, our universe and our whole existence as we know it is just a part of another bigger universe, maybe we are just a seed of pollen in a bigger places. So, that still leaves the question of what created any of that? What created God? Why are we here to question this? No matter what you think, there is a God. Something had to of created all of this, it doesn\u0027t just happen because of \u0022Gravity\u0022, what created that gravity and allowed all of it to form then, huh? Maybe it is nothing some might say, okay but still why and what created that nothing even? You can\u0027t answer this, no one can, and it is likely that no person ever will in life, but anyone that believes in no god or creator at all, you are the stupidest of all people, no words can even describe how moronic and mentally challenged you have to be to not believe in any god at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can understand if he has a hate for God for his disability, but still, that is extremely pathetic in any form no excuse, for someone with as bright of a mind as him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can state a theory or my own about why the universe exists. I never went to college, I never deeply studied space for hours and hours like Hawking probably has, but I know enough to know that my theory is a good plausible theory, for many reasons. Am I going go be great like Stephen Hawking, probably not, but he is probably no better than me if he truly thinks like that. In fact I might actually be smarter than him in forms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo start, and this is my theory, I think that Black Holes do exist. It is pretty obvious that they do, and it is pretty obvious that humans are right about there being a supermassive Black Hole in the center of almost every universe. That is how planets, stars, elements and matter is formed and thrown together to create things, by spinning around and orbiting the black hole. That is most likely what keeps our universe and everything in it rotating and moving. Even our sun rotates around an even bigger object that itself. Now, something is holding our universe and everything in it together, isn\u0027t it? It can\u0027t just be nothing. That is where the theory of dark matter comes into play. It is theorized that dark matter is what holds the universe together. Where my theory comes in, is that everything is formed from dark matter, everything. Black holes take in and basically eat light and matter, as well as anything around it, right? (At least that\u0027s what we think, truly no one in history has ever even truly positively seen a black hole, and we definitely know nothing about them for a fact) Well, I believe that black holes take in these elements, and I believe that they spit out dark matter in return. This would explain the expansion of the universe over time. Black holes create dark matter. They create everything. But, as with all deep-minded scientific theories, it does have a plot hole. Because this leaves the question, wait, then if they took in elements and light and spit them out as dark matter, how did they also form the light and elements that it is taking in? That is a hard question to answer, and the only thing that truly comes to mind is reproduction or teleportation. But we can think about that deeper at another time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is what I think, I believe that in the beginning God created a plan. God designed us (as well as probably countless other of beings and creations just like us), God designed the universe. Then, I also believe in the big bang theory as well, and I believe that God let the universe expand and create life and everything over time just as he planned it, and it is still expanding today. This explains almost every creation and universal expansion theory there is in one. I believe that these black holes, are the reason behind our universe expanding and generating more life and satellites, stars, matter, elements, planets, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are so many theories of what black holes are and what they do, but this is just one theory that really just makes since.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can think what you want, there are stubborn people out there that believes strictly in religion, there are some people that believe strictly in science, that is okay, but to say that a god or something did not create nothing, is just the stupidest thing one can ever think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Blake Matthew Tompkins\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T03:23:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReligious matters such as the nature and probability of a god are beyond the scope of this forum, and inevitably lead to acrimonious arguments.

I think the bigger question is why a state that could have been stable for a inifity becaume unstable. Between the initial state and inifinity i think the models have it that the universe coukd have not inflated, or inflated somewhere else at a diiferent times as suggested by multiverse model. Some even go so far as to say our space-time physics may only be situational and that under different circumstances the physics might be very different. The universe exists, we call it everything and we guess at how long it lasted.
