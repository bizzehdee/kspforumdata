Orbital rockets are already have very constrained requirements with relatively low margins. Additional requirements will substantially increase the development cost and force you to compromise other parameters of the vehicle. For example, a rocket that is designed to be fueled vertically only needs ribbing or reinforcements on the longitudinal axis. If you have to add lateral reinforcements, with internal struts or plates, it will end up being heavier, which will impact performance. This means that the upper stage will need to be a bit larger to compensate, and the aircraft, which has its own constraints, might need to be even heavier, etc... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure, it can be done, but it has a cost.

Let\u0027s then be generous and assume that the launch vehicle has wings that allow it to redirect all of that speed vertically without any expenditure of delta-V. The weight of those wings will affect payload capacity however. The extra structural weight that will be required for the tank to sustain lateral stresses during climb to launch altitude and during the turn from horizontal to vertical will also affect payload to orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn that case, your rocket will need an additional instantaneous delta-V of 200 m/s to match the shuttle\u0027s speed at that altitude (i.e. accelerating from 235 m/s to 435 m/s requires a delta-V of 200 m/s).
