You get a sense of this that 51L had two fault to destruct modes, one is on the pad (the grease did not fill in the hole) or in flight (grease fills but then is pushed through). So it really doesn\u0027t matter in the long run if the orbiter breaks up from aerodynamic forces or gets blown to smithereens on the launch pad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe designation criticality I is something a manager uses, it lacks the detail needed to determine if the critical structure was robust enough under any circumstance to fly. The engineers believed that a situation developed over time whereby a design they thought they could trust could no longer be trusted under many operational states, and they were awaiting disaster. One has to wonder what MT had done had the blow hole was on the other side and the system limped to booster separation and aborted to say Spain or LEO. Would have they then said no . . you cant fly this anymore. . .too dangerous. Suppose the end of the booster had broken off and had been lost in the Atlantic. And then what, just say it separated on landing . . . .even though you expected it to blow up on launch pad. MT moved the two most critical engineers to other parts of the company and initially tried to blame one of them, but the report exonerated them. It was an attempted coverup, obstruction of justice . . no charges there were filed either. No culpability. Its institutional culture that caused it, file the RICO on them if its institutional.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou have to back a little bit away from the incident once you know that the culture of the institution was the primary cause of the accident and then look at the culture and argue the case. What are all the what ifs. If one what-if is that he you can blow up any time during the first 90 seconds of flight aerodynamic forces or not, then that\u0027s it, that\u0027s what it is.\u00A0 Then you need to go to the design chain of command and ask, why did we choose this and why are we still using it. . . . . .And why isn\u0027t critical information being passed. The report itself did not go far enough, they did not criticize the OMB for making the decision, they did not offer\u00A0 a bypass stance allowing for procurement of alternative boosters, and worse MT was not held negligent and its company officials walked away without a scratch, basically.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-17T20:57:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223270695\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022169590\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221516222458\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107380\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nJust now, PB666 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn engineer or safety officer is a more or less an advanced technician, they are not managers.

As a consequence, a seam burst, a fortuitous oxide seal formed, but that was eventually torn off by windshear, exposing the main tank and support structure to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E plume, culminating in a strut failing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey do not, however, address what transformed the Challenger LOV event into a LOCV (Loss Of Crew and Vehicle) event.

In the case of\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EChallenger\u003C/em\u003E, there is an abort tower to permit crew abort from T=0, and my understanding is that Orion would have stood a very good chance of separating for a safe parachute landing. Not guaranteed, but a heck of a lot better than \u0022have to hold onto failing SRBs and pray\u0022. Mission failure, but crew survival. In the case of\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EColumbia\u003C/em\u003E, unless gravity magically reversed itself, falling foam would not possibly have hit the Orion vehicle.
