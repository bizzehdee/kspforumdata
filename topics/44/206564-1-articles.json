If this plane technically has a wing edge. I\u0027m hoping the diamondish shape lends to making that a non issue.

I\u0027m assuming that would help with making it strong enough for good maintenance/reusability. It\u0027s also a potential wing loading of 144lb/f2.

It could land with lox seeping out it\u0027s pores. And possibly burn all fuels then use pure lox to deorbit if it has enough. Not sure if it would have a small amount of normal fuel for landings or subsonic flight or whatnot.

You could being them out of the body on demand for certain parts of flight. Maybe they could be made to auto adjust as needed or as is efficient somehow in a simplistic reactive way that doesn\u0027t create too much extra drag. I\u0027m assuming my wing being symmetrical, and potentially designed to fly upside down, might want these on top and bottom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApparently this isn\u0027t new: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijae/2021/9370331/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijae/2021/9370331/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould these be made of that niobium metal for going to orbit?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould these be put in a scramjets air flow to help light it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found the thrust to weight of the xrs2200 and rs2200. 35 and 80. so 800,000 thrust is only 11-12 tons no matter what. That is fairly light. So, that could go in the engine or fuselage weight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit2: I also forgot to apparently multiply by ln. I was working with much larger delta v. I was doing 900x9.81x1.0776 instead of ln(1.0776)*9.81*900.... Unless scramjets and whatnot can be that efficient on the way up. 8\\\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it can still get to orbit, but it needs a good chunk of the cargo to do so. Have to refigure this now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I give it around 844 tons of more methane(assuming you can run it on methane) and near 596 tons of cargo it might be able to make it. So, maybe a 0.3 cargo ratio. similar to the shuttle. But it might need to take off more tonnage for fuel and structure. This assume 1450 average isp from the scramjets and 450 average isp for the aerospikes.(along with 9550 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDv\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E to fully circularize orbit and not just get apoapsis up.) The fuel would fit in 2 24 ft diameter fuel tanks at 72 ft long. Might have to be specially shaped or some fuel in the wings. But this would have the benefit of more cryogen in the ship to cooling to the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo idea on the other cost. But it is near the same values as the shuttle in some ways. I think it\u0027s main point would be for ultra dense cargo.(mainly because the original design is from a bomber for moab/mop bombs) Unless a larger version is made.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor less dense cargo it would need it\u0027s bigger version at around 288ftx144ft and use liquid hydrogen. That might give room for a larger cargo bay. No idea on the cargo size though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you convert a ge9x engine into a ram/scramjet and only use the rear smaller diameter? if you could fit at 1.5meters diameter at 4x on each side and 110,000lb thrust they would be usable for takeoff. Assuming I\u0027m not missing anything else. If it could be brought down to 18,000lbs per engine instead of 21,000 it would be perfect. The rest of the engine could be in the other weight categories as It\u0027s using methalox cryogen to cool around the air intake. Assuming you can do that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom what I\u0027m reading, the proper compression ratio for ramjet is around 60 and scramjet between 50 and 100... The ge9x is around 61:1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe not. I did it with more detailed scramjet info(I think.). It might be able to get 236-308 tons to orbit. Depending on the engine weight.

This gives 560t cargo with 1166t of fuel. this gives 20-22 tons for aero forces for extra fuel and if ram/scram need more weight or other issues. Not sure if turboprops could add more efficiency to the start of the flight or not. Or if any of the above is even correct.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I\u0027m correct the wing weight and body weight are the same at max load. around 583/560/583 with the center more conventrated and the wings distributing the weight more on the sides and with more structure in the center and body where needed. Optimal distribution might be 666.66/666.66/666.66. The fuel would take up any space not used. Not sure how the fuel loads change over time with lower loads.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith fuel cost alone that is 5 dollars per lb of cargo. and you could run tickets for 1728 persons, if they can fit, at near 3-5k a seat! 8) 5k making around 3.3million per flight above fuel costs. Fuel cost 5.25 million per flight at full load. Not sure how much fuel for a people run. That is about less than halve the tonnage, not including seats and other things. So maybe half the tonnage. If fuel is halved for half cargo then you could have bare minimum seats cost 1500 per person for a 1728 person flight. I\u0027m assuming that doesn\u0027t work that way with fuel though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit4: And I forgot to half the cubic area so unless you fly a wing that has a blunt or very rounded edge along the front/back it has a lot less space and must run on kerosene. Not sure how to do that one. If you could make the front fat and round enough to make up for the thin back and not loose volume for fuel you might be able to run on methane. If not kerosene. Unless I just did all the math wront... I hate math. Nope, it has around 72,000 cubft to use and I thought it had 144,000. This means it can\u0027t hold the methane fuel. It needs more dense. by about 2x. Or more interesting combinations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cs\u003EThis can probably be done better for more cargo space. But as is it might allow 288t cargo. If not it might be able to get up to the 560t stated before with more details. Especially the scramjet to mach 25 part.\u003C/s\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cs\u003EThis is then down to 0.144 cargo ratio. So, unless it\u0027s cheaper it\u0027s worse than the shuttle. And airfriction not accounted for could take the entire cargo away. So, a 2 ton maybe reusable ship for a few crew members and if lucky a few 100 tons of cargo at most. Unless my math is still that far off in a good way. Probably not since I used what were probably hydrogen \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E values and not methane! 8) So, goodbye cargo! 2000 ton 2 passenger plane to orbit! Maybe. Not to mention structural weight hasn\u0027t been gone over. I bet it\u0027s heavier than expected. Maybe a bigger plane with more weight and bigger wing. Then hydrogen and maybe some less dense cargo.

If I make it fly omnidirectionally with sc/ramjets facing towards the 60degree angle and the other engines towards the 120 degree angle or something. It can use both edges for a nose.

If my new math is correct I have 192,000ft3 to play with(maybe 172,000ft3?) and not 72k. This means\u00A0 pure hydrogen(maybe methane/lox if it can get to mars) and a massive tank in the middle. This ships points is to start at a 120 degree angle and slowly turn towards to 60 degree angle as you increase mach speed. If it can get liquid air/lox all the way up to mach 25 it only needs a tank of 168 tons of hydrogen(52.5105984 ft diameter, 75812.27ft3) to start until it hits space and then fills(or already has filled) a middle tank inside with lox/Lair for the final boost. This means a max takeoff weight of 2160 tons. 8 sabre engines(body rotates, but tank/engines stay in the same direction as body rotates around them.) and double landing gear top and bottom.

If you run at 8:1 ratio and some of it is recollected like it were at 6:1 could this save on oxidizer somehow. The last stage has to go up to 2500 tons if it can\u0027t collect/recycle. any reuse might be helpful to add to collection and have more on hand at any moment, even if it adds inefficiencies. The ship has enough storage room for oxidizer, but the weight of it makes the hydrogen use too inneficient and increases it beyond the tank limit potentially. If not close(assuming my math is close to correct.) any effective increase in oxidizer without adding more mass at any given moment would help. could the bell nozzles lap any of it up the sides like a reverse regenerative cooler. Or literally with the regenerative cooling system? If it goes back in the hole like a reverse film cooling it could be broken back down and shot out again hypothetically. Or just shot out as water and steam as an additive if it gains enough efficiency or acts as an oxidizer. The objective is oxidizer at all costs. Not sure how much could be collected at that point. A little bit of hydrogen wouldn\u0027t hurt either. Else cargo tonnage has to be reduced.

It would save huge amounts of tank space. If not I have to largely increase the tank size potentially. Though probably not too much because of the volume increase with a sphere. I was also hoping to over pressurize the hydrogen. Assuming it can go past the 4.432 I think I saw for the mass/ft3 I saw for the shuttle.

If it has a lining to store the hydrogen that shrinks and then fills the outside with liquid air(or the reverse), if the liquid air is the same as lox, then that is 71.2 density per ft3 filling in afterwards. That maxes at under 3000tons(just under 2250 tons if lair is 54.3123/ft3.). So, there is lots of room. The hydrogen can only get around 183 tons of liquid and 218 tons of slush.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-02-26T07:13:36Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2022 07:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
