Many of the criticized design elements of the shuttle either have been or should have been non-adherent parts of orbiters core and could have been altered as to make it more cost efficient. The shuttle was a thing, by the time SLS becomes a thing (after 10 years of public sector waffling) its function relative to its price will be obsolete. Building the SLS will be like building a mainframe industrial server when any off the shelf computer can do the same for a fraction of the price.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes F9/FH does have its weak spots going to GTO, but that weak spot is a function of the cheapest part of the rocket (in the expendable version) and thats\u00A0 the second stage. If SpaceX was not working on the BFR they could use the current technology to replace the second stage with a metholox version and get 50 more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E and they would be up there with SLS to GTO. So nothing about SLS\u0027s function that is revolutionary.
