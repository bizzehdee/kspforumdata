Specifically, how it is treated in relation to old-time, low-tech ideas, solutions or equipment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany blockbusters feature some huge government or private agency, well-funded and full of incredibly smart people with long experience in the field, usually in a large and opulent headquarter (which for some reason is furnished more like a car mechanics shop than a lab - with chemistry/biology/engineering experiments being performed on small desks lining the edges of large halls, for instance).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen The Disaster happens. All the scientists and engineers are dumbfounded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut here comes The Protagonist, a down-to-earth man without academic credentials, whose work usually centers around physical labour (mining, farming, oil drilling, etc.). He walks up to the headquarter\u0027s big wall monitor, squints, and finds the solution immediately. All of the scientists are dumbstruck, they never thought of that \u003Cem\u003Eobvious\u003C/em\u003E solution. They either argue against the idea (only to be proven wrong shortly after, possibly via a funny incident, like: \u0022We always check all our numbers twice, we\u0027re never wrong\u0022 - cue something scientific exploding or falling apart in the background), enthusiastically agree and hail the protagonist as a genius, or just stand there looking stupid. Some scientists might even try to state some mathematical formula, or technobabble, only to be shut up with a quip from The Protagonist, after which they meekly slump back into a corner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Solution invariably involves bringing out The Museum Piece. The advanced and modern technology failed, now we must go back to the Good Old Method! Roll out the WWII aircraft, or the \u0022dumb\u0022 rocket, or a reliable firearm. In extreme cases, swords or bows and arrows. Rule of thumb: If any aspect of it is computer-controlled, or it was designed using computers, it\u0027s too modern, unreliable or flawed to work. The Museum Piece will somehow overcome some contrived obstacle with triviality, such that the antagonists can\u0027t detect/hack/shoot it, or it remains functional after The Disaster has blacked out all recent technology.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen The Protagonist turns out to be the best man for the mission and hand, rather than relevant pilots/soldiers/astronauts. The Protagonist tends to have some experience in the field himself, and even though he retired years ago, he can still do the job better than any people who have currently been working with it for years. This might extend to The Protagonist\u0027s friends (or crew), they are always the ideal people to bring along. As he/they is about to embark on the mission, some of the experts try to give last-second advice: \u0022Remember to _____\u0022.

Science never marches on, it strays away. Engineering even more so, any piece of equipment designed after 1970 can barely hold together against the force of gravity, and will break apart when you look at it funny. Experts with fancy degrees, or professionals with decades of experience, are morons, the common sense and intuition of your everyday rural worker is superior in every possible setting, situation or instance. In several cases, science or technology is even the cause of the problems, or stated/implied to be decadent or evil. Best-case scenario, the new science/technology is created by well-meaning \u0022scientists\u0022 (there is only one science profession in movies), and initially appears superior, but comes with a horrible side effect or gains sentience and turns evil.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah, scientific inaccuracy isn\u0027t my biggest peeve in movies.

Oh, there were people who thought this particular scientific advance or that was wicked, and who objected to anesthetics, for instance, or to the theory of evolution, or, for that matter, to the Industrial Revolution\u2014but science in the abstract remained good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow different it is today! There is a strong and growing element among the population which not only finds scientists suspect, but is finding evil in science in the abstract.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is the whole concept of science which (to many) seems to have made the world a horror. The advance of medicine has given us a dangerous population growth; the advance of technology has given us a growing pollution danger; a group of ivory-tower, head-in-the-clouds physicists have given us the nuclear bomb; and so on and so on and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut at exactly which point in time did the disillusionment with the \u0022goodness\u0022 of science come? When did it start?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould it have come at the time when some scientist or scientists demonstrated the evil in science beyond any doubt; showed mankind a vision of evil so intense that not only the scientist himself but all of science was darkened past the point where it could be washed clean again?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen was the sin of the scientist committed, then, and who was the scientist?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe easy answer is the nuclear bomb. It was to that which Oppenheimer referred in his remark on sin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I say no. The nuclear bomb is a terrible thing that has contributed immeasurably to the insecurity of mankind and to his growing distrust of science, but the nuclear bomb is by no means pure evil.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo develop the nuclear bomb, physicists had to extend, vastly, their knowledge of nuclear physics generally. That has led to cheap radioisotopes that have contributed to research in science and industry in a hundred fruitful directions; to nuclear power stations that may be of tremendous use to mankind, and so on. Even the bombs themselves can be used for useful and constructive purposes (as motive power for spaceships, for one thing). And missiles, which might have hydrogen bombs attached, might have spaceships attached instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBesides, even if you argue that the development of the nuclear bomb was sin, I still reply that it wasn\u0027t the first sin. The mistrust of science itself antedates the nuclear bomb. That bomb intensified the mistrust but did not originate it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI find a certain significance in the fact that the play R.U.R. by Karel Capek was first produced in 1921.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt brought the Frankenstein motif up to date. The original Frankenstein, published a century earlier, in 1818, was the last thrust of theological, rather than scientific, sin. In its Faustian plot, a scientist probed forbidden knowledge and offended God rather than man. The monster who in the end killed Frankenstein could easily be understood as the instrument of God\u0027s vengeance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn R.U.R., however, the theological has vanished. Robots are created out of purely scientific motivation with no aura of \u0022forbiddenness.\u0022 They are tools intended to advance man\u0027s good the way the railroad and telegraph did; but they got out of hand and in the end the human race was destroyed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScience could get out of hand!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe play was an international success (and gave the word \u0022robot\u0022 to the world and to science fiction) so its thesis of science out of hand must have touched a responsive chord in mankind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy should men be so ready, in 1921, to think that science could get out of hand and do total evil to the human race, when only a few years before, science was still the \u0022Mr. Clean\u0022 who would produce a Utopia if allowed to work?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat happened shortly before 1921? World War I happened shortly before 1921.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWorld War II was a greater and deadlier war than World War I; but World War I was incomparably more stupid in its details.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMen have made colossal misjudgments in a moment of error and may make more to come. Some day, someone will push the wrong button, perhaps, in a moment of panic or lack of understanding, and destroy the world; but never has constant, steady stupidity held sway for weeks, months and years as among the military leaders of World War I. For persistent stupidity, they will never be approached.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA million men and more died at Verdun. Sixty thousand British soldiers died in a single day on the Somme while generals thought they could build a bridge of mangled flesh across the trenches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEverything about the carnage was horrible, but was there anything which managed to make itself felt above that sickening spectacle of mutual suicide? Was it the new explosives used in unprecedented quantities; the machine guns, the tanks? They were only minor developments of old devices. Was it the airplane, first used in battle, in this war? Not at all! The airplane was actually admired, for it was in itself beautiful, and it clearly had enormous peacetime potential.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, no! If you want the supreme horror of the war, here it is:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn April 22, 1915, at Ypres, two greenish-yellow clouds of gas rolled toward the Allied line at a point held by Canadian divisions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was poison gas; chlorine. When the clouds covered the Allied line, that line caved in. The soldiers fled; they had to; and a five-mile opening appeared.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo gap like that had been seen anywhere before on the Western Front, but the Germans muffed their opportunity. For one thing, they hadn\u0027t really believed it would work (even though they had earlier experimented with gas in a smaller way against the Russians), and were caught flat-footed. For another, they hesitated to advance until the cloud had quite dissipated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Canadians were able to rally, and after the clouds drifted away, their line re-formed. By the time of the next gas attack, all were prepared and the gas mask was in use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat was the horror of World War I, for before the war was over poison gases far more horrible than the relatively innocuous chlorine were put into use by both sides.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo grisly was the threat of poison gas, so insidious its onset, so helpless an unprepared group of victims and, what\u0027s more, so devastatingly atrocious did it seem to make war upon breathing\u2014that common, constant need of all men \u2014that after World War I gas warfare was outlawed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn all of World War II, poison gas was not used no matter what the provocation, and in wars since, even the use of tear gas arouses violent opposition. Military men argue endlessly that poison gas is really humane; that it frequently incapacitates without killing or permanent harm; that it does not maim horribly the way shells and bullets do. People nevertheless will not brook interference with breathing. Shells and bullets might miss; one might hide from them. But how escape or avoid the creeping approach of gas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd what, after all, is the other side of poison gas? It has only one use; to harm, incapacitate and kill. It has no other use. When World War I was over and the Allies found themselves left with many tons of poison gas, to what peaceful use could those tons be converted? To none. The poison gas had to be buried at sea or disposed of clumsily in some other fashion. Was even theoretical knowledge gained? No!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPoison gas warfare was developed knowingly by a scientist with only destruction in mind. The only excuse for it was patriotism, and is that enough of an excuse?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a story that during the Crimean War of 1853-56, the British government asked Michael Faraday, the greatest living scientist of the day, two questions: 1) Was it possible to develop poison gas in quantities sufficient to use on the battlefield? And 2) would Faraday head a project to accomplish the task?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFaraday said \u0022Yes\u0022 to the first and an emphatic \u0022No\u0022 to the second. He did not consider patriotism excuse enough. During World War I, Ernest Rutherford of Great Britain refused to involve himself in war work, maintaining that his research was more important.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the name of German patriotism, however, poison gas warfare was introduced in World War I, and it was the product of science. No one could miss that. Poison gas was invented by the clever chemists of the German Empire. And the gas poisoned not only thousands of men, but the very name of science. For the first time, millions became aware that science could be perverted to monstrous evil, and science has never been the same again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPoison gas was the sin of the scientist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd can we name the sinner?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, we can. He was Fritz Haber, an earnest German patriot of the most narrow type, who considered nothing bad if it brought good (according to his lights) to the Fatherland. (Alas, this way of thinking is held by too many people of all nations and is not confined to Germany.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaber had developed the \u0022Haber process\u0022 which produced ammonia out of the nitrogen of the air. The ammonia could be used to manufacture explosives. Without that process, Germany would have run out of ammunition by 1916, thanks to the British blockade. With that process, she ran out of food, men and morale, but never out of ammunition. This, however, will scarcely qualify as a scientific sin, since the Haber process can be used to prepare useful explosives and fertilizers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuring the war, however, Haber labored unceasingly to develop methods of producing poison gas in quantity and supervised that first chlorine attack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis reward for his unspotted devotion to his nation was a most ironic one. In 1933, Hitler came to power and, as it happened, Haber was Jewish. He had to leave the country and died in sad exile within the year.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat he got out of Germany safely was in part due to the labors of Rutherford, who moved mountains to rescue as many German scientists as he could from the heavy hand of the pedant psychopaths. Rutherford personally greeted those who reached England, shaking hands with them in the fraternal comradeship of science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe would not, however, shake hands with Haber. That would, in his view, have been going too far, for Haber, by his work on poison gas, had put himself beyond Rutherford\u0027s pale.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can only hope that Rutherford was not reacting out of offended national patriotism, but out of the horror of a scientist who recognized scientific sin when he saw it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven today, we can still recognize the difference. The men who developed the nuclear bombs and missile technology are not in disgrace. Some of them have suffered agonies of conscience but they know, and we all know, that their work can be turned to great good, if only all of us display wisdom enough.

For instance, just ask a kid who\u0027s bored with maths about what he thinks of maths in general: \u0022It\u0027s stupid and I\u0027ll never use it for anything.\u0022 Objectively, that\u0027s pretty wrong, everybody could use at least some maths at some point, but it\u0027s a very comforting lie. \u0022Don\u0027t worry, not knowing maths doesn\u0027t make you inferior. Actually, you\u0027re better than them for not wasting your time.\u0022 You could say the same about history, social studies, cooking or most other academic studies, or even stuff like reading user manuals. Gaining knowledge and expertise is hard, often frustrating, and it\u0027s easy to give up. At those moments, it\u0027s comforting to be told that staying invested is a waste of time, that your intuition is the right answer anyway, and that people who know this better than you actually don\u0027t know anything at all. Academic degrees are just words on paper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd so Hollywood comes along with the idea that \u0022Expert\u0022 = clueless idiot who doesn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Eunderstand\u003C/em\u003E anything. That knowledge itself is useless, that the pursuit of knowledge is dangerous, and that the only true virtue in face of danger is knowing how to shoot danger in the face. That the gut feeling of the uneducated is worth more than years of expertise. That a down-to-earth manual labourer can step into any role, and do it better than the guys who do it for a living, and the people who tells him otherwise are just elitists. See for instance \u003Cem\u003EArmageddon\u003C/em\u003E, where the chosen solution is to teach oil drillers how to be astronauts, rather than vice versa. Because anybody can learn how to operate spacecraft and work in zero G in a few days, but drilling is an \u003Cem\u003Eart, \u003C/em\u003Ewhich requires a specific mindset, nay, a \u003Cem\u003Elifestyle\u003C/em\u003E, to fully understand - or even functionally grasp. And where the mission planners of NASA apparently miss the fact that their chosen landing site is a kilometre-thick iron slab, which Bruce Willis\u0027 character can tell at a glance. And where the enormously complex space shuttle, with \u0022a million moving parts\u0022, can be perfectly fixed by giving it a good whack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t remember many movies in recent years where the solution to a problem hasn\u0027t been \u0022going primitive\u0022, digging up the Ancient Artifact (which of course is a lot more powerful, complex and fantastic than anything that can be created today) or otherwise returning to the traditions of old; rather than analyzing the problem, doing the calculations, and inventing something new. \u003Cem\u003EThe Martian\u003C/em\u003E stands as a rare example, and even there much of Mark Watney\u0027s likeability comes from his tendency to tell the NASA experts to (expletive) themselves, and win the day with his intuition rather than trusting their expertise. In most situations, the new invention turns evil, showing that science is dangerous and not to be trusted (\u003Cem\u003EAngels and Demons, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Jurassic Park\u003C/em\u003E and all sequels, etc.). The problem isn\u0027t that the scientists have terrible security procedures, it\u0027s that science itself is inevitably evil.
