For the sake of discussion, let\u0027s go with 100 kilometers (about a third of the way into outer space from earth).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith that range, missiles and fighter craft could win the day, since inertia does wonders for newtonian combat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAkin to modern naval combat, space battleships would not exist. It is quite within human technical ability to make a missile accelerate to orbital velocity within 100 kilometers\u00A0of vacuum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt best there\u00A0would be the space equvalent of air carriers and missile/flack gunships.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you think?

This doesn\u0027t have to mean more ships, but might mean one really big ship, which may be more economical. Efficiency is key.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Armor works very well, but it has to be designed right. Sloping armor is crucial. Spaced armor is amazing against kinetics, and if the outer layer is heat-resistant, it works against energy weapons as well.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. Ranges are \u003Cstrong\u003Eshort\u003C/strong\u003E. The fiercest combat takes place within 100km. Beyond that, you\u0027re just slinging missiles at each other. Combat is really resolved at 10km or less, unless it is very uneven. Missiles can be fired from across the system. 1000km engagement range is for missiles, certain kinds of lasers, and ultra-high speed \u0022sandblaster\u0022 railguns, firing rounds as light as one gram, but firing them incredibly fast. Besides missiles, all those are \u003Cstrong\u003Every\u003C/strong\u003E high tech solutions.\u003Cbr\u003E\n4. Combat is \u003Cstrong\u003Eone-dimensional\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0 Ships close in, then merge. It\u0027s a head-on joust, even dodging is limited.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n5. Radiators are vulnerable, but not all that much. Edge-on, they\u0027re incredibly hard to hit.\u003Cbr\u003E\n6. Missile dreadnoughts rule the day. Large, armored, with many guns and a missile battery. They are very aerodynamic-looking, because the whole nose\u00A0has to be\u00A0highly sloped. Larger ships are more mass-efficient thanks to square-cube law.\u003Cbr\u003E\n7. It often comes down to guns. What makes a good CIWS (low spread, high speed, high rate of fire) also makes a good anti-ship cannon. Cannons firing heavy shells are great at killing the target outright, but are hard to make and will likely get damaged before they can be used, because heavy rounds\u00A0will fly slowly, and this will decrease their effective range. Faster-flying rounds let you fire at the target for longer, delivering more total energy, which is what decides engagements.\u003Cbr\u003E\n8. Missiles are great, but it\u0027s hard to carry a lot of them, and they are easy to shot down. Screening your dreadnought\u0027s approach with missiles is a good tactic. If the enemies\u00A0are\u00A0shooting at the missiles, they aren\u0027t shooting at you. If some of them make it to the end, so much better.\u003Cbr\u003E\n9. Drones (fighters, basically) are missiles with a gun. They are heavier than missiles, so you can carry less, but with a strong cannon firing heavy rounds (speed is not that important, the drone provides that), they can do a lot of damage. Their biggest advantage is strategic - you can recover and reuse\u00A0most of the drone after it made a pass. Drones can be armored, but they are so small that it is not very efficient.\u003Cbr\u003E\n10. Lasers are good at shooting down missiles and drones. At very close range, they can be a workable backup weapon. They can also burn out turrets, though they have trouble with radiators.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n11. You are limited by energy you can put into your weapons, which is the same as energy generated aboard your ship times your weapon efficiency. Ships and fleets are best compared by total power output, not by numbers, tonnage or size.\u003Cbr\u003E\n12. Where you fight affects how you fight. In a low planetary orbit, speeds will be very high, and combat will be extremely fast. If relative speeds are low, such as in high orbits or around smaller bodies, then the battle will take a lot longer. In high speed\u00A0combat, it is useful to mount guns that trade speed for rate of fire. In low speed combat, you will close range much slower, so high speed weapons are better, because they will be able to fire at the enemy for much longer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yes, it is spectacular. It starts out at 50km, but the reactors run so hot that the ships are visible because of their\u00A0glowing yellow\u00A0radiators. They are blazing glowing red or yellow kinetic rounds (you would usually put so much energy through a round that it will heat to incandescence), which looks surprisingly like \u0022lasers\u0022 from Star Wars. They try to reduce their opponent\u0027s armor and firepower until they pass, at which point they can no longer keep their nose pointed at each other, and then the one with more weapons left wins. Missiles and drones are used in swarms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGamma ray lasers, particle beams and other exotic technologies aren\u0027t really feasible, BTW. They typically lack the range to compete with kinetics and regular lasers. Casaba Howitzer is just an enhanced nuke, it doesn\u0027t have the range to be a primary weapon. It would be mounted on missiles to allow them to strike from a slightly higher distance.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-10-05T14:15:18Z\u0022 title=\u002210/05/2019 02:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 5, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Guest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-05T15:07:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgreed with p.4.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spacescifi","CreatedById":197504,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-05T15:44:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223682128\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022188681\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221570284065\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002217022\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dragon01\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Dragon01 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWrong game.

It can be improved by making a larger aperture, but in practice, in order for the laser to be any good at 1000km you end up with gigantic lenses, and it\u0027s still not very effective (though at half that distance, it does burn some impressive holes).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKinetics are railguns, for most part. Coilguns are slow-ish, short ranged, but hard hitting\u00A0weapons.\u00A0Space combat starts at 50km, because forces acting on weapons are \u003Cstrong\u003Ehuge\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0One minute of arc at 1000km equals 100 meters. Now, consider how hard it is to achieve sub-mil\u00A0accuracy in a gun. Then, consider what happens if you try to do the same with a gun that has \u003Cem\u003Emega\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ewatts \u003C/em\u003Eof power going through it, trying to rip it apart. If you spray a 100m radius circle with slugs, it won\u0027t do you any good, because few of your shots will be hitting. Not only that, a shot fired at 20km/s (pretty typical for these weapons), it will take 500 seconds to fly 1000km. So, you\u0027re shooting at a circle several times the area of your target,\u00A0centered around the area your target was in about 9\u00A0minutes ago. Time to target is actually more important for increasing range than accuracy, provided you have a high rate of fire.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpace combat goes, depending on power levels involved, from 200-300km to the merge, at which point ships may pass within a kilometer of each other, depending on tactical decisions. 50km is, roughly, the distance at which they \u003Cem\u003Eactually \u003C/em\u003Estart hitting each other with anything besides lasers. It may be more, it may be less, depending on weapons involved, but kills are rare outside 50km. I have designed a railgun which sort of works at 1000km. It consumes 1GW, is over 30 meters long, fires rounds that weigh a \u003Cem\u003Eone gram\u003C/em\u003E, and I\u0027m not sure that models COADE uses work well for such extreme devices. It is a great weapon, but actually building something like that would be incredibly hard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you don\u0027t believe, buy COADE and find out yourself. It\u0027s pretty cheap on a sale.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was being generous with autoshifting at 1000 or even 100 kilometers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBabylon 5 has ships autoshifting out of hyperspace at 3 kilometers or closer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt that range, missiles can cross it in mere seconds. Which means big bulky ships would get slammed with lots of nukes/missiles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpacestations would likely get wrecked. The only way maneuvering will save a ship here is via counter fire and also missiles targeting other craft while it flies away with a big fuel tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-10-05T19:16:08Z\u0022 title=\u002210/05/2019 07:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 5, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
