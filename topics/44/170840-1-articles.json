Atmosphere density on Mars is like 0.6/101 what it is on earth g-forces are about a 3rd.

Its a lower speed if you choose a higher elevation, higher speed if you choose a lower elevation. If you set the landing velocity maximum to 10 m/s then you would need a parachute roughly 500 m in radius to slow you down (you wont be able to do this), at minumum (without parachute) you would have to burn 500 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E of fuel. Another method is to aerodynamically load surfaces for example a wing, this then allows the craft to fight gravity at the same time conserving lift and providing a horizontal direction of motion which to create drag in, BFR. A particle traveling to its perigee achieves a flat trajectory at PE and there after rises, it momentum is horizontal, and the drag it creates is in the horizontal direction, if lift or thrust is provided in the verticle direction the craft can stay alot long enough to dissipate much of its speed, while eventually letting g-v\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E/r to craft intercept the ground. With a properly designed entry and lift surface this can get you optimistically down to 200 m/s after which you will need \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to land.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDropping vertically from space is a bad idea, because integral of drag forces with respect to distance is dominated by proximity to the ground, the craft will never reach terminal velocity before engines would need to fire to burn off speed and that negates most of the drag loses from energy.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDownload \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E (real solar systems).

Be aware that Mars have no ocean, elevation is measured from the lowest point on Mars, which would be the equivilent of measure altitude on the Earth from the bottom of the Mariannas trench. As a consequence your target altitudes are going to be higher than you think. I made a WWI styles triplane that was very effective of dissipating drag forces continuously (sort of), but KSP is not good at modeling mach forces at high altitude. And basically once you get close to M=1 \u0026lt;350 m/s you need to abandon the wing and retrofire the rockets.

The equations that you want to use are the definition of a (semi-major axis) and the vis-visa equation. To avoid confusing radius (e.g. a circle) with radial distance, imagine that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E as a vector point from the planets center of mass to the point of lowest orbit, this is called a position vector, the length is the magnitude of that vector, so we are not referring to a radius of r but the magnitude of the position vector, the orbital maneuvers change the position of the vectors.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStep\u003Cbr\u003E\none: \u00A0 \u00A0 convert altitudes to radial distances. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E = 3,806,000 meters, Apo = 47,972,000\u003Cbr\u003E\ntwo:\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003Cem\u003Ea\u003C/em\u003E =\u00A0 Average the two . . . . 25,889,000\u003Cbr\u003E\nthree:\u00A0\u00A0 calculate the velocity at apoapsis.

This is not what they did, what they did was more compllicated, they started at a higher altitude to bleed off peak velocity and let the orbit decay, what I will do is just simplify. The r-vector is 3,430,000, this then needs a velocity of 3250 at the Apogee. But this is not what we want we want the difference of the velocity at the perigee.

You will have some sort of ablative shield and your perigee will be much lower, if you pass as MRO passed you will fly through the martian atmosphere and back into heliocentric orbit. Because your craft is 10t (very close to the limit of what Earth can launch to mars currently) you will not likely have the fuel on board to slow down 5,500 m/s of velocity to land (which would triple the size of your craft). In this case you need to use the Martian atmosphere to bleed off alot of speed and do it rather quickly. If you have unlimited resources from Earth place a refueling depot in orbit around Mars. In this case you could use the procedure above to place your craft in a parking orbit, refuel, and then proceed to land on Mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is the problem, you need about 4400 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to land. So the choice fuel outside of Earth are hypoglolics, they have ISPs of around 250 (2500 m/s exhaust velocity). Why am i mentioning this, many rockets you see launched from Earth are using cryogenic or semi-cryogenic engines (sometimes with sloppy boosters of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E).

In fact, your LEO\u0026gt;Mars injection was probably the result of a Hydrolox or Metholox fuel system.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe rocket equation specifies \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E = \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E*g*ln(Starting mass/Final Mass). We can calcuate a starting mass for a final mass of 10t. The starting mass of rocket in LMO required to retrograde burn down to the planet is 58t. If we assume that 1/10th of that is engines and fuel tanks, that leaves your lander with 42% of its original mass. To correct we need to increase starting mass to 138t. Right now we cannot even place 138t of mass in LEO, let alone send to Mars. So lets imagine we can send 20t of ship to LMO at a time, each ship having 5t of fuel. That would take 20 deliveries. A very slow ION drive type tug could \u0027handwaving away the power-production issue\u0027 deliver 20t to orbit, but that tug would take 20 years to deliver the fuel required, you would need 5 @ 200t tugs to reduce this to a 2 years, so even that is a non-starter. You could have a solar paneled cryogenic refueling station, metholox (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E 375), you probably could get away with a 35t lander at the LMO station resulting in a 12t lander on Mars (less if it uses drop tanks). In the most speculative mid-far future range is hydrolox refueling station. Potentially \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E of 475. This is a spacecraft at LMO of 29t (again you can lower with drop tanks).\u00A0 Left without choices you end up mulling over the aerodynamics of re-entry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe aerodynamics of re-entry is about as difficult as the rocket science required to get into orbit. This is complex math. The density, temperature and composition of the gas changes with altitude. PV=nRt, but there are particle behaviors, supersonic, transsonic and subsonic dynamics that need to be dealt with. But the ideal situation is that you aim for a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E in which your KE at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E (drag losses included) is slightly higher than \u00B5/2r which gives a slight vertical velocity allowing you increase breaking time. This is very difficult to nail down. At this point velocity erodes quickly and then radial velocity starts to decrease rapidly in the direction of -3.8 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E. Believe it or not, the higher the initial reentry velocity the easier this is. The reason is that circular orbits degrade by spiraling through the atmosphere, and by definition increase the loss of altitude as a function of time. So really fast entries are a balance between escape velocities, capture braking (MRO-like) and reentry braking procedure and what is idea (provided a great shield) is something between reentry breaking (mostly) and capture braking (a little). At the point that velocity is below Mach 5.0 the shields need to come off and the craft needs to start burning to land. Anything that the craft can provide to keep its radial/verticle velocity closer to zero means more time spent dragging down the speed. But at some point wings will not provide significant lift because of the thinness of the martian atmosphere, at that point they only add weight and should be discarded.\u00A0 This is the point to burn off horizontal and some vertical velocity. If you are doing this right at the end of your re-entry procedure you will have about 400 m/s of residual velocity. This means you have saved 4400-500 = 3900 m/s of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E . . . . . .in the best case scenario you save 17t, in the worst case 100t. So prepare yourself to do some hairy math.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you really want to be a rocket guru, figure out a way to get your ship down to the surface and back to a refueling station (or Earths atmosphere) without using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E or the like. I think if you can do that and prove it can be done you will have alot of job offers coming in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-02-13T20:07:25Z\u0022 title=\u002202/13/2018 08:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 13, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jirokoh","CreatedById":182820,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-13T13:39:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow thanks a lot for the long reply!\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nJust a few things to mention: I think I didn\u0027t express myself correctly, I should have said it more accurately.

If you watch the F9 launch videos and the humidity of the atmosphere is just right you can see this layer separate from the nose cone and the cone broadens. At the same moment you may see flame from the rocket going the wrong direction, sooting up the side of the rocket. This is cause by supersonic boundary layer separation, In side the boundary the vehicle is basically clinging onto the mass and the flow is non-laminar out some distance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022330px-Bowshock_example_-_blunt_body.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022267\u0022 src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Bowshock_example_-_blunt_body.jpg/330px-Bowshock_example_-_blunt_body.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022330\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBow shock off of\u00A0 a blunt body\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you don\u0027t see is that on the nose cone itself air mass is also accumulating. Air molecules travel at the speed of sound, this is basically the absolute value mean moment of air motion at a given temperature. This means that at any given temperature an air molecule can only accelerate so rapidly. I an attempt to move around the rockets nose cone the gas trys to accelerate but at the speed of sound relative to other local air molecules it cannot. At which point its flow becomes inelastic and it basically piles up as a dense layer on the nose cone. The tip of that layer builds verticle mass on the nose cone with speed. If you build a triangle pointing vertically with on point up the axis, another point touching the side of the rocket at the base of the curvature and the third point touching the curvature, then the sin of angle x hypotenuse(velocity * time) = Mach * time or if speed in is Mach its Sin \u0398 = 1/S\u003Csub\u003EMach\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0 . . . . . .\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressible_flow#Mach_number,_wave_motion,_and_sonic_speed\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u0398 = ArcSin 1/S\u003C/a\u003E roughly. And everything below the cone created by the hypotenuse gets compacted into the nose cones mass (under the boundary layer), as the layer builds upward molecules accelerate more fluidly outside the layer. If the structure is not designed to take the force (such as the engine on an airliner) the structure will undergo cavitation.\u00A0 In the Sears Haack shape the object has a shape that minimizes the distance of the triangles vertex (verticle) from the skin of the rocket, this causes the flow to become more laminar around the rocket. I should note that there are also oblique shockwaves, but at the altitude on Mars which you will be decelerating through you should not have to worry about these.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe can think of it like this, at a certain speed the air behaves like a gas around a structure, above that speed the air starts behaving more like a dense liquid; the degree that it behaves like a liquid is a function of speed and structural design. A liquid has more cohesion than air (you see rain drops stick to the window of a cockpit window) and that liquid has more affection for the object than the air outside of the boundary layer. But as its a liquid if the layer is high enough it can slide off.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, if the object is high enough the \u0027stuck\u0027 gases can slide off before the next gas molecule hits. . . .this is space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what it means is that as you travel in from space particles are hitting the object and immediately moving out of the way, the layer, if any is very thin. When two molecules stike each other they knock eletrons out of orbitals and create a momentary plasma that glows, these \u0027chew\u0027 at the surface. So that the surface needs a material that sloughs off with these impacts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese molecules can provide lift but that lift is not aerodynamic, there is no Bernoulli\u0027s force involved, its like billiard balls striking and reflecting.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this situation if the structural plane is facing the gas flow, it will create maximum drag, but no lift (Imagine the Apollo capsule traveling horizontally, heat shield facing the air flow, as if it is orbiting but inside earths troposphere). If you rotate the plane to 45\u0027\u00A0 (Gasflow ---\u0026gt;\u00A0 \\ object) there will be as much lift as drag. The spacecraft will fall less rapidly compared to the verticle plane. If the plane it facing but 30\u0027 then it has less that half the drag but most of the force is in lift, so this falls the least slowly. But in horizontal flow through the subMach airspeed you don\u0027t want to have the plane of the wing much above 15\u0027 because of turbulent flow. Between these\u00A0 (subMach and Orbital speeds at space altitudes) two circumstances the plane can trap gas momentarily and cause the gas (or plasma) to do funny things. For example the plane facing the flow of gas causes the gas to reflect backwards increasing the risk that another gas strikes it, sending it back. That flat plane is expected to build a hot and thicker of layer of gas on its surface (a fire ball). If one grooves the surface like the skirt of a womans dress, the fireballs will flow through the channels. We can constuct the surface (imagine a collection of funnels and tubes)\u00A0 to force the fire ball downward toward the ground and as the fire traveled down the spacecraft would experience an upward force. This behavior would be expected to continue while the spacecraft was above Mach 0.85. Of course you would not want to have funnels and tubes as the increase and mass and the shock forces on the craft would give your engineers nightmares.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022i1ZQmyJ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/i1ZQmyJ.png\u0022 width=\u0022472\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis image shows that both inelastic and elastic collisions are contributing to the forces. The inelastic collisions create the red glow that is directed by the winglets down the space craft, channelling some of the flow to increase lift. As the static pressure of the atmosphere increases individual particle collisions contribute less and flow dynamics contribute more. This results in the appearance of shock boundaries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-02-14T17:02:08Z\u0022 title=\u002202/14/2018 05:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 14, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-14T19:29:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo not forget about the inflatable ballutes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed4557869950\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/121162-130-inline-ballutes-ib-v128-30052017/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:212px;max-width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KG3","CreatedById":182951,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-14T19:58:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223294895\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022170840\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221518625412\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107380\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, PB666 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStarting at about Mach 0.85 this starts to change around the less aerodynamic parts, there is a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_layer\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eboundary layer\u003C/a\u003E that develops and in particular when and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_system#Boundary\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eobject does not conform\u003C/a\u003E to the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sears%E2%80%93Haack_body\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESears-Haack\u003C/a\u003E shape.
