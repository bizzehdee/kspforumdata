Some have real-life examples (like Chthonian Planets) while others are just science fiction for now (Coreless Planets). I also have a lot of hypothetical planet types. Some of these types have examples in our own solar system, which goes to show how exotic our planetary neighborhood really is. This list will be constantly updated, and other types for other forum users are welcome!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003EOCEANIAS:\u00A0\u003C/b\u003EThese are the so-called \u0022Water worlds\u0022 that have been appearing in science fiction for years. However, not all oceanias fit into one category. Water planets fall into 3 groups: Water Dwarfs, Classical Oceanias, and Water Giants. All 3 groups are defined by radius, mass, and proportion of water.\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWATER DWARFS:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003ETiny ocean worlds are known as Water Dwarfs. These wet midgets range from 0.05-0.5 Earth Radii and 0.01-0.4 Earth Masses, and are more commonly moons than planets. They form from small ice worlds, with radii at most 0.5 ER, migrating inwards either alone or around a migrating gas giant. Water Dwarfs could also be around gas giants farther away from the habitable zone of their stars. They are either heated by tidal forces, greenhouse gases, or both. Unlike moons like Europa and Enceladus, Water Dwarfs do not have ice crusts if they\u0027re outside the habitable zone. Those would still be classified as ice worlds. There are no known examples of Water Dwarfs yet, but some gas giants like \u003Cstrong\u003EKepler-458b\u003C/strong\u003E may have some as moons. If Laythe from KSP did not have any islands, then it would be a Water Dwarfs.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ECLASSICAL OCEANIAS:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EThese are ocean worlds that are more or less similar in size and mass to Earth and other sci-fi ocean planets, like Kamino. Classical Oceanias cannot be more than 50% smaller or larger than Earth. Otherwise, they are either Water Dwarfs or Giants. They range from 0.5-1.5 Earth Radii and 0.4-1.25 Earth Masses. However, COs cannot have a density greater than 2.5 grams/cubic cm or gravity greater than 0.85 gees. That would make them Mini Earths or regular terrestrial planets. COs form in the same ways as Water Dwarfs, and have no known examples. But these objects could form around gas giants like HD 125612 b.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWATER GIANTS:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EThe final type of ocean planet is much more different than the other two classes, yet seems to be much more common. Water Giants are similar in size and mass to gas dwarfs and ice giants, but at least 70% of their mass is liquid water. The remaining mass is a rocky outer core, an iron inner core, and a relatively thin atmosphere. Only 1-3% of a Water Giant\u0027s mass is its atmosphere. That\u0027s really thin compared to those of Neptune and Jupiter. However, certain specifications need to be put into place for a plane to be called a Water Giant. They range from 3-5 Earth Radii and 6-20 Earth Masses, but some radius-mass ratios within these ranges can turn Water Giants into Ice Giants. Take Gliese 436 b for example. It has 4.3 times the radius of Earth, putting it right in the range. But the mass of 22 Earth Masses gives it a gravity 18% higher than that on our own planet. This compresses the water into ice and removes the planet from the Water Giant category. WGs form from ice giants or gas dwarfs with high levels of H2O inside them that migrate close to their parent stars. Hydrodynamic escape can reduce the planet\u0027s atmosphere to the mass of what other WGs have. They can also form from large ice worlds melting and/or sublimating. There are several examples, such as GJ 1214 b and Kepler-22b.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-19T19:30:05Z\u0022 title=\u002204/19/2016 07:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by ProtoJeb21\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EWater Giant category\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
