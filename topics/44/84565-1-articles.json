Not laser. I believe, sonic equivalent of laser has been demonstrated in solids, using phonons. Everything else is complicated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo have a laser, you must have a system that can emit or absorb a photon, and have it placed in an inverted population state.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis might work with gravity. A field of rotating masses might... gase? But I do not know how strong the effect will be. States involved are not metastable and much too macroscopic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther fundamental bosons are even trickier. Gluons are color-charged, and so are confined. If gluon laser could work, it would have to be in quark-gluom plasma environment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWeak bosons would make good candidates. Anything that decays via weak mode only is already metastable for that very reason. Inverted population is a given, since ground state is vacuum. The trouble is getting enough of such matter together to observe effect.
