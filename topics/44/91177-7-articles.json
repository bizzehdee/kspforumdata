Which means that the act of forcing them to dodge means nothing except that it will take them slightly longer to reach their target. I\u0027m assuming the ship in question of course has something like a nuclear reactor. Effectively fuel-less for 10\u002B years of operation. As a result, most of the text in my giant wall of it previously is meaningless. The tactics laid out there depend on the idea of forcing your enemy to waste enough fuel such that they are either unable or unwilling to complete their mission (completing it could mean the crew ends up in a solar orbit far away from help with not enough fuel to reach anywhere that they could even surrender at). The second aspect of the tactics still ends up being decently valid, as it is easier to heat up the ship with what amounts to a flashlight beam from a maser than it is to hit it with a railgun round, eventually the crew will succumb if not the hardware.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as what I was saying about coolant. I wasn\u0027t actually stating to dump coolant itself, I was stating to dump FUEL, utilizing it as a coolant. If your fuel source is anything cryogenic or volatile at elevated (but not extreme) temperatures, then as the ship heats up you are going to be boiling some off and will have to vent the excess to prevent the pressure in the fuel tank from reaching dangerous levels. Since you have to do this anyway, I was saying you might as well use it in some way that lets the escaping fuel take more heat with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe liquid droplet cooling system I have always somewhat enjoyed as a concept, but it has some issues, especially for a warship. Passed a certain phase in the combat, the warship is likely going to be relatively constantly changing vector and orientation. Unless you contain the droplets in some sort of physical tube (which I imagine would drastically reduce the effectiveness of the system, even if IR transparent) any time you turn or shift \u0027position\u0027 you\u0027d be losing the droplets. Of course the way to ensure you don\u0027t lose any is by turning the flow off, sucking up the rest, then continuing. Depending on how long this process takes, it could result in a net gain of thermal energy rather than a net loss. Remember, the other guy is presumably looking for any situation where you are \u0027standing still\u0027 to focus all of his lasers on you for maximum heating. Additionally, I would assume that you could only really utilize the droplet booms on the opposite side of your ship from the enemy. Either their beams will heat up the droplets instead of letting them cool (in which case collecting them gives you heat) or they simply reduce the effectiveness of the droplets (in which case, nevermind, go ahead and do them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarlier in your post you mention that the acceleration provided by the Q-Thruster in your math is about 0.33% of 1 G of accel. That is perfectly fine for dodging the slow stuff (railguns, missiles, etc) over combat distances of thousands of kilometers or larger (the larger the better of course). Terminal changes though (quick turns/translations to dodge incoming missiles and close railguns and eventual laser fire) it might behoove your ship to have something that can do quick bursts even at the expense of having an expendable fuel. But the Q-Thruster still provides you with the game changing fuel-less main engine. Remember, the idea of making the enemy waste his fuel is only really helpful if it means he won\u0027t end up getting anywhere he wants to go without it. If all you do is reduce his maneuverability, this was still helpful but his mission is still possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EzinX","CreatedById":118288,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-03T15:16:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nyrath\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nyrath\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESorry I\u0027m coming into the discussion late.\u003Cp\u003EThe various weapons seem have been discussed, with the glaring exception of the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/spacegunconvent.php#id--Nukes_In_Space--Nuclear_Shaped_Charges\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecasaba howitzer\u003C/a\u003E.
