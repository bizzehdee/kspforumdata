Modern manufacturing would use mostly CNC-machined parts or 3D-printing, which means that each part has to be redrawn on 3D CAD/CAM systems anyway. Since you\u0027d be making new digital plans with modern techniques, you\u0027ll want to optimize the design and reduce the number of parts by combining them together into more complex shapes instead of welding lots of individual parts together like they used to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe materials for CNC milling as opposed to casting are different, and so are the mechanical constraints on the parts. The alloys available today use different thermal and mechanical constraints.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this means that every part needs to be individually redesigned with modern techniques and materials. Which is exactly what they are doing with the F-1B.
