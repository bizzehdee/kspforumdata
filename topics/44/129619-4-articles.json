There are certainly high winds at altitudes we are talking about, but they have relatively low shear. This is evidenced by the cloud observation data. You wouldn\u0027t be able to hold the colony anchored in one place, but it will drift in relative calm. Furthermore, relatively minor steering will be necessary to keep it circulating around constant latitude. Which is all you really care about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWater vapor content in Venusian atmosphere is quite significant. More than enough to extract hydrogen for the support structures. And since, as I\u0027ve pointed out, Venusian atmosphere contains no oxygen, or anything else for hydrogen gas to react with violently, hydrogen will be as safe as helium, so long as habitat modules and buoyancy modules are well separated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith exception of flammability, airship have fantastic safety record on Earth. Additionally, we have a lot of experience with huge floating structures in sea, including their ability to withstand weather. It\u0027s not quite the same thing, but in terms of being able to resist stress due to variations in buoyancy, a lot of this knowledge would carry over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat would be a good first step, yes. But the only reason we\u0027d build one on Earth is to prepare for a mission to Venus, which I\u0027m trying to convince you lot is a good idea. By no means do I suggest we go in half-cocked and just go directly for a build on Venus with no testing or preparation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, Earth\u0027s weather would prevent us from building a true full-size implementation at low altitude, and we don\u0027t have enough air to support something so massive at high altitude. But we can certainly build and test individual modules, floating them above oceans or some other large, open areas. It might even be a good idea to run a few mock landings to make sure we can land people and cargo on it safely from orbit. I\u0027m picturing lifting body entry capsule landing on\u00A0short carrier-style deck with arresting cables.

A thermoelectric nuclear reactor would do the trick, or one using sterling engines or brayton turbines, which would be less reliable though.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor a sustainable habitat, you need a source of nitrogen, water and oxygen first and foremost. Since water can be split to release oxygen, we have that part covered, and plants can convert CO2 into Oxygen, and the Atmosphere, as well as the soil, contain Nitrogen and nitrogen-rich minerals.\u00A0Food will be mostly brought along by the colonists at first, until the greenhouses can provide all of their food.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNext we need some way of keeping the first generation of plants alive. We can use the subsurface water ice, combined with imported nutrients for that. I think aeroponics or hydroponics would be the best candidate at first, since soil is heavy, and you\u0027d have to import that from Earth at first.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/8c/0f/36/8c0f367e1ac0181ebd5fa1d265700272.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/8c/0f/36/8c0f367e1ac0181ebd5fa1d265700272.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen we need a source of spare parts. Producing large mechanical parts shouldn\u0027t be much of an issue, since metals like iron, aluminium, titanium, nickel and manganese are very common on Mars. We\u0027d have to develop a metalworks plant that can convert martian sand into useful metals. I don\u0027t know much about metallurgy though. Electronics would likely have to come from Earth for a while, as would smaller mechanical parts.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe initial habitats would need to be brought from Earth.

That\u0027s done primarily with aircraft even on Earth, so boots on ground is kind of a moot point here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpeaking of planes, yes, you can build a drone that will operate on Mars. The trouble is with making it practical for transportation. Low pressure means very high stall speeds. Which means there is absolutely zero way of landing or taking off from a runway. You need VTOL. Which you don\u0027t have air for, so you have to use rockets. Now, if you take a look at how much fuel is wasted on VTOL aircraft on Earth, and adjust for the fact that a rocket eats about 10x as much fuel for hover as something like Harrier jet engine, you should start seeing how it\u0027s not a good idea. You can definitely have a plane for emergencies. You should, in fact. Search and rescue, that sort of thing. But you can\u0027t use these\u00A0routinely for transportation. You\u0027ll never mine enough fuel to keep them running.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExpanding a cloud city is actually \u003Cem\u003Eeasier\u003C/em\u003E than doing the same work on Mars. Workers can work outside on Venus wearing a light hazmat suit. Construction can be done with polymer pipes. No heavy machinery needed. No cranes, either, as every block is literally designed to support itself and can be easily moved around.\u00A0All of the materials would be made from plant by-products. So you don\u0027t need mining, or mining equipment. Have we even discussed mining in near-vacuum? Because it\u0027s not easy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, we have a lot of experience of keeping a few people in a large tin can in space for a long time. We have some experience attaching modules together and doing minor repair work. We have nothing like the sort of experience we need to actually construct things from scratch in a space-like environment. And it\u0027s even worse on Mars. You don\u0027t have enough pressure to make oxygen mask a viable option, but you have enough pressure for dust storms. Fun!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGas giants aside, Mars\u0027 surface is about as inhospitable an environment as we have in the Solar Systems. We can build a colony that will survive there, but making it self-sufficient is outside of our reach right now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only indisputable point is that it will be much easier to ascend from Mars. Venus ascent would require equivalent rocket to Earth ascent. Maybe even a tiny bit heftier. (If scale height of 15km holds, it can be as much as 500m/s of extra dV for ascent from a cloud city vs. ascent from Earth.) Mars, in contrast, is practically airless for the purpose of ascent, and we are looking at almost 3x less dV compared to Earth/Venus ascent. Which means that a mars ascent vehicle is certainly going to be an SSTO craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther than the size of the rocket, however, there are no additional difficulties on Venus. It would be straight forward enough to have a dedicated module for launches, which can carry the rocket away from main colony prior to launch, not unlike what you\u0027d do with a tracked vehicle on Earth. Alternatively, air launch is an option. Deploying a large aircraft from Venus is as easy as dropping it off underneath. Disposable winged stage would be a bit more expense, but it might be worth it for the ease of the launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll in all, all this is really saying to me that Mars is a much better place for a temporary outpost, supplied from Earth. So long as you stay marooned on the base, it\u0027s reasonably safe, and you can maintain the base with equipment from Earth. Then, if things go south, you just jump into an SSTO craft and wave the base goodbye as you ride to orbit. Venus, in contrast, makes much more sense as a permanent, nearly self-sufficient colony which, hopefully, can become entirely self-sufficient over time. Yes, it will be much more difficult to leave it, but the idea is that people wouldn\u0027t do that nearly as often. It wouldn\u0027t be a two year expedition trip, but more of a relocation for work. A place you\u0027d go to for many years, perhaps even decades. And that\u0027s really what we want to build.

A thermoelectric nuclear reactor would do the trick, or one using sterling engines or brayton turbines, which would be less reliable though.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor a sustainable habitat, you need a source of nitrogen, water and oxygen first and foremost. Since water can be split to release oxygen, we have that part covered, and plants can convert CO2 into Oxygen, and the Atmosphere, as well as the soil, contain Nitrogen and nitrogen-rich minerals.\u00A0Food will be mostly brought along by the colonists at first, until the greenhouses can provide all of their food.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNext we need some way of keeping the first generation of plants alive. We can use the subsurface water ice, combined with imported nutrients for that. I think aeroponics or hydroponics would be the best candidate at first, since soil is heavy, and you\u0027d have to import that from Earth at first.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/8c/0f/36/8c0f367e1ac0181ebd5fa1d265700272.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/8c/0f/36/8c0f367e1ac0181ebd5fa1d265700272.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen we need a source of spare parts. Producing large mechanical parts shouldn\u0027t be much of an issue, since metals like iron, aluminium, titanium, nickel and manganese are very common on Mars. We\u0027d have to develop a metalworks plant that can convert martian sand into useful metals. I don\u0027t know much about metallurgy though. Electronics would likely have to come from Earth for a while, as would smaller mechanical parts.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe initial habitats would need to be brought from Earth. A good solution would be inflatable habs that are then covered in Martian soil, either in the form of sand bags, or via 3d printing, as ESA proposed for \u00A0the Moon:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://lunarscience.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/lunarbase3dprinting.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://lunarscience.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/lunarbase3dprinting.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow you have a Mars habitat that can keep its inhabitants alive, without having to import everything from Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThings that will have to be imported from Earth for a while, both on Mars and Venus, will be medical supplies, spare parts, and people.
