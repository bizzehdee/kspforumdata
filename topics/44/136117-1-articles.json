Its sauce for the goose, because the most efficient place to burn out is always at periapse, the place were speed is fastest. BUt the most important thing is that the reason Apo increases to Escape point followed by increases of post-Escape velocities is that burning at pE increases kinetic energy, part of which is converted to potential energy as it leaves, and the rest remains kinetic energy relative to the system central mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason that Transfer energetics is not ideal in the 2 step process between orbits that start small and then increase 5 or six fold is because the second burn is velocity wise, far from the first, if it is close to the first, its efficient, and if it close to escape burn its efficient (because at escape velocity the second burn is basically 0 relative to the planet, its a limit that can never be reached in a comoving space-time system) a second burn is not needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIts all about the energetics, work is the addition of force over distance, if you travel into a low point around a celestial and then do work, you are moving faster relative to the celestial. Your craft has an absolute limit of thrust to weight a measure acceleration (increase in velocity) and of force/time, it does not matter if it is stationary to the celestial or moving 1/10th the speed of light. Since work is force * distance and since velocity is distance * time the force/time * distance (=velocity * time)\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 therefore \u00A0 \u00A0 force/time * velocity* time\u00A0 Kinetic Energy= integral (t=0 to t=end thrust)\u00A0 thrust*velocity. since the moment of thrust can be converted to dV as dV = f(thrust. time) the two velocity aspects multiply by each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis aspect of rocket behavior can be used in the atmosphere also, conservation of motion during a launch is extremely important, for example the atmosphere aspect decreases allows increased velocity and ground referenced acceleration, loss of acceleratoin in stage changes cost efficiency for several reasons, thus its a good idea to minimize the stage losses. The more one is pushing against gravity to stay aloft the more important these are. One strategy to avoid this is to shed boosters from the side, in which the main engines continue thrusting, even if the booster engines have energy left. Once a craft has turned and has significant omega^2 r centripetal acceleration, it can relieve its stack stages without much cost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven though you are adding the same dV you have produced alot more energy. That celestial only took u/r potential energy coming in and will only take u/r going out, so the large ramp up of kinetic energy at the pe, is all for the space craft to keep once its leaves the SOI, if it wait halfway up the exit to add more dV it will be going slower relative to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the way we can look at this is via enthalpy available in warped space-time complexes,\u00A0 there because space-time is warped by energy. Bodies that enter these systems cannot gain or loose total energy and random applications of force will result in a loss of energy from the bodies (such as frictional forces causing the collapse of a nebula protosystem disk). Nature assumes the application of force is random and so enthralpy will always tend from energetic to less energetic state, application of force intelligently can favor the improved energetics of one object at the expense of something else. In this case the exhaust of gases at pE in a retrograde direction almost certain results in those gases falling into the celestial. The system assumes a continuous motion toward disorder but ordering certain aspects can be done, even randomly objects are tossed from systems into space, others are tossed into the star, and the order in a planet is sometimes smashed into collisions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-06T00:56:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaie,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0This is an orbital mechanics question I can actually help you with \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Hohmann transfer from a Kerbin- like orbit about the sun is a straight vis-viva problem. 918.3 m/sec.
