In the beggining sort of \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sun is made of atoms lots of atoms mostly hydrogen in that beggining most of the heavy stuff sorts to the center and hydrogen to the exterior, like Jupiter, but then the sun fires, poof and this is produces a much higher intensity of light, and specifically blue and ultraviolet light\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you are a carbon atom lofting around you are going to be, basically ionized :C:, carbon gas. Next solar winds blows by with what H: and H\u002B so you form mainly CH4.

Sometimes you form H3CCOH, ethanol, sometimes HOH2CCOH, sugar. All a sugar is an aldehyde or ketone at any carbon and hydroxyl groups at all other carbons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the bottom line here is that if you ionize alot of space dust, then allow molecularization, molecules form \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo then the next question, the earth accretes, does this ionize space dust, sure it does. Your deep fat fryer or food in you oven begins to brown at 425\u0027F (218) C. That browning you see on your cookies, that is ionization, visible, many bonds ionize at much lower temperatures, most break by about 400\u0027C. So did molecules on earth ionize, they most certainly did. In addition the surface is virtually unprotected from the suns radiation for a long period as gas/liquid/solid separation occurs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the overwhelming majority of molecules in space were destroyed. And consider this, what is the most numerous atom on earth, iron, many of those carbons where originally tied up in iron molecules and other metals. This chemistry and the separation of these elements in our earth may have triggered life. But now there is almost no carbon tied up with iron, it has all moved toward the surface, along with the oxygen that and nitrogen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yes they existed in space\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyes they could form in space\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyes they could form on earth\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emost probably formed on earth, some were dropped in later, but the energy that drives life is probably from the chemistry going on inside the earth, surface chemistry prolly comes later. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut the space derived molecules might have stimulated the formation of life by providing resources, such as heated metal-carbon-oxygen compounds, that are not stable as they move toward the surface. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhich is why questioning when life arose is a very important question, timing is everything.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-24T18:22:17Z\u0022 title=\u002210/24/2015 06:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vger","CreatedById":67603,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-24T17:34:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, now we have another excuse to get corporations up there right?
