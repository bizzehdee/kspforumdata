Then the amount for radiation hitting Ceres relative to Earth is 1/(2.77Au)^2 which means the level of solar radiation is 1/8th, that means in order to see the average grey object on Ceres would require an exposure of 8 fold more time than on Earth or a aperture size 2.77 times larger. In terms of F-stop, the F-stop value would be 2.77 fold smaller than on Earth (Larger F-stop allow smaller levels of light, but increase the focal distance). IOW of the Ceres surface material were on the moon we would shorten the exposure time and increase the F-stop. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second image was taken at a radius perpindicular to the direction of the sun, the sun being in the left image direction, and the right portion of the image is at sunset, because most of the image is at a low incident angle relative to the sun, the exposure for the image is probably on the order of 16 to 32 times longer exposure or 4 to 6.5 times smaller aperture than the setting required for the same camera capturing the same surface on the moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E In addition the surface of Ceres appears to be very dark, and this would indicate that even more exposure time than the average reflective surface on earth. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E There are 6 factors in the exposure then\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

(since the intensity is digitized the signals with voltages very close to 0 or very close to maximum-saturation) will begin to lose correctablity. If a voltage comes in at 1 and this is statistically as 50.0% \u002B/- 0.05% then a voltage coming in at 0.01 has a value of 0.5 \u002B/- 0.05% and a voltage of 0.001 has a value of 0 or 0.1% \u002B/- 0.05%. At the high end the problem is more contorted because the reading is the saturation voltage - read voltage. In some instruments the voltage may even drop a few percentages with more intense light. IOW for very low and very high detected intensities the error in correction grows increasingly more severe as one approaches either limit of detection. Thus the cameras are going to record intensities that fit most pixels in the middle of the range. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a problem with almost all development based techniques and it overlaps with digital detection devices, the only exception are PMT based gamma counters that can read linearly across a 10\u003Csup\u003E8\u003C/sup\u003E fold scales (the major problem is background at the low end). Your typical detectors on digital cameras are in the 10\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E-10\u003Csup\u003E4\u003C/sup\u003E fold range scale. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus is you want to desaturate the intensity of light of the spots you would have to set the average detected hv by the camera to a lower threshold cease value.
