So, for instance, you can\u0027t design a plane around ramjets because it wouldn\u0027t take off the runway and you can\u0027t expect a plane with turbojets to cruise at match 4.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then I got thinking: Wait, there is the Kerbal way! You just combine engines!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich, since none is even planning in real life, probably means the Kerbal way doesn\u0027t really work and you can\u0027t \u0022just\u0022 combine engines. But hear me out:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImagine a small business jet. You fit a central turbofan (or turbojet, if they engine has to propel the plane higher than match 1) at the end of it much like engines in fighter jets are positioned. This engine will power the aircraft during take off, landing and subsonic flight where supersonic flight is forbidden. It should be a common, off-the-shelf commercial engine, which is easily available, has a reasonable price point and is common enough so maintenance and spares are just regular business. Nothing fancy, in other words.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, on the wings, you put a pair of ramjets powerful enough to propel the plane above match 3. Now, ramjets have very few moving parts (according to wikipedia, only the turbopump), and they are built in large scales for missiles, even if those are likely to be smaller than ramjets powerful enough to work in a business jet. So they should be relatively cheap to maintain and manufacture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, the plane takes off and heads for the ocean on the central turbojet, activates the ramjets, closes the turbojet intake to prevent damage and goes as far and as fast as it can!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven more, at least as far as the engines are concerned, there isn\u0027t that much R\u0026amp;D involved. The turbojet is an existing commercial design (uh, wait, turbojets are for military jets, right? Maybe there are purchase regulations?) and the ramjets are upscaled version of existing designs (just use tweakscale? \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E ). The extra weight of unused engines cuts the aircraft useful payload, but it might remain economically efficient because of the much lower investment in R\u0026amp;D and the possible maintenance costs of more complex and unique designs like the SR-71 engines (which I doubt the USA would allow to be sold for commercial use, plus the production lines are closed) as well as the lack of economies of scales in designing an expensive engine that only works for one type of aircraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, that still leaves all the issues of commercial supersonic/hypersonic flight: regular aviation materials melt at speeds above match 3 (use active cooling with liquid nitrogen or something?), you can\u0027t have a civilian aircraft leaking fuel on the airport like the SR-71 did, and it will be able to carry very few people in far less comfort than rich executives are used to - specially if they have to use pressure suits like the pilots of the SR-71, and the limited routes where supersonic flight is allowed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, since in any case none who knows of the subject is contemplating it, which are the drawbacks of trying to apply this Kerbal way to real engineering?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-06T16:10:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot that stupid of an idea... it\u0027s actually one that real-life aerospace engineers have had. And refined upon it. See, nowadays, you don\u0027t even have to mount different engines on the same vehicle. You literally have \u0022two-in-one\u0022 engines. KSP actually has two of those, and both are inspired by real life counterparts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, you have the Whiplash turboramjet. The word \u0027turboramjet\u0027 should already give you an indication as to what it is. The engineers took a ramjet, and mounted a turbine right in front of it, so that the exhaust of the turbine goes straight into the ram combustion chamber. The turbine drives an intake fan, much like in a turbofan engine; you could consider this a super-high-bypass turbofan, with almost all the air being routed around the turbine to the combustion chamber, and only as little as possible being consumed by the turbine itself to keep itself running.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo on the runway, where the ramjet is unable to do anything, you spin up the turbine and force large amounts of air into the ram combustion chamber, which lets the ramjet ignite. It doesn\u0027t work all that well, you don\u0027t have anywhere near peak thrust, but it\u0027s enough to let the plane accelerate and take off. The faster the plane is moving, the more air gets into the intake. You start routing air around the turbine to avoid it becoming a bottleneck, feeding it straight into the combustion chamber. Eventually, at mach 2-3, the turbine does almost nothing and the ramjet largely powers itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRealworld inspiration: Pratt \u0026amp; Whitney J58, the engines of the SR-71 Blackbird. While officially designated as a \u0022turbojet with afterburner\u0022, it featured the above-mentioned air routing, and the afterburner had a dedicated combustion chamber, so for all intents and purposes it worked as a turboramjet. The Blackbird was easily able to take off under its own power, while also being able to exceed mach 3 with those very same engines. (Even the exhaust graphics of the Whiplash are inspired by how these engines looked under full thrust.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe issue is that ramjets cap out eventually, and if you want to go hypersonic, you need a scramjet (\u0022Supersonic Combusting Ramjet\u0022) instead. And now you suddenly have three engines you need to stuff into one. That doesn\u0027t work, especially since the geometry of the combustion chambers and intakes differ noticably between ramjets and scramjets. You need a whole new type of engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn KSP, we have the R.A.P.I.E.R. engine. It is largely defined by its ability to switch between open cycle (air-breathing) and closed cycle (rocket) operation, but the realworld inspiration - the S.A.B.R.E. engine from Reaction Engines Ltd - can do much more than that. In contrast to the J58, this one has never flown before; in fact, it has never been \u003Cem\u003Ebuilt\u003C/em\u003E before. But the science behind its operation principles have been verified. It too involves an internal turbine forcing air into dedicated combustion chambers, but it\u0027s not a ramjet, it\u0027s not a scramjet, and it works without any complex air-routing shenanigans.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead, it has a very special air intake with absurd, almost magical-sounding abilities to gather and cool down supersonic air. It\u0027s already working on the test stand though, now it just needs the rest of the engine to be built. By choosing the right kind of turbine and the right kind of combustion chambers, this thing supposedly scales smoothly all the way from standstill on the runway to hypersonic velocities - at least mach 5 has been claimed, probably more than mach 6. And then it can also switch to closed cycle mode on top of all of that. You can imagine now why this engine is kind of a big deal, and why it had trouble securing development funding initially (nobody would believe this was physically possible).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut if it works out, it will mark the birth of an entirely new class of airbreathing engine, the likes of which the world has never seen before. We will find out in the next roughly 10 years, which is the timeframe Reaction Engines has named for building a prototype, testing it, and bringing it to production.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-06T16:13:10Z\u0022 title=\u002211/06/2016 04:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-06T16:53:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWeight and complexity.
