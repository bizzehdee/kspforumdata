There is no magic in physics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, you are not addressing the fact that every Eukaryote is literally a factory. Your entire complaint from the start was that a factory can\u0027t replicate without any one component, and therefore, cannot evolve. A Eukaryote cell is literally that. I am waiting for a detailed rebuttal, where you explain the difference between Eukaryotic cell and a factory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI already gave one. \u00A0Let me reiterate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe factory\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EI\u0027m\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0talking about uses hard carbon or metal components, everything tightly integrated like a watch. \u00A0Thousands and thousands of steps are integrated together and the thing is hyperfast. \u00A0Pieces of the factory do fail, and digital watchdog systems detect this and order the failed components recycled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY5192g1gQg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA floppy eukaryotic cell is \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003Enothing\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E at all like this. \u00A0At all. \u00A0Again, it\u0027s like the difference between a mitochondrion in a bird and a jet engine. \u00A0The parts are different, the principles are different, the energy storage mechanisms are different - the only thing in common is both are combusting hydrocarbons for energy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cell is floppy, it won\u0027t fail if a single atom gets out of place, it isn\u0027t cooled to near cryogenic temperatures, it isn\u0027t made of metal and diamond, it doesn\u0027t have digital sensors and exact control logic (mRNA regulation is statistical), it isn\u0027t in hard vacuum, it can\u0027t be intelligently redesigned, it can\u0027t operate using most of the elements on the periodic table, it won\u0027t have digital error correction between generations to reduce the probability of mutation to zero...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m talking about machine phase chemistry. \u00A0You\u0027re talking about goop in a bag. \u00A0There are about alike as jet engines and mitochondria.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yeah, just like jet engines guzzle hydrocarbon fuel by the ton, nano machinery factory would burn through energy and feedstock at incredibly voracious levels. \u00A0They would burn far more energy to, say, make an ingot of steel than a steel forge uses for the same task. \u00A0(but the ingot would be perfect). \u00A0Which doesn\u0027t matter - living cells don\u0027t have nuclear reactors or vast arrays of solar panels plugged in to them via power cables...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, something else you might have missed : the minimum \u0022replication subunit\u0022 of a nanomachinery factory is still a bunch of equipment. \u00A0It\u0027s a plasma furnace to digest matter. \u00A0A bunch of chemical reactors to get it to the atomically pure feedstocks. \u00A0Probably multiple stages of filtering. \u00A0(all sorts of high end equipment to do that - lasers, calutrons, etc)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are still 3d printers - they make the bulk stuff like frames and tank walls and casing and things where atomic precision isn\u0027t needed. \u00A0And then the core machine, the nanofactory, is hundreds of thousands of separate assembly lines that converge on one another. Some assembly stations in the factory can be state adjusted - ON/OFF/A/B - which is how the factory can make multiple outputs. \u00A0(different final products have modular components added or missing in sockets on them)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe whole \u0022nanofactory\u0022 isn\u0027t nano at all, once you include all the assembly lines and all the ports for input gases and coolant and power and all the duplicate backup assembly lines, the thing is desktop printer sized or larger. \u00A0Any smaller and it\u0027s not functional.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are then robots as well. \u00A0And a control computer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis whole machine weighs over a hundred tons. \u00A0Remove any major part, and it will not replicate itself. \u00A0It is too complex for nature to design via evolution, at least not without more time than the sun has left. \u00A0It doesn\u0027t compete with living cells in the same environment and the \u0022nanomachinery\u0022 isn\u0027t separate free running cells, everything must be welded down and connected to power leads and be heat sinked...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think maybe you had some sci fi nanobot the size of a eukaryotic cell roaming around free in mind. \u00A0I will agree with you there - the environment at that level doesn\u0027t have enough energy to do things this way. \u00A0The \u0022nanobot\u0022 would never get enough energy to copy itself at any decent rate since it is having to synthesize diamond, etc. \u00A0Also, it would just jam and fail since it\u0027s outside the vacuum chamber it would be intended to operate in. \u00A0So you\u0027d have to make it more flexible to survive in the living biosphere on earth, and after you do all that you end up with something that is marginally better than existing life at best.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-15T06:22:51Z\u0022 title=\u002202/15/2016 06:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by SomeGuy123\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
