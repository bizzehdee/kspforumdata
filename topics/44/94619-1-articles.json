It is probably idiotic, uneconomical and dangerous, but it might just be crazy enough to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first stage (TAL stage) resembles a giant Shuttle orbiter. Rather than a cargo bay, it has a fuel tank inside - a tank a bit smaller than an ET to power a 3-engine cluster of SSMEs to a ballistic trajectory. Because this is not an ultra-heavy launch vehicle, we don\u0027t have any SRBs, or we use smaller SRBs that can be attached over the wings, as this is essentially a linear launch vehicle and we don\u0027t have anything under the wings to attach large Shuttle-type SRBs to.) The front end of the TAL stage is a nosecone, which is concealed inside the interstage fairing. Above this is a widened, shortened Centaur upper stage, and above this is the payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket would work like any other, but the first stage would have an unusual return path. After MECO, the stage would remotely re-enter and land in Spain or another coastal area in Europe, with the intention that it can be loaded onto a barge and be brought back to KSC. Essentially, it would perform a Transoceanic Abort Landing (in this context, it is a Trans-Atlantic Landing, as this is not an abort - it is normal operation.) The Centaur is expendable, as Centaurs are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIssues-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Costs of moving a giant, precise rocket stage across stormy seas. The stage would be too big to use a Shuttle Carrier aircraft, and the SCA can\u0027t fly that far with a piggybacked payload anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Need suitable, long landing strip with boat access.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Re-entry should not pass any populated areas.

Nevertheless, you\u0027ll have to maintain several additionnal landing zones in other countries to be able to cover various launch angles (which would veery expensive - having classic \u0027airports\u0027 prepped for the shuttle\u0027s emergency transoceanic abort mode on each flight was already costly \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E, you\u0027ll have to add to that a full logistic chain if you plan to do it on each launch) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll also need a correct weather on both ends at each launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, the SSME\u0027s would be severely underperforming for this kind of mission :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey are built to sustain a very long burn in near vaccuum conditions (which is not the kind of conditions experienced by a first stage - so you\u0027ll have to make new nozzles adapted for it.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd they don\u0027t have that mich thrust at sea level, compared to other LH2/LOX engines (so you\u0027ll need SRB\u0027s anyway)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 3 SSME\u0027s, with their 1860kN of thrust at sea level each, would have a TWR \u0026lt; 1 if they where trying to only lift a fully fuelled external tank (625 tons) - without any upper stage or orbiter \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(For comparison, a single RS-68A has more than 3000kN of thrust at sea level for a delta-IV rocket)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, for your kind of first stage, i think it would be easier to start directly from a delta-IV rocket 1st stage and make it reusable instead of starting from the Space Shuttle subsystems \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if your first stage has a similar size and shape to a space shuttle, maybe you\u0027ll be able to use boeing\u0027s shuttle carrier plane to transport it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-27T01:50:39Z\u0022 title=\u002212/27/2014 01:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by sgt_flyer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-27T01:37:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s already a design for a Delta IV first stage combined with a shortened Centaur, though.
