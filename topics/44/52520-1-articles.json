Is the entire combustion chamber and nozzle shifted, or is the nozzle only moved?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the nozzle is moving and the combustion chamber is staying still, how does that work? Is the throat between the chamber and the nozzle flexible? Is the nozzle physically separate and just held in place? If that\u0027s the case, how are hot exhaust gases not seeping between the connection?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the combustion chamber moves along with the nozzle, then are most combustion chambers spherical, to facillitate a socket/ball joint?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully someone knows and can explain.
