On the other hand, I have been wondering whether we should not intentionally send life along with spacecraft, as a sort of insurance policy should Earth be hit by a spacerock. Humans might well go extinct, but we will have helped life to spread. Maybe, just maybe, one of those craft will land or crash somewhere where its hitchhiking lifeforms can continue evolution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would compare it a bit to trees or flowers spreading their seeds and spores with help of the wind.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spenzor","CreatedById":103399,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-12T22:00:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure there\u0027s some sort of extremophile bacteria here on Earth that would do well on Mars. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadiotrophic fungus might be another candidate, though the known varieties seem to require organic material to live on even in the presence of significant levels of radiation.
