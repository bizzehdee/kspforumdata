The basic problem is that when you say space or time, and we use our best definitions that are not QM we run into both as child processes of space time. Here is an example, suppose i say an apple fell and hit isaac on the noggin. But was its Isaacs nogging that hit the apple. The apple is falling is in the non-inertial reference frame, and the noggin was accelerated by earths surface to the apple. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would appear to be random, but if we reverse time then all inertias appear to lead to a single point. No problem, our three space dimensions become a point particle, of course with massive particles this is unstable so we make mass disappear. Ok we have a infinite energy density state with no mass, hmmm, theoretically then relativistic gravity just also disappeared, oh damn, and so did space-time and time. So a free unassociated QM sigularity can do sci-fi like stuff, like be at any, all or no space-time all at once.

And it has actually been calculated that the rough probability of a huge explosion of spontaneous matter and energy popping up out of empty space is such that it might happen once within all the known volume of the universe every 100 trillion years or so... so perhaps exactly that happened 14 billion years ago and the universe was essentially created by the Kraken.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GeneralVeers","CreatedById":148918,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-06T02:59:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022alpha tech\u0022 data-cite=\u0022alpha tech\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow does the laws of physics allow something to be created from nothing?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimple: by separating positive from negative. \u002B1 \u002B -1 = 0.

The nature of the Big Bang is, and has for a while been, one of the hardest topics to study in all of science. Here\u0027s a few possibilities:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Time did not exist before the Big Bang, so in a sense there has always been the same amount of matter and energy for all of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The laws of physics only apply within the universe, so talking about boundary conditions at the edge of the universe, outside it, before the beginning, or after the end means throwing all known physical theorems into doubt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Another universe existed before our own. Perhaps it collapsed into a Big Crunch and then rebounded; perhaps it moved through a higher dimension of space and collided with our own, transferring huge amounts of energy into it and causing a massive explosion; perhaps our universe was created from something that occurred in the previous universe, artificially or by a natural process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Quantum Mechanics suggests that things CAN be created from nothing, if you\u0027re really sneaky about it, i.e. create only a little bit of stuff or get rid of it really quickly. And it has actually been calculated that the rough probability of a huge explosion of spontaneous matter and energy popping up out of empty space is such that it might happen once within all the known volume of the universe every 100 trillion years or so... so perhaps exactly that happened 14 billion years ago and the universe was essentially created by the Kraken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst there is the suggestion that during inflation and the short period that followed that energy poured into our universe. I neither support or deny the pre CMBR suggestion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, dark energy suggests that energy has poured into our universe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth of these may represent transition from energy states we do not understand tobstates we can deduce.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SomeGuy12","CreatedById":103022,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-06T04:38:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s simply because you don\u0027t understand what time is\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E What experimental evidence indicates that differential geometry is anything more than a hypothesis?

Time is a human concept, describing the change of the universe. Not an inherent property of the universe.

We usually have proper time in mind when we talk about this one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Time as a coordinate in Relativity. This one can be strictly defined in terms of differential geometry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Time as casual ordering of events. This is the trickiest to define properly, and you have to drag entropy into it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then you have various cross-disciplines. Relativistic Quantum Field Theory has to deal with both 1) and 2). Which gets really hairy. Statistical Mechanics deals with 1) and 3). There are only two realistic scenarios where you need to talk about all three. That\u0027s event horizon of a black hole and the Big Bang. If you have a good grasp of QCD, and Condensed Matter theory, you can have some idea of what\u0027s going on in such condition using mean field theory approximations. It\u0027s ugly, and our insight into exact physics of it is very limited to say the least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, the precise QM of what\u0027s going at these kinds of places isn\u0027t really relevant to the discussion.
