First of all, twelve stations!? Secondly, some of those \u2018stations\u2019 are huge, vastly larger than the ISS, and yet somehow they are able to stick them all together.

There are various episodes of TNG where they clearly state a direction and speed between real, actual stars such as going to Wolf 359, and warp speeds are given a formula in canon, i.e. not an empirical formula derived by fans, then completely break their own rules and get there way faster than reasonable. You can\u0027t go that distance at that speed in that time.

I wonder a bit about how it escaped the atmosphere so quick since warp within the atmosphere sounds pretty crazy but I\u0027m sure Treknology can do it.

Often times ships are shown within under 10 km of each other visually from outside the craft, with easily traceable perspective and camera movements that constrain the maximum camera distance, or are shown with considerable perspective, i.e. as viewed from a few kilometers or less, on displays inside a ship. They are not usually shown onscreen with the near-orthographic projection you might expect if you are indeed viewing the ships from hundreds or thousands of kilometers away, even if viewing with very strong optical zoom. However, stated ranges by characters, while sometimes just hundreds of meters or a few kilometers are often well in excess of a hundred thousand kilometers. Star Trek ships in subluminal combat appear to be able to accurately target torpedoes at about half Earth-moon distance against an actively maneuvering target with nonzero chance to hit if stated ranges are to be believed. There is no combination of camera movements, field of view, fisheye, or anything else you can do to get the visual results to match the stated range, as this would make ships the size of skyscrapers or somewhat large look as they would at Earth-moon distance, which is to say, almost totally orthographic. Unless their screens on the bridge and the story camera outside the ship are wrong or a tac view and do not represent any direct imaging method with a real camera much of the time, this\u00A0 doesn\u0027t really make any sort of sense.
