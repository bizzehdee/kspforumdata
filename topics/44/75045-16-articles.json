And then fusion. The one and only way to actually make a dent in fossil fuel consumption. Neither of the alternative energy sources is particularly efficient, and wind power has a nasty side effect of killing birds and spoiling the landscape. It\u0027s also not cheap. In contrast, nuclear is clean and safe. It had what, two failures? One of them was a borderline criminal case of human error combined with this being Soviet Union (in any normal country, the test would\u0027ve been delayed, not handed off to a bunch of rookies), the other was a natural disaster, which are a problem regardless of what you\u0027re running on. Not to mention it was handled quite well, actually, and did less damage than commonly thought. Going nuclear is our only chance of both keeping up with increasing power demands and stopping global warming (as well as plain ol\u0027 air pollution). None of the renewables have the power output that we need.
