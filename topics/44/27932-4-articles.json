I think Phobos and Deimos are better targets for several reasons. Of course, as already mentioned, they are cheaper targets due to their lower gravity. This means lower delta-v requirements, and thus less fuel and a lighter spacecraft. But also, the crew would not have to readjust to a high gravity after nine months of weightlessness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut first and foremost, some speculate that Phobos and Deimos may indeed contain chemically bound ice. Their low density should apparently suggest that possibility. This would really make them priceless. Ice equals fuel, and as a fuel depot Phobos and Deimos would be even cheaper to mine than the Moon (ie. fuel-wise when transporting it back to Earth).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, bringing along a lump of ice for fuel might be preferable to conventional fuel. Storing ice is easy, as you only have to shield it from the Sun with foil, whereas liquid hydrogen and oxygen is difficult to store in comparison - it needs to be cooled to very low temperatures. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDust may indeed be a significant problem on the moons, but I would expect the same to be a problem on Mars itself (although less so). There you also have the violent dust storms to consider.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the return journey some have suggested a flyby of Venus to shorten the trip. Apparently this should make it possible to stay for only two months around Mars, and not imprison the crew for the 15 months required to wait for another Hohmann transfer to Earth. However, it would similarly restrict the launch window to line up three bodies (Earth, Mars, Venus).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sof","CreatedById":65663,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-28T12:26:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo how about landing on Phobos, hollowing it out then spinning it to create your spacestation with resources you don\u0027t need to bring with you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GJames","CreatedById":58866,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-28T12:39:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sof\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sof\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo how about landing on Phobos, hollowing it out then spinning it to create your spacestation with resources you don\u0027t need to bring with you.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhobos is roughly 22km wide, so that could take a while...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"karolus10","CreatedById":17876,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-28T14:02:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPhobos could made well as staging area on mars orbit, but sending people for long term mission on Phobos is very similar to asteroid missions...

If you could get a large amount of those materials, especially water ice which can be used to make propellant, you save a good deal of money when carrying out space missions of any kind, as less fuel etc. needs to be brought up from Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the availability of target asteroids, there are around 1,100 near Earth asteroids that have been classed as \u0022moveable\u0022 by Deep Space Industries and NASA. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are some problems if the target asteroid is tumbling; currently there is no real way of stopping that easily and economically. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is also easier to reach many of these \u0022target\u0022 asteroids than it is the surface of the moon (In terms of Delta-V), and current technology has already visited asteroids, such as NASA\u0027s Dawn mission, which is currently cruising through the asteroid belt on it\u0027s way to Ceres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, the asteroids with large amounts of minerals in them account for roughly 20% of the asteroids discovered so far, and more are discovered every week. If a target asteroid weighed 15,000 tons, it would be roughly 20-25m in diameter. Such an asteroid could be brought back to lunar orbit, where it could be studied and then mined. If this asteroid was an M-Type asteroid that contains mostly metals, it is likely to have a mineral content of around 88% iron, 10% nickel and 0.5% cobalt. As you can see they are almost pure metal, and if those metals were sold at today\u0027s prices then that one tiny asteroid would be worth $222,000,000 at today\u0027s prices. However, the cost of putting nearly 15,000 tons of usable metal into LEO would be around $45 billion assuming that the launch price is that of the Falcon Heavy, one of the most economical rockets in development today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously it would take a ridiculously long time to use up that much metal, but having it out there, safely orbiting the moon would bring down the amount of materials needed to be launched from Earth for future missions.

As for the disadvantages of this gravity simulation, they\u0027re well known and given a sufficiently long radius should be fairly negligible once it\u0027s been going for a while, but obviously would never feel exactly like regular gravity. The curved gravity issue is not really an issue at all. You just make the floor curved. There\u0027s also another method of creating gravity, which is simply accelerating at the desired force for half the journey and then slowing at the desired force on the second half.
