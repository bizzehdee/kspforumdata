Simple. Mass is like a dense form of potential energy. It is possible to do the same things we use mass as an energy source for as we do using radiant energies... but radiant energy by it\u0027s very nature requires either longer charging times or a massive charging infrastructure already in place. Mass does not require ANY charge time since it is compact and dense as an energy source. As a bonus it makes a good way to dump waste heat too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you know how scifi-starships flash out when they hyperjump or go to warp?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImagine if that required and burned or vaporized propellant each time? That\u0027s where the flash comes from! Meaning in order to jump safely you need enough propellant to dump heat and create the flash effect. Because if you don\u0027t your hyperjump will be suicide. You will make the jump alright... as a blinding flash of light with your ship\u0027s atoms scattered across the void.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso means jumping from solar system to system and harvesting propellant is absolutely necessary to make the next jump. As well as calculating jumps correctly... since jump too far from a star system and unless you have an uber photon drive or equivalent you won\u0027t reach it for millions of years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-04-06T10:01:55Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2023 10:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-06T10:09:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey throw back the whole other universe.
