(When I say ground vehicle, I mean something serious. Not just an automobile. More like something you\u0027d see on a frontier world.) Obviously you need navigation, cameras in several directions, and some way to talk to your autopilot. Speed, grade, and perhaps...altitude? could be put into a single screen. Communications could take its own screen as well. Are there any other must-have things?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, how do you configure your RasterProp MFD\u0027s?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Refining the request:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: The autopilot is a glorified cruise control, and little more. It\u0027ll keep you going in the same direction, at (largely) the same speed, but not much more than that. Think MechJeb\u0027s rover autopilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: The terrain information is not immediately evident. Think topographical map, you have to pay extra to get higher quality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: The terrain tends to be craggy, or full of gullies, ruts, and ridges. You can\u0027t really trust an AI to navigate this, like you can\u0027t trust an AI to rock-crawl.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: Although you can go outside for a bit (hull breaches won\u0027t kill you), you really don\u0027t want to. Think high desert or Antarctica; you want that climate-controlled cabin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5: Weather could be a concern. This includes solar weather, as well as simple rain and stuff.

I think it is a superior solution to have the AI controlled vehicles never even move if there\u0027s no valid path to their target than have them \u0027running against a wall\u0022 fruitlessly trying to get there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#1, you could do limited A*. You have a certain \u0022bubble\u0022 around the vehicle covered by sensors. Once you encounter non traversable terrain, you try to find a path to the far edge of the bubble in the direction of your desired waypoint. If no path exists (say the rover encounters a mountain range blocking the way, the autopilot shuts down the vehicle and sounds an alarm)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"0111narwhalz","CreatedById":110660,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-09T03:23:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you might be missing the point a bit.

One color - we can use white - represents \u0022goodness.\u0022 It\u0027s the combination of a bunch of algorithms working together to guess at how \u0022drivable\u0022 the terrain in front of the vehicle is. You see black areas representing \u0022dangerous\u0022 terrain\u0022 and white areas representing drivable terrain, and the autopilot tries to find a route through the terrain that will stick to areas that are \u0022good enough\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sensor data is combination of lidar and cameras - on the CM vehicle, lidar was only short range, so the vehicle would guess at what terrain features were at a distance, optically. When the vehicle gets close to that same features, it scans it with lidar, and estimates, based on the real world shape of the object, how \u0022drivable\u0022 it is. (yes I think this mean the vehicle would be equally afraid of tumbleweeds as boulders because both have a solid lidar return, but only one actually impedes the progress of the vehicle)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt stores in memory information about the object it saw, and gradually builds up a database, so as it sees new objects, it learns - in realtime - what they are shaped like and can now recognize them from a great distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a futurisitic vehicle you probably could make the lidar a lot brighter and thus boost the scan range. I don\u0027t know what you can do to reduce the \u0022tumbleweed\u0022 problem - you don\u0027t want your autonomous vehicle to be afraid of foil wrappers and plastic bags and cardboard cutouts but I know of no single sensor systems that can recognize all of these things reliably.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne more thing - any reasonably competent engineer for a system like this is going to demand overall mapping data. Having your vehicle drive around blind, only able to see what is immediately around it, is a terrible way to make sure you even reach your destination. On a planet with enough atmosphere you\u0027d launch a propeller driven flying drone that would ascend to high altitudes and map enough of the terrain to find a route to the destination, completing the map before you even depart. If there\u0027s not enough atmosphere, you\u0027d use a satellite map.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you had 2 basic autopilot screens, one would be from the perspective of the front of the vehicle, facing towards the direction of travel, and it would show the autopilot\u0027s estimation of the safest route to travel between terrain obstacles. The other screen would be from above, and would have a line on it showing the planned route from your present location to the destination, and the remaining distance and ETA.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-09T05:37:51Z\u0022 title=\u002211/09/2015 05:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SomeGuy12\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-09T10:01:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs this vechile made for shirtsleve planets, or mars type stuff?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"0111narwhalz","CreatedById":110660,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-09T18:01:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomeGuy, you\u0027re really missing the point. \u003Cem\u003EI\u0027m not trying to supply an AI with information.\u003C/em\u003E I\u0027m trying to supply a pilot with information.
