For the rare cases where the Shuttle\u0027s unique capabilities were extensively used, quite frankly, we probably could\u0027ve done it cheaper with a single-use mission module sent up separately on a medium/heavy-lift vehicle, to which a small crew transfer vehicle would dock for the duration of the mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst off you are fabricating a problem that the shuttles track record suggest really does not exist, Soyuz had two loss of crew events, the shuttle had two loss of crew events, both used markedly different systems. You know, space is not for the feeble at heart, neither is cutting edge science by the way. I spent many an afternoon with a geiger counter sitting next to me pinned to the right; and on another day I might be diluting the highest concentration of the most poisonous stuff known to man. If you want an argument solely about minimizing risk to zero, you have already lost I don\u0027t listen to you and I don\u0027t care. The functionality was and is always more important. Certainly absolute risk minimization not an argument the DoD uses. The problem you are creating is a artificially problem. Although it put 140 flights into space, and brought home all but one. It was a flying brick, but being a flying brick did not bring the one return failure, it was the sort of careless attitude about tile damage. This is something that occurs at 50km. Soyuz also had a problem at high altitude, the sprung a leak in their capsule, everyone died. That\u0027s space, you get the glory, you take the risk. Who are you taking the risk for, hopefully science, sometimes for the DoD, and sometimes other stuff. I have to add to this that at least the shuttle had a runway suitable to its needs, that\u0027s a luxury that the concorde did not have and yet it was allowed to fly for 20\u002B years before that was realized.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you think the space shuttle is a risky afair, then by the logic humans have NO business going back to the moon or mars, or trying to start a colony. All of these things are a magnitude more risky than the shuttle. Essentially that argument crops NASA to LEO ISS runs,\u00A0 completely unacceptable restriction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me make my position clear, its not about the shuttle, I don\u0027t care if it looked pretty at launched or was unsafe on occasion or whatever . . . . we lost functionality that should not have been allowed to lapse.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTHe argument has been made that other systems could/can do what the shuttle can . . . . Ok where are they, I see alot of expensive systems that can\u0027t do a third of what the shuttle did and still we are two years from a manned US based launch system . . . that is if you trust the contractors. . .all of whom are notorious for delays. \u003Cstrong\u003EThe shuttle function replacements have been all but a complete failure\u003C/strong\u003E. No in space repair, no manned capability, no satellite return capability, no capacity to assemble space stations . . . . . . Thats what it is, NASA intended replacement of the shuttle has not worked except for the rather blind luck of having SpaceX step up and want to start batting for them. And it looks like SpaceX will be sending crews to the ISS before the Orion contractors are ready to launch there trial run of the complete module. At the rate they are building these things we would be lucky to see a complete deep space module one per 3 years.

The Shuttle and ISS budgets ate up all the $, so throwing real money at crew required killing Shuttle first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut that was more of a congressional issue, not a NASA issue. NASA\u0027s budget was not spectacularly high, in fact toward the end it was low compared to GDP. At least I agree with this, but not simply that all functions. The shuttle was experimental technology made operational with largely 1970s technologies and could have been redone far more efficiently preserving most of its capability after the ISS was finished even excluding the possibility that we can launch another Hubble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is that over time the contractors serving NASA were not become more efficient and there is no guarantee that a recyclable vehicle would have saved that much money if it was engineered.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere is the basic problem with engineering. . . . we have to consider an overriding feature of the shuttle was the sheer size of its equipment bay (4.6 by 18\u00A0m) this made an ideal carrier for scientific satellites which were often bulky because of the nature of the equipment. Even so with a PL to LEO of 27 kT you are sitting at the very high end of capability, that has to be added, on top to the ability to carry up to 11 astronauts back to Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be my opinion based on the types of problems needed to solve for deep space flight that a larger volume payload would be better, not smaller. Its ability to pack and unpack stuff from payload bay make ideal for carrying bulky solar arrays (not for ISS) that can be used for interplanetary missions. For example, with current technology, the only vessel capable of building an interplanetary space tug would be the Shuttle, only the shuttle has the extendable arm and a payload bay long enough to carry the types\u00A0 of panels required for such a mission AND can assist and astronaut crew capable of assembly. Without a tug getting stuff back and forth from Mars is going to be prohibitive, IMO. And I know we are going to here this argument about the DSG, the problem with DSG and like-systems . . . vaporware. In my experience if something is doable and feasible its going to be execute within sizable completion in 5 years . . . . its not happening.\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESTS evolution\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo its not only what the space shuttle has done, but what it could do in the future. Another problem that I see is the complaint about the Engines. So somethings I would point out that I would change.\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. SFRBs . . . .no really efficient launch vehicle really uses these anymore, and the ones that do use small ones, just enough to get to close to MAX Q. These should have been replaced with F9 like returnable rockets. The SFRB recycling was a boondoggle, and SpaceX demonstrates how it should be done.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Payload bay could be widened without necessarily effecting overall performance. I would have been nice to have a shuttle with a wider bay. The future of deep space until a efficient fusion reactor can be designed is bulky structures. Length I don\u0027t think I would mess with.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. The RS-25s unfortunately, and I say this very cautiously, required to much maintenance per cycle, the production cost, trivial compared to the number of missions, I wouldn\u0027t touch that be there needs to be a way to allow them to operate for hours without significant maintenance.\u003Cbr\u003E\n4. Complete avionics flight control replacement, complete overhaul of extended duration life support capabilities.\u003Cbr\u003E\n5. The big red fuel tank, seriously there could have been structural adaptations to prevent icing, for the fact you are launching next to a beach next to the gulf stream, it carries heat from the gulf = moisture. This problem could have been dealt with removable plastics that could have been separated prior to launch. There were solutions available. The idiocy of this is that oxygen is produced on site for the shuttle . . .this means, guess what so is nitrogen its simply toss away, it could have been used to keep the exterior of the shuttle dry simply excluding moist air.\u003Cbr\u003E\n6. Ablation tiles . . .again these have been shown to be obsolete both in design and structure.\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nReplacement\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFirst off the Orion system IMHO is too specialized, it looks back to the Apollo era and not forward and it has taken too long to design and has proven to be rather expensive. So I don\u0027t see Orion as a comparable replacement but as a tangential system. More and more it looks like a boondoggle. There is no need for a vehicle to be able to go to Mars and whereever and also reenter the earths atmosphere. These capabilities can be taken care simply by crew transfers, The orion reentry capability is kind of a waste of function capabilities.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe SpaceX Crew transport system is very utilitarian and does fill in a gap that the US has been lacking and is likely to be a cost reduction over the shuttle, obviously this, if it works will be required . . .no doubt..But expect glitches.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMissing: is an in space repair capability outside of the ISS elliptical.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMissing: is an in space assembly facility (a factory) or the means to build it. Im not saying that the shuttle is best for doing this, but its a magnitude better than the next best thing . . . . . Deep space ventures and tugs will require this.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBulk cargo carrying capacity\u00A0 . . . . .compromised . . . .I don\u0027t see a future for DIV heavy. Maybe space X or the Russian rockets can pick up the slack.\u003Cbr\u003E\nExtended range multipurpose vehicle. Obviously the vertical range limited the shuttle, and its looks like SpaceX is working toward in space refueling (currently they cannot handle LH2. This needs to be a thing.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 a. First its hard to imagine a mars resupply and sample return without a dedicated (i.e. Earth MEO or GTO to Mars ) shuttle, the refueling needs at Mars are pretty significant and we can\u0027t expect Mars to be big fuel producer. There needs to be a way to get some sort of equipment carrier up to MEO that either it or something else assembles\u0026gt;\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 b. of course the assembly may require its own specialized and dedicated facility (once it is built)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 c. some ability for the shuttle/replacement to be refueled in space. If spaceX is cheaper at getting m -\u0026gt;LEO then why not let them do it in spades.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are many pieces here that need to be replaced, not just manned to orbit if your are looking future. As stated in other thread \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E is mid to far future, most of the things I mention need to already be a thing for stable and expansive deep space presence. Its not about the shuttle or its design, its about extending functionality into space up to a point where this idea of fabricating interplanetary vehicles with Earth return capability is routine and something more evolved than Hayabusa (the Odysseus of the spaceflight saga). It is sad for NASA that not only did they loss what they had, but since then progress has been virtually frozen. And in terms of the cost NASA is a victim of greed as well as their own inefficiency, so the point needs to be made that NASA needs funding to handle near future progress.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223268275\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022169590\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221515998050\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257438\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CatastrophicFailure\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, CatastrophicFailure said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSoyuz had two LOCV events... during \u003Cem\u003Edevelopment\u003C/em\u003E (Challenger and Columbia were both \u201Coperational\u201D flights), and the Soviets learned from the mistakes and rectified the flaws.
