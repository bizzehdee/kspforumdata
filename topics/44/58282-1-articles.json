There are a couple steps between kilo and one before and after centi. There is deca as in decameter or 10 meters. Then hecto as in hectogram or 100 grams. Then you have the smaller units. Deci as in deciliter or .1 liters. Then there is centi like centimeter .01 of a meter. Then you have milli like milliliter. This should clear up anything in case anyone is confused.
