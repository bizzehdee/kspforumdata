On top of that, you have to add the equipment to clean it (because that stuff is toxic, yo) and fit it with lab equipment. I think it would be much more efficient to just launch a separate, dedicated lab module\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-26T13:49:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewell, the idea is that the payload IS the upper stage SRB.
