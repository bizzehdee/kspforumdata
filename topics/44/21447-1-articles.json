Adams) even if it wasn\u0027t named \u0022Asparagus\u0022 until 1989.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne important thing to understand is that the cult of Asparagus made a lot of sense in pre-release KSP, not so much in \u0022real life\u0022, \u0022post-release KSP\u0022 and \u0022realism overhaul\u0022.\u00A0 The biggest reasons follow:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe biggest reason for asparagus staging was that KSP had a limited maximum size of rocket engines.\u00A0 If you wanted a bigger rocket and/or more delta-v, you simply piled small engines on top of small engines and built \u0022kerbal\u0022 rockets.\u00A0 Only N-1 and Falcon Heavy use \u0022lots\u0022 of engines, and really doesn\u0027t work in real life.\u00A0 More modern KSP (including beta and other late pre-release editions) had things like mammoths, twin-boars that made these \u0022kerbal\u0022 rockets only needed for wackjob-style rockets built out of huge numbers of mammoths.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond is that for peak aero efficiency, you need to maintain a velocity equal to your terminal velocity.\u00A0 In KSP\u0026lt;1.0, this was achieved by limiting \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E=2.0.\u00A0 In real life (and KSP\u0026gt;=1.0) this requires a huge \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and essentially requires solid boosters.\u00A0 Asparagus staging let \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E stay relatively constant (at ~2.0) all the way through the souposphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn pre-release KSP, vacuum nozzles had full thrust but simply used more fuel to compensate.\u00A0 I didn\u0027t understand why this was so terrible until some of my \u0022lift off with vacuum rockets\u0022 simply failed and showed just how badly I was \u0022cheating\u0022 by relying on old KSP\u0027s poor physics model.\u00A0 Consider a hypothetical Falcon 9 with \u0022onion staging\u0022 (\u0022onion staging\u0022 is provably less efficient than asparagus staging, but is needed to make my point): Instead of 9 first stage engines \u002B 1 second stage engine, this \u0022Falcon 8\u0022 rocket has 8 first stage engines firing in parallel (and feeding through KSP\u0027s \u0022magic fuel lines\u0022) the second stage engine.\u00A0 There is no way the benefit of losing one engine (roughly one ton) will compensate for using a sea level optimized nozzle on the second stage (which provides much more than half of the delta-v).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso post-release KSP has a working aero model.\u00A0 The cult of Asparagus fed on the issue that strapping stage after stage in parallel didn\u0027t add any aero losses.\u00A0 I think this is mostly minor, but it still artificially made asparagus look good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, asparagus would really help on Falcon Heavy, but was beyond even spacex\u0027s prowess (and remember all the claims that it was impossible to stabilize all 27 engines in Falcon Heavy.\u00A0 SpaceX does 6 impossible things before breakfast and was stuck on this one detail).\u00A0 Drop tanks may be catching up and replacing asparagus as \u0022important kerbal tricks\u0022 in post-release KSP, and can be seen in Rocket Labs\u0027 Electron (in the form of \u0022drop batteries\u0022, which makes sense since they don\u0027t get any lighter and are an obvious candidate to drop).\u00A0 I\u0027d expect that restartable vacuum optimized craft would try drop tanks in the future (do one \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E kick on one tank, shut down, drop the first tank, switch to the second tank, and do the second (final?) \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E burn afterwards).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-27T08:51:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut should we call Asparagus any design with
