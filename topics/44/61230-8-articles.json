If you want to go to the mars and then go back to earth without waiting months for a transfer window, you have to use a special window that occurs pretty much every 15 years.

To reduce the latter, there must be some way to do weight-bearing exercise that covers the whole body, in order to compress the bones. Strapping the astronauts\u0027 hips to the treadmill won\u0027t do it, since this leaves upper body bones from having to bear weight. Strapping them by the shoulder leaves the neck bones vulnerable, and so on. Also, human arms normally hung from the upper body sections, which means they have to be given exercise separately (bones need pressure to maintain density, not tension). In the end, some sort of centrifuge would still be necessary, otherwise we\u0027re looking at an extensive exercise regime. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen again, considering the amount of time the astronauts have off duty, such exercise regime would still make sense.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Headhunter09","CreatedById":67393,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-09T14:47:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs long as we\u0027re assembling transit vehicles in orbit, I don\u0027t see the problem with constructing a centrifuge.
