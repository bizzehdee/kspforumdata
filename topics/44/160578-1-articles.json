However, on Earth the background temperature is generally above\u00A0270 K, as opposed to 3K in space. Radiation of heat can be done via convection, and its easy to obtain material to use as a heat sink.

Radiation is one, but not that efficient as a heat transfer method at our preferred body temperature. Human body can radiate at\u00A0up to 100W, or a little over half of our heat production at rest.\u00A0Convection in the form of respiration is of course another one, like you mention, and very efficient when the surrounding environment permits the sweat to evaporate.

Which being a gas tends to expand and move up and away when warmed. Letting cooler air again come in to contact with our outer surface. (Of course this works in the opposite direction when air is hotter than us.) Neoprene has quite a low thermal conductivity, thus it is very good for e.g. wetsuits and other clothes meant to keep you warm. I would be very surprised if I didn\u0027t get hot just sitting in a suit made from it. If you had a suit made of steel fabric - not very comfortable, but it will definitely keep you cool.
