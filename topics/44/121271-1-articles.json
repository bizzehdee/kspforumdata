I will use Star Trek as an example. Their premise fr teleportation is that the entity is deconstructed and analyzed, then is created from materials to match exactly the original entity at the destination, complete with memories. This should also apply to moving around consciousnesses, except that it is only the mind and memories that are deconstructed and re-assembled. My question is this: If yo were teleported/have your consciousness transported, even if the destination has a copy of you with the exact same everything, even memories, is it really you? Are you, yourself dead, and your personality is assumed by a perfect copy? Share your thought please, I would like to hear what you guys think.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GeneralVeers","CreatedById":148918,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T06:16:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EConsider the fact that the body you currently live in is no longer the one you were born with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot one single cell in your entire body survived from the day you were born.

I was in a traffic accident, banged my head real hard and don\u0027t remember 15 minutes before the accident and a few hours afterwards. Otherwise, as far as I can perceive them, my though processes are the same, my other memories are all intact and I continue. If there had been no physical injury and doctors running around me covered in blood, I would know nothing about the incident and continue to live my life as if nothing happened. Imagine that situation. You live your life with just a small period of time your memories can\u0027t account for. Why would that bother you? Clone or not? I may be a clone, so what? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AngelLestat\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AngelLestat\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe key here is to understand what is \u0022you\u0022, no matter how perfect is a copy from you, is easy to know is not you, because you are here, and that thing is there.
