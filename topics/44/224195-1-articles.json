As it goes up (neglecting air friction), it keep that same Vh. But to stay above the same point it started at, it would actually need a bigger Vh, because the radius above the center of the planet is bigger the higher the rocket goes. So it drifts east, but not as fast as the surface is going east. Thus, relative to the surface, it falls behind by drifting west.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
