I\u0027m working on a mod for KSP called Kerbal Botany Expansion, which, as it sounds, adds plant science into KSP, but I really have no idea how plants grow in space or exactly how I want the plant study labs to work. I know that the science is going to be generated over time, but I am not exactly sure what should be said about the Plants at each different stage, If you have information on this topic, I would love to hear it and figure out a way to incorporate it into my mod! If you have ideas for my mod specifically, you may want to consider posting that in the development topic of my mod (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/150785-kerbal-botany-expansion/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EHere\u003C/a\u003E).
