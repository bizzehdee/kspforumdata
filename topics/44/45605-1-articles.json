It is set a goal, and figures out what it would need to accomplish that goal. This translates into a long list of items with certain specifications. That list could be split into three-stuff NASA already has, stuff NASA doesn\u0027t have, but does exist, and stuff NASA has, and doesn\u0027t exist. NASA wants everything to be in list 1 before it launches the mission. Going from List 2 to List 1 is basic enough, NASA buys the item, maybe with a few modifications (Electronics must run on AA batteries, for example). List 3 is more difficult. Take the cameras the Apollo astronauts used on the Moon. While the principles of photography was established by the early 1960s, a camera that could be used by a man in a bulky spacesuit, in a vacuum, did not exist. NASA asked Hasselblad to create camera which could be used in those conditions. Hasselblad worked out the technical issues themselves, and gave NASA the cameras.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis relationship was beneficial to both parties. NASA got their amazing photos, obviously, but making the Moon cameras made better commercial cameras possible, either by directly influencing manufacturing processes used by Hasselblad (I don\u0027t claim to have an intricate knowledge of film camera design philosophy before and after 1963-1972, but it is common sense to assume that \u0022outside the box\u0022 thinking came often be superior to the convention) or by Hasselblad having more money to send to R\u0026amp;D, both through the contract money, and the \u0022our cameras are used by frickin\u0027 NASA\u0022 selling point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galane","CreatedById":77949,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T21:49:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...and stuff NASA has, and doesn\u0027t exist.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso known as Area 51. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Holo","CreatedById":39606,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T21:56:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Galane\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Galane\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso known as Area 51. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom their post, it\u0027s making me imagine a large warehouse full of closely guarded and constantly observed \u003Cem\u003Etop secret cameras\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
