just be a NASA cultural thing, but look at the huge army of very well paid techs that had to crawl over the Space Shuttle for months to ascertain it was safe to re-use and put humans on.\u00A0 \u00A0It would almost have been cheaper to build a new Shuttle for every flight.\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0Now imagine doing the same with a recently shut down nuclear reactor\u00A0 that\u0027s still undergoing decay reactions and isn\u0027t shielded on all sides, how long will the maintenance take now and how much will it cost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps you could use a robotic vehicle to attach lead plates to the unshielded side of the reactor before sending the techs in.\u00A0 \u00A0Answers on postcard,
