Richard Garriot the creator of Ultima Online follows in his fathers foosteps and buys a ride on the Soyuz up to the ISS. Richard was near sighted thus never was able to become a government paid astronaut like his father. So he makes a deal with the Russians and they send him up for $30million. But the money is only the start. This documentary follows Richard for the nine month training session. It\u0027s an amazing look inside the Russian space program and the ISS. A truly inspiring journey. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found two things that stand out the most to me. How subtle the correction burns are. No sound. All you see is all the stuff floating around inside the capsule move to the back and then back to zero g. Cool effect. Just a little on-off burn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big thing that surprised me was how violent the landing is. He brings up this HD camera and films everything its great. All the way up to the end. I swear its like a car crash. Even with the \u0022soft landing\u0022 thrusters that fire an inch off the ground its still a scary, violent impact. And to add insult to injury the damn thing rolls over. ( which may be intentional to get the cosmonauts out easier )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut all in all an amazing first person perspective of Russian space flight and some good times on the ISS. Awesome movie. So if you haven\u0027t heard of this its a must see for any space enthusiast. I could watch it over and over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/hqY2GmvGcjA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-25T02:05:31Z\u0022 title=\u002209/25/2013 02:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Apotheosist","CreatedById":9399,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T23:52:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow/where can I watch it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-25T02:11:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI bought the movie off \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.amazon.com/Man-Mission-Richard-Garriotts-Stars/dp/B0077D2AJW/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1380074830\u0026amp;sr=8-2\u0026amp;keywords=Man\u002Bon\u002Ba\u002BMission\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAmazon.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if you just want to rent or something I think youtube has a service for that and the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/movie/man-on-a-mission-richard-garriotts-road-to-the-stars\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emovie is on there\u003C/a\u003E, but its in standard definition.
