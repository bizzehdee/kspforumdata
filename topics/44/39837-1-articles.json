SpaceX can\u0027t really do that in the near future without a lot of subsidies by NASA. They just don\u0027t have the money. If they can develop a heavy-lift rocket for $3 billion (which is about 1/8 of what NASA is spending on SLS), then it would take them 120 Falcon 9 flights or 50 Falcon Heavy flights to get enough capital (assuming they make 50% pure profit on each flight). Heavy rockets are usually more cost-efficient per mass than light rockets, but require a lot more up-front capital.
