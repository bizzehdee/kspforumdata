For example if dark energy were to reverse and the universe began to close back in on itself causality may cease to exist in the final moments. Local space time in the universe can be moving away at many times c....somewhere i read something like 58c....maybe higher. If this is reverse direction and return when they got close to each other then the comoving reference frames would be moving faster than c. In this way time is a function of the inflation of the universe, relativistic gravity may be the fix. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are confusing what happens in our peaceful little backwater with all points. i think what hawkings and others are trying to say that if you have enough energy to travel back in time you also have energy comparable to other space time of the univers where this is possible, unfortunately, its too much energy for human, maybe matter, to exist. You could go back in time but it wouldn\u0027t matter because the local spacetime you are sitting would be complete and utter chaos characterized by exotic matter, inflation, etc. The outcome would be a honogenization of local space and future generations would not see specific outcomes but generalized outcomes, like CMBR. I think from a quantum perpective if you tried to tamper and persuade many anti-normal events, you would prolly loose all control of shaping those events, that is a refection of destructive chaos. Another way to look at this is that our time-line is like a pond and we are a fish in that pond, the pond has streams that flow in and out, and we can swim to those streams, but should we seek out to enter a birds nest or walk on the moon, we cannot expect our pond physics to work the way we expect.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-29T14:32:37Z\u0022 title=\u002210/29/2015 02:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-29T14:25:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/fasterlight.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThe FTL page over on Atomic Rockets\u003C/a\u003E probably has the best way of breaking down all the mathematics and technical issues behind faster-than-light travel into layman\u0027s terms.

This sounds like the equivalent of the Sci-fi phase, the proton would have to be in another phase, its vibrations out of tune with the proton making them invisible to each other. For this to occur time would have to be discrete at the quantum scale, it would be like time-sharing of quantum time. We know the vibrations of the atoms E = hv, this is arguing that that this wave is carrying much smaller waveform, much like system clock on a computer.

By sheer coincidence, Planet A\u0027s scientists launch a big satellite around the same time. Shortly thereafter, astronomers on Planet A see a huge missile coming, and there\u0027s nothing anyone can do about it. But when the missile arrives, by sheer coincidence the satellite blocks it and the world is saved. Physicists on Planet A surmise that based on the missile\u0027s speed, it was launched before the satellite was ever launched, and that they lucked out when they decided to launch it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile Jeb is in a rocket flying past and sees the satellite launch first and then the missile. Aha! So the physicists were wrong. He goes to tell them about it, but in so doing he must travel slower than light, so by the time he gets there, the missile has already hit the satellite. More importantly, the missile has entered Planet A\u0027s light cone, so the fact that it had been launched had been visible to astronomers already. His perspective was perfectly valid way out in space, but in this reference frame he\u0027s wrong. Right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming I thought that through, let\u0027s run it again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlanet B launches missile while Planet A launches satellite around the same time. Val, in space, sees the missile launch and realizes that by the time the Planet A-liens see it, it will be too late to do anything. Incidentally, she notices that their satellite has not been launched from her point of view. No matter though - she has a world to save. She warps to Planet A at ludicrous speed to warn them. They are still debating whether to launch the satellite, and she convinces them that it\u0027s of world-shattering importance. Thus they launch it. A while later, astronomers spot the missile coming and are glad they launched the satellite. When the missile arrives, the satellite blocks it and saves the world. Everything\u0027s cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut wait! The physicists calculate the missile\u0027s incoming speed and surmise that it launched before their satellite did. How did Val manage to see it coming... wait no. They surmised that last time around too. Val has warp, so of course she can warn them before the missile comes into view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce more, with feeling!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlanets A and B launch their respective thingies around the same time. Secret Agent Kirrim is in space flying around (in the opposite direction as Val last time) and sees the satellite go up first. Cool, a satellite. Then he sees the missile launch shortly thereafter. Oh no! Better warn the A-liens. He warps to Planet A at ludicrous speed and tells them there\u0027s a big deadly missile coming. Unfortunately, there\u0027s no sign of any missile to be seen in the sky. People ridicule him and his claims to have outrun light. But then, a while later, a huge deadly missile appears on scope and the astronomers realize to their dismay that it\u0027s too late to do anything. Fortunately, the satellite blocks the missile and the world is saved. Kirrim is honored for his pure-hearted attempt at heroism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut oh no - physicists have calculated that the missile was launched before the satellite, which was already in orbit by the time Kirrim landed. Yet Kirrim claims to have seen the satellite go up first. They argue at length over whether Kirrim has traveled in time or is simply insane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I understand it, the question is of trivial importance. Of course people from different reference frames will disagree on the sequence of (unrelated) events. Special Relativity warned us about that. By warning the A-liens, Kirrim had to enter their light cone and thus their frame of reference.

We Warp from A to B. This happens in Earth\u0027s frame of reference so theres no time travel, we just need some distance to work with.

Remember that the ship entering warp and emerging from warp are spacelike separated events and so can occur in either order depending on the frame of reference, and we have chosen a frame of reference that puts exit before the entry, in Earth\u0027s time. So Earth, a few years after the ship leaves, sees it entering warp for a second time. It saw it arriving a long time before that, though, and after you account for speed of light delays, you do not get the expected travel time as we did on the trip out. The ship, in fact, arrived before it set out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm not sure why people have a problem with this.
