The second An-225 included a rear cargo door and a redesigned tail with a single vertical stabilizer. It was planned to be more effective for cargo transportation.[11] Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the cancellation of the Buran space program, the lone operational An-225 was placed in storage in 1994.[12] The six Ivchenko Progress engines were removed for use on An-124s, and the second uncompleted An-225 airframe was also stored. The first An-225 was later re-engined and put into service.[5][13]\u003Cp\u003EBy 2000, the need for additional An-225 capacity had become apparent, so the decision was made in September 2006 to complete the second An-225. The second airframe was scheduled for completion around 2008,[14] then delayed. By August 2009, the aircraft had not been completed and work had been abandoned.[1][15] In May 2011, the Antonov CEO is reported to have said that the completion of a second An-225 Mriya transport aircraft with a carrying capacity of 250 tons requires at least $300 million, but if the financing is provided, its completion could be achieved in three years.[16] According to different sources, the second jet is 60\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u015370% complete.[17]\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-01T10:54:29Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2014 10:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-01T07:39:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMagnificent beast \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E You\u0027re very lucky.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-01T08:44:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI saw it land a couple of times at Toulouse airport as part of the A380 program a few years back.

Fuel load is very significant portion of the gross takeoff weight. A 747-400 (gross takeoff weight of ~875 000 pounds) departing on a long haul flight like LA to Sydney or Hong Kong - Frankfurt will be carrying on the order of 350 000 pounds of fuel. Thats about three times as much as the passengers, baggage and cargo. And most transport category aircraft have a maximum zero fuel weight (MZFW). That is the maximum aircraft gross weight prior to loading fuel. It defines the maximum non-fuel payload. For a 747-400, the maximum zero fuel weight is about 540 000 pounds, meaning a 747-400 taking off at maximum gross weight must have over 100 000 pounds of fuel on board. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: The maximum zero fuel weight is a structural limitation. Fuel is carried in the wings while other payload is carried in the fuselage. Bending loads on the wing are different for the two cases.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
