Farming subsidies should never have been a thing in US government (IMO), farming is big business, they can survive just fine. Subsidizing churches is not possible (1st Amendment). Education is mostly State/local money. The military in the US is about 50% of \u003Cem\u003Ediscretionary\u003C/em\u003E federal spending, but discretionary spending is only about 1/3 of total US Federal spending. The bulk of fed spending here is \u0022Programmatic\u0022 spending, which is social programs (largely Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid). This has been true for decades, contrary to what I imagine many outside (and inside) the US think the US spends money on as I see people saying that we spend half out money on the military all the time, when in fact it\u0027s closer to 20% (much of which is payroll, and medical, actually). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENASA right now gets ~0.5% of Federal spending.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
