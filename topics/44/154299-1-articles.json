And the Navy found out that even though both engines were built to the exact same design, they were not identical. Spare parts that worked on the GE-built engines didn\u0027t work on the Pratt-built engines and vice versa. They ended up having to store more spares because they had to have sets of spares for each.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, the point is that even experienced engine-builders working from the same blueprints can\u0027t build interchangeable engines.
