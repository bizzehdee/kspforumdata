I don\u0027t want to go into ogy contests about this but just from wikipedia you can pull examples both ways and study the mess that is copyright laws. Just because you think it\u0027s fair use might not be fair use. Asking Squad about it is free and if they say it\u0027s not OK you should not do it, it\u0027s that simple. If they say it is OK, your bases are covered since you have the IP holder\u0027s permission to use it in this way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond point here is that whether or not this is non-profit can be contested. You\u0027re asking people for money that goes directly to a single person to fund their balloon launching hobby. You don\u0027t even have an existing work here, you\u0027re selling the idea of Jeb on stratosphere to get money of which you\u0027re basically not accountable to anyone on how you use it. It\u0027s very different if you were to first do the work, then ask for donations to cover the expenses. Now you\u0027re just asking for money. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird point is that using this forum to ask for money without permission from the forum\u0027s owner is just plain rude. I can think of a few scenarios that might happen if they just let anyone advertise their kickstarters to fund their Jeb-launching projects. Again asking for permission costs nothing, is polite and if they say no, you don\u0027t do it. There\u0027s literally no reason not to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal point here is that the person setting the kickstarter should realize that if any copyright issues would be to arise, they\u0027re personally accountable. If they get ten thousand dollar fine, they themselves will have to pay. Crying to court about someone on the internet saying it\u0027s ok will not help. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor all the above points that may or may not cause trouble the simple, polite and completely free solution is to ask for permission. Personally I can\u0027t understand why this is such an issue and needs to be argumented over? Just ask, if they say yes, great, you have official support. If they say no, you just avoided a lot of headache for someone and unneccessary work for a gaming company. Either way it\u0027s a win.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pxi","CreatedById":78711,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-19T10:40:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lajoswinkler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lajoswinkler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I take a photo of a man dressed in Goofy, or a Goofy figurine being lit on fire by a torch lamp, and I make money out of it (even if it\u0027s profit for me, though this Jeb thing is non-profit), it\u0027s at least fair use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I make a short movie in which Goofy is used \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eas a Disney character\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E, without it being parodied or turned into an art, and I make money on it, then I\u0027m breaking the law.
