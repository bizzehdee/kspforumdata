It will slip out inevitably.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I propose a solution that, while expensive and it might increase global warming by some degree, WON\u0027T slip out the fusion plasma unless you desire it to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIdea: Create the fusion reaction some way and sustain it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we don\u0027t know how to sustain it or have a way of doing so then that\u0027s the main problem.

Regenerative rocket based cooling. Pump liquid helium or liquid hydrogen through the reaction chamber walls to keep them from melting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWill probably need either a spherical or cylindral shaped reactor since either is better for even flow of pumped liquid to cool it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOutside the fusion reactor building you would see rocket bluish plumes shooting up into the sky instead of steam plumes you see at nuclear plants, because more energy would be generated and thus more heat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan this be done or am I oversimplifying it?

in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd while magnetic confinement helps a little, an object at \u0022only\u0022 a few million Kelvin will be radiating a trillion times more energy than the surface of the Sun inch-for-square inch, and mostly in X-Ray. And you usually want to go a little hotter to get the reactions going. The thermal radiation energies involved start at a dental X-Ray and go up if you want to have a livelier reaction rate. At these frequencies, we only know how to reflect X-Ray at very shallow angles. To prevent energy losses, you need to send that heat back in or run the reaction so fast there is no time for reactants to cool. Since nothing can reflect the radiated heat back in, the only way to avoid losses over time is to have you reactor be really big. Id est, the Sun. Your other options is running the reaction really fast, either in a continuous beam in a toroidal reactor or in spikes using either ablative or magnetic compression. All three of these have to work with fairly rarified plasma to function, so getting high mass flow rates simply isn\u0027t an option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a secret third option. Catalyzed fusion. Muons bring the barrier down enough that you can almost get away with room temperatures. Though, of course, a few thousand Kelvin won\u0027t hurt for a faster reaction. Trouble is that muons decay, and we haven\u0027t figured out how to make them efficiently. You solve that, and we\u0027ll have cheap, reliable (almost) cold fusion.

And you usually want to go a little hotter to get the reactions going. The thermal radiation energies involved start at a dental X-Ray and go up if you want to have a livelier reaction rate. At these frequencies, we only know how to reflect X-Ray at very shallow angles. To prevent energy losses, you need to send that heat back in or run the reaction so fast there is no time for reactants to cool. Since nothing can reflect the radiated heat back in, the only way to avoid losses over time is to have you reactor be really big. Id est, the Sun. Your other options is running the reaction really fast, either in a continuous beam in a toroidal reactor or in spikes using either ablative or magnetic compression. All three of these have to work with fairly rarified plasma to function, so getting high mass flow rates simply isn\u0027t an option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a secret third option.
