Even if we don\u0027t run environmental risks, and even if we aren\u0027t risking running out of fossil fuels any time soon, which with development of hydraulic fracturing seems more likely now, we still can\u0027t rely on fossil fuels indefinitely. Most of our technology is energy-density limited, and energy density of gasoline is fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that fear mongering can be used to harm the oil industry directly. If we develop better energy sources and oil industry dies, good riddance. But if we start suffocating it now artificially, we are suffocating entire economy, doing loads of damage to the technology sector, and that\u0027s where almost all of our money for research is coming from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is simple strategy. Like it or not, we are relying on oil too much right now to do absolutely anything without it. If we give up burning hydrocarbons, most of the world\u0027s population will simply starve to death because we cannot sustain agriculture without this input. If this damages the environment, well, that\u0027s too bad, but we simply can\u0027t stop it. What we can do is try to get past this phase of oil dependence, and the best way to do this is to have as much money diverted to research as possible, which requires a strong, healthy economy. If stimulating economy means relaxing some of the restraints and producing more CO2 emissions in the short term, I say it\u0027s worth the risk. Fossil fuels are pretty much the only shot our civilization has of making a leap from agricultural society to a true post-industrial, and if we screw this up, the next opportunity will be millions of years from now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZetaX","CreatedById":60692,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-23T19:24:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere is definitely no way in hell we\u0027ll manage to do irreversible damage in a decade, so lets just wait.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIrreversible\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BF No almost definitely not.

But just continuing and even increasing the output until we know every detail sounds naive to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe potential costs, not even counting possible deaths, just money, are quite high. Regarding the actual costs when not knowing any more details we should work with the expected value. Thus if we assign climate change a chance of 20% to actually being aviodable/reducable by us strongly reducing emissions, we have to half those potential costs/the potential savings. And I expect those then still to be well over a trillion dollars. So the question can also be put as this: is the expected value of the costs of climate change lower or higher than the expected value of this or that countermeasure. And I am confident that at least for the cheaper ones (e.g. fuel efficient cars, more non-carbon-based power plants [well, I also see some cost problems with nuclear ones in the very long, so this would at least be tricky]) this is true.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sternface","CreatedById":83299,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-23T20:27:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mdatspace\u0022 data-cite=\u0022mdatspace\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E@Stern You paragraph goes the exact same for the opposition.\u003Cp\u003EThe green movement has become one with the democrats, and their opposition has become one with the republicans.
