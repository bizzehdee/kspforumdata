Another reason was to grab land before other countries would get their hands on them. The colonial effort was usually initiated by governments or government-controlled companies for two main reasons: greed and power. And the whole thing fired back when those colonies went independant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big difference is that in those days, you could sail for a few weeks and live off the land when you arrived there. You had air, water, construction material, and a temperate climate. You could grow food locally, build a farm, and rely on trade routes. You didn\u0027t have to rely on supplies or technology for long-term survival. And even then, it was tough. If Mars One wasn\u0027t a scam, with today\u0027s life-support technology and no assured supply lines, it would be more likely to end like the Roanoke Island colony in 1587.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny space colony would have to be massive in order to be self-sufficient. It would need farmers, miners, doctors, children, cooks, teachers, janitors, engineers. It would require hundreds of inhabitants just to have the minimum skillset for survival of the group.

Based on the presentations I watched and the information at my disposal at the time, there was no definite way of determining if MarsOne was a scam or not. In my opinion, there still isn\u0027t. Since there was no clearcut way of determining the scam-level of the company, there existed two possibilities for them, and two for me. Again, since nothing I can do would change that system, it made sense to buy in. Absolute worst case, I lost $40 and 10 minutes. Why should I care? It is less of a risk than kickstarter for a reward that I win either way (I get there or I don\u0027t, but either way I still have the happy feeling of knowing I did what I could).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe information I had stated that the way they intended to reduce costs was that they (for the most part) were NOT going to be developing anything. Their plan was (and to my knowledge, still is) buy things from people that are footing the dev cost themselves. For example, using the Falcon Heavy. They only need to pay the $50-100M cost of its use YEARS from now instead of the billions for dev costs. Considering the Falcon Heavy won\u0027t be launching any tests until August (unless that has changed since last I heard), you can\u0027t use the lack of any purchased launch vehicles against them. They have the option of going \u0027now\u0027 and paying the United Launch Alliance a billion dollars for the launch or they can wait a couple years and pay SpaceX a tenth or better what they would pay the ULA. Depending on exactly what they are doing with the rovers, its possible the same logic applies, they may still be in the discussion stage for exactly what they want the rovers to do (just be an examination bot like Curiosity for landing site judging? Or perhaps it is a construction bot?). These things take TIME in the real world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy job is a Systems Engineer, and for important systems the process involved in just choosing a color for an LED indicator takes several meetings, trade studies, and research power points. And that is just for an indicator light! Not something that actually does anything at all, no computation, no movement, etc. That may sound absurd, and to a point it is, but this is how a system gets made where everything is thought of, because almost literally every person on the project got to have a say in every aspect of the project. One person can make a massive mistake (ignoring red green colorblindness), one hundred people has a good chance of catching even the slightest of problems (at just the right orbit above mars, with the right orientation of the craft and the solar panel arrays, some light will bounce off the solar panels and shine through the window to land on the console, making it impossible to see that a warning light has started glowing the specific amber color you chose). And at ANY stage you can be forced to go back and start over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, it doesn\u0027t make much sense to purchase a crew cap or the transit stage craft until such a time as you actually know what your desired launch system can actually do. On that note, their plan for the transit stage was to basically pay one of the major contractors that had produced habitat modules for the ISS to build a near carbon copy of their module, just with redone internals to more suit their needs. The development costs are almost zero, they just need the tooling costs, labor, and materials for the most part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fact that they are waiting means they are not actually idiots. They are waiting to see if technologies that can drastically reduce the cost will pan out this year. During that time they continue to go through the selection process for their astronauts. This gives them plenty of time to make sure they make the \u0027right\u0027 decisions (clearly they have already failed though, as they booted me \u0026gt;\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E ) and to begin the training. From the information I have come across, they are doing tasks exactly as they said they were (with a little slippage in the time frame, but they made their schedule during the hope filled early years, so I don\u0027t blame them) and in an order that makes sense for what it is they can do with the money they currently have.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-16T16:00:08Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2014 04:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Mazon Del\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EClarification\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"78stonewobble","CreatedById":97559,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-16T17:14:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nibb31\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nibb31\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes, but we don\u0027t have the technology to assure that we can keep a colony alive.\u003Cp\u003EAlso folks, what is the point of a colony?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the past, colonies were created where there were resources (gold, spice, slaves, exotic produce, etc...) that would increase the wealth of the colonizing nation. Another reason was to grab land before other countries would get their hands on them. The colonial effort was usually initiated by governments or government-controlled companies for two main reasons: greed and power. And the whole thing fired back when those colonies went independant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big difference is that in those days, you could sail for a few weeks and live off the land when you arrived there. You had air, water, construction material, and a temperate climate. You could grow food locally, build a farm, and rely on trade routes. You didn\u0027t have to rely on supplies or technology for long-term survival. And even then, it was tough. If Mars One wasn\u0027t a scam, with today\u0027s life-support technology and no assured supply lines, it would be more likely to end like the Roanoke Island colony in 1587.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny space colony would have to be massive in order to be self-sufficient. It would need farmers, miners, doctors, children, cooks, teachers, janitors, engineers. It would require hundreds of inhabitants just to have the minimum skillset for survival of the group. This means that it would need hundreds of interplanetary launches to bring the equipment, supplies and people. It is simply beyond any short or medium term capabilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, why would a government or a corporation invest hundreds of billions to build a colony on Mars or the Moon when:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ea\u003C/em\u003E - There are no useful resources that would increase anyone\u0027s wealth back home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eb\u003C/em\u003E - There is no possibility of a land grab, firstly because of \u003Cem\u003Ea\u003C/em\u003E and secondly because of the Outer Space Treaty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ec\u003C/em\u003E - Any self-sufficient colony would be hard to control, which increases the risk of losing it to independance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the colonists, just like all migrants since the dawn of humanity, they moved there to seek wealth, comfort, and a better future for their children.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMars on the other hand is a sterile wasteland, bombarded with cosmic radiation, where you can only go outside with a 50kg EVA suit.
