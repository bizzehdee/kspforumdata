Lets say we had a ship with 1000 x 1000 meters of panel and ignored the weight of the panel. The ship could generate 1500 newton. 15km (earth debiotizing) diameter impactor has a mass of 4/3 pi 7500^3 times d (say 3) = 5.3E12 mass. At 1500 newtons accelartion would be 3E-9 meters/second or 3E-10g. The issue of moving to intercept the asteroid itself is a problem. 1000000 meters of panel has to way many kilotons, the dV of the entry would have to be tiny to gain orbit, it might take years to arrive that that speed and approach, and then landing on the asteroid is a whole different problem. One 1 meter/second of thrust would take how long? 100 years. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiverting objects from crossing earth\u0027s orbit is easier than making them hit the earth. First you have to find an object of size, some of then have high energy differences and planes that do no cross the earths, you would have to match planes and then cross orbits. If you\u0027re acceleration is too slow there is a good chance you will send the asteroid on a hyperbolic trajectory with earths upper atmosphere (drag would be immaterial) or on an escape orbit or collision orbit with some other body (like Jupiter). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EION drives are far more dangerous, because in theory the ion drive potential is to create particles with the energy of a baseball from a single hydrogen atom. THis is unrealistic but particles with 2 x mass gain and ISPs in the 100,000s or 1,000,000s are conceivable. For very heavy payloads that include a nuclear power supply this might be very useful.
