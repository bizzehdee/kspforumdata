It is like I am dressing my face up as a salad. Now, the experience is great, and the smell is nice, so certainly there could be some psychological benefit in here. But as a scientifically minded person, I have to ask myself - how do they even work scientifically?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe skin certainly doesn\u0027t have anyway to absorb nutritions (that is what our digestive system is for), so it is pointless to call them \u0022skin food\u0022, and yet that is how a lot of the stuff on the market is advertised, to the point that we have collagen face masks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those who do not know: 1. Collagen is just a protein in animal skin that gives them elasticity. 2. It cannot be absorb to the body as is in anyway - it is broken down to amino acids in the digestive system, and does nothing but cover your face as face mask 3. Collagen films are what they use as sausage casing now instead of intestine. Using collagen face mask is like cover your face in sausage casings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So how do they work? Finding actual scientific information and journals about effects of beauty products are so difficult, despite them being a massive industry with millions of products on the market...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI assume that the idea of face mask is to cleanse the face of dirt and oil, and replace the natural oil of the skin after it was washed away, but what does those things and what does not? I hope I am not the only one on this forum who is interested in beauty products and science at the same time...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SomeGuy12","CreatedById":103022,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-11T14:53:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy would you think they work?

Excepting the orifices (nose, mouth, eye socket, etc), it\u0027s also pretty much airtight. The pores on the skin are actually just small pits, and they don\u0027t go very far in either.

These chemicals are only effective if they are picked right off the plant and used immediately, otherwise their potency decays rapidly. The chemicals are designed to protect the plant in case it sustains injury. The acid itself increases the rate of oxidation (10 fold for every unit drop in pH). These chemicals perform the same function as adding peroxides to the skin of folks with acne. The bacteria themselves are the result of bad-diets and poor habits. Eat fresh locally grown veggies, more fish, less beef and no lot fed animals. Avoid restaurant foods, chocolate, nuts (unless very fresh), Fried foods.

But, by far the most common thing that cosmetics do is, either:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea) leave a thin oily residue, which acts as a water barrier, keeping your skin from losing as much moisture as it normally would, thus, while they still recieve the same exposure to moisture from underneath, but you are reducing the amount that leaves on the surface, your skin becomes slightly swollen (or \u0022MOISTURISED\u0022) which will flatten out wrinkles and leave it feeling a little smoother and softer.

This can have the effect of drawing water out of the skin, or it can have the effect of adding salts into the tissues - this may then have a knock-on effect of making the tissue more amenable to absorbing moisture from elsewhere, possibly a second skin cream or other product.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically the biggest effect they rely on is water control one way or the other. Claims that there is some other fancy substance in there that is doing something else are possible, and they do have to substantiate those claims, but it doesn\u0027t have to be much to let them put it on the box.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExactly the same goes for your whacky vegetable casserole facemasks, on a very basic level, your soaking your face in something watery, inevitably, this is going to have a moisturising effect, that will make your face feel all nice.
