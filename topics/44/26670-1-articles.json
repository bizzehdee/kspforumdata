In a few years it\u0027s going to stop sending information back though. I can\u0027t help but wonder if it might be a good idea to send something out of the solar system a lot faster. Put it on a much bigger rocket and get it going at several times the velocity with a longer lifespan for communication.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBear in mind I am no proffessional so I know some things I\u0027m saying might sound stupid to those more educated in the matter of space, but I wonder what we might be able to do if we made a probe like this. We could find out more about interstellar space and things like the oort cloud (though I\u0027m sure that would take many years).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat of it?
