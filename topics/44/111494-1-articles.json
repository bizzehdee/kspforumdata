Even though it was never used for once-around, it proved very handy indeed - here\u0027s a [PDF from NASA](http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/reference/green/entare.pdf) showing the crossrange use for every flight through STS-88 in 1998.

In particular, the \u0022tiny wing\u0022 version you cite was on the very of being abandoned for two main reasons; First, it\u0027s low density made it very, very sensitive to cross winds.

Thanks.\n\nThe DC3 would\u0027ve had some cross-range capability - not as good as the STS, but certainly better than the capsules. \n\nIt was as close to an \u0022official\u0022 concept as you can get at that point in history - it was Max Faget\u0027s personal design - and he was pretty much the king of design decisions at NASA prior to the shuttle project."},{"CreatedByName":"Mazon Del","CreatedById":32991,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T15:11:02Z","Content":"\u0022This isn\u0027t a plane, it\u0027s a flying brick on approach.\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"Ten Key","CreatedById":123319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T18:47:05Z","Content":"It certainly is a beautiful machine. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/8akgPBjkL-Y?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T02:16:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E In short, if at first you don\u0027t succeed, landing Space Shuttles is not for you.\n\nThe same applies to all other glider craft ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jonboy","CreatedById":134111,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T04:12:52Z","Content":"All my shuttle replicas in 1.02 also require a pretty step decent, with a final pitch up to kill speed.

A normal craft will to between 1:15 and 1:35-ish, with gliders going all the way up to 1:60 nowadays. A Cessna is hardly a fair comparison, because those too are knows as bricks with wings. Even a 747, with four huge engines messing up your aerodynamics, will do 1:17 or something close to that.

A lot of general aviation and airliners (clean, cruise) fall near there. I can believe 15:1 for high-performance aircraft, but I\u0027ve never seen anything close to 35:1 that isn\u0027t built to be a glider. In fact, just a few decades ago, that would have been considered a high quality sailplane. Of course, now with all the fancy materials, they\u0027re doing better than 70:1.
