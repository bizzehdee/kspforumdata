The teacher posted the solution to the question online, but it left me unclear as to what his intent was. The question was as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA traditional watch hand has a second hand 1.45 cm long from centre to tip. What is the magnitude of the average acceleration between 30 s and 50 s?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn class, we had only briefly covered circular motion, but I remembered the equation we\u0027d used: \u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/tuGx47n.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tuGx47n.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the motion of the hand is constant the acceleration should be constant as well. To be safe, I tried the equation twice, once over the 20 s interval and 1/3 the circumference, and once over the whole 60 s. Both times I got an answer of 1.6*10^-4 m/s^2. However, when I received the marked test back, I had been given 1.5/8 with the note \u0022not reasonable\u0022. I know I lost 1/2 a mark on my diagram; I\u0027ll admit it was a lousy one. The other mark I did get was for my final answer, since, while different, it complied with notation and significant digits. Several days later he posted his solution on his website:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nOO3zwY.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nOO3zwY.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Qm63cbO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Qm63cbO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat was wrong with my method? Every circular question we\u0027d done previously had worked with the equation I used. I considered that perhaps my solution was for \u003Cem\u003Einstantaneous\u003C/em\u003E acceleration rather than average, but for an object with constant speed shouldn\u0027t those two be identical? Can anyone see where I went wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Wo9NKX4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Wo9NKX4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"N_las","CreatedById":31280,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T23:50:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour Formula calculates the magnitude of the instantaneous acceleration, but it ignores the direction of it completely. You are right, that instantaneous and average acceleration of an object with constant velocity shoud be identical, but the watch hand doesn\u0027t have a constant velocity, since it changes direction all the time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example: the average acceleration of the clock hand during 60 seconds is zero. Because after 60 seconds, the clock hand has exactly the same velocity (magnitude and direction) as at the beginning, so in 60 seconds there was no change in velocity. That means zero average acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn your Problem: You have to calculate the velocity of the clock hand at 30 seconds as vector, because the direction is important. Then you have to calculate the velocity at 50 seconds as vector. Now you substract the 50s-vector from the 30s-vector, to get the vector of the change in velocity. If you divide this vector by 20 seconds you get the vector of the average acceleration. Since the magnitude is wanted, you then have to calculate the magnitude of this vector.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Extemporary","CreatedById":20795,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-01T00:24:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, I understand where the confusion came from. In the lesson on circular motion we never distinguished between average and instantaneous acceleration. We only did three problems where we found the circular acceleration, and they all used the formula I tried. He even specifically said that for these questions we would only need the magnitude. When I saw the question, I saw circular motion and a magnitude-only response, and assumed it was the stuff we did in class. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Death by Reentry","CreatedById":107247,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-01T04:39:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could always print off your teachers solution mark the mistakes and hand it back to him/her with a 3 out of 8.
