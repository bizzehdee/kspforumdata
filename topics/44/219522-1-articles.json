From my gajillion hours flying ww2 combat sims, I actually prefer the F4F-3 to the folding-wing -4, because the -3 has about the same ammo load, but only 4 guns (the later Eastern built (the aircraft name for General Motors) Wildcats were also 4 guns)\u2014leaving it with substantially more firing time. On the -4 I actually don\u0027t use the outer 2 guns and save them just in case I go Winchester on the other 4. Sims are not real life, obviously, but the accounts of battles (Lundstrom is awesome), do show the incredible advantage of survivability.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EI actually think from a doctrinal POV, the IJN had it exactly wrong given the highly selective and rigorous nature of their pilot training (Sakai\u0027s book, \u003Cem\u003ESamurai!\u003C/em\u003E, among others details this). They worked hard to create \u003Cem\u003Efantastic\u003C/em\u003E pilots, then put them in an aircraft absolutely focused on \u0022offensive\u0022 capability to a fault. They rejected so many candidates, their stable of up and coming pilots was not high enough to meet the demands of a total war. In combat units, their radios were sort of marginal, so many pilots removed them to save weight\u2014for more maneuverability! Pilot armor? LOL\u2014heavy! Self-sealing gas tanks? Those are also \u003Cem\u003Eheavy!\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0 Many pilots also elected not to take the parachutes they were issued. The next result was great, but completely irreplaceable pilots. As fresh pilots came to the front, this was exacerbated, because the vets had the early war combat experience when they dominated to fall back on, but the new guys had to learn on the job, where literally any mistake was often deadly. The USN (USMC/USAAF as well) had by Japanese measures, an effectively endless stream of new pilots\u2014\u0022good enough\u0022 as the training was not nearly as selective. These good enough pilots could improve in combat because they could actually make mistakes and still get home\u2014then learn from those mistakes.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good judgment comes from experience; experience comes from bad judgment\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHard to get the former when bad judgement is fatal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe US could have afforded (in terms of pilots) to make an especially capable, but more vulnerable aircraft\u2014the Japanese really didn\u0027t have that luxury, IMHO.

It was like 2/3 the ROC of the Zero. So 1 v 1, in an even fight, if the Zero doesn\u0027t control the fight he\u0027s doing something wrong. Course fights are never even in the real world\u2014generally if they are even you\u0027ve already done something wrong. The Japanese fighter aircraft at the start of the war (IJN, and IJA) did so very well not because their planes were better, and not always just because they had veteran pilots (experience in China), but because they were, as is said, \u0022the firstest with the mostest.\u0022 If you\u0027re the RAF in Burma, and 50 aircraft come sweeping over your airfield as you try to get airborne with 6 fighters\u2014you\u0027re going to have a Bad Time\u2122.
