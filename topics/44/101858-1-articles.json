This debate started in another thread, and has, unfortunately, somewhat derailed it. So, I\u0027m starting the thread so the debate has a home to live in where it won\u0027t wreck other threads.\n\nNow, Yuri Koptev has said that the entire Mir program cost 4.2 billion dollars. (Link to web archive of NY Times article with his statement [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20141027231301/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/24/science/24MIR.html).) This seems somewhat incongruous with the ISS\u0027s price tag of 150 billion dollars. (Multiple different sites make this claim, although I can\u0027t seem to find a primary source stating the ISS\u0027s cost.)\n\nIs Koptev\u0027s statement accurate? If so what are some possible reasons for the low cost of Mir? Is the ISS\u0027s cost being inflated? More importantly, which one is an accurate indicator of the cost of future modular stations?"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T03:57:07Z","Content":"Skylab wasn\u0027t modular.

It had a similar mass and habitable volume to Mir, as well as crew number...\n\nCome to think of it, the core of Mir was basically an advanced Salyut, correct?

We may need an adapted Delta IV. That\u0027s not all bad, but DIVs can be up to twice the price of an Atlas V.\n\nEDIT 2: Using a modified Unity Node with life support and essentially a Canadarm, it could be done. It has a similar habitable volume as the core of Mir, and with modifications it could have life support, power, and plenty of other stuff. Plus, it already has quite a lot of berthing ports, and using other modules that are similar to the adapted Unity Node (AUN?), minus the birthing ports on some sides, we could have quite an \u0022FGB\u0022. But it would need to be extended, with life support and the ability to unload cargo from a cargo vehicle.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-13T06:03:33Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2015 06:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Bill Phil**"},{"CreatedByName":"GreenWolf","CreatedById":65798,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T06:01:46Z","Content":"Well, the ATV is already set up to allow for a rear docking port.

Most of our existing ISS modules are based off of the MPLM in one way or another, which makes sense when you realize the MPLM was designed to fit in the Shuttle\u0027s cargo bay. But anything we build in the future will probably be descended from the MPLM as well.\n\nEdit in response to your second edit: A modified Unity node would work great as a core. If we setup some kind of automated docking system like the Russians have, we might not even need the Canadarm. An arm might be useful for unloading cargo, but something like the Strela cranes could be used instead. For the cargo block, we have a lot of options.

Now to throw in my two cents.\n\nStation programs, especially the ones that keep on going for a long length of time like ISS, are dominated by mostly two things, logistics and operations costs. \n\nOperations costs, like Nibb says, are basically keeping the small horde of managers and engineers that support ISS operations fed and clothed, and driving nice cars and the like. This is not often spoken of, but I gather there are huge inefficiencies here in the ISS program due to its multinational nature. Not to mention that due to its scientific purpose and the fact that it\u0027s still one of the firsts stations ever built, it is reasonable to expect it being inherently more expensive than any follow-on that benefits from the experience of this program. For example, a hypothetical \u0022commercial\u0022 successor to the ISS could use a single ground control center with fewer, more efficiently distributed managerial personnel, get communication coverage through satellite links instead of costly to maintain ground stations, and keep in the payroll a much smaller engineering department if it used hardware with a significant heritage.\n\nThe second big ticket expenditure are the logistics of the thing: resupply and crew rotations, basically. There you have much more rocket launches than for the construction part (if your program is successful, at least), and a big unit price on the rockets will quickly be felt in the bottom line (shuttle, I\u0027m looking at you). There, too, we can expect a big decrease from the ISS figure in future stations, perhaps an even more dramatic one, mostly because the new rockets are not only going to be much cheaper than shuttle, we can also expect them to be cheaper than traditional rockets, now that we are moving away form cold war designs with an eventual promise of at least partial (useful) reusability.\n\nRune. Reusing SRBs doesn\u0027t count as reusability in my book."}]}
