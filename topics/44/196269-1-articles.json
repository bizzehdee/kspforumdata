Platinum and other platinum group metals\u00A0are extremely useful catalysts for many industrial processes, but are too expensive for widespread use. For instance, much research has gone into reducing the amount of platinum needed for fuel cells.

Some industries need high G-force, and now we make use of centrifugal force. That could reach 10000\u002BGs in most normal machines(that, common university labs use), given that you just put in a small amount of material. Well, Jupiter surface(I mean the surface that we measure Jupiter\u2019s radius with)\u00A0g is not that high, but some manufacturers may benefit from that.

There\u2019s actually not much difference, between going to Saturn from Earth, and today\u2019s going to US from China(by plane, not ship). So, the solar system is a whole, but industries would probably have changed a lot, if they still exist. So, just consider Nike putting its factories in\u00A0India, and we should be able to better understand what space of that time is about. IMO, nowadays is like when humans were first exiting Africa to spread over continents, the near future is when Ancient Greece, Mesopotamia, Egypt, India, China, Maya, Inca and the like first formed. I mean, why go back to the Earth when you have Mars, Deimos and Phobos? There will be some connections between planets but few, at least we do know we aren\u2019t alone in the solar system. (That is, if we weren\u2019t to forget all about it.)\u00A0While the far future, the whole solar system could be linked pretty like how the Earth is liked together now. For the limit of light speed... No offense to the greatest modern scientists but, just a couple of centuries ago, people believed that trains can\u2019t go faster than 200 km/h, or passengers would die of a lack of breathe-able air. According to the most avant-garde scientific calculations, of that time. Even now, there seem to be some beliefs against scientific terms. I don\u2019t mean religion, that is a different thing.
