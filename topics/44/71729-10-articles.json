The triangle trajectories were used to obtain a comprehensive, multi-angle surface map of the constantly rotating comet nucleus and to perform some scientific experiments. They also wanted to make really sure that nothing would endanger the spacecraft in close proximity, so they kept creeping closer and closer only very slowly, with lots of small manual adjustments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, other gravity sources will interfere with Rosetta\u0027s orbit, making stationkeeping maneuvers necessary. This is true for all orbits in an N-body environment. Even spacecraft in lunar orbit for example must regularly make correction burns to stay where they want to be.
