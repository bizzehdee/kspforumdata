I\u0027m by no means an expert on the subject, but I was wondering how accurate KSP is?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, when designing a spaceplane, I would choose to place the wings above the center of gravity to increase stability. I would also choose to place the center of lift about 1/3 away from the leading edge of the wings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe list of design guidelines for aircraft and spacecraft is very long, so my general question is: How accurate are the dynamics in KSP? What (if any) phenomena are known to not be in the game?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-RanZ-","CreatedById":51892,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T19:25:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Enot at all, KSP\u0027s plane dynamics are in no way realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hobobot","CreatedById":68560,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T19:34:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERegarding that, I\u0027ve noticed some huge problems with the SAS stuff.
