On earth we need to burn fuels, complex power plants, we cant just aim a mirror at the sun and get continues heat and power 24/7.

The argument that for what the asteroid colony can\u0027t make right way they can trade for in what they can mine, which can\u0027t be done on Venus without having to get things off of Venus.
