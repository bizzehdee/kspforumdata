Everyone, even the smartest people in the world, are wrong about many of the things they think. That\u0027s why we form a consensus. That\u0027s why PEER REVIEW is CRITICAL. Whenever some person or group reports a result that contradicts the consensus and years of research and experimentation, no one believes them, and other scientists will try to disprove the contradictory findings. This kind of thing happens all the time in science, and findings that appear to fly in the face of scientific consensus and research are almost always shown to be some kind of experimental or analysis error.
