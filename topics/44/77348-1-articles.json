It\u0027s mechanically simpler, but the engine control computer has to be more sophisticated to avoid a \u0022hard start\u0022. A \u0022hard start\u0022 is basically when an engine\u0027s ignition system functions \u0022late\u0022, allowing too much fuel/ox mixture to build up in the combustion chamber. That can cause the combustion chamber to explode, which is obviously A Bad Thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor Al/Lox hybrid rockets, I imagine that a small amount of LH2 could be carried to supply a torch ignition system similar to the J-2\u0027s Augmented Spark Igniter. The same idea would probably work for other propellant combinations as well. Basic idea is to add small bottles of hydrogen/oxygen (probably supercritical instead of liquid) for the ignition system to use, probably located next to the (typically helium or nitrogen) tank pressurization bottles, and put a small spark-started H2-Ox burner in the combustion chamber. The H2-Ox burner would only need to be active during engine start, once the engine is running it could be turned off to conserve H2-Ox.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it sounds a bit complicated, that\u0027s because it is complicated.

There\u0027s no reason for the propulsion system to be connected to the crew section by anything but structural elements. Indeed, there are many reasons for it not to be. Literally the only reason for the fuel lines to go on the crew compartment would be if you\u0027re using N2O or LOX and want to link the propulsion with your life support. In the former case, you can break down N2O into oxygen and nitrogen for an emergency air supply, in the latter case you can pipe the boiloff gas into life support tanks. Those two aren\u0027t actually that bad, as far as the fuels go. Pure oxygen is a fire hazard, but it\u0027s not too bad if there isn\u0027t too much of it.

However, given that the pressure inside the cabin is higher than the pressure outside, a leak will never result in the fuel coming in. You don\u0027t have the fuel tank right next to the pressurized compartment; most of the craft is unpressurized, and there\u0027s pretty much going to be hard vacuum in between the fuel tank and cabin.

Because of their modest delta-V requirements, in addition to being expendable, the use of hypergolics were deemed appropriate.
