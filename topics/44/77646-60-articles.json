If those of us that do start collecting models of the various components that we plan to use. We can start to make rough mockups of different designs starting with off the shelf. We can then stick them together listing total component cost/mass. Complexity and compatibility will be assessed by peer review.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Forgot to add /mass\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have solidworks experience. I have been somewhat hoping that someone would find and post a link to design drawings for the frame and whatnot in a 1U cubesat. I am reasonably certain it is best that we go this route rather than a custom frame. The custom frame is going to have to sit inside the cube-launcher anyway, so its going to resemble it for the most part. If we have some other shape, chances are we will need to make a new launcher and that dramatically increases the cost and decreases the chances of this happening.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"henryrasia","CreatedById":45695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-04T16:42:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh... my... god...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://cubesatbrasilia.akamido.com/MzQ0NA==/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECheck this out!\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s right here in my city!

All the high resolution cameras I have looked into will take 1/4 to 1/3 of the satellite. So that should be a last item selected as something to fill a void that was not needed for mission critical components. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea of using a lens system on the experiment to use a regular camera. Tho in practice this may not work (no experience in optics). This will also bring its own problems. A rotating camera will take significantly more space then a fixed. Given our current list of cameras this will not work. Years ago I worked for a security company that specialized in surveillance. We had some 480p cameras that were about 25mm x 25mm x 15mm. These looked a lot like the cameras in the photos above of ArduSat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thought I had was to use a microscope attached to a hinge and a solenoid allowing positioning over 2 experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I have uploaded all the files I have downloaded regarding cubesats to the dataserver.
