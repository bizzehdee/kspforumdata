I\u0027m not sure if full fledged adoption would affect students more before or after high school. My guess would be before since they may still be struggling to grasp basic concepts in those phases.\n\nAnyway, I went and did some googling about the subject matter. If I am to believe this:\n\n[http://science.howstuffworks.com/why-us-not-on-metric-system.htm](http://science.howstuffworks.com/why-us-not-on-metric-system.htm)\n\nthen the history of this issue is a lot more complex than I realized. 370 million dollars to convert the space shuttle fully to metric? Wow. And apparently it\u0027s a matter of congress mandating it rather than having it just be voluntary.

Many older aircraft, experimental, and some LSA\u0027s use statute miles for airspeed. Everyone else uses nautical miles for airspeed and modern electronic flight bag programs like foreflight give distances in nautical miles. Visibility is statute miles though, never understood why. \n\nBeyond that, I might need to explain myself a little better. I have my bachelors in aerospace engineering, and throughout college received the experience of doing the same math with both metric and imperial units on a regular basis. This is because the aerospace industry is split between metric and standard. Metric conversion factors are always a power of 10, but somewhat difficult to remember exactly what. Also, Metric units are almost always too small or large to be truly useful and you end up living the life of scientific notation. Imperial units have wacky conversion factors that while more difficult to learn tend to stand out. For the size of imperial units, odds are someone created a unit that fits the need making numbers that are easily represented without scientific notation. \n\nWhile I am not against converting to the metric system, I find it highly overrated and not worth the effort."},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T23:20:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thankfully for science, you\u0027re right ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E Back on topic: As an \u0022outsider\u0022 (Norwegian) looking in, it shouldn\u0027t matter which one you use, metric or imperial, in your daily life.
