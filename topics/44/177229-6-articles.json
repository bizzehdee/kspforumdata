Like Green Baron said on page 1, the soil is poisonous, there\u0027s nothing to eat, drink, or breathe, and on top of those things, there is none of the ozone that protects us here on Earth. All things the same, wouldn\u0027t it be safer to build space stations in orbit? That would mean no fuel needed for landing/takeoff, no landing legs, no parachutes, no sanitation rooms, etc. And, we could make our own gravity \u003Cem\u003Ea la\u003C/em\u003E 2001. Not to mention that there would basically be no size restraint. I think the only hazard that we would be more likely to encounter in orbit as opposed to the surface would be micrometeorites, but we already have experience with that. Given enough time, we could even add radiation shielding (or even create some from dirt brought up from below)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMars is not just \u003Cem\u003E\u0022That rock\u0022. \u003C/em\u003EAside from the Moon, it\u0027d be an excellent stepping stone out to the rest of the solar system. A lot of people here are advocates for space habitats, but I think the public will likely react better to boots on the ground instead. At least at first. (And publicity may be one important factor in the early days of space colonization. Look at how interconnected we are today, and how public perception can spread). It also has a load of raw resources and plenty of water ice, perfect for developing another industrial civilization without relying on resources from Earth after a while.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s also plenty of research opportunities. Right now, we\u0027re limited by how much we can send to Mars to study it. If we have people and manufacturing capabilities on Mars, we could build what we need and want on site, without worrying about time, or distance. We also wouldn\u0027t be limited by size, so we could get some large-scale scientific operations going. We haven\u0027t been able to get a deep in-depth look under the surface yet for example.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlenty of people want to live on Mars. The Mars-One project (Which, for the moment, let\u0027s ignore the feasibility), had over 200,000 people signing up. That\u0027s pretty significant regardless of your views on the project itself. And SpaceX\u0027s BFR is supposed to be economical enough to allow anyone willing to save up to go. To the point it\u0027ll cost the same of a moderately sized house, or luxury car (And since it\u0027d be to colonize, you wouldn\u0027t need anything on Earth anymore, so you can sell it). That would open Mars up to millions of people. Not all will go, but \u003Cem\u003Eenough \u003C/em\u003Ewould want to. It may not actually reach that low of a price, but it should be low enough many will have the option open to them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for radiation, you could create bricks out of the Martian regolith to protect you from it. And put your water in the walls between you and the outer hull for even more protection. After a while, you could even add a magnetic field generator powered by solar panels to provide even more protection on top of that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd because Mars was much more habitable in the past, we may be able to bring that back eventually. Mars is the perfect place to make more Earthlike (Venus would probably be better due to its size, but it\u0027s a lot harder to reduce an atmosphere and lower the temperature), so colonizing would give us the incentive to terraform it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a profit to be made? Maybe, but probably not a permanent one. Is it worth it when we have all these other issues on Earth? A lot would say no, but the amount actually being spent would be smaller than what\u0027s spent already on dealing with those issues. So there\u0027s nothing saying we can\u0027t get both at once, or that we have to prioritize it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-14T08:08:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223433376\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022177229\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221534197807\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002299243\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MDZhB\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, MDZhB said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe soil is poisonous\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf vaporize the Earth ocean, the residual ground will be poisonous, too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf pour on Mars a lot of water and solve all its chlorine compounds, we\u0027ll probably get something like salty oceanic water like on the Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf there will be too much water for\u00A0Mars. we can pour the excessive salty water from Mars to, say, terraformed Venus, which lacks its own water.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAdding even more water from icy moons and comets/asteroids.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, if teleportally connect all planets into a RAID array with shared volume, we\u0027ll get same air and ocean composition everywhere and same air pressure.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThough a little different temperature.(like we already have on Earth) because Venus and Mercury will be still closer to the Sun than Pluto.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-08-14T08:09:20Z\u0022 title=\u002208/14/2018 08:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 14, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by kerbiloid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-14T08:09:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMars is a deadly place that is impossible to \u003Cs\u003Eterraform\u003C/s\u003E receive enough CO2 for an atmosphere with enough pressure to rise temperature above water freezing.

In the late 19th century, astronomer Giovanni Schiapparelli\u00A0observed what appeared to be water channels on Mars (Probably the Valles Marineris). When his writings were translated into English, the Italian word \u0022canali\u0022 was misleadingly translated as \u0022canals\u0022. For decades afterwards, it was widely believed that these had been built by intelligent aliens. Predictably, Martians featured in a large amount of\u00A0Science Fictionof the first half of the 20th century. However, when\u00A0NASA\u0027s Mariner 4 probe flew past Mars in 1965, it was conclusively shown that the canals didn\u0027t actually exist. When the Viking probes landed (the Soviets got there first\u00A0with Mars 3, but the lander was taken out by a dust storm 14.5 seconds after landing), the planet was shown to be lifeless, and the concept of Martians quickly became discredited. More recent observations suggest that Mars may have supported life in the distant past, and some people still cling to hope that life may reside underground, no matter how unlikely it is. However, the red planet has had such a hold on human imagination for so long that it is not going to be lost as a setting any time soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nMars regained its prominence in human imagination in 1976 when the\u00A0Viking 1\u00A0probe reached the planet; equipped with more advanced technology, it was able to take a number of impressively high resolution photographs.\u00A0One of these showed\u00A0what appears to be a human face. Though quickly debunked by every legitimate authority, it has taken its place alongside the Nazca lines and the Pyramids of Giza in conspiracy lore \u2014 especially as one of the photographs from the mission\u00A0has yet to be declassified. Fictional representations of Mars were changed as well; no longer a destination, but a stepping-stone to greater glories in the form of ancient ruins filled with\u00A0Lost Technology, waiting for humanity to discover it and thereby leapfrog into the stars. One way or another, that\u00A0particular argument will remain unsettled\u00A0until\u00A0people actually go there unregulated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nMore modern stories tend to have Mars\u00A0being colonized, either as a plot point or part of the Back Story. This isn\u0027t an unlikely scenario in real life; it has more of the basic elements needed for life than any other non-Earth world in the solar system and it\u0027s quite similar to Earth in several aspects, including day length (24h 39m 35.244s), temperature (-2 to -87 \u00B0C, chilly, but overlaps a fair amount with Earth, albeit the coldest parts of Earth), and an atmosphere (although Martian \u0022air\u0022 is mostly carbon dioxide and averages about 1/100th of the Earth\u0027s pressure). It\u0027s also our neighbor along with\u00A0Venus\u00A0(which we have yet to keep a probe functioning on for\u00A0more than a few minutes). For these reasons, Mars is the planet that is most frequently subject to\u00A0Terraforming. Strangely, regardless of how otherwise Earth-like it may be, Mars tends to retain its distinct red soil. The weak gravity and thin atmosphere also means that dust storms go\u00A0crazy on Mars. Every so often, a gigantic dust storm\u00A0will cover the entire planet\u00A0in a thick cloud of particles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nBecause the Martian day is almost, but not quite, the same length as Earth\u0027s day, NASA scientists working on Mars missions reckon the local time there by \u0022sols\u0022 (Martial\u00A0solar days). There\u0027s no special name for the Martian year, however. Despite its many Earthlike qualities, Mars is nowhere near as big as the Earth. It\u0027s only half the Earth\u0027s diameter, and has only 38% of Earth\u0027s surface gravity. The reason for this is that when Jupiter migrated inward towards the Sun, it robbed Mars of material to form with; scientists believe that had Jupiter not drifted inward, Mars would have been the same size as Earth and Venus. The\u00A0total\u00A0surface area of Mars is about equal to the\u00A0land\u00A0surface area of the Earth (i.e. that small portion of the Earth\u0027s surface that isn\u0027t under water). Nevertheless, Mars has a canyon (Mariner Canyon) that\u0027s far, far larger than Earth\u0027s Grand Canyon, and a volcano (Olympus Mons) that\u0027s far, far larger than Earth\u0027s Mount Everest.\u00A0Unlike Everest or most other large mountains on Earth, Olympus Mons is not steep at all. On the contrary, it rises so gradually that in terms of land area it\u0027s roughly the size of France, and a person standing at the base of Olympus Mons would be unable to see its summit because it would actually be over the horizon. Olympus Mons and Mariner Canyon both lie on a region called the Tharsis Bulge, essentially a seven kilometer high (that\u0027s\u00A0before\u00A0adding the altitude of the volcanoes) bump on the planet\u0027s surface caused by a massive upward magma flow beneath that entire area. Olympus Mons is the largest of\u00A0many\u00A0volcanoes sitting on the bulge. When these volcanoes were being formed, the pressure caused by the upward magma flow caused a part of the crust to\u00A0split open, creating the Mariner Canyon. Depending on how the boundary of the Tharsis Bulge is defined, it covers up to twenty-five percent of Mars\u0027s surface area.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nOne unusual feature of Mars is that its northern and southern hemispheres are so dramatically different in geography. The northern hemisphere is largely smooth (and it is theorized that much of it was once covered in water), while the southern hemisphere has very rough, cratered ground that averages 1\u20133 kilometers higher in elevation. Given the sheer improbability that asteroids and meteors would only strike half of a planet, astronomers have been trying to figure out why this would be the case ever since detailed photographs of Mars first became available. In the last decade, study of the northern hemisphere has indicated that\u00A0a single massive impact\u00A0by an object about 2/3rd the size of Earth\u0027s moon may have wiped away all smaller craters and other irregularities on the northern hemisphere. The signs of this enormous crater, bigger than the next four largest in the solar system combined and covering some 40% of Mars\u0027 surface, were obscured by over a billion years of volcanic eruptions along its rim. It has been argued that the difference in cratering is because Mars once had a shallow ocean covering most of its northern hemisphere. While there is no evidence to disprove this claim, there is also no conclusive evidence for it either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe most damaging is that Mars has a core that\u0027s dead, with no tectonic activity at all, so there\u0027s no magnetic field to keep the solar wind from keeping the planet more or less sterile. Although science holds out hope that they will\u00A0one day discover evidence that life once existed on Mars, there\u0027s very little hope they will find life living there now.\u00A0Worse than that, the Martian soil is now known to be extremely rich in hexavalent chromium (known for short as HexChrome), one of the most potent carcinogens known to man. Today, the moons\u00A0Europa\u00A0and\u00A0Enceladus\u00A0are considered more likely to currently harbor life, both having verified subterranean liquid water and the protection of their respective home planets\u0027 magnetic fields. (Europa\u0027s surface ice is also a protective barrier from Jupiter\u0027s latent radiation.) While in 2015 it was finally verified that there is indeed liquid water on the surface of Mars, the lack of a magnetic field and toxic soil would still be severe obstacles to life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-08-14T12:11:10Z\u0022 title=\u002208/14/2018 12:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 14, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by ARS\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-14T12:20:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Karte_Mars_Schiaparelli_MKL1888.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022394\u0022 src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Karte_Mars_Schiaparelli_MKL1888.png\u0022 width=\u0022713\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zcGFjZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VzL2kv\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022378\u0022 src=\u0022https://img.purch.com/w/660/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zcGFjZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VzL2kvMDAwLzAzMi8zOTUvb3JpZ2luYWwvaW5zaWdodC1tYXJzLWxhbmRpbmctc2l0ZXMuanBn\u0022 width=\u0022660\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, Curiosity, Viking2, and Spirit are\u00A0somewhere in Elysium,\u003Cbr\u003E\nOpportunity \u2014 south of Eden,\u003Cbr\u003E\nPathfinder and Viking 1 - on Chryse,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceception","CreatedById":152800,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-14T12:59:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223433572\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022177229\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221534234144\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107381\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Green Baron\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, Green Baron said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, \u0022was much more habitable\u0022 brings up the wrong picture imo, it is supposed having had the preconditions for microbial life in the first few hundred millions of years, similar to those on earth.

The early atmosphere came from outgasing of the soft and warm upper mantle (which makes it questionable if there were any gases during and directly after formation). The question about life on mars depends on \u003Cs\u003EDavid Bowie\u003C/s\u003E the assumption that things there work the same way as on earth. We can ask if there was enough time - let\u0027s say ~400my if we take earth\u0027s shortest debated path to early life - or if processes of removal were too fast, and we can wait until we get a positive result from exploration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think we all agree that the conditions may have been conducive for the development of early microbial life, until water and atmosphere were lost (water apparently seemingly maybe partly drawn into the mantle).

In a basic sense habitability could just mean \u0022may have liquid water somewhere\u0022, but that alone really means nothing at all e.g. if radiation cancels any attempt of chemistry to organize itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe don\u0027t know what the early atmospheres of either earth or mars looked like in detail (CO2, H2O, H2S, these things, maybe thinner, maybe thicker than today). The early atmosphere came from outgasing of the soft and warm upper mantle (which makes it questionable if there were any gases during and directly after formation). The question about life on mars depends on \u003Cs\u003EDavid Bowie\u003C/s\u003E the assumption that things there work the same way as on earth. We can ask if there was enough time - let\u0027s say ~400my if we take earth\u0027s shortest debated path to early life - or if processes of removal were too fast, and we can wait until we get a positive result from exploration\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m going to have to disagree here.
