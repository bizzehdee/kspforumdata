The sky was getting lighter by the minute as I waited, but I was able to spot the swarm in binoculars when it rose above the trees to the northwest. Since they were moving slower that low, I was able to try counting them, and got something close to 60... but it was difficult again because the satellites were not overly bright (not the predicted magnitude 2.0). They got as high as 65 degrees altitude (last night they were only 40-something), and as they passed through the Summer Triangle they began lighting up at a couple points along their path as the sunlight apparently glinted off each of them in rapid succession as they went through the spots between Vega and Altair. So they didn\u0027t so much look like a string of pearls (like I normally see), but more like a gold chain that flares at certain points as it is dragged along.
