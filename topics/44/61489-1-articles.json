The Copernician (Sun-centered) system offered a couple of predictions - first, it predicted the distance to the outer planets (the Ptolomaic system didn\u0027t constrain that), which, while nice, they had no way to measure. It also predicted there should be a shift in the positions of the stars over the year\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 which was very pointedly *not* observed. So, observationally\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 the Earth-centered system made more sense. More specifically, Copernicus (who nicked the idea from the ancient Greeks - they, too, had proposed a sun-centered system) worked with perfect circles\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 and in order to get predictions as accurate as the Ptolomaic system, \u003Cem\u003Ealso had to add back in epicycles, deferents, and the whole load of baggage that went with it\u003C/em\u003E. By the time you patched the Copernician system up to the point where it worked as well as the Ptolomaic system\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 it wasn\u0027t any simpler.

With that, he finally had a system that could out-perform an Earth-centered one. and it still took about 100 years until some kid in his 20\u0027s explained it all while inventing calculus and integration in his spare time (Newton).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t throw out a model, or theory, until there\u0027s some good reason to.

So it\u0027s not like they\u0027d assume that if there is no measurable parallax, that there is no parallax at all. Possibility that stars were simply too distant for parallax to be measurable was understood. The problem was lack of understanding of wave optics, leading Tycho to greatly over-estimate the apparent size of stars. Even to a modern telescope, light from a distant star might as well be from a point source. However, even a point source results in an apparent disk of finite size.

Many physicists think we should believe in this out of modesty. As much as enthusiasts of modern science enjoy likening the acceptance of the conclusions of modern astrophysics and cosmology to \u0022logic\u0022 and \u0022enlightenment\u0022, it\u0027s ultimately a matter of faith.

Instead of the nice circular orbits of past maps, there would be crazy loop-de-loops for all of the celestial bodies as they orbit around the Sun as (from the Earth\u0027s POV) the Sun \u0027orbits\u0027 around the Earth. I suppose that the brute force way of generating such a Geocentric map would just be to calculate all of the positions of the celestial bodies and transform them into a coordinate system with Earth as the center. But would there be a way to have some sort of mathematics associated with the new orbits to predict their position relative to the Earth at a given point of time?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe exact mirror image of the heliocentric model of the Solar System into an up-to-date Geocentric model is a Tychonean model with the star movement centered on the Sun.

No observation made from or near the Earth can give you any evidence for one model over the other.
