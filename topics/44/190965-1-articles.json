The problem i am facing, is that at 12k feet, the wind gusts can go up to 50 knots in certain places and because i am holding the ballon with a tope in a fixed length, it can\u0027t get the extra leash \u00A0to climb up, i think when i reach 12,000 feet and i get a wind gust of 50 knots, my balloon will just be forced down to 7000 feet or something where there is less wind. I came up with a solution, use a host material, which will occupy 3 of 4000 gram balloons, so i just have brut force, this way maybe it can be more absorbing. What host material should i use for the 3 balloons? has this been done before?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-12T05:19:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/202276-sarthak/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022202276\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/202276-sarthak/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Sarthak\u003C/a\u003E, I\u0027ve moved your question to science and spaceflight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-12T07:26:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have no idea what you are proposing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be much more simple (though maybe difficult to schedule) if you launched the balloon when the winds were blowing less.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-12T09:30:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni think he needs altitude control for his balloon. probably a ballast system of sorts. or perhaps a small hydrogen/helium tank and release valve to control the volume of lifting gas. problem with those systems is thay require consumables which would limit flight time. another option might be a small\u00A0heater for the gas bag, get a small amount of buoyancy control.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-01-12T09:31:15Z\u0022 title=\u002201/12/2020 09:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 12, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Nuke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-12T10:22:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223727267\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022190965\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221578814005\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022137807\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mikegarrison\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, mikegarrison said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be much more simple (though maybe difficult to schedule) if you launched the balloon when the winds were blowing less.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be impossible.
