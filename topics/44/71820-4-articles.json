As far as scaling, I have heard mixed reports on scaling, some saying its a problem (without any citation) and others stating it isn\u0027t a problem (also without citation). Regardless, if the system works to any degree comparable to a solar sail it will be utilized over them. Solar sails have a few problems that tend to get overshadowed by the idea of just making them bigger. Primarily the fact that deep within a solar system (where we are) there is enough stuff floating around that they will degrade noticably over time. If you are lucky your degradation will tend towards a general degradation of capability, if you are unlucky then you are going to need to \u0027constantly\u0027 (every couple weeks?) need to recalibrate how the sail operates. The bigger the sail, the more degradation you can sustain and still be mission capable. And they are heavily dependent upon a local source of energy (sun or laser platform). Once you start getting to the far outter sections of the solar system or places with no infrastructure, the use of a solar sail quickly becomes problematic. If we identify a specificed size/power input for the thrusters that makes them even partially comparable to a solar sail in terms of thrust abilities, it would be FAR better to just have a large bank of these. You can keep them inside your protective hull, thus reducing degradation over time. They work as long as you have electricity, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RuBisCO","CreatedById":59540,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-06T17:36:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA crude summary of the stages of scientific turthiness:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomeone makes a claim = \u0022BS\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomeone makes a claim and reports it in a peer review journal = \u0022Intresting, but probably BS\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomeone test that claim and comes up with the same or similiar results = \u0022Fascinating, perhaps this is not BS\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomeone repeats testing of claim with variation and gets similiar results with a model showing what variation does = \u0022Well this appears to be the scientific consensus\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomeone repeats the testing of the testing of testing of the claim and gets the same results that fit within the model = \u0022Established Scientific theory\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomeone with limited education can be instructed to test and can validate the claim that has been tested, re-tested and modeled = \u0022Fact\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEMdrive appears to be at stage 2 or even 3.

They tested the Cannae Drive, a dummy modified Cannae Drive without the slots, and a device very similar to the EMDrive (though never referenced as such), key difference being that this one also was half filled with a dielectricum. And test loads to verify they got no thrust/torque from cables and stuff. Power levels were 17 Watt, tops, a rare case of XKCD getting numbers wrong. That the dummy device produced the same results as the real device is not terribly surprising: The slots are way too small to have a significant effect on waves of that frequency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne more little observation: They do not say which way the thrust went when they mounted the devices the other way round. I\u0027d assume it also changed direction, but I also would assume you put things into a vacuum chamber to test them in a vacuum, so there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd on the pictures, you see that the devices are almost touching the vacuum chamber walls. If it\u0027s not thermal effects from the air inside the chamber, definitely near field effects are next on the suspect list of perfectly normal explanations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Albert VDS","CreatedById":74055,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-06T21:24:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid NASA Validate an \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CImpossible\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Space Drive?
