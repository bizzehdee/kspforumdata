But to the point, the 4n \u002B 2 orbital can be accessed at several points along the graphene sheet edge so it can be thin and wide and in that context a monolayer could conduct an infinite number of amps. if you could take a 20 guage wire and widen it 40 times and flatten it 100000 times you could spread out the ends to make an excellent high amperage contact, your transformer can have 2500 times the number of windings which means you could turn a 10x stepup thnsformer and turn it into a 25000x step up transformer.

But without lithium, in nature 4n \u002B 2 orbitals love to stack, that stacking explains the double helical nature of DNA. They like to point the hole of those little donut orbitals at each other (grand oversimplification). You can roll graphene ever so slightly creating a wrap, and if you can do that you can create and electromagnet with many many windings. And graphene can potentially be made very long. In space if you were to print out graphene and let it roll out into an hv free area, the 4n\u002B2 orbitals would be perfectly flat following space-time curvature, forever. And if you place an electron on one end and test the voltage potential at the other end, that EMF immediately appears, because according to one report, the lowest potential energy 4n \u002B2 orbital is a quantum singularity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine a 3D printer that can print graphene, and it is printing a graphene sheet on a very smooth thread spool used for a sewing machine, and while it is printing I am turning it so that when I am done I put 500,000 windings on it. Lets say with molecular (metal alloy) appending that thickness reduces to 50,000 but I can gain superconductivity, that means I have say 50,000 windings. At the ends I spread the superconducting graphene out into a wide area of regular graphene that then I connect to my powersupply (basically the relay would be like a flat pole you might find in any household distribution center), somewhat tricky because you would have to fork the interior most winding out and turn it backwards. With proper terminal insulation I could place 0.1V on that assume the maximum amperage I can place at the poles is say 125 Amps (limit of most residental distribution centers), calculate the EMF on say a magnetizable supermetal place in the center hole of the spool. Then you get it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now if each graphene hexagon is spread 4A apart and I have a 4 centimeter of graphene that means on each hexagon I am dropping 125A across 10\u003Csup\u003E6\u003C/sup\u003E (.125 millamps per hexagon) contact points of superconductive material or if I connect this with non-superconductive graphene at room temperature, the contact might be a 0.4 meter (.0125 millamps per hexagon). So basically the transformer that powers your house is doing roughly the same thing, but its about a meter high and a third of a meter wide, and embedded in really dangerous oil (most of the environmental PCPs came from transformers of that like), and I am basically doing half of that with a sewing machine spool sized device. We have to assume via Quantum mechanics that we can dump 1 electron onto the orbital at the rate of 1/10\u003Csup\u003E-43 \u003C/sup\u003Esec , and so you can use highschool physics to calculate the number of electrons in an amp. 6.25x 10\u003Csup\u003E18\u003C/sup\u003E So basically that is not rate limiting, the only rate limiting problem is the transfer heat on the transfer pole and its effect on distal superconducting. Agreed that temperature is a problem, but if the Tmax can be improved with other metals and configurations, this offers a tremendous potential. Imagine three printers, one prints a layer of metal on the spool and the other prints a layer of graphene as it passes the other side of the spool, then a third prints a third layer of metal on the other side, and possibly a forth prints a thin layer of insulation say polyethylene, and you do this 50,000 times. . . . . . . . . \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of the things one could do.

Critical current is a function of the diameter of the conductor, this conductor is essentially flat. But lets just say you are right, just before going from hyperconductive to super conductive you split your graphene into a flat array of graphene threads. This could be done by essentially rolling the conductors into a spoll instead of using a bar to attach them. Of course 125 A of power is insane for a superconductor, but not farfetched, if the spools are mounted at 45 degrees to what is being accelated and the core is replaced by a magnet you could make the spool longer than a sewing machine spool to increases the number of threads, it really doesnt matter because graphene has a denity below 1 and so you are saving many fold over rare earths.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E i dont know if you are correct about critical current and graphene, the problem is that with a large sheet if graphene ther is not one 4n\u002B2 orbital, but an infinite number, and so you really have many with approximately basal potential energy orbitals for Electron waves to travel over, As long as dV is infinite on the terminals. This is one of those I wont worry about, graphene has a relatively low thermal stability, so its going to be a couple of decades before you see this be implimented as supermagnets in space, imho, they will work it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought I should explain this \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. suppose we have a single column of aromatic hexagons, we have a single 4n\u002B2 orbital that connects one end to the next\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. if we add another hexagon any where we create 1 additional orbital, roughly the same potential energy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. If we add another hexagon anywhere we create 2 additional orbitals. If we keep doing this parallel to the first column of hexagons we create 2\u003Csup\u003En\u003C/sup\u003E orbitals were n is the length of the original length of the columns in hexagons.

And we can already use a two stage system that gets us there so .......\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T14:16:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBut even space applications focus in cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you need millions of those perfect printed or placed layers, the cost will rise so much, that it will be even pointless for space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can be usefull in the future with new manufacture techniques, they can make aerogel base on graphene oxide or graphene ink, which are 3d materials that are produced as a whole.. no stacking layers after layer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T16:06:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AngelLestat\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AngelLestat\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBut even space applications focus in cost.\u003Cp\u003EIf you need millions of those perfect printed or placed layers, the cost will rise so much, that it will be even pointless for space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can be usefull in the future with new manufacture techniques, they can make aerogel base on graphene oxide or graphene ink, which are 3d materials that are produced as a whole.. no stacking layers after layer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWait . . . . . . .this technology is improving very fast. If it took six months to make a part, not a problem, the typical space prep phases is 5 years to a decade anyway. The other thing is who needs 50,000 windings, its just an example, maybe 2000 would do. If you don\u0027t stack, graphene is of little use to you, because its flatness and stackability is one of its key property. When you see 4n\u002B2 think flat, pancakes, 3D ink would have no better conductivity than graphite, you need sheets, long flat sheets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T23:08:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://gas2.org/2015/08/24/graphene-converts-heat-electricity/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://gas2.org/2015/08/24/graphene-converts-heat-electricity/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould increase power output of solar panels in space by placing it on the back side of solar panels, or on the heat radiators.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-07T20:49:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://qubitsnews.com/2015/08/31/worlds-thinnest-light-bulb-created-from-graphene-2/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://qubitsnews.com/2015/08/31/worlds-thinnest-light-bulb-created-from-graphene-2/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow we have a graphene with LED like properties.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-07T22:42:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYea yea, we get it.
