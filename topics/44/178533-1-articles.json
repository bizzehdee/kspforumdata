The though came to me randomly that sometimes maybe you need to go down to go up... Stupid random thought, but.. What about making rockets that use buoyancy and water to make them go faster to help get out of the atmosphere. They could use, buoyancy, and things like, hopefully light/redundant, electrical systems to do what a jetski does or similar and maybe loose the bottom part or separate near the surface in order to reuse it. This part could be collected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample. A rocket dives very deep(maybe the water thrusters in reverse.) then go upwards at a speed to seperate the above rocket in order to make it separate like navy/sub missile and bounce into the air and then use that momentum to maximum upward thrust and then ignite the rockets and get into orbit. Could you make more interesting rockets or more efficient ones. I imagine they could be larger to fit in gasses or things for upward thrust or use compressed air or a vacuum to create things to aid in rocket propelled ascent partially. How feasible is this and has this been considered over land rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso a mid stage filled with helium or vacuum could be either made to land (possible similar to a blimp, or at least to minimize descent forces) Or if filled with viable materials used as part of the rocket stage as fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas this been attempted or proposed before?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was also looking at something about vacuum blimps recently. The blimp stage could either just aid the water ascent and stay when reaching the surface or it could help propel actual rocket stage higher in order to gain altitude to lessen the overall craft fuel needs. I imagine for a designer it would be nice to add negative weight to a craft for once. I imagine one problem could be getting the potential lighter than air stage to not hit he other one. Maybe you would need it to be on the nose and come off and float at a different trajectory than the main stage. It could also have some rockets to help pull it away and in a different direction before attempting to land. And with it being a water based rocket it could potentially just land in the water nice and soft like. 8)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe don\u0027t have any lighter than air portions for rockets in stock to do we?!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither way, how high could you get a rocket before igniting main thrusters? Could this sort of hybrid design save on launch costs or allow new things to be done?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could also add in blimp like negative air aspects to staging to make the stages land softer or have a slower natural decent to save on fuel if using reusable stages. At least hypothetically. What if fuel tanks were make to fill with negative air vacuum after being spent on top of any additional outer vacuum chambers. If this could be done while expending fuel you could increase air buoyancy while ascending. Maybe this could be used to increase efficiency of the rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-09-25T12:33:15Z\u0022 title=\u002209/25/2018 12:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 25, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RCgothic","CreatedById":132560,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-25T13:02:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a lot (a *lot*) of effort for maybe an extra hundred metres per second, which is at best what drag would afford you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSaturn 5 is over 100m tall.

The idea being you launch the rovcket through these ballons, inside which is reduced atmospheric drag due to the lower molecular weight of the gas mixture. Another slightly more ambitious idea is to build an enormous hollow tower and evacuate the inside, so that a rocket can be launched all the way from the ground to orbit whilst in vacuum, with obvious reductions in drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose two are quite out-there, google around the terms and you are sure to find something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow a little surprise titbit I found just now: a study on using an evacutated tube to propel an atmospheric sounding rocket. Not quite in the way you originally envisaged, but not a million miles away either. The idea is you have a long evacuated tube with the rocket fitting snugly inside, forming the bottom seal. Once you release the rocket, atmospheric pressure pushes on the lower part of the rocket forcing it up the tube at speed, exiting the top with some positive velocity and altitude, whereupon the rocket firs with a boost to speed and height.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is pretty similar to using buoyancy, and therefore a direct confirmation that you are not crazy!

I always liked the idea of getting into atmosphere before launch. I was at one point working on an electric ascent for eve but It never got fully of the ground. It got a ways up there but It was tedious. Although it looked like a potential for in game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other idea with water is the fact you are in a space like environment. You hypothetically are giving launch a full 3d 360 infinite runway with virtually no limitations on distance and other factors. Or like the long balloon idea make something so large the bottom is in one region and the top in another. 8)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other thing I was thinking is like sub missiles but not necessarily going straigth up. If you encapsulate them you can literally make a sub carrying a traditional rocket(or any rockets. use it deal with underwater pressures and make it reusable. Then it and the underwater stage basically stay in or on the water surface and you collect them afterwords. on top of this use lifting body concepts to get more out of the normal rockets via adding to the current rockets or via a stage on top or on the bottom to give extra life. Or like you mentioned it could be like a water based firing chamber using negative pressure. Maybe it could be run from the deep or use ti to gain momentum and fire like a plane firing a gun. If you are getting enough re usability out of it then maybe it would help. If not maybe the buoyancy issues and lighter than air stuff could help lower fuel a little in order to need less full for things like the reusable parts from spacex or similar. if it helps at all it could get more efficiency out of stages from it potentially. If you already have air pumps and can make pump it all out fast enough you could make it ascend better on the way down by using it\u0027s existing structure to some extent to remove air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the other advantage of water, although what i already mentioned, is that you can go from the waters surface at any angle. You are not stuck with an initial vertical launch if it\u0027s helpful. And you don\u0027t need to take straight launches. You can use any convoluted path you want potentially. Even a circle to gain speed and try to breach like a whale to gain max altitude and velocity. Could you use the water speed and lighter than air concept(or reduction of effective mass) to get it in the air without thrusters with enough momentum? I would imagine there is a way to calculate how much speed would be needed to get to a certain altitude. I\u0027m asuming you can reduce drag more with shape and things. Although i have no idea how much. with separate stages you could specialize the shape. If the underwater one is literally a sub made out of engines and a sheath around the entire rocket you could customize pretty nicely. At least hypothetically.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI didn\u0027t think about the heatsink part. If it helps you could use more powerful or smaller engines on the underwater portion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was basically thinking of a rockoon with a stiff body, or applied to a stiff body, like a zeplin body, being projected from underwater, via a distinct underwater phase, and then made more efficient on the way up. Plus I was wondering if the lighter than air applied underwater could enhance the water breaching stage to increase the height or velocity. Then you use a more powerful underwater stage to pull it or keep it under at a safe depth and then launch. if you can even stay at a shallow depth but move horizontally underwater you could then pull up with the right depth launch at a steeper angle. But I\u0027m guessing it would depnd on the struture, which is why a dedicate shell around the entire rocket as an underwater stage might be good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could make a speedy submarine that shoots out a rocket from it\u0027s length/nose instead of it\u0027s top and use that vacuum tube concept. 8) It\u0027s a bit extreme but potentially reusable... \u0026gt;\u0026lt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen fire a special rocket with lighter than air enhancements to get more lift.

If you could slow the decent a little would it help with safer returns to use vacuum chambers. You would even easily get vacuum chambers from space by letting out oxygen or things on the way back. If drag is not so much an issue on the way back from space why not Zeppelin landers. You could make the structure capable of deploying to larger sizes for returns to hold vacuum to slow down/aid in descent. If larger sizes are needed.

Although having one where the top of the rocket is in lesser depth compared to the bottom would make a rocket of a few thousand feet long(or even a few hundred.). Although I bet the numbers would be interesting on how that affects launch. I think I saw a post on that once about super high in the atmosphere to avoid fuel use or something. But I have no idea how it went or how it would work starting in water. Water would support more types of structures until you got into the air. The blimp concept and other things could be applied to actually aid structure instead of primarily lifting if it\u0027s something that is better off in ocean/space compared to water. And if something goes from water to air it could easily inflate under the difference and use this to launch if it doesn\u0027t add drag sufficiently. maybe it gets longer and is loose like a deep see fish and inflates with hot air on the way up. That would be a undersea launched hot air balloon rocket. I guess that would be a more pure rockoon but from water and it has to inflate on the way up. It\u0027s either hot air or a structure that can inflate but still hold a vacuum. Maybe a metal structure(like a round tomato cage) with fabric held taught enough?!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdit5:\u003C/strong\u003E Final note, if I can stop editing. What about a water bottle rocket that the fills with air in a vacuum to get as high as possible. 8d If anything it might make a cool toy. If you are already using vacuum why not increase pressure then do the opposite and maybe add a balloon concept like above(tomato cage that inflates and holds taught fabric to hold vacuum.). Might win a model rocket contest with it or something if it works well. 8)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdit6:\u003C/strong\u003E Maybe if a descending vehicle can be made it can work like a boat that rides on the layers of the atmosphere. Maybe if done right it can be made into a space rescue vehicle in case of accidents in space and collect crew if they get detached in a worst case scenario. Or just a really cool descent vehicle. Think a boat descending through the atmosphere that is also a blimp lie inflatable structure and can ride the clouds and atmospheric layers.

You could pack as much buoyancy into the rocket to get more momentum on launch. Could current fuel tanks hold a negative buoyancy when empty? I was kind of assuming those were already fairly strong by design as they have to deal with positive pressures. If you designed a rocket around a positive and negative pressure fuel tank then you might be able to do this. Maybe give it various section so that when one empties it is then drained of oxygen for a buoyancy assist. I don\u0027t see why, if that is feasible, that could not help with reusable rocket designs like the spacex stuff. Maybe you could get some extra fuel efficiency or less overall fuel needs overall.

The idea of using a blimp concept could be applied to enhance a normal rocket like space x or a modified shuttle tank. Could you take solid rocket tanks(or any tanks) and then make them hold a negative pressure(after a chamber is emptied of fuel.) to help bring them down with a secondary fuel source. Maybe to offset the weight and reduce the fuel for recovering the part in a usable form. I would think the best chance of this working would be on large fuel tanks with lots of empty space.

If you can especially get a tank filled with negative pressure/vacuum fast enough maybe it could be used as a counter system to help in case a rocket tries to veer off course. Or as a safety system to help making stuff in a bad situation not go as out of control by having it be partially a blimp and then more predictable on failure.

Just use the tank as it already is to increase performance if it\u0027s possible. Maybe even vacuuming it out to a current safe amount and not acheiving perfect vacuum. Outside of structural issues.

I would think it could be useful for something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeparately, what about the buoyancy water rocket idea as a way to get more launch windows. It could be an emergency vehicle for rescues potentially. Even if less efficient. Not sure if that opens up enough things for practical use. If it helps with landing issues because of the problems of air space etc. Maybe it could also open up more flights in general if we start doing more in the future. Mainly with an emphasis on where you can land if you fail to get all the way up for some reason but can still manage to land in friendly territory.

It\u0027s the same as protecting a person from pressure underwater. Then you make an expensive underwater shell that can be used and repaired as long as possible.

A giant cylinder could have half spheres put in it to make chambers. The cylinder would have the top be a half sphere for max structural strength(assuming) and then another half sphere on the bottom with a whole for the positive pressure to force out fuel and them a plug that negative pressure would/could cap when applied and other holes, if needed, for getting all the air out(probably redundancy for safety). then you only need downward facing half circles put in the rest of the cylinder to for any other desired chamber space. You could have as many negative pressure half sphere/cylinder spaces as desired for either for maximizing negative pressure or to get as much fuel as possible. Or even to aid in the overall strength of the cylinder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe inside would only have half spheres in it to maximize fuel space. These would be half spheres facing downwards to let gravity or pressure push the fuel out. The only upward facing sphere/half sphere would be on the top of the cylinder. Although you could simply make the very top a full sphere with a hole in the bottom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could also add other internal or external structural strength with beams or other arched beams, or the like, inside the empty spaces. Maybe with a tapered widening joint that spread out along the inner or outer skin of the tank. This would allows a wide joint and a much smaller\u00A0 beam in the middle for maximum strength to the walls. Although I don\u0027t know if that helps maximize fuel or tanks space. At least not if it\u0027s inside the tank. But that, on the outside of the tank, could be done to aid both negative and positive pressure. I would assume it would look alot like how it\u0027s presumed cells are attached organically with a wide connection and potentially thinner, but maybe flexible, connection point. Just a matter of doing it efficiently. Or am I think of drawing of neurons? I\u0027m also thinking wide as in 3d wide in all direction. a joint covering a wide potentially hexagonal or pentagonal surface. Very thing at the edged and thicker as it gets to the center where it goes into a long tube(s) to attach to another surface. These could be tightly packed. Also potentially making room for thinner inner tank. Or one designed to counter the outer surface joints to equal out the strength of the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wonder if you could make a thinner tank(designed around total weight.) and an outer layer of a material that can be worked like sodder(but at higher tempturatures likely.) and then pulled to a second outter layer in multiple strands to make joints. The outside layer on the inner tank could be this material in hexagon/pentagon shapes along it\u0027s surface. This could be used to make the tank somewhat cheap to replace. it could also have the inner tank also make of similar shapes underneath(and in the same spots or purposely misaligned) so they can be replaced easily and cheapy. Just a matter of shaping them then. Which I would think could be done with heat and negative/positive pressure designs of the tank. Although the spheres would probably need to be solid. Unless also made the same way with inner joints.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wonder if you could make the joints by taking physical thin(relatively) lines of material and heating them to sufficient heats to make a material draw up a wick to positions. Maybe this could be perfected to be done in space for repairs in orbit or something odd.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, the point of this is to achieve better overall performance if possible or for functionally aiding in the recovery of said parts. Assuming it can be done efficiently.
