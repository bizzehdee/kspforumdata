Yet hardly any force was applied. So is it energy that limits our control? I think not. Limitations exist only as we see them to. Humans did not evolve with wings, yet we sought and achieved flight, something once declared an impossibility. Men on the moon? Science fiction, yet humanity also proved that false. We strive against the impossible, to push against the limitations of the universe, and make the impossible possible. FTL is impossible in accordance with the laws of physics. So what do we do? We find a way around it, in the form of the alcubierre warp drive formula.

One comment could lead to someone changing their mind and getting that girls phone number. Their great-great-grandchildren have an idea they mention to a friend. That friend is inspired, and pursues the idea, eventually making it a reality. This is then built upon by many other people, and turned into, say, the first warp drive in human history, and is te thing which allows our species to step out into the stars and call another world home.
