In addition, many players complete their first Mun landings by sitting the rocket\u0027s engine bell directly on the ground. I have three questions related to this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nCan the *edge* of an engine bell really support the weight of the whole rocket if it were standing on the ground directly? Of course when in flight, common sense would dictate the engine bell must support the weight of the whole rocket under multiple G when it\u0027s running, but isn\u0027t that force spread out across the entire bell and combustion chamber, not concentrated on the rim? Could the bell crumple if you tried to land on it?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nImagine a lander without landing legs coming in to land on the Moon. As the engine approaches to mere inches above the ground, and there is less and less room for exhaust gas to escape, how does this affect the stability of the landing craft?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAre there any real life examples of rockets landing or taking off directly on the engine bell, without legs or an elevated launch rail of some kind?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-23T22:01:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNope, not possible in real life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ultimate Steve","CreatedById":161505,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-23T22:40:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you custom made a nozzle so it could be landable, in theory it could work, but besides that or landing on a low gravity body like an asteroid I don\u0027t see it happening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut there is one real world example I can think of.
