Backups exist, but for the most part switching to manual is pointless - if the navigation system fails during a launch then a pilot is likely to have no idea what course the rocket is on, and will have no choice but to abort.\u00A0One of the few things that men can do as well as computers is to dock, so if any of the the docking technologies\u00A0fail then a pilot can take over, once the craft is close enough to its target. They can also do things such as reboot systems when they fail, which is not automated for fear that \u0022false\u0022 reboot situations could occur at critical moments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Of course, the astronauts have some very important jobs on board the ISS!

Some of the readings had to be radioed back to Earth for further calculation (because of the limited computer power onboard) but some could be entered into the navigation system directly. The astronauts also had huge checklists to attend to during the mission, making sure equipment was working as expected: during the first few low Earth orbits before the trans-lunar injection they had to check just about every circuit and system before they could commit to going for the moon. If, during that stage, a fault was detected they would have to decide a) can they fix the problem, \u003Cimg alt=\u0022B)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 title=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E\u00A0can they work around it (by, for instance, using circuit breakers instead of faulty switches or using backup equipment), or c) is the mission a bust?

Computers fly a combination of preprogrammed trajectory and real time calculations. All major maneuvers and burns would be pre-planned and calculated, and even contingencies for use in an emergency. Even unplanned maneuvers would be calculated by computer. I\u0027d say usually, the astronauts punch numbers into a computer which does the work. Softwier is right about the role of astronauts in apollo, but almost all of the actual \u0027flying\u0027 is done by computer. During the lunar landing, the computer controlled the de-orbit burn and attitude using its inertial navigation system and radar to detect altitude. It guided the lem to a preprogrammed area and then the astronauts took partial control, in \u0027steering\u0027 to guide to a suitable landing place.

EDS which was automatic and would eject the capsule and end the flight. The commander could turn the abort handle, the same thing would happen. Lastly an abort could be called from Houston. However, once the escape tower jettisons they were high enough in the atmosphere that an immediate abort wouldn\u0027t be needed (and actually might be worse in the end). At this time EDS was turned off (called EDS to manual for your next Apollo 13 viewing)[actually EDS was switched to manual slightly before the tower is jettisoned] and turning the abort handle would implement whatever the best available abort mode is. I believe (not 100% though) that if only the guidance failed, they could manually pilot the rocket to orbit (and possibly the moon) however NASA would probably just choose an abort mode anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the LM, it was intended that the autopilot would land the ship 100%, however the landing area for A11 wasn\u0027t an area could land in so they aborted the autoland, moved to a slightly different landing area, and landed manually.
