Here are my responses to those:\n\u003E - We are interested in the development and progress of animals in the wild for scientific purposes, why is that hard to believe in this situation?\n\u003E \n\u003E - The SETI program is the equivalent of trying to pick up a television broadcast with an old radio\n\u003E \n\u003E - This is based on our current understanding. God knows that doesn\u0027t change as we advance, right?\n\u003E \n\u003E - Seemingly random to us. When we\u0027re tagging or observing openly animals and fish for example, that would seem random to them as well.\n\u003E \n\u003E - If you were a government would you want your citizens knowing that there are things of such magnitude out of their control? Also some governments are fairly open about this topic.\n\u003E \n\u003E - Again, why do we need to understand the reason? They\u0027re a completely different species from a completely different planet. And I again refer you to the idea of a deer not understanding why it was abducted by a human and then set free (the human was a scientist doing research, but the deer didn\u0027t understand that)\n\u003E \n\u003E - This one is pretty out there. What arrogance to believe that it doesn\u0027t exist because we don\u0027t understand it. \u0022Sufficient technology is indistinguishable from magic.\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E - Human mind is fallible - Uh, yeah. But why do people feel the need to immediate discredit others for a sighting? There are some amazingly credible witnesses. Police officers, pilots, astronauts, military. Why is there not *curiosity* about this subject? If you want to put it to rest, find proof (proper proof) for each sighting. You cannot just say every person who sees a UFO is not credible.\n\n- It is more the \u0027has arisen near enough to us\u0027 part that I was intending there. \n\n- Just because you can\u0027t understand/decode a broadcast doesn\u0027t mean you can\u0027t detect it. It doesn\u0027t require many leaps in logic (I do like that phrase) to make the assumption that alien broadcasts would have some sort of pattern and be distinguishable from the \u0027background noise\u0027 of the universe. Besides the WOW signal we haven\u0027t picked up anything that could be interpreted as alien signals. \n\n- Of course it can change. But based on our current understanding, which fits experimental evidence and explains what we see in the universe almost perfectly, there is no reason to make wild assumptions that these rules can be broken. \n\n- Fair point. Though you would expect some hard evidence to be left behind. When we tag animals, well, we tag them, we leave debris behind etc.; there\u0027s never any physical evidence of abductions. \n\n- I challenge the notion that a government would deny that things exist beyond their control, and the idea that any conspiracy of that size could ever be pulled off. Natural disasters aren\u0027t covered up are they? They\u0027re completely beyond our control and they affect far more people than alien abductions would. \n\n- We don\u0027t necessarily need to understand the reason, but we can attempt to apply logic given that we are capable of it. Saying \u0027we couldn\u0027t even understand their motives\u0027 is basically the UFOlogist version of \u0027God works in mysterious ways\u0027\n\n- I am not saying it doesn\u0027t exist because we don\u0027t understand it. I am saying that it is extraordinary to claim that such things exist when we have no evidence for them and there are far simpler explanations for the same outcome. \n\nI will again reiterate that eyewitness testimony means **A B S O L U T E L Y N O T H I N G**, no matter who it is from. The human mind is an amazing machine but, like any machine, it has its flaws. Anyone can be deceived. The mind deceives itself constantly. The memory is a fragile thing. It is easily distorted and it is susceptible to suggestion and bias. \n\nIt is not that I am not curious. I am extremely curious and I have done a fair amount of research into this subject and concluded as best I can that there is always a perfectly ordinary explanation. I\u0027ve had experiences in my life which I initially put down to the supernatural or paranormal, but after investigating them I found them to be reasonably simple tricks of the mind. For a good month or so (now this is eyewitness testimony, call me a hypocrite if you like) I was seeing lights moving across the wall of my bedroom while the blinds were closed, accompanied by a scratching sound seemingly within the wall (now this is an old house and its walls are pretty much solid stone) There was no clear source of lights. Initial investigations showed that the light was not coming from the direction of the windows as completely blocking them had no effect. Eventually I found that the light was in fact the result of a mirror which had fallen behind my desk reflecting light from a second mirror in my room up onto the wall. This meant that blocking line of sight with the windows had no effect since the light was coming from another direction. The movement of the lights was caused by the wind moving leaves in a tree outside. The scratching I traced back to a mouse that was not within the wall but scraping along a metal girder in the ceiling/floor beneath it and to one side, which was reverberating through the old stone and creating a loud noise. Obviously this isn\u0027t really a UFO sighting per se and is relatively minor, but in the dead of night the mind easily amplifies the significance of even little things like that."},{"CreatedByName":"Pingonaut","CreatedById":15723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T18:57:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Radar returns of vehicles with much altitudes and speeds than we\u0027re capable of, large uncatalogued objects appearing in orbit, clearly structured radio signals from elsewhere in the solar system... anything like that.
