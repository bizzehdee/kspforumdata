I think implicit in the metastability is that at the beginning of the universe metastability may have existed, but as it cooled the resulting top quarks typically interacted with higgs in a conformal manner. That was my interpretation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember we are trying to find things that might, under unique circumstances, violate conservation of momentum and metastability in the top quark higgs interaction could be one of these. Doesn\u0027t mean that it has any relevance for modern universe, simply means that the circumstance might exists under extreme circumstances. More to the point, if those circumstances existed again, most likely we wouldn\u0027t care because they would be inconsistent with life in general. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so I placed that as the catch phrase in the title, that is how the article was relevant to me, and maybe relevant to other folks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-29T20:11:44Z\u0022 title=\u002209/29/2015 08:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sgt_flyer","CreatedById":57690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-29T20:24:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor me, the true point of the article is their improvements upon the measurements of the top quark is useful -
