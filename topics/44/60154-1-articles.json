We already have very powerful propulsion systems that can take us anywhere in the solar system with ease.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue is that these propulsion systems need fuel, and that fuel needs to be lifted out of earth\u0027s gravity well, and that is prohibitively expensive. With cheap trips to orbit, large orbitally built and fueled exploration craft advance from \u0022are you insane\u0022 to \u0022we might actually have a budget for this\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust think of how much further away Minmus is from the Mun than the Mun is from Kerbin. Yet the delta-V required for a Mun transfer is 5360, and the delta-V required for a Minmus transfer is about 5420. The difference is utterly negligible next to Kerbin\u0027s massive gravity well. And the same is true in real life - as soon as you break free of the Earth, relatively tiny amounts of fuel used in small engines can get you almost anywhere. The fuel cost difference between a Moon rocket and a Mars rocket is a few percent on the launchpad. The reason we haven\u0027t sent humans to Mars is not propulsion technology, it\u0027s money, time and health concerns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure, one could argument that with a new kind of propulsion system, you could use a much faster transfer on the same small amount of fuel. But it\u0027s not a hard requirement. Lower the cost to orbit, and you can simply lift that much more fuel up there and use conventional engines on the same faster transfer. In my opinion, space exploration stands and falls with our ability to conquer Earth\u0027s gravity well in a consistent and efficient fashion.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-23T14:43:13Z\u0022 title=\u002201/23/2014 02:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cziken20","CreatedById":95907,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-23T18:03:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would want 6 to happen \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NASAFanboy","CreatedById":57300,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-23T22:03:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERight now, we are on track for 4 and 5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Chinese moon landing was enough to push Congress to allocate more money to the NASA budget for 2014 (And thus, save Curosity and Cassini) and for an bill to be proposed that would force NASA to return to the moon and establish itself by 2022, bascially an all-out revival of Project Constellation.
