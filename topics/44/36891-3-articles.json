After this link is established and control of both bodies is attained, the first body could slowly be killed off(shutting down the nervous system, and eventually shutting down the old brain slowly. This process could be repeated. It might however lead to severe loss of memory, although the consciousness of the original person might be maintained.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this is a much more realistic step forward than directly to computers as we a. don\u0027t have the processing power or the knowledge of how consciousness works. The brain is very different too from modern-day computers. Thus, it w=would be more plausible to transfer consciousness to a new biological body. This also adds the advantage of being able to genetically modify the new body with certain desirable traits, eliminate genetic diseases etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo answer the question: yes.
