Fresh off the high of the Moon landings, the future of space exploration and exploitation looked bright.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, the premise was, put a bunch of solar panels (or a solar furnace) in geosynchronous orbit, and beam power down to the surface using microwaves (microwave power transmission over long distances is well-understood and well-demonstrated, and was that way at the time). You end up with clean, consequence-free power 24/7/365, no questions asked (with about a 75-minute-long \u0022night\u0022 period when the powersat passes behind the Earth).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, fast forward 40 years. Surface-based solar panels only collect power half the time at best (and aren\u0027t particularly efficient to boot), all the good rivers have been dammed, and wind turbines blow (pun intended). Nuclear fission plants are as popular as shag carpeting, and commercial fusion power is decades away. Even if you don\u0027t believe in peak oil or anthropogenic climate change, smog isn\u0027t much fun, so there\u0027s a big movement away from fossil fuel-based power generation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, a number of different multinational corporate conglomerations and national governments (the only organizations with enough resources) have proposed the construction of powersats as the solution to a power-hungry world. In particular, Mitsubishi (yes, THAT Mitsu, that makes everything from cars to cargo ships) and the Indian and Chinese governments have floated proposals to do just this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the problem of powersats isn\u0027t a simple one:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to achieve efficient, large-scale power transfer, you need an antenna about 1km across in space (and phased arrays won\u0027t cut it - the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinned_array_curse\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethinned-array curse\u003C/a\u003E makes certain of that) and a receiver about 10km across on the ground. Most conservative estimates put the cost of a single powersat, generating about 4GW of power, anywhere between \u003Cstrong\u003EUS$11B and US$320B\u003C/strong\u003E, depending on engineering constraints and decisions (decisions made by people much smarter than me), and would require a multitude of Earth-based launches and large-scale orbital construction. As a means of comparison, conventional power plants, whether coal or nuclear, cost anywhere between US$3B and US$6B per GW upfront.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the question I put to you, the KSP community, is thus:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIs it worth it?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s a better hope for the future of our electrical grid?
