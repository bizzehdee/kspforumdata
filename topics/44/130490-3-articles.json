I\u0027ve decided to try out a GALCIT end-burner, but I\u0027ve come up against a minor problem -- the acquisition of bitumen. I\u0027ve found plenty of places to buy asphalt cement, but that\u0027s mixed with chunks of cement, so unless I can extract the bitumen, it\u0027s of limited utility. A friend of mine had a bucket of partially used asphalt cement he was willing to give to me, and I\u0027ve tried extracting the bitumen by boiling it in water with hydrogen peroxide as a solvent (a technique that\u0027s kinda-sorta similar to a method of extracting bitumen from tar sands, which is why I decided to use it), and I\u0027ve managed to get a small amount from that, but the procedure is rather long and inefficient and it would be easier to just buy pure bitumen. Does anyone know where I could get some?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, does anyone have any experience with asphalt/KClO4 rocket motors? I\u0027m thinking about using them because the high regression rate might allow me to make an end-burner and because it\u0027s got a specific impulse higher than r-candy propellants, but any other information regarding that type of propellant would be greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-30T23:56:35Z\u0022 title=\u002209/30/2014 11:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Exosphere\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"B787_300","CreatedById":31055,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-07T05:51:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExo even with a GLACIT motor i would still think coring would be a good idea... gives you are surface area to play with\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Exosphere","CreatedById":98328,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-07T19:03:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022B787_300\u0022 data-cite=\u0022B787_300\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EExo even with a GLACIT motor i would still think coring would be a good idea... gives you are surface area to play with\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I ran a few calculations on the thrust of a theoretical GALCIT end burner, and came to that conclusion. Even assuming a propellant density unrealistically close to theoretical, an unrealistically high Ve, and a burn rate much higher than I\u0027d be likely to achieve (even after doping the propellant with Al/Fe2O3/other burn rate enhancers), the thrust produced by such a motor would not be great enough to propel a rocket larger than about two or three inches in diameter without resorting to a very short motor, which would significantly reduce the propellant fraction of the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that even with no burn rate enhancers, GALCIT burns at about one inch per second. In a cored design, this would tend to give a very short burn time (relative to an r-candy rocket). This would indicate a very high TWR, which would cause pretty significant drag losses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of this issue, I figured it would be better to either stick with r-candy or APCP.
