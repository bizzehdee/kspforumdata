If fusion was a thing today and we had a rocket to get it into space a reactor, and the reactor could operate for at least a few seconds stably. IOW it meets all the criteria for functional fusion energy in space . . .the vast majority of space missions would not choose this. If you are following the Isaac Arthur videos . . .I am sorry . . . . but fusion is the smaller of the problems. Fusion electric\u00A0 is premised on the idea that you have to get\u00A0 more out as you put into it. The problem with fusion in space is compounded by the fact that the ability to get power out is worse in space than it is on land. To begine with we may not get enough power out to reinitiate. The second problem is you have to store charge to get it started, requiring mass. The process itself is hampered by the fact that steam generation is the most efficient way to get power out, which on land is benefited by the fact we can tap into lakes (such as in fission power plants, cooling towers) you can bring water from miles away to cool if you had a very powerful plant, like a fusion power plant. In space there is only two ways to get rid of energy, either as kinetic energy of exhaust or as waste radiation. As the raw nuclear power output power increases, the mass (radiator) cost of waste increases faster. So at some-point one is almost always better off using solar since its power is cooled at the source. That limit point on power is probably in the fission reactor range, not fusion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe issue of heat is very important, not because it just increases weight, but it points at the exact problem is that finding a solution to waste (i.e increasing efficiency) is a more serious problem than solving fusion power. If we had a way to efficiently utilize nuclear thermal heat, we don\u0027t need Fusion, fission would do for now. Fusion only appears to be a solution to space energy problems because we don\u0027t have it. If we had fusion we would suddenly realize how far we are from interstellar power. Of course, if you are on Europa or some other Jovian moon, fusion might be very attractive, given all the ice you have to melt, but its not in a mode in near or mid future to be plucking gasses off the sun. Its just not. Thus the Fusion powered tug I designed could never exist, it does not have enough radiator mass, probably off by a factor of 100 in constituitive vessel mass. (meaning that thus is more like\u00A0 0.0001 instead of 0.01.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK so here is the analysis\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpiralling out of orbit using Nuclear power is \u003Cu\u003Every wasteful\u003C/u\u003E.
