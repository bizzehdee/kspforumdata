Not only does the ring rotate with orbital velocity, but there is additional velocity that creates a ficticious centrifugal force that works as artificial gravity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we assume a ring at twice Kerbin\u0027s geostationary orbit altitude (2869km), then if it orbits normally, the acceleration due to gravity is 0.088m/s/s. The velocity of this ring if it were forced to be keostationary would be 1843.6m/s. The acceleration toward the centre would be 0.54m/s/s (and the acceleration felt would probably be 0.45m/s/s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we use the Earth as an example, then at 180,000km (one half of the Moon\u0027s perigee), acceleration due to gravity would be 0.012m/s/s. If this ring were forced to be geostationary, its velocity would be about 13.09km/s. Centripetal acceleration would be 0.95m/s/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf instead we want centripetal acceleration to be one gee (9.81m/s/s), then the velocity required would be 42.02km/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we want the acceleration to be 0.5 gee, then the required velocity would be 29.71km/s/s. This is only 70m/s less than Earth\u0027s orbital velocity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, these values of accelerations are quite small, requiring ridiculous velocities to work. For example, to dock with this ring, such a spacecraft would need at least 52km/s delta-v. If the ship fails to dock, it will be flung out of Earth\u0027s SOI at up to 42km/s, escaping the sun with initial velocity of up to 71.8km/s. This is 19.33km/s less than the velocity required to escape the Milky Way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if this ring orbited the Sun (preferably inside Mercury\u0027s orbit), then with a radius of 23,000,000,000 metres, the required velocity for one gee is 475km/s. This shows me that the slowest ring would be at the lowest possible altitude (as we would not want people accidentally whizzing out of the milky way). Should\u0027ve been obvious, really, but oh well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 7000km altitude (well above the messy atmospheric drag - hopefully), the required velocity for one gee is 11.2km/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould this work at all, or am I simply a madman \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LewisTherin","CreatedById":55124,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-18T13:17:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo you mean build a ring at a given radius and then spin it faster, right? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven that the radius of the orbit is intrinsically linked to the velocity, I would have thought that would lead to immense forces acting on the ring trying to push it out to a higher orbit (stretching the ring outwards in that radial plane in all directions at once), tearing it apart in the process, but it would be interesting to check what sort of material strengths you\u0027d require for that not to happen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Awaras","CreatedById":15671,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-18T14:03:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you read the \u0027ringworld\u0027 novels by Larry Niven?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-18T20:10:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re definitely a madman, but where there\u0027s a will, there\u0027s a way.

That way, the center core sections would be a microgravity environment (which does have many uses), and the wheels would be your 1G living spaces and long-term habitable areas. Each wheel would essentially be something akin to a city block, and the core axis like the roadways connecting them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust my take on it...
