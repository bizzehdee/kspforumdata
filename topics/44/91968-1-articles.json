There\u0027s more than a dozen Moon landers heading over there in 2015, and some of those are \u003Cem\u003Estudent projects\u003C/em\u003E.

If you go to the gym for the first time and demonstrate to the ripped guy next to you that you can bench press a beginner level weight, does he really have to go ahead and prove that he can do it too? Even though he did that much and more years ago? The analogy is perhaps a little flawed (there\u0027s no \u0027beginner level\u0027 in lunar soft landing), but the point is: the countries who have already pulled off that much and more don\u0027t have anything to prove just because a newcomer demonstrates that they can join the club.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the capability to do Moon missions isn\u0027t exclusively a government domain anymore either. Just as the private sector is taking over launch services, I bet that we will be seeing a private lunar soft landing succeed within the next 12 months.
