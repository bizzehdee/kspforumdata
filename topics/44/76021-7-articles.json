There is a huge difference between something that works on paper and an operational design. Once the development work really starts, you typically hit roadblocks that were not apparent earlier and the designs get more complex, more expensive, and take much longer to complete that origically planned.

They were relying on the electric output from an ACC on board nuclear reactor to provude liquid oxygen and hydrogen, both stages required Liguid O2. The storage capacity of the gases woukd require a third vessel, and the production time would have benn horrific at 1960s electrlyisis capability. To make this rocket feasable they would need vessel much larger than a carrier with several nucear facilities and a large storage capacity, in addition placing these liquid fuels under water would generate a large icing problem that also would have to be dealt with. if the USN needs nuc powered vessels to improve performance they are going to get the best, but the per watt cost of power on land are not as good as other fuels, and when we deduct the sheer size of the rocket and the inefficiency of electrolysis at sea, its a genuinly bad idea. On land, there is always excess capacity at night and so the capital costs of power don\u0027t need to be considered, and hydrogen can be made from methane.
