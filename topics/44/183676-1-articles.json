NASA\u0027s jumped through more hoops before, only this time they don\u0027t have to engineer brand new technologies and equipment based on theoretical experience. The US is the only nation on Earth that can use it\u0027s prior experience to make it happen. Also NASA doesn\u0027t play to do it alone. I see nothing stating that NASA plans on doing it solo so I could expect NASA to work hand-in-hand along side ULA, Blue Origin and SpaceX to get payloads to the moon to accelerate their lunar architecture. Besides, an intensive schedule over a shorter timeframe, with a concrete date (rather than a timeline) draws us to achievement. This isn\u0027t Apollo. We don\u0027t need to do an Apollo 8 flyby first, nor an Apollo 7 orbital test flight. We can do a quick test of the lunar lander at LOP-G, return it, have the crew board soon after and land and return using Orion. Many of the steps and delays that plagued the Kennedy goal to the moon were related with trial and error just to get there for the first time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApollo 4, the first flight (that I\u0027m considering, not earlier SA/AS flights) took flight in 1967. Apollo 11 landed in 1969. 2 years later. So this kind of jump is easily feasible. \u003Cem\u003E\u0022But Zoo, SLS is only slated to launch once a year at most\u0022\u003C/em\u003E, as of current reports. This new goal may cause a shift. I can\u0027t claim to know what\u0027s happening internally with this new proposal, and for all we know after SLS\u0027 maiden 2020 flight, NASA may shift funding to make multiple launches feasible. \u003Cstrong\u003EBut\u003C/strong\u003E, even if NASA can\u0027t, this again isn\u0027t NASA alone. NASA can and \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ewill\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E utilize their commercial (and international partners as they already stated in their press release) partners to make this goal. I\u0027m certain to help with this goal, SpaceX will be called upon for cargo launches, and for more vital and essential elements NASA will employ ULA to launch them using the ever proven Atlas V, and may even call upon the Atlas V should the payload exceed the FH\u0027s payload fairing size.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith NASA\u0027s planned missions, they probably don\u0027t need a crewed SLS launch every year, and using the Falcon Heavy/Atlas V for any cargo, they could get away with 5 missions by the end of 2025. Apollo had 6 missions between Apollo 4\u0027s first all up test and the penultimate moment that was Apollo 11. Assuming we don\u0027t do a repeat unmanned mission, we can skip Apollo 6, and if we skip any LEO test flights (and if we do any LEO test flights, they could be done using the Falcon 9 or Atlas V instead), which would skip Apollos 7, and 9. Leaving only Apollos 8, 10, and the end goal, 11. So to match SLS\u0027 launches with these remaining missions. We have EM-1, or Apollo 4 in 2020, EM-2 which is comparable to Apollo 8 (while also filling the manned testing portion of Apollo 7) in 2021, followed by hardware testing in lunar orbit, ala Apollo 10, in 2022. Leaving 3 years to deliver crew to the (likely commercial launched) LOP-G.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo it\u0027s crazy. Maddeningly crazy. Likely just a PR stunt and not actually going to happen. But, assuming Bridenstine is smarter than he looks, he might know more than I do and may know that it\u0027s actually feasible. So I put my vote at roughly 33%. It\u0027s feasible. Definitely a possibility, so I can\u0027t say it can\u0027t happen. But will happen? Especially by their timeline? That\u0027s where the % falls off for me. But I\u0027d rather be optimistic. After all I\u0027ve missed a lot in my life already in regards to spaceflight history, so I don\u0027t want to say \u0022it won\u0027t go anywhere\u0022 and miss out.
