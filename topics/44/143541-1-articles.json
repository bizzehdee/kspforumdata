The documentation on the experiment was very intriguing. However I was disappointed\u00A0to find that relevant posts have seemed to have ceased late 2015. (anything more recent appears to be spam bots.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn their forum (not this one) they had also discussed joining forces with these guys\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://sites.google.com/site/kommunitycubesat/home\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://sites.google.com/site/kommunitycubesat/home\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Another presumably cancelled cube sat project inspired by KSP, with a slightly more ambitious goal of imaging the moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis personally saddens me here we had a whole bunch of people that came together and wanted to do space stuff, they were serious about it too! The MosSat people were doing ground experiments and getting in touch with biologists, KSI LIS-1 had actually gotten a piggy back launch ride with a moon lander aboard a falcon 9 rocket. Real science was going to be done here and perhaps finally a non-government space program could have shut all those moon landing conspiracy theorists up for once (though unlikely as people assume the falcon 9 booster landing is a fake as well.) It\u0027s just sad to see both projects presumably\u00A0gated by funding.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThough the projects may still have some fight in them I still find it interesting that since so much discussion of the projects are documented with some digging someone could easily recreate all the plans that were made for each of these projects.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI personally would love to start my own cubeSat mission, although I would not want to lead a community if I was unsure if the project would get off the ground (literally) as In the case of failure I would want to bring as little people down with me as possible. What Intimidates me mainly however is funding as that seems to be the metaphorical death trap of most projects. Crowed funding is what many people turn to often finding out that it\u0027s really hard to get people to fund something that doesn\u0027t offer them a product. Quite sadly space exploration and research falls right into that niche.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat are your views on cubeSat related projects in general? Should projects like this as\u00A0KSP community projects be continued? Many projects like these fall below the successful funding threshold and are left to fade on some distant server somewhere. Space isn\u0027t easy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-11T09:52:54Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2016 09:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Skript88\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
