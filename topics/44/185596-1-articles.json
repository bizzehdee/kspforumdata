Anything solid is going to shatter it, of course, and there\u0027s way too much debris to account for all the stuff in orbit, so you\u0027d need something fairly gentle and indiscriminate. Such as gasses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s what I mean: instead of a kinetic/explosive missile, you launch a bunch of gas canisters on a suborbital trajectory, and detonate them in the path of the debris you\u0027re trying to deorbit. The debris flies through the gas and slows down ever so slightly, maybe enough to make a difference over time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould this be at all practical? Flying through a thin cloud of gas wouldn\u0027t fragment a dead satellite, would it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngrybobH","CreatedById":165814,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-18T18:48:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you detonated a gas canister wouldn\u0027t you be adding more debris? Of course, if the debris was suborbital, it wouldn\u0027t be that much of a problem but, that debris could be struck by what you are trying to deorbit. I see potential problems. As far as an object flying through the gas, it could be utterly obliterated if the gas was sufficiently dense or the object was sufficiently flimsy. Okay, maybe that\u0027s an edge case. I do see a potential problem with delivering enough gas at the precise time to make any real difference at all. The question is would it at least be worth the effort and cost to launch a \u0027gas bomb\u0027? Someone smarter than me could probably answer that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like the laser method better. Far less explody but not without its\u0027 own issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cunjo Carl","CreatedById":162109,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-18T21:12:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s an interesting idea! We could even avoid the canisters altogether by just bringing up a liquid that could evaporate like like liquid nitrogen (or perhaps even water). For maximum effectiveness, we would want to bring the gas up into a retrograde orbit, so each atom will hit the satellites/debris as hard as possible. Even still, given the scale of space it would still take a great number of orbits through the gas to meaningfully slow a satellite.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut here\u0027s the tricky part, anywhere near the Earth our gas atoms will drag on the tenuous atmosphere and deorbit themselves much faster than a satellite would. Meanwhile if the atoms were farther away from the Earth, they\u0027d get swept away by the solar wind! I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any happy medium for our gas atoms to orbit stably. Perhaps this is a good thing, because if gas could orbit stably, each time a rocket burns in orbit it could smear quite the mess across the sky!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe alternative would be to try to deorbit the satellite it all in one shot with tons of gas particles. A great source of directed gas particles would be a normal rocket engine! It\u0027s funny to think about the physics of deorbiting a satellite by pointing a rocket engine at it. The present ideas in progress are instead a space harpoon, and a space net. If I\u0027ve understood it correctly, the idea behind the net is to attach a big high drag surface onto the satellite so it naturally drags harder against the atmosphere. They\u0027ve actually even tested it in orbit!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ctable border=\u00221\u0022 cellpadding=\u00221\u0022 cellspacing=\u00221\u0022 style=\u0022width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003Ctbody\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/PIfRPTIgXuw?start=90\u0026amp;feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003C/tr\u003E\u003C/tbody\u003E\u003C/table\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-19T07:27:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223621262\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022185596\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221560892357\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022162109\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cunjo Carl\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, Cunjo Carl said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut here\u0027s the tricky part, anywhere near the Earth our gas atoms will drag on the tenuous atmosphere and deorbit themselves much faster than a satellite would.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn artifical or captured LEO comet.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA piece of sublimating material with a command module on front side.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters keep the comet oriented always prograde.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rear side sublimates, the gas flow produces both low thrust, holding the comet in orbit, and\u00A0 gas cloud deorbiting the scattered debris.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters also redirect the sublimated gas.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe front side is covered with reflective thin film (or painted so).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith additional admixtures can be used as a fumigator against space moths.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpd.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe comet orbits in retrograde direction, so the debris hit the gas cloud at 16 km/s, partially evaporate, and the drag force is added to the thrust produced by the sublimating debris material.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-19T08:07:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2019 08:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by kerbiloid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-19T08:59:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrbit a payload that\u00A0deploys a gigantic\u00A0plastic bag that fills with chemicals to create a low-density\u00A0expanding foam.
