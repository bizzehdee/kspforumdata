The CRS contract with NASA stipulates a new Dragon for every CRS flight, so the returned capsules cannot be reflown for that purpose. And there currently are no other customers for cargo Dragons. So in order to reduce cost, SpaceX is salvaging the easily reusable parts (like avionics and stuff) and uses them to build new Dragons. This, of course, renders the old Dragons inoperable, and as such they remain sitting in a warehouse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpaceX does occasionally exhibit a returned Dragon capsule here and there at trade fairs and other events.
