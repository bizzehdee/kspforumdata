Water can make propellant to bring cargo and crews back from the moon and propel a space economy, but specifics are not so good. You see Water needs to be converted to Liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, a rather energy intensive process. Lets say you have 1 MW thermal of power to work with, that could produce 100 tons of propellant at 10% efficency (electrolysis loses, coversion to electricity\u00A0loses, power mining equipment, cryo coolers) in \u003Cstrong\u003E155 days,\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Eor \u003Cstrong\u003E235 tons\u003C/strong\u003E a year. Half of that fuel is lost to get it to lunar orbit, only about 25% if we consider reusuable fuel shuttles from the surface and back, so that coming to ~56 tons of propellant\u00A0in as far as Earth-Moon L2 per year.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo provide that much power it is often assumed that requires nuclear reactors, its easily possible to do 1 kg/kw thermal, but the added electrical conversion equipment and radiators is going to bring that up to 20-40 kg/kw, so that comes to 40 ton power plant, landed on the moon. But wait that is not including the electolysis and cryoplant for making and liquifying the fuel.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSolar panels can do at most 2 kg/kw, but at least that is as electricity, but that is not including stuctural mass which is going to be more on the moon then in zero gravity. Lets say 10\u00A0kg/kw and an efficency of 20% instead of 10% (so\u00A0500 kWe is needed instead of 1000 kWh)\u00A0and that comes to 5 tons, not bad. At the poles of the moon there are places of \u0022eternal sunlight\u0022 where direct\u00A0sun light is available 80-90% of the time, so it may be possible with present day solar photovoltaics to buid multple megawatts worth of solar power farms at the moons poles. Lets say 30% efficent solar panels\u00A0are used, hung from a mast a 35\u00A0m by 7\u00A0m array\u00A0could produce 100\u00A0kw, this mind you is 2-3 times more\u00A0efficient then the ones on the ISS.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdd the mass for electrolysis and cyrocoolers and radiators, lots of radiators, we\u00A0are likely talking about at least 100 tons of eqipment for at most 1 tons of fuel a day.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-12T00:57:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a paper from the 1990s someplace around here that shows that lunar \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E basically just offsets landing costs (in propellant).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA better place for a propellant depot using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E is in an Earth Moon Lagrange point, and find a NEO object with water to drag there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHonestly, as a few people have said since te 1960s, if you can reuse spacecraft, and massively reduce the cost to LEO, everything becomes much simpler.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n235 tons a year in your example is not that many launches of something like Starship.
