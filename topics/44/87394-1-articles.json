It could have just as easily been Earth- no actually, it could have MORE easily been Earth, since Earth is a bigger target to hit. I wonder what people\u0027s reactions would have been- I would assume we would have started a rush program to build several nuclear interceptors. Nuclear explosives are the only tech we have that could possibly deliver enough of a punch in the short time we would have had before impact. Other proposed means of asteroid/comet deflection take too much time. That this comet is so small (700 meters in diameter) would certainly help our ability to push it off course with nuclear explosions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tutrakan4e\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tutrakan4e\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPlease make some pictures for me since my brother killed my telescope\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a large dobsonian, so it\u0027s for visual only.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tech Support","CreatedById":89874,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-17T12:28:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan we expect some fancy pictures from the 5 orbiters around Mars ??\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E( 100 posts ! yay !! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E )\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aethon","CreatedById":110755,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-19T16:10:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETodays\u0027 the day!
