Life living on a much different chemistry. I think titan has chances. It has cryovolcanism(Sotra Facula), and it likely erupts water and ammonia. That means that beneath said feature, there could be a reservoir filled with an water/ammonia mix. If that is true, which it likely is, titan may have more potential than Europa. Titan has the atmosphere. Landing there will be like earth. The geologist inside of me wants to know.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t discount metanogens either. It would require a completely different chemistry to use methane as solvent, but low temperatures mean that you would need something other than hydrogen bonds to keep your complex molecules together, and having a non-polar solvent does allow you to do that. So we might see life in methane oceans that does not rely on water at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-27T00:27:55Z\u0022 title=\u002210/27/2013 12:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by K^2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mdatspace","CreatedById":83778,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T00:43:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, Squad have been talking about a second gas giant.

If so, hydrothermal vents could easily hold life. Methane is not as good of a solvent as water. Where the cryovolcanism is at, there is heat. That certainly helps life.
