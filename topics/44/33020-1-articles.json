They\u0027re different orders of magnitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe original plan was for the SLS/Orion to have their first manned flight test in 2021 with a crew orbiting the Moon and then coming back to Earth. The asteroid retrieval plan only changes that slightly. The astronauts would still go into an orbit (a higher orbit) around the Moon, it\u0027s just that there will be an asteroid there for them to study. The main benefit of the asteroid mission would not be the manned part, but the development of the Solar Electric Propulsion stage which would move the asteroid. That technology could later be used on other things like sending heavy cargo to Mars for a manned Mars landing. It\u0027s also nice to practice moving asteroids around if we want to use them for something like extracting resources from them, or redirecting an impactor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cost of the asteroid retrieval mission is about $2.6 billion over 10 years. That\u0027s about the same as the cost of the Curiosity Mars rover, or 1-2% of NASA\u0027s budget over that period. In order to land on the Moon, we need to develop, test, and build a lander, which is estimated to cost about $8-10 billion. And if we want to stay on the Moon for long periods of time, like having a base, we would also have to develop some kind of habitat and associated infrastructure, which would also cost many billions of dollars. So building a Moon base is not really comparable to the asteroid retrieval mission in terms of cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with this bill is not that it redirects NASA to make a Moon base, it\u0027s that it doesn\u0027t give NASA any additional funding to do that. In fact it cuts NASA\u0027s budget and caps it (doesn\u0027t allow it to increase) for the next few years. Telling NASA to do something and then not funding it is probably the worst way to go, because it\u0027s going to result in massive schedule slips and cost overruns, and probably a lot of cancelled missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe discussion should be more about the overall architecture, not a single mission like the asteroid retrieval. There are two basic paths for future manned spaceflight that people are talking about. One is the president\u0027s plan which is about going to Mars as the main goal. To do that, you would need to develop some capabilities first, such as a heavy lift rocket, a deep-space habitat, a Mars EDL (entry, descent, and landing) system, and maybe some better propulsion options like SEP or nuclear thermal rockets, which would be big cost savers in the long run. The asteroid retrieval mission would demonstrate the SEP stage very well, which could later be used for cargo flights to Mars without having to spend billions more designing one. Later, around 2025, there would be a long duration flight to a large \u0022free range\u0022 asteroid (~1km size). This flight would develop the capability of a deep-space habitat which would be virtually the same as the one needed to go to Mars. This would lead to a Mars mission in 2033 or 2035.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other main path, which Congress seems to like, is a return to the Moon. We would start with developing a lander which would lead to short duration Moon landings around 2022 or so. Then we would start longer duration Moon surface missions in the late 2020s and build a permanently manned base in the early 2030s. This would demonstrate a low-gravity surface habitat similar to one that could be used on Mars, but we would still need to develop a deep space habitat and Mars EDL system. This would lead to a Mars mission around 2040.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second option would have higher costs simply because it takes a lot to get to the Moon. The delta-v required to reach the surface of the Moon is greater than the delta-v required to reach the surface of Mars. ( 9500 m/s Earth surface to LEO \u002B 3000 m/s LEO to Moon transfer \u002B 700 m/s Moon transfer to LLO \u002B 1600 m/s LLO to Moon surface = 14800 m/s Earth surface to Moon surface. 9500 m/s Earth surface to LEO \u002B 3200 m/s LEO to Earth escape \u002B 600 m/s Earth escape to Mars transfer \u002B 0 m/s slowing down in Mars\u0027 atmosphere \u002B 500 m/s retrorockets Mars atmosphere to Mars surface = 13800 m/s Earth surface to Mars surface. ) Because of the rocket equation this means that putting a certain mass on the Moon requires more mass to LEO than putting the same mass on Mars. Granted a mission to Mars would take a lot more mass on the surface than a mission to the Moon, but if we wanted to build a base on the Moon the costs would be similar to a base on Mars.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceisbeautifulul","CreatedById":68592,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-15T21:40:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022M5000\u0022 data-cite=\u0022M5000\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s not forget the city in the sky, the ISS is still going.
