There are three species of\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loricifera\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eloricifera\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0known to be anaerobic, where their mitochondria (they are the powerhouse of the cell) can operate in oxygen free environment, a new critter (\u003Cem\u003EHenneguya salminicola\u003C/em\u003E) has been identified which has no\u00A0mitochondria (blackout of the cell). It lack the genetics\u00A0to make them. That is a first in multicellular world. In additional contrast to the aforementioned loricifera, these buggers don\u0027t live in extreme environments of deep sea hypersaline brine\u00A0lakes. These are a species of a parasite found in salmon, so plenty of oxygen there. They just chose not to use it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200225114408.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200225114408.htm\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-find-the-first-animal-that-doesn-t-need-oxygen-to-survive\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-find-the-first-animal-that-doesn-t-need-oxygen-to-survive\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is still not fully understood how the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EHenneguya salminicola\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0can maintain its life, and what the actual replacement for mitochondria is.
