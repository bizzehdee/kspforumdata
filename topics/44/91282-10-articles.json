There are spontaneous fission processes with heavy products as well. Likewise, there are alpha/beta decays that are triggered by neutron capture. The difference is specifically that RTGs tend to rely on spontaneous decay, while reactors and nukes rely on capture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI read an article about 10 years ago, maybe more in which you have an RTG in which the two radioactive materials were embedded in a rubbery plastic, when they roll into each other the generator core they exchange particles and react with each other producing heat and fueling the thermocouple. I imagine if the craft still had fuel to manuever the rubber would be cut and it would drift into space. This was an idea for fuel deep space spacecraft with lifespans of 50 to 200 years. I think the Voyager craft have another decade left in their RTGs before they do not have enough to power the antenna and they will go silent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActaully denser will work better but not because of nuetron decay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDenser works better because if you thermocouple is at the center of the mass, the absolute heat gradient increases from the interior to the exterior.
