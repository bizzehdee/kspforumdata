Genetics also governs how large our jaws are when we are born, but the amount of chewing we do as we grow has a significant effect on jaw size: children who eat tough, hard-to-chew foods develop larger jaws, those who are fed soft foods develop smaller jaws. A high-protein diet tends to increase jaw development. Those who have smaller jaws are more likely to get wisdom tooth impaction - the main reason for wisdom tooth removal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is reflected in the prevalence of wisdom-tooth impaction in different cultures. In much of the developing world wisdom tooth impaction is rare. They have many other problems, but their wisdom teeth usually have enough room to develop. In China, wisdom tooth impaction is a serious problem, and has been that way for so long that a mutation inhibiting the development of wisdom teeth is becoming increasingly common. In Western developed nations wisdom tooth impaction is pretty common, though a high-protein diet and (in some countries) a preference for heavier breads helps reduce this compared to China.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs everybody assumes, our distant ancestors ate very tough foods - badly cooked roots, meat killed on the run (which makes it tough), and nuts and seeds that have to be extracted from tough cases.
