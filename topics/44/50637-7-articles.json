I can think of arguments for and against having a space program when there is so much poverty. By the way, I speak as a citizen of another country which has a lot of poverty: I\u0027m Mexican.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn reality this question goes so much beyond just space programs and specific countries. I\u0027m an astronomer and I\u0027ve often been asked how do we justify spending billions in building huge telescopes when there are, for instance, millions starving in Africa. Astronomy doesn\u0027t directly improve the quality of life of people around the world. So I think it\u0027s a valid moral question to raise, and I\u0027ve seen it pop up in discussions many times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most satisfying answer I\u0027ve read is the following. There are two ways to make the world a better place: 1) reduce the suck; 2) increase the awesome. In other words, while it\u0027s important to improve the living conditions of those less privileged around the world, it\u0027s also important to promote human activities that are done out of passion and that give people things to dream about and provide sources of awe and admiration. These activities keep the human spirit going. What\u0027s the point of having well-fed, healthy, long-living individuals if they have nothing to dream about, no awe-inspiring things to give them a reason to work passionately? Space programs are one such thing, in my opinion. So are astronomy, poetry, pure mathematics, music, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you allow me saying it, though, India does have to address the severe poverty problem it faces. But it doesn\u0027t have to be at the expense of its space program. Keeping it will inspire many future generations of scientists and engineers and give the general public a reason to dream on. And I\u0027m sure there are many other budgetary items that can go before the space program.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tech Support","CreatedById":89874,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-25T05:54:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd they finally released a photo !! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETaken from a height of 7300 km; with 376 m spatial resolution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://scontent-a-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/v/t1.0-9/1601064_1556527811237242_6484338843541089909_n.jpg?oh=fc545bf01b2eeb0ea79664f6402d38dd\u0026amp;oe=548F1B6A\u0022 alt=\u00221601064_1556527811237242_6484338843541089909_n.jpg?oh=fc545bf01b2eeb0ea79664f6402d38dd\u0026amp;oe=548F1B6A\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-25T06:13:09Z\u0022 title=\u002209/25/2014 06:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Tech Support\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Meithan","CreatedById":76123,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-25T16:00:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tech Support\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tech Support\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd they finally released a photo !! \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWOW!
