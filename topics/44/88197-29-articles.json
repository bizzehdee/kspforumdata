However, if I had been given any power to pursue my own goals, I would have been a \u003Cem\u003Emad scientist\u003C/em\u003E - or rather, as the case usually is, a \u003Cem\u003Emad \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eengineer\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E. I don\u0027t care much for theory and the \u0022how\u0022, except as a followup to \u0022whether\u0022. Putting the EMDrive in orbit and turning it on would make a definitive test for its usefulness as a low-Earth-orbit maneuvering engine, however it would say nothing of its usefulness as an interplanetary transfer engine, much less interstellar, so even more tests would have to follow - and setting the device up to perform \u003Cem\u003Ethose\u003C/em\u003E tests is much more involved and complicated. Plus, with the variable and uncertain nature of the EMDrive, various changes in configuration would have to be performed to make \u003Cem\u003Esure\u003C/em\u003E that it works or doesn\u0027t work, which is extra effort and extra things that would have to be planned for. The basic test would have been simple, but any actual testing would need a lot of time and effort. And, accordingly, money. Nobody wants to waste money on a single experiment that isn\u0027t going to prove anything but \u0022this particular configuration works/doesn\u0027t work in this particular circumstance\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs long as it\u0027s simpler and cheaper to keep running tests on the ground, tests will be run on the ground. Sure, it\u0027s slower, it lacks the immediate answer capacity, and all it really is is a lot of filler between the drive and a proper test in orbit, but it provides more accurate data, is easier to manage, and doesn\u0027t cost much money. Once/if it\u0027s been determined that total lack of intervening gases is not an obstacle to the EMDrive, and the produced effect is (reasonably) beyond doubt not an instrument error or a product of some other odd interaction, the whole thing will be sent into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s no point rushing it along with insufficient data and risk running a definitive test in suboptimal circumstances.

Generally, it contains no physical particles. Zero-point field is sometimes used as a synonym for the \u003Cstrong\u003Evacuum\u003C/strong\u003E state of an individual quantized field. - Wikipedia) The microwaves use the quantum virtual particles in the quantum vaccum as propellant. The engine uses magnetic fileds to propel the particles out the back as thrust. The reason that this is said to defy the laws of physics is because of whats said in the definition \u0022it contains no physical particles.\u0022 But as you read at the top, NASA has obviously defied this theory and has proven that it is possible to do. NASA speculates that this engine could send a craft to Mars during a transfer window in just 70 days. A bit of other info, A company in Texas has a new engine called the VASMIR that has been estimated to have a 39 day transfer time to mars.
