SpaceX has based their cost reduction on mass producing Merlin engines and stages, but there will never be a mass production of lunar landers in the foreseeable future. They are always going to be expensive and they go through a much less wear and tear, so it makes sense to try to reuse them. We have restartable engines, we have space vehicles that have shut down, restarted, and have lasted several years.
