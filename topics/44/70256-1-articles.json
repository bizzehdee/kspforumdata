Interesting question. I would think it would have huge deserts, yes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s an overstatement to say the interior of Pangaea was like a \u0022Martian desert\u0022 though... apparently it\u0027s more complicated than \u0022moist coastlines, totally dead desert interior\u0022. Some parts were desert, yes, but probably not all the interior. Apparently Pangaea had a really extreme monsoon climate (\u0022megamonsoon\u0022) so some parts of the interior got lots of rain at certain seasons... but were dry other times... while other areas were always desert. Very seasonal and very \u0022continental\u0022 (hot summers/cold winters), with defined latitude zones, including apparently a moist equatorial belt. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/JD094iD03p03341/abstract\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/JD094iD03p03341/abstract\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.pnas.org/content/108/22/8972\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.pnas.org/content/108/22/8972\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I see references to huge amounts of evaporites though so there were major deserts in some parts... but do you have a source for them being basically lifeless?
