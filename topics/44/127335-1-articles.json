the first thing you\u0027d do if you really had stuff like this would be to optimize it. \u00A0These virtual humans wouldn\u0027t have senses and reflexes they don\u0027t need any more, they\u0027d probably be much smarter and have all kinds of integrated helper subsystems in their minds.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s the intelligent part. \u00A0The hardware part, well, as I said, nanoscale assembly lines. \u00A0Millions of em. \u00A0Redundant. \u00A0As entropy damages this machine, here\u0027s what happens : say entropy damages a nanoscale assembly line. \u00A0There were 100 copies of this line, now there are 99. \u00A0A replication order gets placed once enough are damaged. \u00A0A robot goes out and grabs the module containing the damaged line, and puts it into the intake hopper of a plasma furnace. \u00A0The damaged component gets converted to plasma, separated using electromagnets (basically a calutron) to constituent elements, and the elements get made into feedstock in chemical synthesis reactors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe feedstock feeds into the nanoassembly lines, who combined the feedstock molecules into larger components, which feed more lines, which...until you are back to solid robotic systems that look exactly like the systems that were in the damaged component. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou then replace the damaged module, everything back to normal. \u00A0You have to do this continuously - in a very real way, this machine is \u0022alive\u0022 in that it needs a constant supply of energy to keep remanufacturing itself and if the power supply fails for a long enough period of time, enough parts will fail that the machine will not be able to function even if the power is restored later. \u00A0(it would be \u0022dead\u0022)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo these machines have to hang out near stars, collecting solar energy from the burning of matter, or they die. \u00A0Eventually. \u00A0Obviously you could launch machines with a vast store of stored energy -

the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Einformation\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eneeded for these machines - these include the digital files for the \u0022personalities\u0022 who operate them, the digital files describing the exact schematics for each onboard component, and so on - need to be kept where there\u0027s a hash associated with every piece of data, and it\u0027s raided with about x10 redundancy, the data copied in separate modules all over the machine. \u00A0Periodically, every piece of stored information gets compared with it\u0027s hash (every \u0022sector\u0022 in the data store subsystem), and if the hash doesn\u0027t match, that particular copy of the information gets deleted and restored with information from the 10 times redundancy information. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis reduces the chance of random mutation to \u0022not gonna happen before the stars run out of gas\u0022. \u00A0Actual engineers designing these machines might use more or less redundancy, I\u0027m just giving example numbers to illustrate the idea. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, this constant copying process requires energy, or the machines \u0022die\u0022. \u00A0Eventually -
