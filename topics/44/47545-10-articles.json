However, the fact that Americans use about twice as much energy per capita for the same standard of living should be seen as encouraging. It shows that there isn\u0027t a hard and fast rule for joules per dollar of GDP. In fact growth in several European countries (such as Denmark and Sweden) have shown a marked decoupling between GDP growth and energy use. The UK uses the same amount of energy per capita now that it did 50 years ago, despite GDP growing 2700%. These are all encouraging signs that we might be able to make it work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JiWint","CreatedById":78150,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T19:01:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHumans selfishness\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aladran","CreatedById":2055,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T19:07:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOverpopulation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe don\u0027t know how to manage our ressource but we are still growing in number...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will hit a breaking point, where an overpopulated earth will see a great disparities between the rich and the poor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the rich tend to be richer and fewer, and the poor get poorer a in a larger number. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will get to a point of big social challenges regarding, health care, feeding, housing, etc...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-08T18:49:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PenguinsMeep\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PenguinsMeep\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe only thing you need are robots and engineers.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen they have to compete with the first world countries who have plenty of both. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo its not an catastrophe however China\u0027s growth is a large part that they make factory workers out of peasants and gain an magnitude increase in productivity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the supply of workers dries out they have to increase productivity who is harder and gives less growth.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mardlamock","CreatedById":38972,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-12T04:36:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGovernments and monopolies.
