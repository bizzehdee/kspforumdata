And in the event of an accident or sabotage, the EPR\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s double-walled containment structure would hold up better than the standard single-walled one. The EPR is also designed with a core catcher to prevent the core from melting through the reactor vessel during a severe accident. (As noted, the core catcher is a novel feature, and may not have much better than a 50 percent chance of working.) However, the design for the EPR at Olkiluoto, Finland, had to be upgraded to comply with a post-9/11 requirement that the plant be able to withstand the impact of a commercial aircraft. 131 Without a similar NRC requirement, the U.S. EPR could, and most likely would, be based on the initial, less robust design. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, yeah.
