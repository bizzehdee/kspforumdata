While the surgeon was not exactly competent, Korolev was probably going to die no matter what. He had an undiscovered tumor, and even if he hadn\u0027t died during surgery he was probably going to die soon.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEven if Korolev lives, while the N-1 might work eventually, the Soviets aren\u0027t going to get to the Moon first. The LK hadn\u0027t even had a test flight by 1969, nor had the LOK.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe show claims the Soviets don\u0027t care about the lives of their cosmonauts, but this is only somewhat true. By 1966 the L3 complex had actually evolved from a single launch with the N-1 to a dual launch mission, one N-1 with a backup lander and a radio beacon-rover based on the Lunokhod, and then the second N-1 with the crewed spacecraft, all in the name of safety. The Soviets were fully capable of carrying out a crewed lunar flyby if they wanted to, and yet they chose not to due to the unreliability of the spacecraft. Even in the case of the Voskhod missions they at least made an effort to follow the regulations then in place for certifying a spacecraft for crewed flight, and therefore they were unlikely to do a crewed lunar launch immediately after one flight of the N-1 (which is what happens in the show)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThomas Paine, the NASA administrator at the time of Apollo 11, was a Democrat, not a Republican yes-man as depicted in the show. His line \u0022John Glenn is a Democrat so his opinion doesn\u0027t matter\u0022 when there is a meeting about recruiting female astronauts is very bizarre. In addition, he was known for going against the wishes of President Nixon (Nixon wanted to select the cheapest option for maintaining crewed spaceflight in the future, while Paine pushed for the Integrated Program Plan, a massive program involving space stations, a lunar base, flights to Mars, and the space shuttle). So his yes-man behavior is very out of character, even in the event of the Soviets landing first.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe show has Nixon deciding to place blame on NASA, specifically Werner Von Braun, for the failure of the Moon landing. In real life, Nixon actually did plan on blaming someone if the Moon landing failed, but not Von Braun- Thomas Paine. This is why Nixon kept Paine on as administrator despite him being a Democrat. So Paine keeping his job while Von Braun gets fired is unrealistic.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe direction of the space program in the show is a little iffy. The characters talk about a lunar base as if it was something super new and unexpected but there had been studies and plans for this with Apollo hardware for years before 1969. If the Soviets landed on the Moon ahead of the Americans in June 1969, rather than suddenly deciding on a \u0022new\u0022 moon base because of intelligence hinting at a Soviet military base on the Moon (which is what happens in the show), they probably simply would have done\u00A0\u0022more\u0022 of the Integrated Program Plan with \u003Cem\u003Emaybe\u003C/em\u003E a lunar base and a stronger commitment to space stations (whereas in real life the Space Shuttle was technically the IPP cut down to nothing but the shuttle itself). It is also very 50/50 as to whether the US would really feel like spending billions more dollars just to match the Soviets or whether they would focus on something with (supposedly) more useful results for humans on Earth; that is, space stations in Earth orbit. Public opinion was already swaying against crewed space exploration before Apollo 11 happened, and the US government had numerous other problems it had to attend to. The antagonism of the USSR had also died down in comparison with the situation in 1961. Robotic space exploration was on the verge of becoming more reliable compared to the early 1960s, and that would also help the argument of abandoning BLEO crewed space exploration after the initial Apollo program. The US very may well have taken the Soviet route- start saying crewed exploration of the Moon is a waste of money and focus on space stations. This show apparently plans to \u0022go to Mars\u0022, however for the same reasons as the Soviets, the US would be fairly unlikely to aim for such a goal after losing the Moon race to try and beat the other guy at \u0022something\u0022- whereas Apollo was somewhat acceptable in terms of cost and reward, the price of a crewed Mars program, just to say \u0022we\u0027re better than the other guy\u0022, along with the major risks of such a mission were simply not worth it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt is relatively unlikely the Soviets would have launched a female lunar mission. The Soviets briefly considered the idea as a way to redeem the value of their crewed lunar program but ultimately decided not to. The only reason they launched Valentina Tereshkova was because they believed the Americans were about to do it with the Mercury 13. If they landed on the Moon first, without any evidence of American women participating in the Apollo program, it is unlikely they would send a woman to the Moon. Historically despite still having some female cosmonauts in the late 1960s, none of them participated in the lunar training program.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe Soviets never had any plans for a military lunar base. Their lunar base (the DLB) was entirely civilian in nature. The Moon did, and still has, zero military usefulness.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIn regards to season 2 (what I have seen in the trailers)-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThe space shuttle would not have looked like that if NASA continued to receive high levels of funding past 1969. The only reason is looks like it does in real life is because NASA had to get the Air Force to lobby for it, which involved giving it cross range capability so it could launch military satellites.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEven in the event of a Soviet moon landing and the initiation of a lunar base project, there were never any plans to send the space shuttle to the Moon. The space shuttle would fly crew to a reusable lunar taxi, which would be propelled to the Moon by a reusable NERVA stage. The taxi would then bring them to the lunar base. Sending the shuttle to the Moon was never considered for all of the physical reasons people have discussed (Scott Manley did a video on it).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDeploying some sort of strategic weapon on the Moon is a dumb idea for both the Soviets and the Americans. If you are putting a strategic weapon in space, why on the Moon, when it can be spied on by the American lunar base? Why not a very high Earth orbit? In addition it would take days for your weapon to reach its target on Earth, by which time it would be detected and a retaliatory strike launched by your enemy. I personally don\u0027t mind it because it as an entertainment TV show, but from the point of trying to make a plausible what if history of if the Soviets built a lunar base, deploying a strategic land attack weapon on it is unrealistic.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis show makes me want to see a parody of the movie First Man, except it is about Alexei Leonov and a successful Soviet moon landing.
