Watching a documentary, I discovered that the Apollo 13 LEM used its engine to \u0022speed up its orbit.\u0022 This is something that has always bothered me about orbital mechanics - how was their trajectory changed to shave a full nine hours off their return time? Was the reentry steeper and hotter? How did the return trajectory match up with the other Apollo missions?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"deadshot462","CreatedById":13659,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-07T00:39:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKeep your Periapsis roughly the same, but burn towards a direction that would throw you out of Earth\u0027s orbit if there was no atmosphere. Basically, Apollo 13 probably made their Apoapsis much higher than what it used to be.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbin Dallas Multipass","CreatedById":79477,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-07T01:36:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInteresting question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll I could find out is this: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey had to re-establish their free return trajectory by burning the LM engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis trajectory gave them a moon periapsis of 100km higher than \u0022normal\u0022 (not sure if higher than free return or just higher than mission plan)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022speed up the orbit\u0022 burn is called a PC\u002B2 burn, meaning its done 2 hours after lunar periapsis.
