H doesn\u0027t even make sense. The notes in A minor goes A-B-C-D-E-F-G, NOT A-H-C-D-E-F-G.\n\u003E We\u0027ve all got our problems, be it ridiculous musical scales or other scales. Granted, an H won\u0027t total a multi million dollar probe.\n\nThat\u0027s not just Norway, but all over europe (maybe even further). It becomes worse by H\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201E\u00A2\u00C2\u00AD being called \u0022B\u0022 for no reason except tradition whatsoever.\n\nOne could go further and doubt the entire system of 7/12 notes in an octave(=frequency doubling). There are some reasons for this specific choice, but that also applies to some more numbers. But any change to that will probably be met by public stoning or worse..."}]}
