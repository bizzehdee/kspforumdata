Say, to the right.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe fly, simplifying, gets waving slower with right wing, but faster with the left one. So, it rotates to the right, feeling the \u0022pixel tickling\u0022 weakening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the object approaching, its image grows and starts \u0022tickling\u0022 new and new concentric layers of pixels.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe fly gets waving slower with all wings at ones, its velocity starts decreasing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe closer is the object, the faster its angular size grows, the faster the new layers of pixels start being \u0022tickled\u0022 by its image.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, the closer is the object, the slower the fly waves with all its wings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the object image growing and occupying all field of view, the fly retargets on the object detail, so it can sit exactly on your ear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, the fly approaches the landing leg distance when its vertical T/W = 1, and the horizontal ~0, expands landing legs and touches the target at zero contact speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen the fly sees a window, it just can\u0027t see the glass, so it focuses on the objects behind, and unexpectedly hits the invisible surface.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat\u0027s wgy it doesn\u0027t try to escape through the open window aside, it believes its eyes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso that\u0027s why it\u0027s trying to sit on your same ear again and again.

And not that starship moving somewhere, but same universe with him in same starship.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe fly doesn\u0027t calculate, it follows the imaging.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is strange for the modern Copenhagen interpretation, but rather usual for a many-worlds interpretation.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, when the humanity gets approached the understanding that it lives in a multiverse, rather in the simplified world of modern physics, it will become absolutely natural.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Of course, it doesn\u0027t change the safety countermeasures like a prepared safety margin.
