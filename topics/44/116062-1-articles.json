Then you\u0027ll know why genetic engineering in humans is a **BAD** idea.\n\nBecause movies always reflect reality. I\u0027m not saying the issues presented are impossible, but they aren\u0027t certain either. One can\u0027t use the results from one imagined scenario to discount all other possibilities, in fact, movies should warn us of risks and inspire us to prevent them, not discourage any advancement at all \n\nIn any case, humanity would probably have developed some type of cheap, highly effective birth control that would allow women to only get pregent when she desired that was more ubiquitous than forms today, possibly even deactivating genes until they were needed. What I find more messed up about the movie is (IIRC) that the parents were biased against their non-enhanced child when it was their stupid, easily prevented mistakes that put him at a disadvantage in the first place. Otherwise, that Universe was decent. Besides from ethical objectors, the technology would certainly be rolled out to those who couldn\u0027t currently afford it (the middle class could), with government programs helping if it did not. From the point of view of that society, normal people are a drag on society, and costly, so even if ithat society was a unempathetic dystopia it would have reason to give the technology to all within a few generations. The Third World would be likely screwed, but they are now, and eventually they would be treated too. People in Gattaca cared so much about enhancement and were so biased about it charities would likely sprout up offering it to expectant Third World mothers. Besides, manned missions to Titan, man!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-16T14:58:46Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2015 02:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NFUN**"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T15:17:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This discussion has come and gone several times already here on the forum.\n\u003E Go and watch the movie [Gattaca](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119177/). Then you\u0027ll know why genetic engineering in humans is a **BAD** idea.\n\nHollywood tend to get GM as realistic as combat in space. \n\nStuff with high development / fixed costs but low unit cost becomes mass marked, or more accurate they do not take off before becoming mass marked: Computer and mobile phones is the best examples but most industry products with wide interest and modest production cost follows the pattern, also medicine you have to pay for yourself. \n\nYes it will still cost money so if you are poor you are unlikely to afford it. In the beginning it will be expensive, see price development on TV screens, this has some benefits as you get limited exposure in the beginning so bugs get caught. \n\nI see it as an good thing to do if you can do it safe. Now you might get some issues like how the various mods will interact in the next generation, it will not be one but multiple sets also because of price, might be cheaper to do another treatment in another country. You will get fashions.

The how and why in the movie doesn\u0027t matter, what it does display nicely is what can and probably will happen.

Millions die of thirst and starvation. Thinking \u0027we\u0027 would share the genetic mods would be delusional.\n\nThose with money and power can afford to get modified. They will be stronger, faster, smarter and healthier. AS a result they will be richer and more powerful. Those who can not afford modifications, or choose not to for for example religious reasons will earn less and suffer poorer health. They simply can not compete with those modified.

Changing the human genome means something to die off in the process from some failure (yeah, no way to get rid of it). Anyway, I don\u0027t have any idea over how genomes can affect intelligence - AFAIK intelligence can\u0027t be inherited, only passed by habits of the parents. Also, IQ can be raised way simpler than changing some genetic things, not to mention we must know what kind of intelligence they want to have."}]}
