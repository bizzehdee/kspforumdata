However, mass fraction may have little to do with the costs of a rocket, as the costs of fuel are very small when compared to the costs of the engineering program as a whole.

This would give the ability for it to launch from various altitudes in various ways. This could seperate to get payload up. Maybe it doesn\u0027t need to at a high altitude but a slow one skimming through the air at specific altitudes to get as close to escape velocity as possible before using fuel or other propulsions like gas to lower the rocket stage fuel requirements. If you use the same gas as the fuel or part of the fuel would it save fuel if you release some out the front to remove air resistance. It might help if not to deal with all of the heat etc. Again, if it can make the fuel as the ram jets are combusting stuff you could have a small tank fill in flight to use for end rocket stages and the rest constantly coming out to lower thrust needs/flight times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach part of the aircraft could have intakes made for the different mass when together and separated.

My rocket could float at a single altitude indefinitely and then float over to where ever you wanted it to. That could be good for getting payloads to places without having to be over it directly.
