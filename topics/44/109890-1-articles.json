This contrasts from a dry workshop, which would have been constructed from a empty fuel tank on the ground, then sent into orbit. This was studied in the Apollo Applications Program, and was the prime contender for Skylab\u0027s construction before using a dry workshop instead. \n\nWhat do you think guys?\n\nThis is also a \u0022wet workshop\u0022 discussion forum, so discuss away!"},{"CreatedByName":"Kibble","CreatedById":131042,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T02:33:37Z","Content":"The problem with wet workshops is the same as the problem with inflatable habitats - you have to launch it empty.

It would allow space stations to be built quickly for little extra cost, as you would only need to fill it up with equipment (which can be done with another Falcon 9 launch, or, in the case of the Falcon Heavy, just use the extra payload space not taken up by a crewed Dragon to haul up all the goodies needed it it.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T04:52:51Z","Content":"The idea was abandoned for a number of good reasons.

Now the main problem we have is interior walling. It probably be made of thin sheets of aluminum with bolts on each end, so that it could be made in pieces.
