Which begs the question; which of the two planets is more likely; earth, because of the moon left over as a relic from an impact with a body the size of mars? Or Venus, whose cloud cover might obscure the geologic scars following such an event? One way I think we could get more accurate estimates on this is to figure out how large mercury was prior to impact... Possibly by finding the average core:radius ratio in the observed solar system, allowing for an estimate of the size mercury used to be based on how large it\u0027s core is. Ie, one would expect that the cooled core of mars would compare in equal size to that of mercury, assuming mercury was the mars-sized impact which was responsible for the formation of our moon...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore research..

The Earth\u0027s core has two measurements; the solid inner core has a radius of 1,220km, but if the liquid outer core is counted than it measures at radius 3,400km to a planetary radius of 3,390km. Density comes into play here, obviously.. However, I wager that density might be a relic from planetary formation, and would not have anything to do with calculating the previous size of mercury. Thoughts, anyone? Am I even on the right track here or wasting my time?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I realize some of these calculations make no sense.

They found that if a planet about the size of modern Earth collided with proto-Mercury at just the right angle and speed, it would have been possible for proto-Mercury to lose a large portion of its mantle due to it being stripped away. Furthermore, they noted that such an impact would not result in the proto-Mercury being caught in the larger planet\u0027s gravity, effectively turning it into a moon. Such a collision, they also note would have resulted in much of the material ejected into space falling back to the target body, resulting in it being more metal rich than before the impact.\u0022 - \u003Ca href=\u0022http://m.phys.org/news/2014-07-simulations-mercury-victim-hit-and-run-collision.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://m.phys.org/news/2014-07-simulations-mercury-victim-hit-and-run-collision.html\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, an earth sized object, huh?

There may have been like, 7, 8, 10 large inner planets- who knows, maybe more- right after the main phase of planetary accretion was complete. The four inner planets left today are just the survivors in a game of gravitational billiards. If Mercury DID survive a giant impact that blasted off much of its mantle, then the debris that escaped Mercury\u0027s influence was most likely ejected from the solar system or impacted other objects.

However, the likelihood that mercury impacted an earth-sized object and glanced it, and a mars-sized object glanced the earth... It\u0027s a strange coincidence. And is possible. I realize that the early solar system was crowded, with as many as 20 bodies. But many of these were either accreted into the ones left today or else scraped by with minor damage, ie mercury. We don\u0027t have surface samples yet so obviously we cannot confirm any relation between the surface composition of mercury and that of the moon. Even so, I don\u0027t believe that point alone is enough to discredit this. At the very least we should attempt to use the scientific data at our disposal to disprove this hypothesis beyond a shadow of a doubt.
