It will not be used in a telescope as it has a number of chips and a fracture that reduce its usefulness anyway. I worked on it from May to July 2017, with a gap due to technical difficulties and a trip to Alaska. The mirror was made with a 1969 Edmund Scientific kit. It was intended to be f/5 but I ran out of grit and couldn\u0027t afford more at the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have also finished\u00A0a complete 6\u0022 f/4.5\u00A0Dobsonian.\u00A0The mirror blank was given to me by a friend at Stellafane, and I managed to grind, polish, and figure it in August 2017 - see pages 6 to 7.\u00A0I star tested it and looked at Saturn on October 20th to confirm a good figure.\u00A0First light was\u00A0on October 27th.

I bought my roughing grit at a lapidary supply, and got a \u0022grit kit\u0022 for the rest of the grades from the (Seattle) local telescope makers\u0027 club.\u00A0 I wound up with better than 1/5 wave accuracy on the mirror, and an 8\u0022 Newtonian that, side by side at a star party, performs about the same (in terms of what and how well I can see) as a commercial 10\u0022 Schmidt-Cassegrain.\u00A0 Mine is a little more work to point at a specific object and keep tracking, of course, but it was about 1/8 the money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the end, by buying a lot of my \u0022telescope parts\u0022 at the local Lowe\u0027s Home Improvement (for instance, I used a 9\u0022 diameter furnace duct for the tube, 8\u0022 and 9\u0022 duct caps and some bits and pieces became the mirror cell, I bought guitar machine heads to tension the wire spider, which is made from .010\u0022 diameter guitar strings, and I fabricated the diagonal mount from PVC plumbing parts), I spent a total of $500 -- which, at the time, was about $100 less than a commercial 8\u0022 Dobsonian (and I spent a total of around 120 hours which, as hobby time, I don\u0027t count against the cost).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHold yourself to the standard of \u0022if it\u0027s not right, keep at it until it is,\u0022 and you can make a telescope that will do anything a comparable size commercial scope can.\u00A0 And when you\u0027re done, you can spend the rest of your life saying \u0022I made that!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit to add: I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll find you want at least twice the amount of roughing grit in that kit you bought -- drop by a shop that sells lapidary supplies and grab a couple pounds of their 60-80 carborundum, and switch to the kit grit when you\u0027re at the required depth, before making the jump to 120 or 180.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-24T23:14:39Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2017 11:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Zeiss Ikon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdd a thought.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starman4308","CreatedById":122674,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-26T02:01:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t done any telescopy, but I wish you the best of luck making your new telescope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust remember,\u00A0it\u0027s Mars, not Duna (or Gratian) that you\u0027re seeing through the telescope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-26T12:43:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223068005\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022160991\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221495764063\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022122674\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starman4308\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 5/25/2017 at 10:01 PM, Starman4308 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t done any telescopy, but I wish you the best of luck making your new telescope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust remember,\u00A0it\u0027s Mars, not Duna (or Gratian) that you\u0027re seeing through the telescope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve never had luck at seeing much on Mars.
