Alas, asteroids in KSP do not have their own gravity (they\u0027re treated like spaceship parts, not astronomical bodies), so this is impossible.

KSP is excellent at what it does. But it can\u0027t do asteroid systems, and it can\u0027t do long-term accumulation of very tiny effects, and it can\u0027t do design of scientific instruments.

I\u0027d prefer to have more options than just those -- as many options as possible, with different asteroidal compositions and different impact scenarios affecting the effectiveness of different strategies (sometimes, harpoons and nukes are the wrong way to divert an impactor). I\u0027ve had my fun with clamping rocket engines on and pushing, and I\u0027ve done a whole bunch of blasting asteroids out of the way; I\u0027d like to see how I could use that to change an asteroid \u003Cstrong\u003Esystem\u003C/strong\u003E, or how different strategies would have different levels of effectiveness for different types of impactor, or how we can build systems that learn about the scenario \u003Cem\u003Ein situ\u003C/em\u003E and adapt to the specifics found accordingly.
