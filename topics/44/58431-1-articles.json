Seeing how these are launched with Soyuz rockets, and rides on Soyuz manned vehicles cost NASA $60M/seat, and taking into account the fact that Soyuz still carries cargo, we are talking about hundreds of millions per Progress launch. Even if NASA only fronts half for Russian launches, and with other vehicles being cheaper, this can still easily add up to something in the $1b neighborhood just for the unmanned resupply launches. And then there are manned launches, equipment and experiments that need construction/preparation on the ground, all of the personnel that has to do with tracking and planning of missions. $3b/year is actually starting to look quite cheap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for it getting more expensive, Dragon is just entering the stage.
