I\u0027m curious primarily because those are exactly the kind of reactors we could use in a large interplanetary spacecraft. Something that could power one of those big VASIMR engines that some people claimed could get people to Mars in 40 days. The problem is these are always so classified, and finding detailed specs is difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll I really know is a few bits and pieces of last generation. The Ford is going to use the new A1B reactor (totally classified) but we know the Nimitz used 2x A4W, giving it a total of 208 MW in it\u0027s engines. We can assume the new reactor will be somewhat better than this at least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat brings up another question though, how efficient are the engines. Ground-based reactors are around 33% efficient, so you\u0027d need 100 MW of heat from the thing to produce 33 MW of actual electrical power. And I know most 20th century submarines were even less efficient than that because the reactors were so small (they operate around 25% efficient). Are super modern reactors somehow more efficient than that? Another thing I wonder, how heavy are these reactors exactly? It\u0027s all fine and dandy if you can produce 200 MW needed for the VASIMR, but not if the reactor itself is 100 tons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t mean to unveil any state secrets or anything... I\u0027m just really curious for the sake of realistic sci-fi (in an up-to-date sense). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_R._Ford-class_aircraft_carrier\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_R._Ford-class_aircraft_carrier\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A1B_reactor\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A1B_reactor\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A4W_reactor\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A4W_reactor\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warhorse","CreatedById":83495,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T05:10:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENaval reactors aren\u0027t really suitable for spaceflight, as they all weigh at least hundreds of tons.

The low T/W ratio means you spend a year or so gaining velocity that means for manned missions you are exposing your crew to high radiation out of the van Allen belts. Excellent for cargo but for crewed missions I would rather trade off specific impulse for a T/W ratio greater than 1 for a 9 month Hoffman transfer than 13 month transfer including the long slow acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T14:04:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E100 kW output?
