Unlike aluminum or other metals that are monolithic (properties like strength, ductability, brittleness, etc are uniform throughout), CFRP can be created with varying properties throughout by changing how you orient the carbon fibre.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCarbon fibre is only strong along one axis, so for example if you cut two squares of it, rotated one 90* and laid it on the first and bonded them, it would be strong in two axes sort of similar to metal. Where it gets complex is you can place the plies at any angle, add in some CFD to find exactly where you need strength, and it quickly becomes much more akin to 3D printing than metallurgy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake all that with a grain of salt since I have not worked on CFRP in a while. I have definitely forgotten some details, and the technology must have come a long way since I used it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-05-07T23:30:06Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2023 11:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Meecrob\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-08T14:19:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224280966\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022217087\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221683489724\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022133381\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Arugela\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n18 hours ago, Arugela said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow much overhead to you need past the expected maximum wing loading as a safety margin?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDefer to \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/104543-meecrob/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022104543\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/104543-meecrob/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Meecrob\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0on the rest of the answers, but I will note that for aerospace applications a 40% safety margin is fairly standard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-08T18:33:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ELooking at wikipedia, a 787 has 377 m^2 of wing area and a MTOM of\u00A0254,692 kg, making the wing loading 675 kg/m^2 in level flight.

For a tube with a given diameter and wall thickness, it\u0027s relatively straight forward to estimate how much bending load that tube can take. There are standard approaches used in construction that you can look up. If you have a simple, hollow wing with no significant reinforcement ridges and a fairly uniform cross-section, you can extend that approach to a non-circular cross-section get pretty close to the real value. For a model plane, I\u0027d call it close enough, and simply expand the safety margin a bit to absorb the error.
