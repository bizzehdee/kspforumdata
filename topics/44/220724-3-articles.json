No way around that, and I agree that people should be able to choose the level of risk they\u0027re OK with.\u00A0 But the way I see it, is there\u0027s a big difference between accepting the risk that things will go wrong despite the best efforts of everyone involved, and accepting the risk that something\u0027s going to go wrong because somebody decided that the \u0027best part for this is no part\u0027, or used the wrong grade wiring tape, or wedged in an accelerometer upside down, or decided that they didn\u0027t need a flame trench for this launch. The kind of thing that\u0027s given Go Fever a deservedly bad name - and as far as I see it,\u00A0 the one company seriously pushing for space colonisation at the moment, has Go Fever writ large.

I don\u0027t have an answer to that one, but I\u0027ll freely admit that I\u0027m biased against private industry deciding it unilaterally - because given the choice, private industry will invariably go for the faster and cheaper option. I suspect we may disagree on that point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit:\u00A0 Actually I have a sort of answer, which is that any volunteers should be volunteering on the basis of informed consent, but that\u0027s going to be damn difficult in practice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI kind of agree with your second point in general (although I\u0027d lump societal dogma in with state coercion and violence) but I suspect we\u0027d disagree over the specifics.\u00A0\u003Cspan\u003E Sticking to a single path can be beneficial\u00A0 for getting things done though, provided that other paths have been fairly considered, and folks have had a chance to make their case for alternatives.
