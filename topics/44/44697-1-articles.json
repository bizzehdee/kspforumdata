In scientific use, however, the term \u0022weight\u0022 refers to the reaction force to any mechanical force on an object which acts to move it away from a natural path of free fall. No matter how strong the gravitational field, objects in free fall experience no forces of weight, and are thus said to be weightless.\u003Cp\u003EThe force known as \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cweight\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 is proportional to mass and acceleration in all situations where the mass is accelerated away from free fall. For example, when a body is at rest in a gravitational field (rather than in free fall), it must be accelerated by a force from a scale or the surface of a planetary body such as the Earth or the Moon. This force keeps the object from going into free fall. Weight is the opposing force in such circumstances, and is thus determined by the acceleration of free fall. On the surface of the Earth, for example, an object with a mass of 50 kilograms weighs 491 newtons, which means that 491 newtons is being applied to keep the object from going into free fall. By contrast, on the surface of the Moon, the same object still has a mass of 50 kilograms but weighs only 81.5 newtons, because only 81.5 newtons is required to keep this object from going into a free fall on the moon. Restated in mathematical terms, on the surface of the Earth, the weight W of an object is related to its mass m by W = mg, where g = 9.80665 m/s2 is the Earth\u0027s gravitational field, (expressed as the acceleration experienced by a free-falling object).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually this page on \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_versus_weight\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMass versus weight\u003C/a\u003E is a bit better but I\u0027d still like to hear what you guys say.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m getting is: mass is what an object has when it is in freefall, i.e., how much inertia it has when gravity is not acting on it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Charzy","CreatedById":440,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T12:14:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMass is constant for a given object.
