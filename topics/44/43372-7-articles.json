Once the optimal location has been located, the construction of a colony begins. This is done by sending further Habitats and ulility landers, and colonists, to Mars. The utility landers contain further vehicles, tools, spare parts, added life support capabilities, the machinery needed to mine, process and utilize metals, seeds, perhaps fertilizers, the critical stuff to sustain a colony basically. We might need to find a way to produce electronics at acceptable quantity, or make that part of the supply line from Earth, since electronics aren\u0027t in exessively high demand, and would be built to last for space missions in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m fairly sure that by this time, the FDR or other high-speed propulsion systems will be space tested, so at the same time, a freighter to fly between Earth and Mars would be built and begin regular freight and crew trips. I consider this ship critical for the large scale colonisation of Mars, because it will fly back and forth all the time, all that will be needed will be fuel. No heavy lift vehicles would need to be used. With a bit of luck, Skylon or another affordable SSTO will be in operation. Reusable Falcon 9\u0027s and Heavies will certainly be in regular operation by then. The freighter would be a one-time expensive investment, but after that the price would be comparatively low, since deuterium is not too rare, and the FDR doesn\u0027t actually use terribly much, and only some level of maintenance will be required.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-24T14:35:48Z\u0022 title=\u002208/24/2013 02:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SargeRho\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anton P.

Environmentalists hate them because of the waste (admittedly something of an issue, but it can be safely sequestered deep underground). Conservatives hate them because coal and oil are much cheaper to build and operate.

Even if we were able to carry out vast geoengineering projects the sheer investment of time and money required is ludicrous.

Doing so would also irreperable damage the planet, erasing much of the science that could be done. We\u0027d be better off leaving the planets as we find them and building Earth-like habitats to live in.
