At high speed, the friction heats you. so, at which speed the air will stop cooling you, and its friction will heat you up?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-12T15:16:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile friction does cause some heating, the majority of the heating due to traveling very fast through the air is due to compression. As the air is compressed it heates up and causes things such as re-entry plasma trails. Another small thing is that you have to define at what pressure, unless you were talking about calibrated airspeed. With regards to your question I have no idea what so ever.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"R0cketC0der","CreatedById":106748,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-12T16:18:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs already said, most of the heat comes from compression.

Compressibility effects such as heating are already noticeable on subsonic airliners. Readouts of \u0022Total Air Temperature\u0022 (TAT) and \u0022Static Air Temperature\u0022 (SAT) are available to the pilots as these values are important to engine performance. The two values typically differ by many degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-12T17:27:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt also depends on the angle of attack of your test surface. Compression happens in front of your craft and air moves fastest along the edges.

When it gets to the point that electrons can flow freely that is where it becomes plasma. Ionisation is where atoms contain more or less electrons than normal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
