In real I heard spacecraft perform multiple burns could someone walk me through this. In real life how do they manage to stay so still and have a relative velocity of 0?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-16T02:03:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn real life- there are more factors involved such as fuel decay, fuel ignition challenges, precision and navigation drift from such issues as gyroscopic precession.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLargely, it\u0027s similar, just with more steps involved. As the ISS is on a high inclination orbit, since it was launched from Russia, which has a high latitude inclination. As a result, most spacecraft must enter a similar orbit, however, it won\u0027t match its orbit completely, so they\u0027ll complete midcourse burns to get the proper orbit, then burn again for inclination, then \u003Cem\u003Eagain\u003C/em\u003E to close the encounter.

There are many reasons for this - the ISS isn\u0027t in a perfect vacuum, the high inclination of the ISS makes the Earth\u0027s bulge more likely to affect its trajectory, drag affects the active vehicle, and so much more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe gravity model for Earth is much more complex than the gravity model for Kerbin.
