That\u0027s about 35kJ. And a charge lasts about a day at moderate use. That\u0027s under 65MJ over 5 years. Most people change their phones at least that often. That\u0027s less than a microgram of mass defect energy. You can get that from a few milligrams of nuclear fuel. If you are stuck with efficiency of an RTG, that\u0027s still under a gram of fuel all in all. So yes, the answer is that you positively can build a phone that you will never need to recharge within its intended 5 year life span.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now for practical considerations. The nuclear fuel would have to be extremely unstable. The half-life would have to be on the order of a decade. That means, no naturally occurring isotope will do. This would have to be something you intentionally breed in a reactor. Expensive as hell and not even remotely environmentally friendly. Next, we go to power output. RTGs are not efficient, and you are not building a more efficient reactor on that scale. You\u0027d be lucky to get 5% out of it, which means the reactor will be dumping almost 10W of heat constantly. You know how hot your phone gets after a long conversation? Picture that all the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now, the elephant in the room. Radiation. Most of the energy released by such a device is going to be in form of ionizing radiation. Unshielded, this power output would result in you taking a lethal dose in under a minute. Naturally, the very idea of making RTG is in absorbing radiation, but there are no materials that will absorb it efficiently enough on the scale of a cell phone. There is simply no way. Enough radiation will escape to make it a serious health hazard. \u003Cem\u003EAt best\u003C/em\u003E, this thing might be safe enough for a quick phone call, and I wouldn\u0027t even bet on that.
