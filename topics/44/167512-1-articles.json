Over the summer, I stumbled across its previously discovered candidate planet on Exoplanet Explorers. The results were absolutely horrifying. This freak of nature, nicknamed Kraken, appeared to be a 3.1 Earth radius planet orbiting every 4.2 HOURS. Yes, you read that right. The calculated equilibrium temperature for Kraken is nearly 5,100\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003EK, or around 8,800 degrees Fahrenheit!!! That\u0027s as hot a some G-type stars!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, it now seems more likely that Kraken is, in fact, a second star to the system. Believe it or not, that\u0027s WORSE than it being the physical embodiment of Hell. Why? To get the signal seen in the K2 data for EPIC 203533312, Kraken would have to be another large star (estimated around 1.5 solar radii) in an 8.4-hour orbit that just grazes the disk of the primary. This is incredibly problematic, as the two stars will likely be close to - if not - touching. A similar system is the binary W Ursae Majoris, which consists of two Sun-like stars that touch and are now shaped like a giant Space Peanut of Death. However, EPIC 203533312 and Kraken are even closer together due to their significantly larger radii. What makes this system even scarier is when you compare it to KIC 9832227. If anybody remembers, this was a pair of G-type stars of 1.58 and 0.83 solar radii in a contact binary system with orbits lasting just 11 hours and will likely merge into a Red Nova in the early 2020\u0027s. Both of KIC 9832227\u0027s stars are significantly further apart than EPIC 203533312 and Kraken, which makes it quite likely that the latter two can merge within the next few decades - or maybe even within the next few weeks! I honestly don\u0027t know. I\u0027m not good when it comes to binary systems, and this system is just so unusual and so dangerous that it\u0027s very hard to get a clear picture of its future. Any planets in this system probably only have a handful of years (in cosmic standards) before being incinerated. But how bad can a Red Nova even be?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Image result for v838 monocerotis gif\u0022 src=\u0022https://thumbs.gfycat.com/ColossalBitesizedHellbender-size_restricted.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVERY BAD\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe most famous Red Nova star, V838 Monocerotis, was probably once a large blue star that appears to have\u00A0merged with another star or a very large planet. It suffered an incredible outburst, quickly increasing to 1,200-1,500 times the size of the Sun with over one million times the luminosity, but with a temperature similar to L-class brown dwarfs. The burst was powerful enough to be seen from Earth, around 20,000 light years away. Any planets in this system were likely destroyed or sterilized by the rapid expansion and sudden, dramatic increase in luminosity. While EPIC 203533312 and Kraken likely won\u0027t produce something as powerful, V838 Monocerotis proves how potentially dangerous these two stars are. It\u0027s absolutely frightening how a pair of stars is about to be completely destroyed and wipe out any planets in its vicinity within a human timescale. I would rank this, hands-down, as one of the most DANGEROUS systems you could ever visit in the entire Universe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-14T21:22:56Z\u0022 title=\u002211/14/2017 09:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 14, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by ProtoJeb21\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ultimate Steve","CreatedById":161505,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-14T05:05:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I wasn\u0027t already buried neck deep in stuff to do, I\u0027d probably write a sci fi story about the last days of those planets...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-14T08:45:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMan this is very\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EEPIC!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cratercracker","CreatedById":171449,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-14T08:51:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think i need to forever engrave the termin of \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003Ethe giant space peanut of death\u0022\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Ein my mind\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Urses","CreatedById":175990,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-14T09:15:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP forums ARE the treasury for unic and epic descriptions for space adressed explanations.... \u0022aerodramatics\u0022, \u0022peanut of death\u0022....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd i love peanuts...

Using the McDonald observatory, they were able to re-define the parameters for the host star, which is significantly smaller than previous estimates by Huber et al. The host is a rather small F-Type main sequence star with a radius of 1.15 Suns, an effective temperature of 6,620\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003EK, and a gravity of 4.19 log g. This puts the planet outside the star, unlike what has been suggested by the limited and outdated data on ExoFOP. EPIC 203533312.01 is part of 6 \u0022Sub-Jovians\u0022 found by the study, with radii between 3 and 11 times that of Earths. Planets of this size with orbital periods below 3 days are incredibly rare, and as a result this sample is part of a so-called \u0022Sub-Jovian Desert\u0022, meaning that it is a statistical range where very few examples exist. Out of all six of these candidates, EPIC 203533312.01 is by far the most likely to be a legitimate planet. It shows no signs of alternating primary-secondary transits caused by an eclipsing binary system, and as of now no other signs of a close secondary star have been found. In addition, all transits are consistent, unlike several other candidates, including one that could be a swarm of comets. However, EPIC 203533312.01 is inside the Roche Limit of its host star, so it \u0022must have a density of at least \u003Cem\u003Ep\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0= 8.9 g/cm\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0in order to not be tidally disrupted\u0022. This results in a mass estimate of at least 48.5 M\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E. The authors, while suggesting that EPIC 203533312.01 seems most likely to be an actual planet, advise caution regarding the 6 Sub-Jovian candidates, as they might all be false positives. Indeed, one of them shows a radial velocity signature (\u0026gt;20 km/s) that indicates it is a binary star. Such a signal has not been found for EPIC 203533312.01 yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow for my take on the paper:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese results have proven that Kraken is most likely NOT a binary star on the verge of collapsing with its partner into a cataclysmic Red Nova event. Rather, the accumulated data favors the possibility of this being an actual, legitimate planet literally hugging its star at an incredibly close distance. It is one of the shortest-known exoplanets ever found, with one orbit lasting a mere 4.2158 hours. Using the new stellar parameters observed by Adams et al and the\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://phl.upr.edu/projects/habitable-exoplanets-catalog/calculators\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHEC Exoplanet Calculator\u003C/a\u003E, I was able to figure out the likely mass and luminosity for EPIC 203533312. It turns out that the star is surprisingly low density, with a mass of about 0.76102 Suns. It also is about 2.27571 times as luminous as the Sun, which would put its conservative habitable zone between 1.438342 and 2.07215 AU. The newly found mass and luminosity values enable the calculation of the semi-major axis and equilibrium temperature of EPIC 203533312.01/Kraken. This planet orbits its star at a distance of 0.0056084 AU from the system\u0027s center of mass and has an equilibrium temperature of 4,180\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003EK. That is astronomically close and hot - the planet orbits just 38,000 miles (61,000\u00A0km) above the star\u0027s surface, and is at the very least an absolutely mind-boggling 7,064 degrees Fahrenheit.

But that\u0027s just part of the story. A planet\u0027s equilibrium temperature is its average temp with NO ATMOSPHERE. Since EPIC 203533312.01 is so incredibly massive, it will likely have a huge, crushed-down atmosphere with a ridiculously intense greenhouse effect. This can easily raise the planet\u0027s average temperature above 8,000\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003EF (4,700 Kelvin) and potentially compress some of the liquid metals into a substance so weird, so alien, there is no way to describe it. The host star would fill the sky horizon to horizon - cool, but absolutely mortifying. In addition, Kraken is also a hell of a lot more massive than the lower limit of 48.5 Earth masses. That is the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eminimum\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0possible mass to even survive the tidal forces from EPIC 203533312. In order for this thing to even be remotely rocky - as it likely is, due to the high stellar flux that would\u0027ve blown away most volatile materials - it would need to be around 180 to 200 times the mass of Earth, at the least. This would give the planet an enormous gravitational pull of over 19 to 21 gees, enough to make a person instantly loose consciousness (if they weren\u0027t also immediately melted alive by the horrific temperatures). This is, hands down, the true physical embodiment of Hell, and that is why EPIC 203533312.01 will no longer be nicknamed Kraken.
