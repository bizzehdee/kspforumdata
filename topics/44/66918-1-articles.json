We are all well aware of the issue of needing sufficient deltaV to move from one orbit to another, but there is another that people often forget, light speed lag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimply put, because it takes time (lots of time) for weapons fire to move from one ship to another, in 99% of all cases of ship to ship combat, the defender has the advantage. Let us examine why.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWeapons tech for space battles tends to fall into three categories: Ballistics (bullets, railguns, asteroids, anything that is fired and can never maneuver), Directed Energy (lasers, particle weapons, etc), Missiles (any weapon system that is fired and has terminal guidance, IE the ability to change its path to maximize the chances of a hit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet us assume for the moment that the battle is taking place over the course of 1 light second, which is 186,282 miles of distance. For referance, the average distance between the Earth and Moon is 238,900 miles, a little less than 1.5 light seconds. In an actual space battle this would be considered quite close range, not necessarily knife fight ranges, but very close. Why? Because they greater the distance, the greater the defender is favored, so it makes sense to keep your ship as far away from an enemy as possible, while maintaining the ability to still hit him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBallistics:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPros: Kinetic energy kicks ass. Relatively cheap on mass compared to missiles (easy to use lots of them), and in a pinch can double as a maneuvering thruster or in some cases a main engine (when you fire a cannon, equal and opposite reaction, your ship will \u0027accelerate\u0027 in the opposite direction).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECons: Ballistics are just that, ballistic. When you fire, they are on a set path that will not change. Very slow! Requires saturation fire!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming a muzzle velocity of 4,000 ft/sec (a Barret M82 can reach 3,200 ft/sec) it would take that bullet/shell 2.85 DAYS to reach its target (ignoring whatever closing velocity you have with the enemy ship.), assuming you are closing at 33,000 ft/sec (the speed Curiosity traveled on a transfer orbit to Mars) with a total closing velocity for the round of 37,000 ft/sec the round still takes 7.38 HOURS to reach its target. For ballistic weapons, a miss by an inch was as close as a miss by a mile, it\u0027s still a miss. All the defending ship needs to do is to nudge itself EVEN SLIGHTLY sometime within the next 7.3 hours and that round is CERTAIN to miss. Why is it certain? Because the guy that shot it was aiming where he thought you were going to be, and even the effect of a tiny push over several hours can cause a ship to be 50-100 feet away from where it going to be. So, in order to ensure maximized chances of getting a hit, you either need to fire a massive blanket of shots across where the enemy is going to be, so large a blanket that they cannot dodge with their main engines, or you need to be able to surprise them (not suprise them as in unexpectedly fire. Surprise them as in, the first moment they realize you shot at them was the moment the rounds started impacting their hull), or you get in stupidly close ranges. Considering the problems with carrying that much ammunition (it weighs a lot in bulk!), this type of weapon is really only suitable for targets that cannot maneuver (large space stations or planet/rock bound targets) or very close in work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMissiles:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPros: Terminal guidance, different warheads, versatile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECons: VERY large, VERY heavy, low ammo count, susceptible to ECM (electro-magnetic countermeasures) and counter-fire.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMissiles at first glance seem pretty great, they are just basically mini-ships themselves. They have the ability to steer into their target, you can give them nuclear warheads, conventional warheads, claymore-esque burst warheads, etc, and you can program them to do interesting things like drift behind a planet before slingshotting around into a target while never using its engine while in view of the enemy. Unfortunately, with all of this comes the downsides. Missiles relative to ballistics will tend to be very large. This is because over the distances involved in space you need a lot of propellant for deltaV and maneuvering. As a result of all this rotundness, missiles will also be very heavy which will slow YOU down as you maneuver around. As a result of wanting to be nimble enough to dodge ballistics, you are not likely to desire to carry too many of these around with you. Additionally, even if the scenario lines up where a missile is capable of hitting a target despite counter-fire and dodging, it is still possible that enemy countermeasure will confuse the missile enough that it misses or explodes outside its useful range (even a powerful nuke will have to be within a mile of its target. No shockwaves move through space to extend this range.). And this comes to a problem that missiles share with their ballistic fellows, the target may dodge. The missile needs to always be working to optimize its path towards the target, the sooner you adjust your path the cheaper it is in fuel. Waiting until the end risks being completely unable to make up the deltaV necessary to reach the target. So any time the enemy ship activates a thruster, fires a weapon, uses its engine, dumps seweage, the missile is going to have to spend fuel to match the new vector. One problem for the missile is when it sees the enemy ship using its engines or thrusters, the enemy has already been doing that for 1 full second (1 second light speed delay due to range). But the missile does not know how long the ship has been using its engines, or how long it WILL use them. So even if the missile spends enough fuel to catch up, when the enemy engine shuts off the missile will likely have to spend extra fuel to correct its overshoot. A ship has a LOT more disposable mass (fuel) than a missile will. As a result this becomes a numbers game of how much can the ship afford to dodge, for how long, and how much can the missile afford to correct, and for how long. All this time, we have to keep in mind that the missile is probably large enough that the enemy ship will be able to shoot its weapons at it, a single hit will likely destroy the missile. The defender also has the advantage that even if the missile dodges all of its counter-fire, the missile HAD to spend some of its limited fuel to do so and then to correct its path, making it less able to perform final aiming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDirected Energy:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPros: (near) lightspeed weaponry, very mass efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECons: heat! low-damage yield.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDirected energy weapons (DEW) (such as lasers or particle beams) move at incredible speeds. Lasers/Masers/Grasers all fire at basically lightspeed, particle weapons slower, but comparable. This makes them very hard to dodge because as the target you have no warning that they are headed your way. You just have to assume they are firing at you and therefor \u0022constantly\u0022 be dodging. Constantly being relative in that only a few course adjustments per unit of time may be necessary because likely the beam weapons will need some pretty awesome precision to hit. Laser weapons (such as the Navy\u0027s new massive laser diode, electric only, non-chemical laser) only require electricity to fire and therefor have no extra consumables that you must carry saving on mass for you. The problem with DEW is that they all tend to release a LOT of heat when they fire. That heat has to go somewhere, space is actually very hard to dump heat into, if you don\u0027t have good cooling then you will eventually need to stop firing just to let your heat slowly bleed away into space. Conversely, whatever heat sink you have for this purposes will in general be a nice target for enemy DEW. DEW tend to work by heating up your enemy to either cause physical damage (LOTS of heat really fast) or to simply cook them to death (low heat). If the enemy has good cooling systems, then you need to score a higher percentage of hits in order to acheive your goal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end DEW weapons, despite their low damage output, end up being the winner of these three types. This is primarily because they are NOT easy to dodge. In our 1 light second battle, the speed of light weapons force the defending ship to dodge more forcefully, faster, than the other weapons do. Additionally, it is possible to easily bracket an enemy ship to prevent dodging from being truly effective. This is similar to the blanket fire of the ballistics, but better because you don\u0027t have to carry the extra mass. So if the enemy wants to dodge, they have to constantly be expending fuel. A hot enemy that is constantly expending fuel is good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously at longer ranges DEW are effectively the new ballistic weapon, but think, if DEW get THAT bad, how much worse has ballistics and missiles gotten?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Coldfinger008","CreatedById":51164,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-28T00:36:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOka excuse me, but if you gonna go imperial, then at least put the metric conversion next to it so the civilized world can understand it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, it\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s just something that really pisses me off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat out of the way,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou have a wonderful post there.^^\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever there is a couple of things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA chemical shaped charge in vacuum can actually achieve jet-speeds of 100km/sec.

Conventional radar as it stands is not really suited towards massive sweeps of space. We do have some fancy games we can play when you have systems like the Arecibo radio telescope down in Puerto Rico (the one used in Goldeneye), which we have used before to \u0022brighten\u0022 other planets so other radio telescopes can see them better. But in general it is assumed that over the distances involved with planetary combat (Earth-Mars, not just Earth orbit) your primary sensors are going to be infrared and telescopic. Part of the reason is as you stated, these methods only require you to see energy that was already transmitted from the target, so you only have the time delay imposed by the distance. If you sent out radar to a target 1 light second away, you would have to wait 2 seconds to get a return, 1 for it to reach the target and 1 for it to come back. Also, the signal loss involved would be quite tremendous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAghanim: There has been many theories and tactics thought about this, but nobody is really certain how well they will work. On one hand you can deploy disposable shields (throwing out clouds of crystal particles to diffuse/absorb the lasers, or even just a solid slab of material) but these are extremely high mass defenses. On the other hand you can design the armor of your ship to basically absorb the energy and flake away (as the armor cracks and flakes away, the flakes are VERY hot, and since they are no longer touching the rest of their ship, that heat is no longer damaging you). And on the gripping hand (points to those who get it), you have tactics you can employ such as rolling your ship around its exposed axis. Think about a tube, if you are looking at it from the side and you are firing a laser at it, if the laser is not able to get an instant-kill, then that means it needs to take some time to burn through or to heat up the target armor for effect. This means that you MUST keep the beam pointed at the exact same spot on the enemy ship (or near enough to it), so all the defender has to do to make your weapon \u0027worse\u0027 is to rotate the ship. Even if your weapon had perfect tracking, you could only maintain the beam on your target location for 180 degrees of the spin. This gives that section of hull time to cool while the battle continues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomeone had said that mirrors wont work, and to a point that is true. You cannot make a mirror perfect enough to relect ALL the incoming light, some will be absorbed and if the enemy laser is worth its salt then it is pouring enough energy into your mirror that the slight amount that gets absorbed warps the mirror (degrading its ability to reflect) quite quickly. You may incorporate reflective elements into your ship armor because every little percentage of heat you deflect is heat you don\u0027t have to suffer from, but it will not \u0027solve\u0027 the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-28T14:19:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Seret\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Seret\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOld warships did actually have \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-torpedo_bulge\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Etorpedo bulges\u003C/a\u003E at the waterline.
