Consider a slower than light civilisation bent on expansion. Each star has a maximum carrying capacity for life due to limited energy and mass. Because they dont have ftl, before they leave their own system they explore every option for getting the most out of thier own star. Planets are an inefficient use of mass when it comes to supporting a large population, the habitable surface area only increases with the square of radius whereas the mass required increases with the cube of the radius. Oniel cyliners have a much better surface area to mass ratio. So their original planets would eventually end up as a swarm of habitats in solar orbits. Once a population fills that, any surplus population must be shipped out to find a new star. Every year each populated planet sends out its surplus in the form of habitats retro fitted for interstellar travel. the more stars doing this, the closer the total yearly surplus is to the carrying capacity of the new star. If we are unfortunate enough to be in the way of such an expansionist culture, we may find a fleet of construction ships arriving to start building orbital colonies (and more ships) out of any matter they can find. If we get hit by a fleet thats already nearing the maximum capacity of our star, they would have to choose between a primitive surface dwelling alien species selfishly hoarding mass, or their own children. We get bulldosed without hesitation. Absolute worst case is if they go for automation in a big way. Even if their race eats itself to extincion, their machines may carry on. Thats assuming they hang around to inhabit the systems they have already mined out, instead of a slow trickle of surplus, we might face the entire population of their home star migrating all at once, and probably getting here within a few hundred years of each other. Sure they would start with the easy to get mass in the asteroides, then move on to the larger bodies. Thats assuming there are enough easily mined volotiles around and they dont just start stipping atmospheres. In the face of a ravenous hoard, we are just small sacks of indignant water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-13T22:36:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHarvesting biomass.
