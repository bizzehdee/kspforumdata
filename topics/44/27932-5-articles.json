Some types of radiation are more dangerous than others. On earth we only have to deal with Alpha, Beta, Gamma and occasionly Neutron radiation. In space there are a lot of Protons and Heavy Ions. Basics studies show that the protons are twice as dangerous as gamma rays (per unit of absorbed energy), heavy ions are about 20 times worse. But thats just killing cells in a petri dish - we have no real idea of the relative cancer risk.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T12:53:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MBobrik\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MBobrik\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E.\u003Cp\u003EWho wants seeks ways, who does not want to, seeks reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, but wishful thinking won\u0027t help you negate physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fuzzy Dunlop\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fuzzy Dunlop\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBut thats just killing cells in a petri dish - we have no real idea of the relative cancer risk.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can\u0027t be too good for your health to lose too many brain cells...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, there needs to be more research in the area, but it isn\u0027t looking too good.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sof","CreatedById":65663,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T13:01:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nibb31\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nibb31\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes, the radiation levels are probably manageable for short duration stays on Mars surface (1 or 2 years), with appropriate shielding, limited EVA sorties, and increased dosage limits.\u003Cp\u003EBut it pretty much rules out any dreams of long term colonization, with children and families living off the land.
