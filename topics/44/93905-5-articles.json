The joint ESA/NASA missions to Jupiter\u0027s moons and Saturn/Titan that I gave as examples were conceived and later cancelled during the ISS era. The ISS era is one of the two times that you highlight where there was an increase in funding for NASA. If increased funding for manned missions should also result in increased funding for robotic missions then we should have seen the effect during the period of increased funding for the ISS.\u003Cp\u003EAnd just to be clear, I am all for manned space exploration. However when significant mission opportunities are being cancelled due to lack of funding while the international community continues to spend tens of billions of dollars each year on manned missions to LEO, then I would argue we have to re-consider our priorities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn what year was cancelled?
