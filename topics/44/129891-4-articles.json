And building an ascent vehicle along with the ability to land it on the surface of Mars is no simple task! It could cost nearly as much as a BFS itself!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMars Direct assumed a two-stage Earth Return Vehicle and a surface hab or two (which are landed separately and each need a landing system), along with a NTR in-space stage and an expendable HLV (several launches) and several heat shields that are expended along the way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMCT assumes a fully reusable HLV that is refueled in orbit by another reusable HLV of the same type (though operating as a tanker). The upper stage of that RHLV carries the crew, and is big enough to operate as the hab throughout the whole trip. It also operates as the in-space stage (so no NTR stage needed), the EDL and lander vehicle (somewhat redundant, but this means you keep your heatshield and landing legs and can use them on the way back to Earth), plus the ascent/Earth return vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...that one rocket stage does the work of like 4-6 separate rocket stages in the Mars Direct architecture (depending on how you count), and the crew portion takes care of the rest. This is what reuse, extensive refueling, and ISRU buys you. A huge reduction in how many pieces of hardware need to be designed, qualified, built, and launched.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n...what the two architectures have in common is the need for surface power (nuclear or solar), some ISRU equipment. For ISRU, the original Mars Direct assumed bringing hydrogen all the way from Earth, which is pretty tough engineering-wise due to boil-off and large volume, but MCT assumes you\u0027re mining/collecting it on the surface in the form of water. So MCT needs to land a significant robotic water-collection system, able to mine hundreds of tons of water per year at a minimum, to give a rough figure of merit. But that\u0027s actually not too bad: one or two tons per day. This would\u0027ve been laughed off the stage in the early 1990s, but now even NASA\u0027s architecture planning conferences take this large amount of available water as a given and is used for site-selection.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what MCT needs is HUNDREDS of kilowatts (at a minimum) and a robotic rover or two to process a bunch of regolith to extract the (apparently fairly abundant) water (though Mars Direct also assumed rovers, but for manned use... so this isn\u0027t a big difference either). That\u0027s like a few SP-100s (or perhaps an SP-100 at the top end of considered designs) instead of just one SP-100 (or equivalent in solar\u002Bbatteries) in Mars Direct, but that\u0027s a pretty good trade, in my opinion, to greatly simplify the rest of the architecture and make it fully reusable (thus much cheaper to do each mission once you build it out) and much more capable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I actually think that Mars Direct might\u0027ve actually cost more money than MCT will!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tech risk is a little higher, but not much so, if you retire the risk with early tests, as SpaceX does.

Whatever you build on Antarctica must be temperature isolated against a thick cold atmosphere, while the atmosphere on Mars is very cold but much thinner, hence you loose much less heat there. On most locations you have the problem that you have to dig yourself out once in a while, that simply does not happen on Mars. On Mars you have sunlight every day, but in the huge sandstorms. But then you have wind. So a combination of solar and wind will always give you power. Solar will go down up to 20% if you let sit the solar cells around and do not care, but at least you get the 20% year round. Then collecting resources from the ground is simpler on Mars, unless for water, but that is still not difficult on Mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand I agree with you that some Mars colonization plans are far too optimistic.

Then one should construct the settlement more like a base than like a colony: Fix an amount of people you can safely supply from earth and bring back in case of problems. 3 will suffice in my opinion and is doable within 20% of current NASA budget. The base will set up stuff (witch itself is at first imported from earth) to supply more colonists on Mars. If you can get all your water locally you will reduce your mass requirement per crew member by 90%. Together with food and oxygen even by 95%. So the first couple of years your growth will be mainly restricted by the constraint to have enough return capabilities there. Over some years you can build up a base of 30-60 people with that technique. From there you can start bootstrapping industry.
