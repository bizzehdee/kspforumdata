It calculates Delta-v, thrust to weight, acceleration, and time at a current stage it would take to reach escape velocity. It takes into consideration differing surface gravities and atmospheric pressures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://worksthusfar.weebly.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://worksthusfar.weebly.com/\u003C/a\u003E - new link the old one seems to have died.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is 934KB and does not require installation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need dotnet 4 or higher to use this program.
