Creating a singularity with a spin is out of our reach, so the only force that will really affect it is gravity, and in that case, the dominant force will be Earth. So it\u0027s gonna fall. Fast. Likely, straight to the gravitational center of the Earth. Problem is, it\u0027s gonna gain some mass on it\u0027s way down. And singularities, when close to them, have a crazy attraction force when close to them, so when near to the core, some really really weird things will start happening. Mass is not evenly distributed on Earth, and at the core, it\u0027s not quite clear how gravity behaves. Since the mass is all around you, you\u0027re likely to have a simili zero G environment at the core. And that\u0027s where weird stuff starts happening. Some say it\u0027s likely to get ejected out Earth\u0027s SOI due to relativist effects, others, that it will start coming back and forth until it becomes massive enough to form some sort of binary system with the rest of the planet. And that\u0027s estimated to take some time. How much? No one really knows, but a while for sure. Most probably over a century, maybe a few more. Is that over someone\u0027s lifetime? Much more than heading off to Jupiter for sure. Is it within our reach? Mhhmm. Not yet. Until we master much much greater quantities of energy, we won\u0027t be able to create a singularity massive enough to survive long enough. Condensing a few tons into a singularity is not easy, and most of the really dense stuff is already very unstable. It\u0027s a good idea, but I hardly see it being doable anytime in a generation\u0027s time lapse.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"3_bit","CreatedById":52836,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T13:42:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHERE is the economical way: wait (something will surely destroy it given time....)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stallion x1","CreatedById":43303,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T16:36:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow about we wait until the scientists at the LHC manage to accidentally create a strangelet ( a particle that must exist according to the laws of physics,that is so stable that when it touches other matter that matter recreates itself into strangelets) It wouldn\u0027t remove the planet but the planet could never support life or anything but strangelets.But im not a physicist so i cant tell you the specifics....\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:0.0:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T16:50:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think the LHC is powerful enough or even suited to create those \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E It can easily create unstable and heavy particles by colliding (and fusioning) low mass and energy particles (usually protons), but to get it to create other lowish mass and that stable particles, even through decay, I doubt so.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"loiske","CreatedById":63673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T19:37:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, now i\u0027m scared \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"almisami","CreatedById":76341,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T22:59:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShoving a big chunk of Iron into the sun would cause a massive solar flare that would roast earth like a BBQ.
