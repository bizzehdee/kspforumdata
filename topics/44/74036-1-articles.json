Which is actually 15 tonnes, though it can do 33 if the vehicle itself does not reach orbit and launches a second stage at the peak of its parabola.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing to the rocket equation around earth, we find that for a traditional vertical-launch LH2/LOx rocket, the required mass ratio for the delta-v is 8.3 or so, leaving no spare fuel. (A rare occurrence)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to the fancy-pants engine, we find that Skylon drastically reduces its dv to launch, and the mass ratio, including spare fuel, is just under 5.1. Additionally, because of its fancy engines and use of the wings on ascent, its initial TWR can be less than one, drastically reducing empty weight of the vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing to a traditional vertical-launch RP-1/LOx rocket, which is the design you are suggesting, minus extra weight for wings, we find that a mass ratio of 15.1 is required. Again, with no spare fuel, you can probably make that 16 or 17 accounting for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, for the RP-1/LOx rocket, we have certain requirements. Firstly, its TWR needs to be greater than 1. Secondly, we are looking at at least three times the mass, due to that ratio. So the engines need to be likely 5-6 times as powerful versus the Skylon designed there, at a modest estimate. Skylon\u0027s engines are quite heavy, with a TWR of only 14 in airbreathing mode, but 5-6 times more and even RP-1 rockets struggle to match that overall weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo not only do we need a lot more fuel, but our engines are heavier. Meaning now we need more fuel. Plus the wings need to be bigger to carry those big engines. Which means more fuel to get it into orbit. And because of all this fuel weight, the structure needs to be much stronger - especially when all this weight has to survive multiple G\u0027s during ascent! So now we add more fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, you\u0027re using four times as much fuel as Skylon by mass, easy. At this size, Skylon will still have slightly larger LH2 tanks than your proposed RP-1 tanks, but Skylon\u0027s LOx tanks have nothing on yours. Which have to be built really strong and heavy and cause all sorts of difficulties. While Skylon\u0027s can sacrifice much strength, become very light, and then make it really easy to reenter, as the vehicle is practically light as a feather for its size, meaning its deceleration on reentry starts long before things heat up. Meanwhile you have a smaller, very, very heavy vehicle to try protect from heat ... Good luck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is also ignoring that overall rocket mass ratios are quite similar for LH2 and RP-1. RP-1 does get the better overall in general, but not by as great a margin as LH2\u0027s required mass ratio, meaning LH2 has the greater payload capacity, if you care to build the rocket large enough. Most people don\u0027t due to the cost of building something that big repeatedly, which would be no issue on a reusable vehicle like Skylon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TeeGee\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TeeGee\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dunno, maybe I should give RSS another go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, you should.

This would be heavily dependent on how much thrust we can actually get out of a nuclear engine, but in theory such a vehicle could manage some decent payload fractions. The problem is, the extreme safety standards a nuclear-powered vehicle would need to meet to be allowed to fly would make refurbishing the space shuttle seem like a walk in the park.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sgt_flyer","CreatedById":57690,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-04T04:28:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Redjoker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Redjoker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor a rocket ssto, a bell nozzle would likely not be used, since you could use an aerospike engine, like the one planned for the x-33 venture star, which would deliver an isp that would be more consistent across a range of altitudes. \u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospike_engine\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospike_engine\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know about aerospikes - but they are only prototypes.

I guess the point of the skylon sabre engine is to cut out the initial delta v from standing to mach 5 at a thinner atmosphere than at SL before switching to rockets, but even so, the payload fraction in comparison to weight is super small. Rockets will ALWAYS have a better payload weight than sstos BUT rockets are disposable, sstos are not. If we were to build a station in space using smaller modules, I think it would be more cost effective to use an ssto to build it bit by bit rather than use 1 large rocket to push a larger payload up all at once. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll we have to worry about is fuel cost and maintenance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that\u0027s besides the point. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue with airbreathers is that they are altitude and speed limited.
