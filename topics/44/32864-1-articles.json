Early on when space weaponry was first started, it was big ship vs. big ship (no were near as big as the star wars, or Battlestar Galactica ships) and pilots of the vessels, found that if he can stay ahead, by having little thrust turned on on the ship, pushing them into higher orbit, his rear gunners could target the ships much easier, and give them an advantage by targeting the bridge. Both sides of the wars would do this, and as time went on, it was taught this idea of staying ahead of your enemy gave you an advantage. Even giving in orbit spacecraft weak ion engines, to keep the ships in range, still stay one step ahead of the enemy. With smaller ships, as ships got bigger, small fighter ships, piloted by one man were developed, giving them the ability to deploy the small fighters and bombers, and attack the ships engines, to keep it from getting ahead of them, and even destroying critical points on the ship. They had very weak ion engines for battle mode, and as time went on, they discovered warp drive, to travel to new planets, and discovered how to change the weaker engines in the fighters, to warp engines. More on warp drive later. The small fighters, although you cannot see it, have rcs thrusters at every critical point, to give it an aircraft feel, then the weak ion engines, are burning constantly to continue the thrust. Which is why they seem to stay with the larger ships, because they are accelerating at the same rate. Space battles always happen in orbit around planets or stars, so in case of emergency, either a rescue crew can get them out of it, or they can get in the escape pods to get to the planets surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. With warp drive, warp drive, is actually a form of time travel, they blast at great speeds to were the target would be first, and then time travel, which is an early stage of time travel, freezes time within the ship during the journey then, reverses it to the exact date of when the ship left, down to just a few seconds later. This requires great amounts of power to do, which is why the engines are so large, and the rear areas of small fighters that can go into warp speed. That is all I have for warp speed. Questions comments are helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MoonHeadJohn","CreatedById":11279,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-14T03:26:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen we see the engines of a ship firing at full power in a film it\u0027s because it looks good.

Since the ship can\u0027t move back through time it won\u0027t arrive before the signal is sent and there\u0027s no paradox. Many believe that the technology to move faster then light will come at the same time we develop time travel but I digress on that point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESpaceship A has a \u003Cstrong\u003Ecloaking device\u003C/strong\u003E and lasers\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, There\u0027s no stealth in space.

Manipulating mass would enable many things to be possible. Space combat is described accurately as being at great distance; a common problem is hiding ship emissions as they light up like a Christmas tree against the background of space. Point-defense lasers are used but are only useful in a small perimeter around the ship because of energy dispersion in space. Conventional Newtonian physics are applicable and RCS are still used when mass drives aren\u0027t or fail. Of course I\u0027m mostly going by nostalgic memory of the first game\u0027s excellent Codex, I don\u0027t think it ever presented actual combat in the same way it is described and I\u0027m sure numerous liberties were taken in the sequels.
