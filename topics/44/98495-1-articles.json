But there are some very strong reasons why diesel is the main fuel for transporting goods across countries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, diesel engines are a bit more efficient than gasoline engines. (Higher compression) Diesel has more energy per gallon than gasoline. Also at least from my experience in the US, since you can get x gasoline from a barrel of crude and y diesel, might as well use both of them in applications rather than wasting 1. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn other notes however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiesel engines are often much higher torque, and lower rpm than gasoline engines of equal power. Lower rpm means less wear and tear in the engine, and transmission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso diesel engines do not require a spark, and all the equipment required for 1 in a gasoline engine. If you lose the alternator in your diesel truck, the batteries can probably keep the fuel pump running long enough to make it to a repair stop. Gasoline cars that lose the alternator will drain the batteries at a significantly higher rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELots of deep water fishing boats (and many container ships, tankers and all) rely on diesel engines partially for this reason. I know that my dads boat, even after having a complete electrical failure, were able to trawl the 40mi back to shore since the engines are gravity fed with fuel, and will just keep running. Kinda sucked not having lights, but it was manageable. Gas boat, wed have had to call in the coast guard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso in extremely high power applications, there are even more efficient diesel engines out there, called opposed piston, engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as i know, they are only built extremely large, i think fairbanks morse is 1 of the manufactures. dont remember how efficient they had gotten them. I think some regular diesel engines out there are pushing into the 40-50% thermal efficiency range nowadays. And several groups are planning on making a truck sized version of an opposed piston design, which may push the efficiency up into the 60% range. J think some of the big engines for ships are even into the upper 60s (and when you are talking a 50khp engine, every .1% counts)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough dont take this all at face value.

Also, a gasoline pickup will perform better, at least to my knowledge, in off road conditions. Also, gas here in Arkansas is $1.79/gallon while diesel is still around three bucks a gallon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the efficiency of my gasoline Tundra will decrease exponentially with more weight that I load. What this means is that my truck will perform very poorly with heavy payloads or tows, and gas mileage will be even poorer. For one, my truck is not meant to tow. If I want to tow more than 5,000 lbs, then what I need to do is to go get a diesel truck (I prefer Ford, like an F-250 or F-350 for this), of which has greater torque at the crank shaft and will hold its efficiency and gas mileage at higher payloads/tows.

The main, and perhaps only, advantage I would give to a gasoline engine is that they can be built lighter. They are burning their fuel in a wave rather than exploding it (knocking, which is what diesels do full time), allowing the use of much lighter pistons and driving rods. I\u0027d also peg gasoline engines as being quieter (that is, it\u0027s easier to muffle the noise for vehicle occupants) since they are burning instead of exploding their fuel. By contrast, a nice big heavy diesel engine is capable of withstanding considerable abuse. Their higher torque is also of considerable benefit for heavier vehicles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t to say gasoline engines can\u0027t be built tough. Marine engines for example are designed to operate at full capacity for extended periods of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERunning society exclusively on one or the other though doesn\u0027t make much sense. There is no way to totally control the quantities of outputs when you refine crude oil. You \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E steer it a bit, but you are still going to end up with considerable amounts of both gasoline and diesel, so from an economic point of view your optimum case will always be some mixture of fuels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen talking about one or the other being cleaner, it\u0027s always worth considering what the definition of clean is. Diesels were considered cleaner for a long time because they were held to the same standard as gasoline engines, which completely ignored particulates of a certain size that were the primary output of diesel engines. When it comes to places like california, I\u0027d be interested to see if the regulations focus only on particulates that would settle, or if they focus on gasses as well. Also, do they regulate the replacement of the filtration systems? Diesels in particular have a problem where they can intake more fuel than they can burn, which is where you get the sooty black exhaust. It\u0027s form incomplete combustion, and it creates a whole lot of nasty stuff, including considerable particulate matter. That\u0027s why I ask about replacing the filters, since I would imagine that trying to capture all that particulate matter would actually clog up the filters within a couple years tops.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-02T19:20:23Z\u0022 title=\u002202/02/2015 07:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-02T20:19:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest advantage gasoline has is that there\u0027s not much competition for that part of the distillate.
