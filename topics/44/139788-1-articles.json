Someone did N body simulations, and almost everything in Ksp was \u0022stable\u0022 over the time period modeled... but Val was ejected very fast, and sometime later, so was Bop... so bop is comparatively stable, but in geological/astronomical timescales... very unstable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI looked it up again... seems Theia hit Earth 20-100 million years after earth\u0027s formation... so that didn\u0027t last too long. I wonder what it would take to have something be \u0022stable\u0022 on the order of 1-2 billion years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSurely these things aren\u0027t directly proportional... how long could we expect a planetoid to last at L4/5 if it was 5% of the mass of Earth(M_e) rather than 10%? I suspect much longer than 2x the 20-100 million that Theia did (at 10% M_e).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis whole idea is fascinating to me... what would it have taken for Theia to capture instead of impact... imagine living in a double planet system (some argue the moon is big enough that we already do)... or imagine a \u0022planet of damocles\u0022 at... say 3% M)e sitting at the L4/5... growing ever more unstable. What could be done to buy more time? some asteroid redirects? what would knowledge of such an inevitable apocalypse do to human civilization, given that it could be 100\u0027s of thousands, or millions of years before it happened (lets assume its hard to predict if it will still be orbiting L4/5 in 10 thousand year, or 10 million, or a billion years).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, for KSP, I\u0027m sticking it at kerbin\u0027s L4, and its roughly 9% of Kerbin\u0027s mass... because I\u0027ve got no other place to put it unless someone can tell me an orbit between Kerbin and Duna\u0027s orbit that would be stable over billions of years... Is there such an orbit (replace Kerbin and Duna with Earth and Mars) in our solar system?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, Val is unstable as its too close to Tylo and Laythe. Bop is also to close to Tylo.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt might well be more stability problems if you simulated millions of years. This would not be realistic either but would show stability problems.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe are not able to predict Harley\u0027s comet for more than a few orbits with any accuracy, small changes will easy dramatically change Ap and therefore then it reenter.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe early solar system was not stable, its belive it was 50 planets or dwarf planets in the inner solar system in the beginning, Theia was probably one of the last unstable ones, also likely something hit Mercury hard.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-16T08:44:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, I know it wasn\u0027t stable early on, things took time to reach relative stability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRealistically, how big of an object can I stick at kerbin L4 while having it be relatively stable on the order of a billion years or so?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
