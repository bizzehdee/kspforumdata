Unmanned rockets already push G\u0027s that would be severely uncomfortable for manned flight.

Try launching a rocket in KSP and let MechJeb tally up the losses, you\u0027ll see it ending up maybe not exactly that but reasonably similar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the entirety of drag losses are 5% of the full budget required, how do you save \u0022a third off of launch costs\u0022, like the patent claims, by reducing them? At bare minimum, you need to significantly reduce gravity losses through a flatter trajectory. Then you\u0027re talking a value that actually matters, and you might indeed shave some 10% off of launch costs, because the tyranny of the rocket equation is working in your favor. That is, if your spaceport is cost competitive with traditional ground based ones in terms of launch fees.

No, that\u0027s not going to work. Not even in parts - because then your customer would need to rent a rocket factory on top of your 20km tall inflatable experimental structure which has preciously little space available to rent. And still haul up the parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe concept clearly calls for spaceplanes, which are built on the ground and then flown up. Unfortunately no spaceplanes are currently flying, the only two spaceplanes that ever went to space required humongous rockets to carry them there, and these planes would have to land and take off at extremely unsafe (potentially supersonic) speeds in order to have lift. And your runway would have to be gigantic.

Therefore you cannot just make the assumption that you can \u0022cut off\u0022 the gravity losses from the first 75 seconds of flight; your actual savings are going to be significantly less than that. You still have to launch vertically and pitch over slowly, or you\u0027ll flatten out too quickly and not go to space today. How quickly you can pitch over is going to be highly dependant on your liftoff TWR. Since gravity is only ~2% lower at that altitude than at sea level, it\u0027s not going to make much of a difference.
