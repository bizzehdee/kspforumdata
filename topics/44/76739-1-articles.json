Space suits help, but if we continue to explore the solar system, then it is only a matter of time before an astronaut experiences a catastrophic loss of suit pressure. But is there a way to keep an astronaut alive (at least temporarily) after that has happened?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine a device implanted in the astronaut\u0027s lung or otherwise connected to their bloodstream. It would have its own connection to the suit\u0027s oxygen supply and would be able to infuse the oxygen directly into the astronaut\u0027s blood in the event the suit lost pressure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I am asking is how long and how well an astronaut would be able to survive using this sort of device.

You don\u0027t explode or instantly freeze. In fact, it would take a very long time for you to freeze because there\u0027s no matter to carry away your heat into space. What would happen is that your blood would start boiling and blood vessels near your skin would start to burst. Basically, it would be highly destructive to your body, but if you still had oxygen reaching your brain, could you save yourself, or at least stay conscious long enough to be saved by other astronauts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Mars:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe pressure of the atmosphere is incredibly thin, would it really be much different from exposure to vacuum? The presence of atmosphere might actually make it worse, causing you to lose heat faster than you would in vacuum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Titan (a bit far fetched, but still interesting to consider):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere, atmospheric pressure isn\u0027t really the dangerous factor, and all you\u0027d need to consider is how long you would last if exposed to the super low temperature and possibly toxic gasses.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xenomorph555","CreatedById":103080,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-05T16:31:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere have been over 600 eva\u0027s, there is nothing to worry about.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shynung","CreatedById":101096,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-05T16:50:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022xenomorph555\u0022 data-cite=\u0022xenomorph555\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere have been over 600 eva\u0027s, there is nothing to worry about.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEVAs themselves are already a risky business.
