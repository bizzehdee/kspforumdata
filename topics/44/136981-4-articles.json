To have even a chance of a miss vs a single projectile the station needs to offset itself randomly by a cross-sectional radius. Say it\u0027s an O\u0027Neil colony cylinder, and the radius is 2 km. That means it needs to be able to (best case, end-on to attack) move 2km unpredictably between detection, and impact. That only allows for a chance the weapon will not hit, not a guarantee.
