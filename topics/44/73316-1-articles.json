It seems that tiangong-2 will be launching in late 2015 on the long march 5, IF it\u0027s ready on time, with a manned mission in the first half of 2016.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So we know there is going to be a longish wait between missions, which isn\u0027t unusual of the chinese, however it could be very beneficial to launch another mission to tiangong. Firstly they could do more experiments and also push the limits of t-1 if it were something like a 20 day mission. It would also keep the workforce occupied and up to date. It would also make tiangong a much better investment, good to get your moneys worth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think though?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-25T10:59:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Chinese mentioned that one of the factors limiting tiangong 1 lifespan was it didn\u0027t have good enough air filtering to prevent growth of mould.
