Also, we expect that in 100 years we\u0027ll have technology beyond our wildest dreams. But I think we have all grown up in a relatively strange age. Classical physics held sway for a very long time, hundreds of years counting from Newton or thousands counting from the first attempts to explain natural phenomena beyond \u0022angels pushing spheres\u0022 level of theory (APS theory, as I like to call it. Quite robust, so long as you accept the first premise). But we are still in the aftermath of the dawn of the 20th century. In terms of physics, we are still in the infancy of the new theories of relativity and QM. In terms of tech, we are living through a boom of technology not seen since the neolithic age.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, it seems that progress at this speed can\u0027t be sustained forever. Computers are not getting faster at the same rate anymore (used to be a five year old computer was useless for gaming, now you can get by pretty well). Physics experiments are only confirming theories, the anomalies just don\u0027t seem to be there. I mean, everyone was so excited that neutrinos might be braking the speed of light. Most physicists I spoke to assumed it was an error, but there was always this sort of \u0022but if they did \u00A0. . .\u0022 afterthought. Because that would be the starting point for a new paradigm. And in terms of space flight, I still hold we have stagnated for 30 years or more.

We got washing machines and fridges and electric stoves and vacuum cleaners because housework was backbreaking virtual slavery, and the suffering of domestic servants was of equal value to anyone else\u0027s.
