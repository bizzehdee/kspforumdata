I wish Einstein had come up with a different term. It took me quite a lot of time to understand that it is a one thing, not two different things bound together with some weird theory. To illustrate - let\u0027s strip one dimention, as we always do, from \u0027space\u0027 and substitute time instead. We now have a 3d object (say, a loaf of bread) where one end is the Big Bang and another one - the heat death of the Universe (or whatever end-of-the-world is in store for us).

The trajectory of each particle my body consists of has been \u0027fixed\u0027 at the moment of creation of our Universe. It\u0027s deterministic. At every single slice there will be only one copy of me. Normally. What I do now, what I will be doing in 10 minutes, 10 years from now - all of it is already there. The amount of matter and energy in each slice is constant. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine now I somehow manage to overcome the entropy of that system and bend the toothpick (my worldline) in such a way it will appear twice on some slices. If we take space and time separately then I just added energy to the space \u002710 minutes ago\u0027 by introducing my own self into it twice, but at the same time I subtracted energy from my former \u0027now\u0027 by removing myself from there. Only if we take the whole spacetime as a whole the laws of conservation can be preserved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the problem with time travel - I will need to reverse the entropy of the Universe. Will my toothpick (worldline) be bent to create a loop or will it break and create two separate worldines? Normally (without time mahchine) each particle has a worldline pointed in the direction the entropy increases so, if I re-arrange matter in the past, its particles will have no means to affect me also being in the past since without special means for time travel I will be the \u0027cause\u0027. So I don\u0027t think that if we assume time travelling is possible my memory would be in any danger of changing.
