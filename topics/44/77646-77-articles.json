Sliding contact allows the cylinder to rotate freely so we can get from and to arbitrary sample by turning just in one direction, and nothing bad happens if the servo logic accidentally tries to turn more than one turn...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrOnak","CreatedById":104432,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T22:52:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry if I\u0027m wrong but if you manage to get a well conducting sliding contact through the plastic of the petri dish and remain a pressure tight seal that survives the rigours of launch, you can get a wire through that as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nicholander","CreatedById":108347,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T23:06:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust shorten it to KSP CubeSat like MBobrik suggested.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sndrtj","CreatedById":110589,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T23:08:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m very late to this discussion, but where can I donate to this project?
