This comes from the proximity of Tylo to Jool. This system of gas giant-super earth abuses the distance and extremely high gravity for a moon (Earth\u0027s gravity is extremely strong given its size) to create a stable system.

Basically, collisions happen at random in the available material until you get a large enough \u0022seed\u0022 or \u0022embryo\u0022 that it starts pulling in the rest of the material around. From there on, it gains mass relatively rapidly through gravitational accretion until it runs out of stuff to accrete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, now what about moons? Well, there are a couple of ways for a planet to gain a moon. It can acquire one through gravitational capture of a passing object (such as Neptune\u0027s capture of Triton) or through a \u0022second generation\u0022 coalescence of material captured by a forming planet - a proto-munar disk so to speak. But here\u0027s a problem: in order for a planet to form its own accretion disk, it has to gravitationally capture material with sufficiently high angular momentum that that material begins to orbit the planet rather than accreting directly. But, since this material is coming from the primary stars\u0027 own accretion disk, anything in a similar orbit will have nearly zero angular momentum once it\u0027s captured, so you\u0027ve got to capture material from relatively far away (or, you\u0027ve got to find another method of generating the disk - this is what the Earth likely did, via collision). This means you\u0027ve got to be big. This is why Jupiter and Saturn have multiple large moons, but the small worlds other than Earth do not (and there were special circumstances for the Earth).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, for your scenario, you have that: a blue giant star which will likely have a huge protoplanetary disk with lots of stuff for forming planets, and a super-Jovian with lots of gravitational pull, capable of creating a large secondary accretion disk of its own. Now here\u0027s the tricky part: we need a third generation. It\u0027s no problem to buy that the super-Jove will pull in enough material for an Earth-sized or larger satellite. But, how is that satellite going to form a tertiary accretion disk so it can have a moon of it\u0027s own? The super-Jove\u0027s secondary disk will be large, but not that large, and the sphere of influence of the moon won\u0027t be big enough to attract material that doesn\u0027t simply accrete directly onto it. (Remember, not even the Earth is large enough to attract sufficient material for forming a large moon through direct accretion - and that\u0027s without a nearby gas giant to mess things up.) So, now we\u0027re looking at a collision type scenario similar to what happened for the Earth - basically, you\u0027d need two near Earth mass moons to form in super-Jovian orbit and then collide. But, even if this happened, that nearby super-Jove is going to screw up the accretion process by tidally perturbing the disk, which means your super-Earth moon might have a pretty ring for a few million years but never a moon of it\u0027s own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then there\u0027s the whole problem of that blue parent star going \u0022boom\u0022 in a few million years anyway (barely enough time to get this planet business started, frankly).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, in order to get what you want, you have to scale up that super-Jove until it\u0027s not a super-Jove anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tommygun","CreatedById":41293,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T01:07:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA second question that may need to be considered is how much radiation is coming form this gas giant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may need a small gas giant to keep from killing any life on this world unless it has evolved to adapt to it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheNewTeddy","CreatedById":68963,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T05:42:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022westair\u0022 data-cite=\u0022westair\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHe\u0027s saying that a water planets plausible average temperature comes in the form of a J-curve where the margin of maintaining 0-15C isn\u0027t the same, in terms of stability, as 85-100C.

The point where the entire atmosphere becomes unstable due to wet runaway greenhouse effect is low compared to the boiling point and more pressure does have only limited effect because the thing depends on absolute water vapor amount in atmosphere, not its relative proportions. It increases slowly with pressure because denser air traps heat on its own, so it will require more water vapor till it becomes unstable, but that is very limited because you are racing against an exponential function. At earths pressures and insolation it is around 25 degrees Celsius, so, say at increased pressure and decreased insolation can it be 28 or 30 deg C, but almost surely not 85 deg or more.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MBobrik","CreatedById":59889,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T15:46:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E It\u0027s no problem to buy that the super-Jove will pull in enough material for an Earth-sized or larger satellite.
