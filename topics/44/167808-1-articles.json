For any rocket that can be throttled you have wires to control the throttling mechanism.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. For any rocket that can be restarted multiple time you have a reignition wiring. (remember that a resting fuel in space/micro gravity has no shape in a tank, so that the fuel may have to be staged long enough to generate momentum of the fuel)\u003Cbr\u003E\n4. All rockets should have some sort of mechanism for shutting down when one of the fuels is found to be empty.\u003Cbr\u003E\n5.

The hydrolic fluid pump either needs to be run by the electrical system or off the turbocharger\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nControl. Turbopumps create pressures and the pressures need to be controlled and governed during flight, this can be done by forking the pressure down a regulatory line to another part of the pump, engine or other pump.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSome of these pressures could be fed though the turbopump but it may be easier if you have multiport (just like on a car were the vacuum lines are piped off a bus to various parts of the engine) just to use one of the outlets and a pipe, then all you have to do is drill a hole, thread the hole, screw in an inlet connector and run a high pressure aluminum line (such as the type used for power steering pump on a car).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere may be various needs for lubricant. At the core of the lubrication is the turbocharger (turbopump). The turbocharger is in a very \u0027corrosive\u0027 environment. At the end of the turbocharger there is a bearing, the bearing needs to be kept cool (below the seizing temperature) and lubricated (just like the valve stem in a cars engine).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.k-makris.gr/RocketTechnology/TurboPumps/turbopumps_for_liquid_rocket_eng.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.k-makris.gr/RocketTechnology/TurboPumps/turbopumps_for_liquid_rocket_eng.htm\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the turbocharger preburner outlet pressure and appropriate oxygen added exceed the oxygen inlet pressure, then an oxygen turbopump needs to be added otherwise the engine will be oxygen starved and thrust will be lost. To deal with this situation a separate turbo pump needs to be added, and this may require precise regulation between the turbochargers for the reductant and for the oxidant.
