In fact, it was a fully featured spaceship, with its own life-support systems, thermal management , guidance and control, telecommunications, emergency rescue, etc and capable of fully autonomous flight for days without the fgb. It could be used with an FGB or a OPS (Almaz station body) attached to it. Actually, sojuz and even apollo rerentry capsules are less \u0022full featured\u0022 than a VA so to speak. They are fully dependant to their service blocks. They cannot deorbit without them, they cannot survive long without them. VA can. Or could.^^ It was even reusable several times. Without the need for full replacement of its thermal shield, which could be restorated up to 10 times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS: during testing, the VA capsules where even launched without an FGB in a special double launch fairing (two VA capsules stacked, the lower one with the escape tower, but with its deorbit block). AFAIR on one if these tests the proton failed and the upper VA could be salvaged by using the excape tower. It flew again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-27T16:22:56Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2016 04:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by InsaneDruid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fredinno","CreatedById":143381,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-27T20:14:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222432093\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022132907\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221456580071\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257690\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sgt_flyer\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, sgt_flyer said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsoyuz 18-1 did not have it\u0027s escape tower anymore ny the time it had to\u00A0abort. they had to\u00A0abort because\u00A0the separation between the core stage and the upper stage malfunctionned, sending the upperstage on the wrong trajectory, while\u00A0the escape tower was\u00A0ejected shortly after the side booster separations, so in this particular\u00A0case, they did the same as Saturn V mode II abort - they separated the spacecraft from the block I upperstage, used the spacecraft\u0027s own engine to put some distance and get to the proper attitude, then separated the spacecraft like they used to for normal reentries.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...which is a capability\u00A0the Shuttle needed, desperately, in 1986.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-01T17:36:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222432093\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022132907\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221456580071\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257690\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sgt_flyer\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 27.02.2016 at 4:34 PM, sgt_flyer said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsoyuz 18-1 did not have it\u0027s escape tower anymore ny the time it had to\u00A0abort. they had to\u00A0abort because\u00A0the separation between the core stage and the upper stage malfunctionned, sending the upperstage on the wrong trajectory, while\u00A0the escape tower was\u00A0ejected shortly after the side booster separations, so in this particular\u00A0case, they did the same as Saturn V mode II abort - they separated the spacecraft from the block I upperstage, used the spacecraft\u0027s own engine to put some distance and get to the proper attitude, then separated the spacecraft like they used to for normal reentries.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, you\u00A0 are right, I\u0027ve took a look in the book - indeed, Soyuz-18-1 had separated after the LES had been ejected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
