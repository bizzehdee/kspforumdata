The reason for that is simple: Isp is based on exit velocity. So if you spew out matter twice as fast you get twice the Isp. Thrust is based on exit velocity times mass flow, so twice the exit velocity means twice the thrust. But, energy scales with velocity squared, so you\u0027ll need 4 times the energy to double your Isp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour spacecraft only has a limited amount of energy at its disposal. It can only draw so many watts from its power source. So you have to pick between pumping out a lot of mass at low speeds (high thrust, low Isp) or pumping a small amount of mass at high speed (low thrust high Isp). In the high thrust - low Isp area chemical engines win by a landslide. The reason is that they use their reaction mass as energy source, this way they don\u0027t need to drag a heavy nuclear reactor around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBlimps wouldn\u0027t really help either, the main hurdle to get into space is getting up to orbital speed, not exiting the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe spacehook could be an idea here. You essentially have a long rope with a counterweight in low earth orbit and make sure that it spins in such a way that the tip dips into the atmosphere and moves slowly relative to the surface. You could then \u0027catch\u0027 the tip using an aircraft when the hook is at it\u0027s lowest point and the spacehook would lift you into space. Then you just have to release the cable when you picked up enough lateral velocity and circularize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously the skyhook would start to deorbit after a while thanks to atmospheric drag and the spaceships leeching momentum, so you\u0027d have to occasionally grab an asteroid or container with heavy stuff and lower it down to earth to maintain orbit. The space elevator is actually a special case of the skyhook, but thanks to the enormous length the elevator is much harder to build than a space hook would be. It still has some serious downsides though, the physics of long cables in orbit are really weird and difficult to predict. Not to mention you have to grab a hook moving at immense speed in the upper atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther ideas could be a giant cannon, a maglev train suspended above the atmosphere via centripetal force and ablating a block of metal remotely with a giant array of ground based lasers. All of these ideas are absolutely bonkers and have major technological hurdles. So, until we manage to get more efficient energy storage/generation or we have some major breakthroughs in material science that makes one of the above ideas possible we\u0027re stuck with rockets I\u0027m afraid.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T12:48:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00225thHorseman\u0022 data-cite=\u00225thHorseman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis calls for a big rail gun going up the side of a mountain.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with those sorts of suggestions is that the G forces involved would ruin most payloads.

In a uniform magnetic field it doesn\u0027t matter how you move something, the energy stored in the combined magnetic field will be the same regardless. No change in energy = no force = nothing to hold on to. For example, for magnetic levitation to occur the following threshold needs to be satisfied:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB*(dB/dz) = u\u003Csub\u003E0\u003C/sub\u003E*density*(g/X).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a perfect superconductor X (How easy it is for the magnetic field to penetrate it) will always be -1. This means perfect deflection, no magnetic field can ever enter the material, so this is the best possible case. Let\u0027s be kind and say the earth\u0027s magnetic field extends 1000km from the surface and uniformly decays over that distance. So dB/dz = 1e-10 T/m. u\u003Csub\u003E0\u003C/sub\u003E is defined as 4*pi*10\u003Csup\u003E-7\u003C/sup\u003E so we know a superconductor needs a density of 8.1e-10 kg/m^3 or less to keep itself afloat in the earth\u0027s magnetic field at sea level (it gets worse when you go higher up).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsidering that the same volume of air at sea level weighs 1.4 billion times more, I reckon that\u0027s a bit of a tall order. If you wanted to levitate a payload of 1kg and you had magical superconductors that weighed nothing at all, you\u0027d need a sphere with a diameter of nearly 1.3 km to keep it levitated.
