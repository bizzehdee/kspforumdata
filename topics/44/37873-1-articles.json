Take a look at the hypsographic curve of earth, for example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/EarthHypso.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EarthHypso.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt shows that earth has two domains, continents are mostly 0--1 km high, oceans mostly 5--4 km deep. So it makes sense to compare Mount Everest\u0027s height to sea level, but to compare, say, Mauna Kea\u0027s height to the average depth of the oceans. Also, for Mount Everest, you might just as well argue that it rises above the Indian plains, as it sits on the watershed between India/Nepal and Tibet. (I think?) But the Tibet plateau is just mindboggling. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/MountEverestRelief.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/MountEverestRelief.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hypsographic curve of Mars shows two domains, for example, for the differen hemispheres.

Because the earth isn\u0027t a sphere, and has an equatorial bulge, Mount Everest isn\u0027t the furthest point from the center of the earth. That\u0027s the Chimborazo in Ecuador.
