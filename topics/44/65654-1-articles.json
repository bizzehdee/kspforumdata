Moderators feel free to close the thread if there is doubt. To be accurate i am not assurting any conspiracy theories. Im only citing my critizisms to their individual points. For example: im not saying: the moon landing was faked. But im saying: some people think the moon landings where faked, whats the counterpoints/evidence it was not faked viewed against the points assurted?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm sure this has been brought up before but im too lazy to bring up an old thread so ill make a new one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy main inspiration for this thread was a moon landing hoax documentary i just saw and the huge amount of these theories floating around and ill be discussing some of the points brought up by that video but feel free to bring up other points i may have missed. For the reference i do not believe the moon landing was faked but i will attempt to be objective. Some of these are related points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConspiracy theory 1: the video/footage from cameras seem unaffected by solar radiation and particles which are of very high quantity outside the earths van allen belt(ie no distortions/ dots etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thoughts: there has as iwe seen been no indipendent experiments done on this effect in space outside the van allen belt so no real evidence exists. Also the videos and photos look quite grainy and has artifacts, even for period tech to me so this may be the actual effect seen in action just not as pronounced as the conspiracy theory suggests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConspiracy theory 2)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe us government knew that astronauts couldnt survive outside the van allen belt without significant radiation shielding that would have made the saturn v too big and heavy to be practical with 60s tech(ie the apollo capsule is paper thin and should offer no protection from radiation) so they decided to fake the whole thing instead. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thoughts: while this is a good point, as far as i know humans can survive a moderate radiation environement for a limited period without immediate effects(not concidering cancer risk) the only main risk afaik would come from large solar flares but they are not frequent and i would think the us government would still take this risk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConspiracy theory 3) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the saturn v rocket was so successfully as the us government claimed then why was the system scrapped following the apollo programme in favour of the space shuttle that had a conciderably lower payload tonnage? The reason must be that it was not a good launch system in the first place and could not have enough deltav for the moon transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thoughts: this is one of the sillier theories in my mind. First of all video images from the time can be seen from the ground of the final orbital stage seperation and as we know from ksp/other sources once youre in orbit youre already 90% of the way there. My thoughts are that even tho the tonnage capability of the saturn V was high it was probably hugely fuel uneconomical because of its top down staging and lack of any recoverable stages as well as reliability concerns. The theories also claim that the huge thrust plume was because cerosene was added for extra effect to the rocket plume because there was such an issue with the thrust plume constraint of the engine.(even if that was a true thing then why in the world would they want to do that for something most ppl wouldnt even notice? A most silly theory) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: as someone pointed out the saturn v was tracked from the ground and could therefore not have remained in orbit /landing without anyone noticing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConspiracy theory 4)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main point of moon landing/apollo hoax theorists is that the footage was faked citing among others these inconsistencies: there is no thrust plume from the lem ascent stage, there is no cratering from the decent stage plume, no/minimal dust is threwn up by the thrust from the lem as its landing decending, multiple light sources etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thoughts: my main answer to all the footage faking theories is to look at the periods special effects in films. There is no way the footage could be faked in any realistic fashion even given a limitless budget with 60s tech (even with todays cgi animations it would be very tricky to achieve an as natural looking effect as the footage even through intentional blurring\u002Badding artifacts). Also i believe the discovery channel show \u0022mythbusters\u0022 tested and disproved all of the visual signs of fakery and also that the low gravity movement of the astronauts on the surface could not be faked using cranes/slowing down the footage etc. Most of the thrust effect/dust visuals and lack of cratering from the lem is likely due to the low gravity/vacume. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: conspiracy theory 5)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe us and ussr was in collusion to fake different aspects of both their spaceprogrammes. And also as the ussr was first several times in achievements of spacetravel but why give up when the us made it to the moon? Shouldnt they be close to the us in tech and be almost ready to go there. The conspiracy theorists assurt that this was because both the ussr and the us knew it was not possible to go to land and return from the moon with the tech of the time and agreed not to push the hoax further\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thoughts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is ilogical even on the face of it to me.. the ussr and the us was not exactly friends during this period so there is no way they would cooperate. Even tho the two nations would later cooperate on space exploration, this was during the time when they where they where quite bitter twoards one another. I dont know the actual reason the ussr didnt push to land a man on the moon(do anyone have any ideas?)..but im pretty sure it was not because of some cooperation with the us. In addition to the other points this one actually makes things look even worse for the conspiracy theories. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIll add more if i think of them\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-13T17:51:23Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2014 05:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by landeTLS\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thiel","CreatedById":13126,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-13T10:05:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Forum Rules\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Forum Rules\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E2.

Every try to get a group of people to keep a secret? It just doesn\u0027t work. Some one will slip up leak inadvertently, or screw up the cover story, ect. Furthermore, the Apollo astronauts were globally reminisced and could not be hidden. It would be like hiding Miley Cyrus, it just isn\u0027t going to happen. Hiding in orbit would not work either. The Apollo missions were tracked from the ground, look into Apollo guidance for proof of this, and a second launch just to orbit the crew would be noticed.

The core of the conspiracists fabricate some argument that sounds plausible, it then gets repeated so often that the more casual crowd sees it as solid evidence and never delves deep enough to expose the flaws.
