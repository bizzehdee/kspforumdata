For a start, solar panels are extremely bad at generating energy at our current level of technology. They\u0027re also quite fragile, which means that sticking them in roads where they are exposed to traffic and weather is a terrible idea. Thus for protection they have to be covered in some polymer that requires extensive maintenance and, because it\u0027s not 100% transparent, reduces the efficiency of the cells. You\u0027d be much better off installing the things on the roof, something I\u0027d support. And this whole thing about being able to heat up to remove snow? The amount of energy required to do that would far exceed their generation capabilities. I don\u0027t like solar power because as people have said, it\u0027s pretty pathetic at generating power. That\u0027s why I believe fusion power is the way to go for the future, because it\u0027s clean and near infinite with an enormous energy load. We should be devoting our resources to developing that, instead of these daft roadways. Until then, stick to fission power, at least for a little while.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skyler4856","CreatedById":76452,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-12T00:29:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBefore we go off into a discussion of other power sources, let us not forget what the implementation of these road ways would cause.
