You can read 100 books and use 1000 programs, but if you don\u0027t relate to it somehow it will always be a challenge. I failed, or almost failed, math pretty much every year I was in school. When I got out I got into computer programming and all the sudden numbers made sense... It was like a switch went off once I had a reason to actually care about it. KSP may even be able to do that in some sense, because you always need to know unknown things, even with your trial and error methods, you should be gaining some sense of what is needed. You are solving for x already, just with brute force instead of numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bivouac","CreatedById":68988,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-20T20:40:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat you\u0027re looking for can be found on Khan Academy.

The older version from the 60\u0027s/70\u0027s is superior to the newer more \u0022modern\u0022 versions. Reason being, the first edition was written before calculators became a common tool used in mathematics.

The format is that of \u003Cem\u003Eshort\u003C/em\u003E workbooks; a full explanation is presented, but the majority of the teaching is via worked examples, and as far as I recall full solutions are presented for any questions asked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first workbook covers notation fully, and start with very simple algebraic concepts, essentially easing into the abstraction from specific numbers to general variables, showing that you can cancel variables etc. - really the most basic of things.
