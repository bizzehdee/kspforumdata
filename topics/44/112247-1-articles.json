Such sleeping arrangements are not limited to subs; During the Korean War, my dad, assigned to one of the 6 destroyers of the Inchon pre-invasion fleet (*USS Gurke DD-783*, *some stories there - sitting ducks - in the thick of it*), had two bunkies. Their shift rotations were coordinated with two on duty while one slept. Hard times. Not much room in the rack either. Pity the man whose time off was during the beach softening.\n\nIf you\u0027re not familiar with the story of the \u0027sitting ducks\u0027 of the Inchon invasion, do Google and read up."},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T18:22:14Z","Content":"Hot bunking is common practice even on surface ships and fishing vessels.

Capsules are a different story, I\u0027d imagine.\n\nThe ISS seems to be the exception when it comes to hot bunking, though I am sure that also has to do with psychological stability of the crew and the stresses being long stretches of time in space puts on humans. Both on the ISS and in other craft, space flight is a hugely inelegant affair. The ISS is a shining star of luxury in that it actually has a separate toilet and cubicle style private \u0027rooms\u0027 (i.e. a cardboard box to sleep in), but that is about all the luxury you get. Oh, and that fancy window of course, that is a big plus ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) Otherwise, space is a very bare-bones experience with little room for shame or feelings of being uncomfortable. Going to space means experiencing all your crew\u0027s nasty habits and bodily functions.\n\nFor the most part, space flight is pooping in bags (or your pants) while being shoulder to shoulder to your crew mates, and stuffing used paper behind your seat. Oh, and let us not forget the ever present danger of a horrible death.\n\n![45fn988w-1366765446.jpg](https://62e528761d0685343e1c-f3d1b99a743ffa4142d9d7f1978d9686.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/22814/area14mp/45fn988w-1366765446.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T20:32:17Z","Content":"Hmmm, maybe it\u0027s a bit off-topic, but i have a question.

So, how clean air aboard ISS really is? I mean there are machines and electronic devices everywhere - some of them have moving parts (metal and plastic particles being produced).

Not to mention human crew dusting everything with lint, dead skin cells and dandruff.

Not only is the ISS equipped with high performance [HEPA filters](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/900.html), cleaning the station is a frequent and recurring task on board just to get that build up out of every nook and cranny.\n\nYou can bet that the ISS is one of the more monitored and controlled environments available."}]}
