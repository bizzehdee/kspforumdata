The persistence of this dichotomy may be attributed in part to the fundamental importance of the separation of inherited and acquired characters within neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory, one of the essential foundations for the modern study of behavior. A cornerstone of early neo-Darwinian thought was August Weismann\u0027s theory of the germ plasm, which proposed a segregation between germinal and somatic cells during development, thus ruling out the possibility that acquired characters could be inherited. This denial of Lamarckian hereditary mechanisms became one of the hallmarks of neo-Darwinism, as opposed to classical Darwinism. Within the neo-Darwinian framework it thus became important, as Weismann himself pointed out, to distinguish sharply between inherited and acquired characters. Although the dichotomy has frequently been criticized it remains tenacious, surfacing in different guises as older versions of it became terminologically unacceptable. The analysis offered here suggests that this tenacity may partly be explained by the implications of Weismann\u0027s germ-plasm theory, and its modern incarnation in the central dogma of molecular genetics, and by the central thematic position of those ideas in the neo-Darwinian foundations of modern behavioral biology\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7602088/#:~:text=A%20cornerstone%20of%20early%20neo,acquired%20characters%20could%20be%20inherited.\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7602088/#:~:text=A cornerstone of early neo,acquired characters could be inherited.\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSee also,\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weismann_barrier\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weismann_barrier\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat caught my attention {prompting this and the post above} was a line in a video about the misdirection of resources and research in genetics, especially the medical application of our understanding of genetics.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the exception of about 5% of our genetic code, merely deactivating a known \u0027switch\u0027 for a disorder does not provide a cure.

This is *sort of* the opposite.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0027standard model\u0027 is that DNA is determinative and that the germ ( reproductive cells) is isolated from the rest of the organism, such that over time (millions of generations) variations in the combination of germs from the successful individuals drives the evolution of the species - regardless of events within the individual\u0027s experience / lifetime.\u00A0 It\u0027s a very binary theory - successful individuals survive to procreate, failures die, and the successful genome (established before birth) is passed on (in combination with another successful individual) to succeeding generations.\u00A0 \u00A0This is the standard view of evolution.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIconoclasts are making waves.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey start with the notion that the germ isn\u0027t isolated from entity and that experience within the lifetime of the organism can rewrite portions the germ DNA. This makes sense to me - especially in light of research I read decades ago regarding heritability of stress response: parent generation experiencing great stress can pass on heightened stress response to the next generation.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSerious consternation is ensuing - as is publication \u0026amp; counterpublication.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMIT just published some of this for anyone willing to shell out the $75.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway - interesting developments in biology afoot\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUrgh.\u00A0 Didn\u0027t like this article at all.\u00A0 Sensationalist, muddled, and technically out of date.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe opening part about \u0027the genetic cures will never happen\u0027 is flat out wrong.
