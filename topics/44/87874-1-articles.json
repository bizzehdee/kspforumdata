While, i will admit that SOME of the coils seen in this scene are 100% INCAPABLE of this feat, others in the scene are absolutely capable of it. You need a Solid State Tesla Coil, some serious electricity, and well, some serious engineering, and a few other bits and bobs to do this. btw, 100% dangerous and potentially lethal if you have less than a FIRM grasp of what you are doing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI prove to you that, yes, this is possible, found this video a few years ago on youtube, but, yeah, this stuffs neat!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/7OT8pHpUz2k?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know some of you are aware of musical solid state tesla coils, but, hey, never hurts to spread some awesome around right?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-19T08:07:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.arcattack.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.arcattack.com/\u003C/a\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-19T14:17:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBut someone can explain with detail how is achieve?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELightning may have its own frequency that can go from 0 to 100khz.
