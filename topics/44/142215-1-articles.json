At one point in the universe energy poured into an inflating universe the same way dark energy\u00A0pours in today. The only difference is that today there are photon emmitting massive reference points and in the early universe, shrouded by the CMBR, there are no such points because the compact universe was\u00A0too energetic.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat needs to be appreciated here is that the early universe was a quantum state, superposition, it gets hairy because in that\u00A0state all energy is supposed to be in a quantum space time unit, but\u00A0as would other wise be known a point with infinite energy density. The\u00A0collapse of this state\u00A0is inflation which leads to quantum space-time that becomes classic space-time as observed. According to the model,\u00A0energy subsequently pours into the universe as exotic particles which eventually leads to the observable matter and energy today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are numbers of theories out there that the inflating and reduction of scalar\u00A0quantum spacetime fields is responsible for our visible universe, in much the same way that we can with high enough energy,\u00A0pluck out higgs fields of inreasing energy, these can then be converted to other things.

This is our observable, we\u00A0measure the propogation of fields through comoving space-time, and now we can\u00A0apparently also measure space-time waves. So lets not put the cart before the horse, because fundemental to the question of what (energy) causes secondary inflation is how spacetime behaves, and as of yet we still have not \u0027detected\u0027 unitary interactions of quantum space-time.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-22T13:17:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh.

For example, it implies that spacetimes in one site can have relative velocity to spacetime in other site - which is clearly not contained in General Relativity (apart from Kerr and Kerr-Newman metric plus the linear version of it, shortly frame-dragging, but those are only from rotation, or you need a moving mass, not intrinsic to spacetime, so unless you want to say that everything is rotating around us that is, or something very massive is moving out very quickly beyond the Hubble distance - oops, we can\u0027t even tell (!) ; then again, why in the hell would they move very quick ?
