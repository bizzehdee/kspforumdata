losing one of four redundant landers (and 2-3 crew members with it) in a crash due to a landing\u00A0computer\u00A0failure is not nearly so bad as losing the entire ITS due to a couple of the thermal

class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI fully agree with you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn an ideal world one would have several \u003Cem\u003Ereusable LMO ships\u003C/em\u003E on Mars, that resupply a \u003Cem\u003Emain vessel\u003C/em\u003E in LMO orbit. This to limit chance when\u00A0 failures occur. Like you mention.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that eventually this will be the way it is going to work! But it will take several iterations of going to Mars (by who ever is going), whereby each iteration lays the foundations to make the idea\u0027s you lay \u003Cstrong\u003Eeventually possible\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpaceX now is rather constrained with what can be done, \u003Cem\u003Econstrained financially I mean\u003C/em\u003E. They had to make choices so that Musk\u0027s idea would tick ALL the boxes within what is currently feasible. That means having to sacrifice on idea\u0027s (maybe you local LMO lander) for the very near\u00A0 mission future, until more can be done as the price goes down. Take the current reuse of the F9 as example: if they accomplish that the price to orbit will go down drastically.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what I think will happen: first they do it \u0022as simple as possible\u0022 (current ITS) and over several missions they build the foundations on Mars to make possible: the unique reusable Mars LMO crafts, which would enable the refuel and resupplying of in orbit ITS ships.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope my writing the above can get together the people here trying to over voice each others ego with theyre ideas. \u003Cstrong\u003ECause you all are right but fail to accept each others argument in a correct timeframe. \u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree that Musk is trying to keep it simple and R\u0026amp;D costs low. \u00A0But I do believe that to be a VERY bad idea. \u00A0Part of the reason that we\u0027ve never gone to Mars is not because there were no simple ideas- it was because nobody was willing to make the large investments necessary to make it economical with more complex ones (like reusable launch stages!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou would think Musk of all people would understand this, what with his being one of key figures in landing orbital launch stages back on Earth for the first time in history. \u00A0Without that INVESTMENT, a Mars colonization effort\u00A0would\u00A0never be remotely feasible. \u00A0But it\u0027s clear Musk hasn\u0027t learned the correct lesson from this- you have to be willing to take on lots of difficult challenges in order to accomplish anything worthwhile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0The simple ITS plan Musk proposed is the easy road, not the hard one, at this point. \u00A0He-s already developed the ability to land launch stages, and he\u0027s going to run with that as far as it will take him. \u00A0But sadly, I fear that won\u0027t be quite enough- the current ITS plan will probably turn out to be somewhat more expensive to operate than it appears on paper, and I fear it will likely prove just a *bit* too expensive to get the kind of large-scale buy-in Musk needs and is hoping for... (a reusable lander would save money going forward, after the R\u0026amp;D costs were sunk- and might just make the difference between \u0022too expensive\u0022 and \u0022pricey but worth it\u0022 Mars tickets for many people...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead of charging ahead, I sincerely believe Musk needs to lay a few more foundations and work on developing lander technology and building\u00A0experience with interplanetary missions on a smaller scale before he attempts his Mars plan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich should be fine- even at SpaceX, rockets never come in on-schedule. \u00A0The Falcon Heavy was supposed to be flying years ago, for instance. \u00A0His Mars Colonial Teansporter booster will probably face similar delays. \u00A0So he should take his time to practice. \u00A0In my opinion, making Red Dragon landings and starting work on a reusable lander with some test vehicles here on Earth (and maybe at the Moon)\u00A0would be an excellent way for Musk to cut his teeth on interplanetary missions and designing for them while his team works out all the technical issues with the ITS/MCT.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNASA was planning on a Moon-first strategy under Constellation for a reason, and while I feel that may have been a bit too conservative an approach, Musk would be wise to develop something smaller like a reusable lander he could send (unmanned)\u00A0to Luna\u00A0or\u00A0Mars\u00A0to gain experience with interplanetary missions\u00A0before he builds an ITS and sends it to Mars...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegards,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNorthstar\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gkirmathal","CreatedById":135480,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-07T11:15:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/91005-northstar1989/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002291005\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/91005-northstar1989/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Northstar1989\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes I think you are correct, but I also think Musk is fully aware of this and that he is limited in what he can currently accomplish financially.
