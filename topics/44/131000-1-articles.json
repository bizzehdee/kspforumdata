The same holds true for engines. Developing an engine, and then building one, is essentially the largest cost (mostly labor costs, they\u0027re very complex and take quite a lot of man hours to construct). That\u0027s one of the reasons that the Delta IV (which uses RS-68s, home grown engines) is more expensive than the Atlas V, which uses engines derived from a late 70s/80s design. A lot of the R\u0026amp;D was already done, in fact, the Atlas III used the RD-180. So it was already developed, the only thing needed beyond that was to purchase units and integrate them into the rocket.

It\u0027ll take a lot for ULA to be completely forfeited- Atlas V and Delta IV have a pretty much untainted track record (there were a few partial failures), and ULA has a reputation for making every launch a success.

The Titan IV cost a huge amount of money to launch, and it also had a bad safety record. During these hiatuses in launches due to launch failures, the DOD could not launch anything, and this could undermine the security of the DOD\u0027s space presence. It isn\u0027t hugely difficult to sabatoge a launch- all you need is a employee who leaves a stray towel or debris.
