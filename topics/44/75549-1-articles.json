Having a cable much longer than\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; geosynch is *useful*. You can launch a spacecraft toward any\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; planet in the solar system by simply climbing up to the right\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; height, and letting go at the right moment. No rockets, no\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; fuel(*), just push the right button on the elevator. \u0022Second\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; floor: Mars, the Asteroids.... Third floor: Jupiter, the Trojan\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; Colonies... Fourth Floor: Saturn...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; (*) It\u0027s not a free ride to the planets. The energy to accelerate\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; the spacecraft comes from slowing down the cable. You have to put\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; energy back into the cable somehow, and rockets mounted to the\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; cable might be the best way to do so. But they can be *good*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; rockets...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo rockets necessary. The cable \u0022leans\u0022 a little from coriolis\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eforce as the spacecraft rides up it. The lean puts a torque\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eon the earth through the anchor. Momentum and energy is\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etransferred from the earth to the spacecraft through the sideways\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecomponent of the leaning cable force vector acting on the\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eupriding spacecraft. Some sway remains after launch, but there\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eare damping effects, eg electromagnetic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you feel guilty about stealing earth\u0027s rotational energy to\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elaunch you to Saturn, assuage your guilt by returning the same\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eway. As you grapple your way down the cable to synchronous\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealtitude against the centrifugal force, and then coast down with\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egravity below synchronous, the cable leans the other way and\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyour energy and momentum are returned to mother earth.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dedjal","CreatedById":57220,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T22:38:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould not.
