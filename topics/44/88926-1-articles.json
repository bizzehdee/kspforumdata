Columbia was originally built with ejection seats, but the STS-1 crew went on record saying that they would have been ejected right into the exhaust from the SRBs had they used them. Even without the ejection seats installed, the remaining hardware and structural enhancements required for them made Columbia too heavy to safely rendezvous with Mir or ISS. They also investigated a separating cockpit capsule after Challenger, as the cockpit did survive the explosion, but the added weight of structural reinforcements, separation rockets, explosive bolts, parachutes and rescue equipment would have negated the effectiveness of such a system, not to mention the modifications potentially posing their own hazards and the added cost of retrofitting the remaining shuttle fleet.
