Birthrates have fallen around most of the world due to increases in education, increased standards of living and longevity, and improving access to healthcare. Human populations are growing, but by lower and lower rates each year. The U.N. projects a worse case scenario of the world population peaking in the 2050\u0027s at around 10 billion people, and declining gradually afterwards as the world average growth rate becomes negative (as it already is in most of the developed world). Other estimates suggest the peak will come sooner at 8-9 billion. The current world population is over 7.2 billion. The Malthusian problem has been avoided for decades because of huge improvements in agricultural productivity. This trend doesn\u0027t seem to be changing, though water resources will likely grow more scarce in the relatively near future.

Countries only go through the demographic transition to lower birth rates when they industrialise, standards of living go up and child mortality and social security rise to levels where they can risk having fewer children. The problem is that when they do this, energy use rises. So essentially the problem is that we either let the developing world match our levels of wealth and see energy use use rise, or we watch them wallow in povety, population continues to grow and energy use rises. Hence our energy problem. Personally I\u0027d definitely go for the first option, it\u0027s more humane and at least the population problem stabilises so we can plan effectively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the OP\u0027s question wasn\u0027t about our prospects of tackling the energy problem, they were suggesting we\u0027d already lost that battle and the climate had dived into a positive feedback loop. I\u0027m not confident there\u0027s much we could do. We lack competence at controlled geoengineering, so we\u0027d be making it up as we went along, and the consequences of any mistakes would be dire, so we\u0027d need to be fairly cautious. Ideas such as spraying aerosols into the atmosphere to increase radiative forcing have been mooted, as has seeding the oceans (with iron, IIRC) to increase their ability to sequester carbon. Manual geological sequestration of emissions is still an experimental technology, and unlikely to be effective on the scale we require IMO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for giant sunshades, it might not be necessary to build them from scratch, and they would need to cover more than a fairly small fraction of the incoming sunlight. Cheapest option could be grabbing asteroids and moving them to a lower orbit, and the technology to do so is available now. Why haul all that mass up from Earth when there\u0027s plenty of big lumpy rocks lying around up there?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main problem of course is that projects on this kind of scale would require massive international cooperation, and that\u0027s difficult to pull off at the best of times. During an existential crisis it\u0027s not at all certain that we\u0027d be able to get everybody to agree on any one course of action. It\u0027s likely that you\u0027d get a small group of wealthy countries having to simply do what they thought best, and hopefully most of the others wouldn\u0027t be doing too much that actively worked against what they were doing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a lot of little simple things that we should be doing already though.
