Please help.\n\nFunny story.\n\nI have a garage, essentially what we call here a *tear down*, it had huge cracks in the floor and ~11\u0022 (~28 cm) of subsidence in the back, when it rained the garage became a pond, that\u0027s how much subsidence had taken place, there was no way to tear the slab out. So I jacked up the garage walls and poured lightweight concrete under the edge with rebar, and the poured light weight concrete on Styrofoam sections (IIRC 4\u0027x1.5\u0022x15\u0022; stack as needed) with occasional beam. I was really conservative about concrete use because of the weight and expense, and so the top-slab tended to range 3 to 4 inches (7.5 to 10 cm). I did this in order to keep the weight of the material down, the soil in our area is more or less a spongy mud so you don\u0027t want to put alot of force on one side of the foundation. During the last 2 *hurricane*, my wheels were bone dry. Worked so well I jacked up the adjacent slab and slid Styrofoam 1/2\u0022 x 4\u0027 x 8\u0027 sheets underneath and compressed sand to fill and that hasn\u0027t lost level in 10 years. Given one had moved 12\u0022 in 45yr and the other 6\u0022 (3\u0027 of tilt) in 45yr I would say its holding quite well. The stability I attribute to the styrofoam, it absolutely stopped wicking and I believe the wicking between rains was causing the soil to deorganify faster and shrink. It also absorbs shifts better than concrete (which tends to crack). I was sure the floor would crack and subside where the Styrofoam was, but to date no cracks, got a fully loaded pleasure boat wheels and a car wheels setting on it so . . . .yeah styro holds. Smartest thing you can do if you have to build up on soft soils. \n\nDo an experiment yourself. Take a long pipe and a flat piece of Styrofoam (shipper foam will do), seal a cap on one end of the pipe, hold it strait up on the styrofoam and add water to the other end (or get help) you will see that it will take alot of water. You can remove the pipe and see how much the stryofoam has given, your are probably going to have to buy another section of pipe before it seriously damages the stryofoam. Now imagine the weight if you had a room filled with that much water (and proportional weight of pipe). When they pour the concrete on the foam beads there will be some dimpling (small rocks, aeration damage, etc) but after that it will resist compression. Where you will see perturbations of the foam is on the bottom, where roots, critters, cracks and deformations of the soil occur. If that was your concrete slab, there would be a good chance it would have cracked, the stryo is a buffer between the hideous DoT forces that occur underground and your slabs desire not to be bent or twisted (it only likes to be compressed)."},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T06:55:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Don\u0027t forget you have to multiply by 9.81 m/s^2 to get the force in Newtons... kg is a unit of mass.\n\u003E 75 kN/m^2 is a unit of force per surface area- of pressure.

But it is true that scales that give weights in kilograms are actually measuring kilograms force, unless it\u0027s a balance scale.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-06T21:37:22Z\u0022 title=\u002203/06/2015 09:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|**"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T16:49:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I know, but it\u0027s not going to be used in physics or in a physics book. Let\u0027s not confuse the guy, please.\n\u003E At least he doesn\u0027t have to do some problems in U.S. customary units, like physics books here in the U.S. will do. They\u0027ll throw in a problem where everything is in feet, inches, gallons (or, God forbid, tablespoons), pounds force, pounds mass, PSI, horsepower, etc. Those problems are most easily solved by just converting the initial problem statement into SI, solve the problem, then convert the answer back to U.S. customary to make the book/teacher happy.\n\nYes but when I say I weigh 150 lbs, its factually correct (unless you are in Britian, in which a pound is a piece of paper with an ole lady\u0027s face illustrated on it, whose value appears to dive when any number of bank scandals happen, go figure that one). \n\nthis is an answer to multiple posts not just this one.\n\nIn the lab we \u0027weigh\u0027 out grams. There is a reason for that usage.\n\nA grams weight is subject to change, but for the sake of an experiment if I want a 1 molar solution that is:\n\n MW in g/mole \\* desire M in mole/liter \\* desired final volume in liter(s) = and so that answer is not in Newtons, the answer is in grams. To state it correctly would be to measure 1 gram on a balance and that was true 40 years ago when we used balances to weigh bigger things, and still true if you are measuring say 0.1 milligram on an analytical balance. But since we don\u0027t use balances anymore and the devise is electronic you really are weighing something and converting the weight to mass electronically. \n\nWhen you go to the doctors office and he puts you on a scale (the tall thing with the sliding weights on it), that is actually a balance, he is measuring your mass and the scale units assume that gravity is 9.8m/s. So guess what both are wrong terms. Technically a weight can only come from a calibrated tension measuring device, and a mass can only directly come from a balance, and a pound is not a piece of paper with a lady\u0027s face on it. \n\nBut these restrictions appear to have no meaning in modern lexicon........\n\nThe real answer here is that unit conversion is real sucky, we should all convert to the kg m sec newt watt joule system and universally use scientific notation, just like everyone should use IAPUC nomenclature to describe chemicals (unlike some pharmaceuticals that have 2 dozen different names), but we don\u0027t and so space-ship on occasion has been known to crash into martian surface, with embarrassed red faces somewhere saying \u0027doh\u0027. Live with it. \n\nYou live in a society where they trust garbagemen and oil derrick-trained CEO\u0027s opinion on global warming more than that of 99% of scientist and their preacher/reverend/priest more than evolutionary biologist on the topic of evolution, and where they believe the US constitution was written by god\u0027s reincarnation on earth . . . . . . . . . then the unit conversion issue is the least of your problems."},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T15:58:13Z","Content":"The difference of gravitational acceleration on various Earth surface is too small to be cared for general use - hence why the balance we use gives us the original reading (kilograms force ? Never actually used it) divided with a pretty much stable coefficient, the (mean ?) gravitational acceleration at Earth\u0027s surface.\n\nHad it mattered, even the question where the Moon and Sun is and their current distance would matter so much, for every time we measure mass. (so the difference due to elevation and reliefs is in a similar magnitude to tidal force I guess)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-08T16:03:56Z\u0022 title=\u002203/08/2015 04:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by YNM**"}]}
