Yes and I know this is pushing what is known well off the edge of fantasy, but its no\u00A0 more fantastic than some of the crap that has been presented here lately.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasic idea is that every quantum of energy in the universe is entangled with other quanta of energy and the graviton is the force mediating particle our device then mediates that force, it basically tells the particles they can only exchange force with other particles on the other plate (sometimes).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAccording to what I have read (ignoring what I have said because I believe we know absolutely nothing about gravitons) that at the quantum level gravity is spontaneously communicated via spontaneous quantum wormholes (comparable to quantum entanglement of photons and electrons). This means that the communication events are all but random, but over scale they appear uniform (law of mass action applied to physics)\u00A0 they are close to quantum scale episodic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the idea of the device is that we can control the when and the with whom. Obvlously we cannot, as this violates uncertainty principle, but even with uncertainty you can manipulate, for example I can broaden a reflect incident beam to get a more uniform wavelength of light. Or I can allow the frequency to broaden and get a slight more focused beam of light. So the assumption of the device is that we cannot control all the gravitons, but we can steer the gravitons toward interacting with certain other particles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo how might our fantasy device do this. Suppose you could create matter, now suppose we can create matter antimater pairs, we create matter proton and anti-proton, and also electron and positron. For each event we feed the anti-electron to anti-proton and vice versa. These hydrogen and anti-hydrogen are used in a fusion reacton, a reactor and anti-reactor to build lithium, which is used finally to build iron and anti-iron. So now all the original products are paired and have a single common origin. The iron in both plates is heavily magnetized so that the plates are held within a magnetic device that is completely evacuated.\u00A0 So the assumption here is that the gravitons are tuned to the original source of energy, so when pairs are created they share and interesting graviton force, and what we are doing in keeping their memory of that common origin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the bugs in this system, if such an interesting attraction can be created, then we have the ability to control that interaction, if the interaction exists between the plates then it always exists, which means that if it can pull the two devices together at 30 m/s2 then we have to repel that force all the time while omega^2 r is less than 30 m/s^2. When your in solar orbit thats a hell of alot of dV. But what you could do is to keep the plates at say 100 meters and begin spinning them until they are have a centripetal accelaration of 3g, then add energy to their rotational velocities (such as using a wire) until they are very far apart still pulling 3g * mass, this position would be normal relative to earths orbit about the sun and the orbits would be changed so they are pushed anti-normal into a orbit within mercuries orbit, as energy is added the plates separate, the force declines and more energy can be added.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second bug in the system, the energy of the big bang may be partial, energy may have come from alternative sources such as dark energy and each photon that is created to create a pair, the unitized gravaton may represent very tiny fractional energies, so that each gravitationally entangled pair is a complex arrangment of gravitons with have attractions with energy elsewhere in this case the specific pair in the plate/antiplates may be very tiny.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe third bug that comes out of the first, when the interstellar ships are released there is no way to stop the plates from spiralling into each other, since the mass they were holding together is now gone, the plates will immediately pull to a fraction of the final radius, in doing so they will accelerate close to the speed of light, any attempt to slow them down would result in gravitational collapse. This shows a problem because gravitons acting in this way would violate conservation of energy. Because their force stays constant no matter how far you pull them apart or push them together. When I stretch the plates apart and the cohesion is still 3g I am basically stealing energy from the vacuum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222459669\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022134320\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221458137541\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022133850\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022wumpus\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, wumpus said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nast I heard (20-30 years ago), somebody did harness \u0022big bang radiation - cosmic background radiation - universal 3K energy\u0022, but could only move the nanotech in one direction, not both. \u00A0Figuring out how to make a repeatable engine sounds like a massive break in conventional physics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other catch is that the energy involved is immensely small. \u00A0It would take vast collectors (in volume) to harness such things, solar cells or even\u00A0sails would beat it by vast orders of magnitude (for going to Mars). \u00A0Expected uses are nanotech (just to make [re]powering the silly things vastly more convenient) or huge structures that travel between the stars (that otherwise wouldn\u0027t be powered by more reasonable things like solar or nuclear energy).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s not the big bang, that\u0027s the big cool, that is the energy of deionization and ionization energy comes from pair production.

There is energy in hv from the sun, but the problem is to get to 0.1c in means that the power conversion rate of a kg of solar panel has to be great or the riders are willing to wait a very very long time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n0.1c\u00A0 = 3E7 m/s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKE = 3E14 joules/kg mass (we actually need several times this because ejection energy is going to be magnitudes more than this), so lets say it takes a year or 3.2E7 seconds. So then each kg of solar panel needs to make 3E7 = 30000 kw. So at Mercuries orbit its about 10 times as much sun as the surface of the earth or 13kw per meter, so that a kilogram of solar panel needs to spread over 2307 meters. So for example the solar panels that I made for demo here were 10x100 meters, each of those would way about 0.4 kg AND resist 3 g of force AND stay facing the sun. At the current idealized efficiency and disregarding g-forces on the panels it would take 2307 years to accelerate assuming we could maintain mercurial insolance. The reality of course is that to use reaction mass to reach 0.1c one needs a tremdous ejection mass energy relative to ship energy, 100:1 so it would take 230,000 and solar efficiencies are not ideal, and you have structural and electrical mass so a million years.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-17T19:14:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst things first: clearing up misunderstandings: \u0022centripetal force\u0022 means \u0022whatever force is pulling the object toward the middle so it goes in a circle\u0022 - in this case, gravity.

The key to this may be the fact that planks energy is in the 1000s of MW (1E28 or something electron volts range) whereas the smallest quanta of energy are in the low frequency hv range. This is what I think that recent paper is getting at, \u003Cstrong\u003Egravity maybe the response to cosmic dispersion\u003C/strong\u003E. We look at the dispersion as being matter, but in reality matter is a latecomer, it is in reality a dispersion of energy, and maybe the plank units of Energy really matter, some other dynamic of the universe forced an undesired dispersion of energy putting it at a natural disequibrium from its lowest state. This is not to say massively clumped energy is preferential, but in maybe multifaceted, meaning you could have two low energy states, on that is dispersed and heterogenous with regard to its origin, and another that is dispersed and homogenous, and the homogenous one would have a lower potential energy and higher intrinsic energy. Quantum gravity could be a reflexive response to dispersion of one natural energy state, that is starting state in which density is in the Plank energy density range. This disruption happened early on and became dispersed and randomized, like rain drops coming from different clouds in the midst of a hurricane. They still communicate, so my feeble energy to matter was a \u0027just so\u0027 method of reassociating energy and spliting it again. If it was true that gravity is the result of untied energy then you could have a gravitational sensor that looks for energies with a shared origin and move them to a certain location. It is possible that the energy states reform in potentials (which warping of space time creates) so one method might be to collect energy from potentials and use it to create matter. So step one would be to find the grand potential, step two would be create precisely that potential, step three would be to collect all the energy from the potential, step four would be create matter from that energy and step 5 would be separate the matter and antimatter created, and repeat process. After the matter was created it would require the input of more energy (not necessarily paired) to make plates - although it does not have to be plates it could be anti-protons in a plasma containment field. If you create anticarbon you could create diamond lattice out of it (although it does degrade at is surface to carbon gas). So the endform is not that important, what is important is that two objects have the same \u0027cosmic energetic origin\u0027. IOW you tie energy up and then you very carefully untie such that now it wants to communicate gravitons specifically with its reciprocal on the otherside of the sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven so once you create such a device, there is no way to turn on and off the attractions once created, they would be always on, but one could use relatively to speed up or slow down time for the particles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe energy of this group however is queer (in the classic not colloquial sense) thoughts, it goes a while and then it becomes wanted of such thoughts, so I throw in a few very queer thoughts, and it quells the latent energy for a time.

I am basically defending the idea just like any one of our sprites might, otherwise the pose has no value.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe same has been done here with: Albucierre drive, Worm hole drive, H-bomb drive,\u00A0 . . . . . . .\u00A0 .\u003Cem\u003Ewhat if we did this posts\u003C/em\u003E. This comes as a reflex to the problem that there are massive translational energy differentials between us and \u003Cem\u003Eeverywhere we would like to go\u003C/em\u003E as well as massive distances to cross. Standard modalities do not serve the purpose of single generation space travel, therefore we have a tendency to propose far fetched schemes to solve the problem and then go through a rationalization scheme to try to prove that the schemes are not as bad as they really are.\u00A0 (i.e. really bad ideas is always a followup process to bad ideas)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[\u003Cem\u003EBack to sprite mode\u003C/em\u003E]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut anyway, there is no specific problem with using quantum gravity as an explanation. The basic problem here is this particular theory is based on \u003Cem\u003Estring theory\u003C/em\u003E, which so far has no testable hypothesis. Quantum entanglement of gravitons may exist even if string theory does not, but that\u0027s another caveot.

Manipulating space-time on a broad scale has an absolute requirement of energy- massive amounts. It would be sort of like plotting a Hohmann transfer or massive amounts of acceleration and deceleration;\u00A0 if quantum entanglement of gravitons exist then entangling them and separating them will afford you much more efficient means of manipulating spacetime than trying to achieve the same result without information about the states of particles (brute force applications of energy).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe key point here is that by linking entangled array with non-entangled array we can use energy from the sun to accelerate the craft to a desired quasi-orbital velocity and then release. The energy is conserved in the manipulation since the payload is released, leaving the entangled array free to \u0027cool\u0027 down to normal orbital statistics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[out of spirte mode]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problems I have stated above:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n0. Two wormholes collapsing should create a gravitational wave instantly and should not coincide with a visible event, this may contradict the current observation.\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. Creation of entangled masses requires anti-matter stabiliization or the sorted of extremely rare energy-pairs (in the form of particles)\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. It also requires an efficient creation of anti-matter from potential energy that we do not currently have.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. There is no way to manipulate I (intensity) after it is generated. Although you could take tiny pieces of the matrix and move them to opposed positions in a circumsolar orbit, once you are there you have to maintain a radial thrust to keep them from falling into each other. The only way to prevent this from happening without thrust is to move the pieces in while moving, this would require a wormhole (as in the fictional type) to both ships to transport.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4th is a caveot.
