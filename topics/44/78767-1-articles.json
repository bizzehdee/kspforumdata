(I\u0027ve said that 3 times, you know that. Why am I saying that so many times? Oh, yeah, I\u0027m terrible at introductions)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E There is a \u0022flight\u0022 portion of the game, but it is almost entirely automated (exceptions include docking, unless you put an automated docking autopilot on, and landing a manned lander, unless there is an autopilot. Oh, and EVA.) You can choose where the spacecraft goes and it\u0027s orbital trajectory. (You either just put \u0022final destination: 200 Km circular Mars orbit, 0 degree inclination\u0022, or you can make the trajectories your self). More clearly, you essentially make spacecraft in the clean room/spacecraft factory/place where you design and build spacecraft (Let\u0027s just call it the Clean Room, okay?), it\u0027s much more complex then the KSP VAB (By complicated I don\u0027t mean you need to know insane calculations and stuff, I mean you can design individual components of the spacecraft, and there would be a bunch of stuff to guide and help you make stuff (Which you can turn off, if you\u0027re feeling hardcore and even MORE realistic). Also, there would be a bunch of pre-made examples and stuff in the game (Like sub-assemblies), and even some whole craft and rockets. Oh, and you can also even design the rockets and launch vehicles. I think I\u0027ve covered the basics pretty good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EClean Room:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EWell, obviously you design\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E and build your spacecraft, there would also be a separate building called the VAB where you build your launch vehicles. But let\u0027s focus on the Clean Room, in the middle there is the spacecraft you\u0027re building in it\u0027s current state, you can select certain components/parts of the spacecraft you would like to view on a bar on the bottom, which would also have an \u0022All\u0022 button which which makes all components appear. When you click on the name of a certain component, it shows info, details, and statistics about it on a panel on the right, the \u0022Component Viewer\u0022. The Component Viewer would show the component type (Ie: Radio Antenna), the component\u0027s name (Ie: RA-3), It\u0027s mass, it\u0027s electrical drain (If it uses electricity, of course), It\u0027s expected lifetime, the other components that it\u0027s wired to, and some stats/info/details that are specific to that component type. (Ie: Data bandwidth: 1 byte per second. Radio range: 2,500 Km. Radio Type: UHF). There would also be an \u0022Edit Component\u0022 button, which would go to the Component Editor, where you can edit your components. On the left there would be another panel, the Component Placer (Gotta think of a better name for that one), This is a lot like the Panel on the left In KSP, it has the list of available components that you can put on your spacecraft. You can right click a component and it will show you it\u0027s stats on the Component Viewer. (Except for it\u0027s name and the components it\u0027s wired to). You can then click on the component and it a popup in the middle of the screen (The Spacecraft Viewer) will ask you if you want to put the component on the outside of the spacecraft (Not concealed by anything), or the inside the spacecraft (Concealed by the shell/chassis of the spacecraft). If you choose outside, you can, like and KSP, move a \u0022Ghost\u0022 version of the component, put your mouse cursor over where you want to put it on the spacecraft, and it will appear where your cursor is on the Spacecraft. And then you can click, and it is now attached onto the spacecraft. The inside is the same, except it is cutaway, and when you put you\u0027re mouse cursor on an area, you can press a button to add small \u0022Stools\u0022 on the bottom of the component, which will raise it, so you\u0027re using the inside more efficiently! Also, in the component editor, you can make \u0022Mega Components\u0022, essentially they\u0027re treated as sub-assemblies, and you can get a component, add some stuff and some other components. You can create some stuff like the long truss which sticks out on the Voyager spacecraft, by making a truss component, and then adding some RTG\u0027s at the top. Oh, for the components to actually work together, you have to wire them to each other, so for example a Radio Transmitter could be wired to a Radio Antenna and it would broadcast whatever the Radio Transmitter is making.

I see the problem. The only problem like this i thought of was engine physics. In KSP, the thurst is just a variable in a .cfg. And the fire that comes out is just an effect, same for the sound. Though, for example FAR has MUCH more detailed physics then in the regular game. Though, that improves the aerodynamic properties of the game, and does nothing to the engines. Spacecraft would have that and engine physics calculations. That means stuff like how the fuel flows into the combustion chamber, how it ignites when the igniter is started, how much pressure it creates in the combustion chamber, and how much thrust all those calculations combined would create. This would allow for actual failures, like engine fires, gimbal failures, combustion chamber breaches and explosions, fuel line blockage and leaks, etc. But as you said, it would be very computer intensive, I mean just imagine your computer trying to calculate 26 engines, with all there physics and such. It would be Lagtopia. Though well, FAR does do something which I THINK is equally computer intensive, and I don\u0027t get any unbearable lag.

I think that is simple, though I don\u0027t know if there should be different kinds of wire and if they should be editable/makeable in the Component Maker/Editor. I think it should be complex, like up to making a solar panel in the Component Maker/Editor by being able to change it\u0027s dimensions (How long and how wide it is), what type of material/type of solar panel it is made of, and maybe how thick it is. (Depends on the technology level you have, I\u0027ll get to tech levels, campaigns, and challenges later). Oh, if you want it to be deployable, you have to make a robotic arm/deployment system as a different thing in the Component Editor.

The reason I made this thread was because I just thought other people might be interested in my idea. And I won\u0027t be expecting anyone to actually go into Unity and make something, but IF someone does, FANTASTIC!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, I see that it will be simply impossible to make an engine simulation that complex. Do you have any ideas to make it simpler but not so dumbed down like KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T08:19:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nicholander\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nicholander\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDo you have any ideas to make it simpler but not so dumbed down like KSP?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepends what your objective is. Games can be educational, but they also have to be fun and engaging and offer the player some kind of reward in exchange for the risk of failure. So you want to simulate rocket engines more closely, ok, but to what end? Simply running a good simulation isn\u0027t inherently fun, if it was people would play with engineering simulation tools instead of games. Games are always a trade off between simulation and playability. There\u0027s nothing wrong with a game being more towards one end of that spectrum than the other, but you need to be aware that increasing simulation often decreases \u0022fun\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need to have a think about what are the main points about rocket engines that make a difference.

Once you\u0027ve decided how much of that stuff your game needs you can look at how to implement it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou also need to think about the fact that a good editor does not a good game make. Spore is a good example. The editors in that were amazing, but once you left the editor and played the game it was, well, underwhelming. Simply having a \u0022better\u0022 VAB mini-game than KSP wouldn\u0027t make a better game overall.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nicholander","CreatedById":108347,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T09:05:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1.
