We have experimental confirmation of that. Unfortunately, we don\u0027t have any experiment that definitely shows that they are slower.

And that would, indeed, require them to move slightly slower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for why they arrive sooner, I always thought that was pretty clear. The spike in fusion certainly starts in the core of the star. Neutrinos escape the core without any hindrance, but all other radiation is re-absorbed into the star. Energy takes quite a while to propagate outwards, even as it builds up to the supernova scale. By the time the outer shells can be blown off by the supernova explosion, fusion has been going on for quite a while at an extreme rate producing the neutrinos that can be detected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIsn\u0027t it nice that we have means of detecting something like that a bit in advance, though?

Basically, the visible explosion is the very \u003Cem\u003Elast\u003C/em\u003E thing to happen during a core collapse supernova (the explosion is candidate for being the loudest known sound in the Universe), and carries only about 1% of the total energy of the event. We see the neutrinos first because the neutrinos are created in the core and propogate away mostly unimpeded by the matter in the star. The visible portion of the explosion occurs after the shockwave has blown the star apart, and comes from the thermal spectrum of the shock-heated gases as they expand post-explosion. Basically, the neutrino pulse is the actual signal from the explosion, and the visible supernova is the thermal afterglow from the expanding fireball (which reaches maximum brightness well after the explosion due to the relationship between brightness as a functions of temperature and surface area).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-21T23:20:12Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2013 11:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Stochasty\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-22T06:24:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys for the answers.

Light hydrogen\u0027s fusion is just extremely improbable and slow process. That reaction has never detected in laboratories. However, reverse fusions happen in core collapse supernova and may have some effect in that process. Energy for fissions comes from gravitational potential energy on star core. It breaks in seconds everything than star has fusioned in millions of years and finally smashes protons, neutrons, electrons, nuclei etc. to superdense neutron mass and releases extreme burst of neutrinos.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RIDGExRUNNER","CreatedById":169467,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-27T19:02:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t\u00A0terrestrial bursts prove that gamma rays travel faster than light?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Steel","CreatedById":49317,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-27T19:06:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222776772\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002243405\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221475002965\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022169467\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RIDGExRUNNER\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 minutes ago, RIDGExRUNNER said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t\u00A0terrestrial bursts prove that gamma rays travel faster than light?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
