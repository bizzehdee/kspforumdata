Microgravity is related to the pseudoforces arising from separation of two objects on various orbits. For example, if you put two steel cubes together, one closer to the Earth than the other, after one orbit they will be separated. If you were to attach a very sensitive dynamometer on them, there would be a really tiny force registered.
