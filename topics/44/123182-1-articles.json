Damage is pretty instant in this game unless 1.0.5 is making a much bigger change than described. We\u0027ll see I guess.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn KSP the only place seperators are dangerous is then the part is already overheating, the 1x2 engine adn tank combination tend to run very hot and is in danger for this, LV-N after long burns too however this will only happen i deep space so you can power down an rotate the ship to drop tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid not know about the changes in separation behavior. Tend to use two angled anyway. We should have some smaller ant like cold gas seperatrons to, the current ones are overkill for most uses, you only need the full power for huge designs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that this can be used to our benefit. Put seperatror on core stage, use it to blow up the booster to avoid any seperation problems \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-17T19:56:26Z\u0022 title=\u002210/17/2015 07:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by magnemoe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-17T21:10:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shrike99\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Shrike99\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJust like to add that SpaceX uses Pneumatic separation, rather than Pyrotechnics.\u003Cp\u003EThis is a different, interesting approach, that is focused on re-usability, but more complicated and heavy iirc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it has never failed them yet (as far as i know), and they have launched quite a number of rockets, so that looks somehow safe...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Corw","CreatedById":7116,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-17T21:53:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou haven\u0027t kept up with the devnotes. In 1.0.5 they are going to be more damaging if the plume impacts an object and according to NathanKell you have to \u0022aim them carefully\u0022. Not only is that unrealistic as evidenced by the video but it isn\u0027t something not easy to do in the editor. Simply using sepatrons to separate boosters mounted on a TT-38K will have the plume impacting the main tank, if that plume is going to now destroy the tank, sepatrons will be severely limited in use. Because damage in the game is instant, unless that has changed too, the moment the plume touches, it will be destroyed.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was talking about seps in current version.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
