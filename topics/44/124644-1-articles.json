The old data sharing has changed many times, for example OLE, gone, its replacement, gone, etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWPF - ([URL]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation[/URL]) originally targeted for XML, XAML is employed to simplify the conversion. 2006, Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0, \u003Cbr\u003E\n- Uses generic design, skins can basically replaced most elements of the gui\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Forms, video, graphics, fixed format text, .. . . . \u003Cbr\u003E\n-Problem is Windows 8 introduced WinRT, which has been haldheartedly accepted, this is followed by win10 with a push toward WUP, and WPF is platform specific for the most part. \u003Cbr\u003E\n-Microsoft Expression Interactive Designer, provides a front-end design tool for backend programming via XAML.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Because of its generic design some features of windows tool box are missing, you have to essentially reprogram the tool to reimpliment the feature (example the multicolumns feature of a list box is missing). Microsoft however has built a database of WPF \u0026#39;objects\u0026#39; that can be used, if you can find them in the mess that is now called MSDN. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWinRt (Windows Runtime) hit the scene with the genuinely unpopular Windows 8.
