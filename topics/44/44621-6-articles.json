But im afraid the program doesn\u0027t even get to that point. The program does not shut down, but stops functioning after the first surfacespeed line. ( with the exeption of the \u0022lock steering to prograde\u0022 line which works ) The reason I use this is because that is was the navball indicates until about 40km where it changes to orbital velocity. Would you recommend a better value? Ive tried just velocity, but nothing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I said everything just stops functioning. The engines just burn to the tank is out of fuel. Where its supposed to stage once under 5 units of fuel. If it even would get to that part... I need the gravity turn to function first. I don\u0027t just hold at 45 degrees until the target apoapsis I pitch over as the speed increases. THEN shutdown engines at target apo.

Unless I go really extreme on the bad moves, I can\u0027t do it. When I finally did build one that it couldn\u0027t fly, there was no way I could do it manually. I think there are some epic button mashers out there that have no idea how bad the rocket design is because of their epic button mashing. I applaud those epic button mashing skills. I don\u0027t have them. That is why I got Mechjeb and then kOS when it was available. I really am wanting to just throw Mechjeb away now, but I need it for it\u0027s information.

I have tried all of those and it works. I bet there is some configuration I haven\u0027t thought about yet though. That is what we need to do. Weed out the failure modes.

Can i have a launch program take it up to that orbit then send a program to each core when its turn in the rotation comes up to release from the main rocket and circularize thus allowing a single rocket with the primary program sending a signal to the other probes onboard when its turns up to decouple free and go.
