Sorry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeeping everything between Windows installs is an exercise in futility, unfortunately. Things just go to too many places, and there\u0027s no guarantee that any given application actually uses a standard location at all. Nothing\u0027s stopping anyone from dumping critical settings into some goofy location that nobody but them uses, bypassing any clever backup software that you might have. I\u0027ve never seen anyone restore applications from a backup without a significant fraction of them breaking, the exception being a full disk backup (which would also restore the version of Windows, so no good for you).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour best option is going to be to manually back up individual folders, then manually copy them back after installation.

To cope, I do a lot of data segregation, backups and syncs. All installers and ISOs I use are archived on my large data drive, keeping only the most recent one around. I also keep a high speed thumb drive ready with the version of Windows I\u0027m currently using. Any time I need to, I can nuke the drive, reinstall Windows, reinstall my applications/drivers and restore my settings in about an hour. And if I lose my backup drive, it\u0027s only 3-4 hours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EForget half day RAID recoveries, just stop caring about the durability of your data.
