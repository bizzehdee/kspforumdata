TLDR: first half was epic, second half was ........, so clumsy I couldn\u0027t but laugh at moments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the story in the first half was very humane, compelling and touching, even made some guys drop a tear. I was positively shocked and almost had tears when the guy was leaving for the space center to fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe exploration part was at Jebediah level with quite stock physics. Land first, then learn about the waves, waves of early alpha release. But let\u0027s admit it wasn\u0027t a big deal. The suspense when they rushed back to the ship was very well done. All the story up to that point was excellent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight after that CGE started to be mixed with sugary vely slow paced melodrama. What made it look clumsy was the very slow pace and big leaps in time in between. They were quite disconnected, and looked like history chronicals, you couldn\u0027t build enough compassion for all the things and people there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was in a small city cinema, mostly with lower middle class people, who don\u0027t care of astrophysics.

(Though I suspect escape velocity from that planet was still near light speed.) But, I simply cannot imagine that the extreme Doppler shift of the transmissions from the water planet (or a little logic) wouldn\u0027t have clued them in, ahead of time, to the possible fate of that expedition. Weren\u0027t those transmissions time-stamped at origin? I thought of it instantly when Romilly told them about the extreme time dilation: \u0022That expedition would have just landed, subjectively.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the scene inside the black hole was ridiculous. I gather that the solution to Einstein\u0027s field equations for a rotating black hole include trajectories inside the event horizon that are closed time-like loops, so some sort of time travel is possible, but the kind the movie showed is indistinguishable from religious woo. Why wouldn\u0027t any civilization with sufficiently magical technology to effect Coop\u0027s \u0022behind the bookcase\u0022 sojourn just send the message directly back to Murph, rather than rely on her time-locked father and his magical watch as an intermediary? And I can just imagine how setting that whole apparatus up would play out. Some far-future post-graduate student gets a note from their PI: \u0022Hey, it\u0027s long past the time we set up that little time loop that let us jump start our gravity-harnessing technological civilization. Why don\u0027t you head out to the ancestral Gargantua binary and get that done? I don\u0027t know why we have to do this indirectly, with all that silly nonsense regarding Dr. Cooper and her father, but that\u0027s the way it happened historically and we don\u0027t want to violate causality, so make it so.\u0022 The whole thing is just too pat. Signs was another movie with a single father living in a cornfield confronting questions of destiny. I\u0027ve always loathed Signs because I thought that it provided trite, nauseating, quasi-religious answers to difficult questions about suffering and tragedy. I don\u0027t think that the woo in Interstellar is all that different except that it waves its hands in the direction of science: a daughter getting a message from her father through some 5-dimensional mumbo-jumbo using magical future technology (we can bend space-time to our will but must communicate with the past using Morse code), rather than a father getting a message from a deity through his wife\u0027s fatal head injury. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did really like the scenes on the future dystopian Earth (and especially every scene with John Lithgow or Jessica Chastain.) And I liked the space travel sequences, though I wish the black hole had been revealed with a bit more awe, and the characteristics of the binary system more fully fleshed out. I wish we\u0027d learned something about the other 9 planets. I thought the scenes on the planets were kind of lame, and the fistfight with Matt Damon was just ugh. (Matt Damon being in the movie was dumb. He simply doesn\u0027t have enough charisma to be believable as a scientist who could\u0027ve convinced people to undertake the project they did.) I thought the O\u0027Neill cylinder was really cool and I wish we could\u0027ve seen more of that project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterstellar would have worked wonderfully if Coop and team gone down to Miller\u0027s world, been able to gather the necessary black hole data from there (inside the black hole\u0027s ergosphere), but realized they were trapped on the planet by its enormous escape velocity. The data (doled out over years by Doppler stretching) enables the solution of the gravity equations by grown-up Murph, which enables the further exploration of the other 11 worlds and the eventually colonization of one or more of them, barely in time as the Earth becomes uninhabitable. And then for the film\u0027s coda, you could show 1000 years later, an expedition reaching Coop and Brand and the rest on Miller\u0027s world (only a week would have passed for them) where he learns what his daughter accomplished.
