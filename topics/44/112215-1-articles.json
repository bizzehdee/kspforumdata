The planet is called Tenorra, and while the star system it resides in has no effect on the gameplay, I would like to make it believable. The planet itself is 1.2 Earth Radii, but less dense, and thus has close to 1G of surface gravity, and is currently under siege by an armada of alien murder-bots from outer space programmed to seek out and destroy technological civilizations. Gone slightly awry. There are 2 major superpowers on Tenorra - the Tenorran Defense Union and the Coalition of Populist Socialist Nations, both are still recovering from a short-lasted dark age after the troublesome settlement of the planet, but are already I guess 40-50 years more advanced than us, much more than that in some areas.\n\nThe star system consists of two Stars - an Orange K2V class main sequence star somewhat heavier than the Sun orbited by 3 asteroid belts and 14 planets, and an M8 class Brown Dwarf companion orbiting at about 120 AU from the main star, orbited by 5 planets/moons.\n\nThe K2V star has an inner asteroid belt, then 2 small rocky planets - Roasted and Toasted, that are well \u0022inside\u0022 of the Habitable Zone, and are exactly as their names imply, roasted and toasted.\n\nFollowed by a \u0022gas dwarf\u0022 - a gas planet about 8-9 times the size of Earth, made mostly of Hydrogen, Helium and Methane. It orbits well inside of the habitable zone. It\u0027s used by the Tenorrans as a source of Anti-protons via orbiting magnetic traps. No exceptional moons.\n\nThen comes Tenorra as 4th planet. Tenorra is as described above, has 9 continents that are all much smaller than Earth\u0027s, also it has a Moon about as big as Mars with a relatively thick Argon atmosphere, which is was used as a fuel source prior to the invasion.\n\nIt also has 3 moons - Thor, Ares and Prometheus, all of them about as big as Charon, except Ares, which is half as big. There are laser cannons built onto the surface of each of them, in addition to smaller laser satellites orbiting Tenorra itself.\n\nThen comes another asteroid belt.\n\nThe 5th planet is an Ammonia planet, with Ammonia based animal-plant hybrid life on it.\n\nThe next 9 planets I haven\u0027t really worked on yet. There are 3 Gas Giants, 4 Ice Giants and 2 rocky planets.\n\nThe M8 Dwarf has a small rocky companion not bigger than Pluto, but with an unusually strong mangetic field and a tenuous hydrogen atmosphere \u0022siphoned\u0022 off from the star\u0027s outer atmosphere.\n\nThe next one is a semi-habitable planet about as big as Earth, tidally locked to the Dwarf that formed at the inner edge of the habitable zone, which has since moved inwards, with primitive microbial life on it, as well as a space station and some surface outposts established recently. These were the first things to be destroyed by the ICES armada - Interstellar Civilization Eradication System is what they were called by their creators, obviously in their language. And yes, that is an ISIS pun.\n\nThe other 3 companions of the dwarf are fairly boring rocks with equally boring rocks orbiting them.\n\n-\n\nSo the question is: How physically viable - not probable - is this system? I don\u0027t know enough about planetary formation and orbital mechanics to figure that out on my own.\n\nI know that this system is unlikely to form in the first place, but that\u0027s not what I\u0027m asking.\n\nEdit: Graphical representation: [http://i.imgur.com/7eKpWCD.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/7eKpWCD.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-07T00:54:39Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2015 12:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SargeRho**"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T23:44:04Z","Content":"K2V star is orange, Mars-sized moons of Earth-sized planets don\u0027t make sense, everything else makes sense."},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T23:48:13Z","Content":"I thought Alpha Centauri B was a blue K2V?"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T23:50:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I thought Alpha Centauri B was a blue K2V?\n\n Lol it\u0027s orange."},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T23:52:42Z","Content":"Ok, clear case of \u0022Didn\u0027t do enough research\u0022.

Venus has lost the equivalent to about 1 Earth atmosphere over its lifetime, but it just happens to have about another 94 Earth atmospheres to compensate. If your hypothetical planet has a large supply of hydrogen then it could last for millions or even billions of years, especially if it used to be significantly larger. (There is a hypothetical class of planets called \u0022chthonian planets\u0022 where all of the atmosphere of a gas giant has been stripped away, so logically there must be an intermediate stage).\n\nThis is sort of where my knowledge breaks down though - I was just going by the physics that dictates how quickly small molecules travel."},{"CreatedByName":"Aanker","CreatedById":70274,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T02:43:25Z","Content":"Venus also doesn\u0027t have the same degree of magnetic shielding that Earth has, maybe as a result of its very slow rotation."},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T03:35:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E K2V star is orange, Mars-sized moons of Earth-sized planets don\u0027t make sense, everything else makes sense.\n\nI agree, if a mars sized planet orbited the earth the tides in many areas would be 30 meters high. If you moved it further away it would be plucked from its orbit by the gas giant. Even tideless areas you would expect the daily tides to be a couple of meters. Not much sea faring going on in those cultures. The claim is that the moon is the remnant of an ancient collision where crustal material coalesced into the moon and a much closer orbit than present (presumably with much greater tides). But a Mars size planet would not be so easily accelerated into higher orbit, it would remain relatively close to earth and the tides would pretty much erode the continents into shallow seas. \n\nIt can exist, its just not so favorable to sentient life forms. \n\nVenus\u0027s atmosphere is not equivocal to Earths atmosphere, most of what comprises Venus\u0027s atmosphere is what we find in our oceans (oxides of carbon, sulfur the like are dissolved in water).

A planet bigger, but less dense than Earth implies it has a smaller core, which could mean issues with the magnetic field. Humans should be able to live comfortably in 1.2 gs, but it could make spaceflight challenging.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The star system consists of two Stars - an Orange K2V class main sequence star somewhat heavier than the Sun orbited by 3 asteroid belts and 14 planets, and an M8 class Brown Dwarf companion orbiting at about 120 AU from the main star, orbited by 5 planets/moons.\n\nK-class main sequence stars heavier than the sun do exist, but they\u0027re pretty rare. And IIRC they will usually have low metallicity (high-metallicity stars are hotter for the same mass), which is bad news for forming lots of rocky planets. You may want to make your central star a bit smaller; look at the masses of real K2V stars.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The K2V star has an inner asteroid belt, then 2 small rocky planets - Roasted and Toasted, that are well \u0022inside\u0022 of the Habitable Zone, and are exactly as their names imply, roasted and toasted.\n\nThe inner asteroid belt may be a problem. In our solar system, we have found ZERO asteroids that are entirely inside the orbit of Mercury. You may want to do a bit more research on this. The small rocky planets are fine.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Followed by a \u0022gas dwarf\u0022 - a gas planet about 8-9 times the size of Earth, made mostly of Hydrogen, Helium and Methane. It orbits well inside of the habitable zone. It\u0027s used by the Tenorrans as a source of Anti-protons via orbiting magnetic traps. No exceptional moons.\n\nIgnore what others have told you, a \u0022gas dwarf\u0022 is completely plausible. Kepler-11 has three of them orbiting well inside the HZ, and it\u0027s 8.5 Gy old, so the planets didn\u0027t migrate there recently. However, replace \u0022no exceptional moons\u0022 with \u0022no moons at all.\u0022 Planets far inside the HZ of a K-class star will be tidally locked, and this goes double for low-density planets like gas dwarfs which develop larger tidal bulges. Moons of tidally locked planets are unstable: because they orbit faster than their parent rotates, tidal interactions will cause them to spiral inward (instead of outward like our moon is doing) and eventually impact the planet. In our solar system, we can see this happening to Phobos, Deimos, and Triton, which will eventually impact Mars and Neptune respectively.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Then comes Tenorra as 4th planet. Tenorra is as described above, has 9 continents that are all much smaller than Earth\u0027s, also it has a Moon about as big as Mars with a relatively thick Argon atmosphere, which is was used as a fuel source prior to the invasion.\n\nMoon as big as Mars? That should be possible ON ITS OWN. Naturally it will be tidelocked to Tenorra, and should thus orbit pretty close in if you want a reasonable day length.\n\nThick Argon atmosphere? Hell no. Not happening. Argon isn\u0027t a common element, it\u0027s mostly produced by radioactive decay. Earth and Venus only have a few millibars, Mars has about 0.1 millibars. Not to mention I\u0027m not sure what you\u0027d be fuelling with Argon, besides a VASIMR.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It also has 3 moons - Thor, Ares and Prometheus, all of them about as big as Charon, except Ares, which is half as big. There are laser cannons built onto the surface of each of them, in addition to smaller laser satellites orbiting Tenorra itself.\n\nDo an N-body on this, considering the size of Tennora\u0027s hill sphere. Those three moons on their own are, compared to Tennora, in the size range of the Galilean moons relative to Jupiter (a bit bigger), so on their own they could be stable, but the big moon will have a huge effect on the system, and may destabilize the smaller ones.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Then comes another asteroid belt.\n\u003E The 5th planet is an Ammonia planet, with Ammonia based animal-plant hybrid life on it.\n\nThis seems reasonable. However, looking at the graphics you should move the ammonia planet farther out: it needs to be at 200-240 K average surface temperature, and ammonia planets are likely to have a strong greenhouse effect due to atmospheric methane.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The next 9 planets I haven\u0027t really worked on yet. There are 3 Gas Giants, 4 Ice Giants and 2 rocky planets.\n\n That\u0027s a lot of planets to fit within 10-20% of the M8 dwarf\u0027s periastron distance. You may want to move the companion out to 1200 AU.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The M8 Dwarf has a small rocky companion not bigger than Pluto, but with an unusually strong mangetic field and a tenuous hydrogen atmosphere \u0022siphoned\u0022 off from the star\u0027s outer atmosphere.\n\nNope. A magnetic field won\u0027t do anything: a hot, pluto-sized object simply does not have the gravity to hold on to hydrogen.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The next one is a semi-habitable planet about as big as Earth, tidally locked to the Dwarf that formed at the inner edge of the habitable zone, which has since moved inwards, with primitive microbial life on it, as well as a space station and some surface outposts established recently. These were the first things to be destroyed by the ICES armada - Interstellar Civilization Eradication System is what they were called by their creators, obviously in their language. And yes, that is an ISIS pun.\n\nDefine \u0022semi-habitable.\u0022 However, M8V is on the border between a star and a high-mass brown dwarf. It would barely even have a habitable zone worth mentioning. Here\u0027s an example of an M6V: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler-42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler-42). Note in the graphic the HZ is probably about 1.5-2x as far from the star as Callisto is from Jupiter.\n\nI would go with an M3V to M5V if you want a habitable planet."}]}
