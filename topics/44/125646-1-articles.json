On common linux system, an interface to authorize (or access) root without opening the root itself (and allowing all application to change the system) is by logging in as a superuser, which is also unavailable on Android. So, in order to gain root access, a superuser is required, amd the root access must be opened. The process to enable root access on Android is by \u0022rooting\u0022 the phone. Search it up, recommend going to xda-developers.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nRooting aside, I think DU things isn\u0026#39;t that useful... You\u0026#39;ll find better apps once rooted (like, greenify ? It\u0026#39;s really light, and is useful). Also then you can proceed to using custom ROM (well, custom Android (or android based) OS) which is mostly lighter and have more features. Had an S3 for like three years, rooting it few months after buying before being lazy maintaining the OS and some bad things happened...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nCounting that S3 is old by now, guess rooting it have more pros than cons (like, proper OS support, tweakings to make it better etc).\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T03:47:14Z","Content":"\nYou need an \u0026#39;su\u0026#39; binary (such as SuperSU) to get root user permissions and allow apps to do the same. - same as using \u0026#39;su\u0026#39; for system admin tasks on a *nix box.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0026#39;s that simple, but there are various methods to overcome the \u0022chicken \u0026 egg\u0022 puzzle -\u0026gt; you need to be root to install su, but you need su to become root... most of these require flashing su onto the rom via recovery mode or ADB.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSome manufacturers make it harder by locking the NAND... (S-on) but the S3 should be ok in this regard.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSearch for your model on xda-developers, someone has most likely upped a flashable su installer \u0026 instructions. \u003Cbr\u003E\nMost custom ROMs come with su, and are labelled as \u0026#39;pre-rooted\u0026#39;. I recommend something Cyanogenmod based. :)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBe aware of warranty issues, also some (mostly internet banking etc.) apps will refuse to run on a rooted device (though there are ways around this too).\u003Cbr\u003E\nMost importantly, pay very close attention to which apps you grant root permissions to... it\u0026#39;s exactly the same as the root account on a Unix/Linux/BSD etc. machine - i.e. full access to everything. Apps are usually sandboxed in the Android java VM, granting root allows tampering with the Linux OS underneath and direct modification of the filesystem.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you don\u0026#39;t understand the implications, or your only purpose in rooting is to get some random app to work, don\u0026#39;t.

It just means they are loaded in memory, not that they are using any resources. Android is a flavour of Linux, so it only frees memory when you need it. The way Linux sees things is that free memory is wasted memory. You might as well leave the apps there, because it is likely that you will need them later.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAndroid manages its memory by keeping the apps you use the most in memory and freeing the space when it\u0026#39;s needed. It\u0026#39;s better to let it do its thing. If you close apps manually or with a third party app killer, you will just prevent it from learning which apps need to be kept and which can be closed, so you will ultimately make things less efficient.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"obsidian_x","CreatedById":145147,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T15:03:33Z","Content":"\nYep, what Nibb31 said. Most battery \u0022savers\u0022 actually end up using more battery (don\u0026#39;t know specifically about DU). Basically if you kill a task that is required by another (eg Whatsapp might use a service to listen for new messages, you kill it), android will automatically restart that app/service etc. If you keep killing it, loading it to memory will require more power, than just \u0022leaving it alone\u0022. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTurning off wifi/4g and disabling gps will probably give you more battery life than those task killers (at the expense of not getting messages until you re-enable). Other built in features that slow the CPU and dim the screen will probably be better too. I use one called timerific but it\u0026#39;s not geared to enable wifi \u0026 4g for a few minutes every hour or something like that that though.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Latcarf","CreatedById":59786,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T23:53:06Z","Content":"\nI recommend rooting.
