I am creating this thread to spread some info and see if anyone knows about Methane Hydrates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo start things off, here are the facts about Methane Hydrates (from the scientific american): Methane hydrates are methane molecules (CH\u003Csub\u003E4\u003C/sub\u003E) that are trapped in an \u0022Ice-Crystal\u0022 Cage. They are found off almost every major shoreline at depths deeper than 3,000 feet. Methane Hydrates (as far as scientists can tell) are created when large underground methane bubbles begin seeping to the surface. When the methane comes in contact with water the water crystallizes around it. These create massive shelves at the ocean floor of methane hydrates. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow this is why they are important: Methane hydrates can release large amounts of energy when burned (like burning methane with oxygen). Also, when burned, they produce less CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E than coal, oil, or gas. Recent discoveries have revealed these methane hydrates are being warmed by the oceans, and if the oceans reach an unknown tipping point, they could be released into the atmosphere. As some of you may know, Methane is a very potent greenhouse gas. Attempts to catch the hydrates have been relatively unsuccessful, as they are very loosely connected to the ocean floor and entire sections of the deposits break away at the slightest touch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is why I am writing this: Research, although on going, does not get much funding from any governments. The only nation to secure samples of methane hydrates is Japan, as they are attempting to phase out their nuclear program. Also, according to scientific american, the methane hydrates off the coast of the mainland USA hold enough energy to power the country for 2,000 years (at our current energy usage). The implications of methane hydrates are massive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are you\u0027re thoughts/opinions?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-27T16:22:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA GREEN LIE!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOil, natural gas, methane hydrates.
