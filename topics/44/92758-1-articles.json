Synesthesia is a huge gray area for everybody, especially since many synesthetes are unaware of it, and that there are MANY variations of it. For those of you who don\u0027t know, synesthesia is the \u0022crossing of senses\u0022, where one sensory stimulation triggers another sense. For example, a sound-\u0026gt;color synesthete would see colors based on the sound they hear, and a lexical-\u0026gt;gustatory synesthete would taste things based on syllables they hear. There are many more types. I recently found I have sound-\u0026gt;shape synesthesia, and have been doing extensive research on the topic. During this, I found a subreddit where a couple of people were talking about how interaction with a computer mouse brought about some synesthesia-like responses. These synesthesia-like reactions were all usually based on the state of the cursor (hand holding up index finger, arrow pointer, text-hover icon, etc.), and induced some sort of a texture-feeling effect, for lack of better terms. The best way to describe it, since I experience this too, is that you \u0022feel\u0022 the link, or whatever it is you are interacting with, be that in your mind, or however else you experience it. I made this poll to get more data on if this is common or not, and ultimately, find out if this is indeed a form of synesthesia or a normal interaction. \u003Cem\u003ENo matter what you vote, it will still be very important.\u003C/em\u003E So far, it\u0027s been tough to tell whether this is normal or not, from the few people I\u0027ve asked. I in no I\u0027ll post my conclusion later if I get enough data. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPOLL QUESTION: When you are using a mouse, and, say you mouse over something or click on something, and the cursor icon changes, do you experience a texture like sense, as if you can feel the cursor/screen, or experience another sensory reaction similar to this? As a aide note, it does not have to be a feeling like you would feel if you normally touched or tasted or whatever\u0027d, it can certainly be something totally in your head.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for this guys, your poll votes will really help, and possibly find a new variant of synesthesia if the results suggest that (don\u0027t worry, that won\u0027t be what I draw my conclusions from, it\u0027ll just be a major chunk of data to use).

One of the classic issues with us synesthetes is that there are really no words to describe exactly what we see or hear or whatever. For example, the sound of a trumpet is a smooth line to me, stretching across my mind\u0027s eye. I know it\u0027s smooth, but the edges look really fairly rough to me. That\u0027s just one little example, but there are a lot of things like this, where you sort of know what it is, but also think what you\u0027re sensing is like something totally different at the same time. Our language doesn\u0027t really have words to describe most of the things we experience. In this case, you probably wouldn\u0027t feel a definitive texture like, say, if you were to feel a piece of bread, but rather something else, beyond what normal language can describe. \u0022Texture\u0022 is really the closest you can get to describing it to others without synesthesia.
