I do not doubt that if programmed, it could construct circuits, small computers, radios,\u00A0 and sensors inside a body. Do you think this is feasible?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it is but it would I think it would be best to occur after the body has reached adulthood and stopped growing. Furthermore, cyborg implants would need electricity to run, so the body would need to be good at generating electricity as well as good at evaporatng ir dissapating waste heat from it. Might need large flapping appendages like elephant ears for that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso any cell constructed implants would need to be made of safe metals that won\u0027t rust inside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCyborg implants would be for life and require surgery to remove. Also in order to have enough metal to build them the creature would have to eat enough of the specific nutients and minerals required over time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-30T19:02:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome thoughts on this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomineralization\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBiomineralization\u003C/a\u003E, i.e. the formation of metal crystals or inorganic materials is well known in a whole range of species.
