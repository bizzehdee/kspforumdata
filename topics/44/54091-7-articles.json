They already checked it after first days of aborts. Here is the whole timeline so far;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- First try, extra hold time at t-13min because first stage liquid oxygen vent/pressure relief valve failed to close properly. They held for a bit, cycled back the clock and decided to try again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Second try, this bit worked fine but second time around inside 13min final count a ground power supply had out-of-spec voltage and that tripped a hold. They looked at it, decided it was just too conservative limit and recycled to t-13min\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Third try they got fairly far into the count (t-4min) but this time the liquid oxygen valve again suspect as there were off-nominal pressure readings from 1st stage tank. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally there were two glitches with the strongback. When it retracted for the last attempt (only one which got that far) the air conditioning ducts attached to the fairing (to keep satellite cooled) detached earlier than normal due to a tangled line. Not a showstopper. When the third abort was called, the strongback returned to upright position very slowly (some glitch with that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBetween Tuesday and Thursday they took the rocket horizontal, inspected the LOX valve that had caused grief (and I assume, fixed whatever was wrong with the strongback) and were ready to try again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Thursday the first attempt took them all the way to ignition of all 9 engines but the computer shut them down immediately as two of them were showing slower-than-expected thrust build-up. Falcon 9 is designed for this; Engines start, computer checks all values are fine and THEN releases the rocket from the pad. Computer said no. Blame the SpaceX MechJeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey recycled for a second attempt while engine guys (probably back at the factory) went over all the data from the first attempt. They knew they would not launch if the engine guys were not happy with the data they had. Nothing prevents SpaceX from recycling without inspecting the engines outright - they are designed for re-starts - but it does require that the guys responsible for those engines fully understand what caused the first cutoff. They set the new time at the end of the launch window and everything went fine until ~T-48 secs (just after the point where internal computer takes over the control of the vehicle) but at that point the guys responsible for the engines basically said \u0022nope, we are not comfortable enough with the data we have / the time we had to analyze it. Let\u0027s abort and take a close look at the engines to ensure there is nothing wrong\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t blame them for electing to be conservative.

Your call may decide if that satellite is toast or not...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe valve that caused them grief on Tuesday *was* inspected and cleared prior to Thursday attempt. There was no reason to inspect the engines prior to the Thursday 1st attempt - they had passed testing at McGregor and had already started up once during hotfire test at the pad. They were considered good.
