This is because most jet designs don\u0027t handle supersonic intake flow speeds well at all, and it has to be slowed down before it can be fed into the engine using a number of techniques, most of which involve particular shaping of rather long ductwork. The \u0027big circular opening\u0027 you see on airliners only really works at subsonic speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/F-35B_cutaway_with_LiftFan.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022F-35B_cutaway_with_LiftFan.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis gives a decent view of the F-35\u0027s ductwork. You can see it in green leading back from the intakes into the front of the engine, going through a weird loop to get around the vertical lift fan (the -A model has a a fuel tank where the fan goes on the -B.) On a real aircraft, that\u0027s what you have to do: have an uninterrupted duct from the intakes to the engine(s) they service. Something like attaching it to a cubic octagonal strut or putting a cargo bay right behind them would, realistically, cut off the air flow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn KSP the air just magically flows to the engine regardless of where the intake is, which is one of the main things that allows airhogging. Frankly the entire \u0027intakeair\u0027 system is kind of a dirty hackjob to make the engines better balanced than they were, as was changing rockets to bipropellant (they used to burn just liquidfuel, so you could run jets and rockets off the same tanks. I used to mix jets in on the first few asparagus stages on my rockets back then.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s also why we get flameout spins like we do: When one engine flames out, the intakeair it was consuming magically transfers to the other engines, which keeps them alive. On an even-engined plane, this puts you in a spin unless they\u0027re mounted very close to the centerline. Realistically, the output of each intake should be designated for a particular engine and unable to transfer to another if that one shuts down, meaning all engines would flame out at once. There\u0027d also realistically need to be a logical flow path through parts with sufficient capacity, and very limited amounts of bending. Neither of these is possible with current game systems.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-02T07:19:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe thing about airhogging in KSP is that in KSP the intake is represented as a part, and you can clip parts on top of themselves to \u0022hog\u0022 intake air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut of course, in real life an air intake is a *hole*, and it doesn\u0027t make any sense to talk about stacking holes on top of each other.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
