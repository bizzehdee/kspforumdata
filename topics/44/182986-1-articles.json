Conservation of impulse means that the impulse gained by a ship equals to the impulse imparted to exhaust gases by its rocket engine.

When a spacecraft swings around a planet, gravity pulls it in, then slingshots it back out. It\u0027s easy to think of a hyperbolic trajectory as nothing more than a curved path through space, but it\u0027s not. The fabric of space, bent by the planet\u0027s gravitational mass, acts like an invisible spring, stretching as you zip around it and then relaxing as you careen away. Basic physics teaches that a compressed spring holds potential energy; the same thing is happening (in reverse) during a hyperbolic flyby.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpace is stretchy, and that stretchiness allows us to do some cool things. On a trampoline, you can bounce higher if someone else has just jumped before you, because the surface is already stretched. In the same way, if you burn a small amount of\u00A0propellant before you approach near another planet, you only get a small amount of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E. You\u0027ll hit the gravity well, stretch it, and then be slung\u00A0out. But if you wait until your momentum has already stretched the fabric of space, and burn the same amount of propellant, then your thrust has something extra to push against and so you emerge going much faster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can also conceptualize it using the forces acting on the spacecraft. Why do you speed up when you are falling toward a planet, then slow down as you are slung away? Well, gravity is pulling you in as you approach, and then it\u0027s trying to pull you back as you escape. It uses the same amount of force pulling you in that it uses to try and pull you back. However, when you burn your engine at closest approach, gravity is no longer just pulling on your ship; part of that total force is now being exerted on the propellant you just dumped. You\u0027re now moving faster, meaning that gravity has less time to pull you back, and the propellant is now moving slower (relative to its original speed), meaning gravity has more time to pull on it. So total energy is conserved, but you get a boost because gravity spent more time tugging you in than it did pulling you on your way out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cunjo Carl","CreatedById":162109,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-22T03:32:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlenty of good answers already, but I\u0027ll add a bit. We actually have an equivalent to the Oberth effect right here on Earth, if you\u0027ve ever ridden a bike in a hilly area. When faced with a short hill, people will speed up extra at the bottom rather than trying to fight the hill extra at the top.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEspecially on a bike, our legs act a bit like rocket engines. Our legs can provide a force for a certain time before getting tired, just like rocket engines can provide a force for a certain time before running out of fuel. In either case, that force per time translates into a certain amount of \u0027speed up\u0027. In other words, if you crank the pedals harder for a little bit, you\u0027ll be going faster. Great!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if you\u0027re toodling along at a normal speed (say 16kph or 10mph) and you notice the road in front of you has a short but steep incline (say 2m or 6.5ft tall) you\u0027ll naturally speed up a bit so that you hit the incline with plenty of speed and whisk over it, rather than needing to spend the extra energy by slowing to a crawl halfway up and cranking your way up the second half. Let\u0027s compare how much speed (aka. energy) we come out with if we speed up another 6.5kph (4mph) at the bottom of the hill while we\u0027re still going fast rather than trying to use it at the top of the hill after it\u0027s too late and we\u0027ve already slowed down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Use the 6.5kph speedup first to get to 22.5kph and hit the hill: you\u0027ll come out traveling 16kph just like originally! This is what people normally do because it\u0027s the easy way to ride a bike up a hill.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Hit the hill going 16kph, and naturally slow down to 1.5kph by the top. Then use the 6.5kph speedup and you\u0027ll only be going 8kph- \u003Cstrong\u003Ehalf \u003C/strong\u003Eyour original speed! People don\u0027t do this.

You could apply this change in velocity at apoapsis, where your orbital speed is slowest, but that would mean you have to speed up a lot more to get to escape velocity. If you apply that change in velocity at periapsis, where you are already moving very fast, then you have to speed up less than you would have to at apoapsis. It doesn\u0027t violate conservation of energy, because at apoapsis your kinetic energy becomes stored as gravitational potential energy, and at periapsis your gravitational potential energy becomes kinetic energy (i.e more speed).
