What this means is that they will try to grow toward, perpendicularly, or away from the direction of acceleration (IE: They can be bred to grow up, sideways, or down). The point of this is that right now the mechanisms that cause this behavior to happen are not well understood. We obviously have data for how well plants grow in 1\u002B Gs, and some for 0Gs. But there really isn\u0027t too much on 0G\u0026lt;?\u0026lt;1G. An example is that currently science is unaware of at just what level of G force are plants able to detect and thus grow accordingly. Plants tend not to grow well in zero G if they have root structures and the like partly because of how the 0G effects water on the root structures, but also weird growth issues. But if it turns out they only need to be spun to 0.05Gs or something similar, that is quite doable and is much less of a challenge for an Earth-\u0026gt;Mars transit ship to do than if they required 0.8\u002B Gs to grow properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, we might get surprised and find out that plants grow ten times better under 0.4Gs than in 1G or some such thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFun fact: E.

So I guess the area for each of the Moss\u0027s will shrink, because if the whole dish started growing at once, through the mission we\u0027d be changing how much gravity it would have, not so as you can imagine, it will get us lots of data about how Moss reacts when suddenly put into another gravity, not what we really want. So, we have maybe, 6 or 8 Moss compartments/areas in the dish, and the first compartment/area starts growing when it first starts spinning at one gravity (I don\u0027t mean 1G).

What we will be doing is measuring how it grows during the initial part of its existence in a low gravity for several days, then up the gravity \u0022quickly\u0022 then see how it continues to grow for the next few days. We might get little wonky transition edges in the growth patterns, but that is fine and useful data in its own right (how do plants grow in changing gravity environments?) but we should be able to get the info we want for the various gravity levels.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm... okay then, though I really don\u0027t see how it\u0027s not feasibly possible to do that in a 10 cm isolated cube floating 418 km above Earth, but hey, I\u0027m not a biologist.
