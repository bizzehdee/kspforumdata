Technology has surpassed biological anatomy and physical capability in almost every way, from physical strength to reasonable intellect.\n\nName anything, and a piece of technology has probably already been created to fit your description. Learning, smart responses, individual thinking, philosophy, even creativity.\n\nComposers, free thinkers, ideologists, artists, you name it.\n\nAlthough technology has evolved with a greater mind indeed, it is true that the human mind is revered as the most complex technology. All of the categories listed above wrapped into one package, along with a few other attributes that machines haven\u0027t been built for yet. It is not built for processing power, but energy efficiency. Our memories may fragment, but that is perhaps because of the sheer magnitude of data out brains try to store at once. A camera, for instance, does not capture a full shutter, but rather a rolling shutter; scanning strips of data one by one for every pixel. Our minds use a frame rate too difficult to put into words, and there is no certainty to whether there is a limit.\n\nWe can solve riddles, as an added bonus. Seeking out puzzles to solve is one of the wonders of our mind. Looking at different angles, trying new definitions, looking for metaphors, and getting the pool of satisfaction afterwards.\n\nAll in all, our overall biological position on the board is okay, but trumped by technology by a marginal amount... but, to what avail? I mean, what is the apex of technological evolution? Speculate all you want about that, but what about biology? Imagine this:\n\nTechnology becomes dominant throughout the Terran system. Not a day goes by without it, and it can only continue to expand. A breakthrough in propulsion research has let us travel the galaxy. We go forth and explore, but run into someone unexpected...\n\nA species that has chosen the route of biological evolution rather than technological. Vessels with regenerative properties, neural binary processing, brains as a memory core, neural interfaces to call out commands, biological weaponry, highly advanced immune responses, and even defenses evolved into them as well, such as built-in weapons or multi-cellular adaptability.\n\nThis species finds us as a threat, and attacks us. What can we do? Fire weapons, alright. Makes a dent, which heals right back. Our limited technology, and just technology in general will most likely never reach the level of efficiency that biology can possibly reach.\n\nAlthough that sounds like a baseless and very bold claim... well, actually it is. I have no idea what the limit of technological evolution is, but I honestly suspect that the potential of biological evolution is far greater than the capable reaches of technology. Some may disagree, and that\u0027s fine. I mean, look at it now...\n\nBut try to look past our own species, as difficult as that may be. Which category do you think wins the battle?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-15T05:36:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/15/2015 05:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xannari Ferrows**"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T11:49:38Z","Content":"I do not think you can separate the two.

Self learning AI becomes better and better, yet gains some carnal properties in the process, as it would simply not work easily without. We make chemicals by altering bacteria, rather than trying to synthesize the chemical from scratch. We make better foods, rather than just better ways of growing the foods.

Biology is still a way to turn energy into useful work, just as technology. It just turned out that nature had some organic material laying around and \u0022made\u0022 life out of it. If it was more advantageous to use iron or something similar, we would have been walking metal robots instead of blobs of organic matter and water. \n\nThat being said, \u0022biology\u0022 as you call it, thanks to billions of years of evolution, is far, far ahead of technology right now. Each cell, every neuron, every muscle in our bodies is a finely tuned machine or computer, geared at doing its job incredibly well. Just think of how complex an organ the eye is and what it is capable of doing. We can\u0027t reproduce its sensitivity or complexity using current technology. We can make instruments that can be more well-suited for a particular situation, but we cannot make something that does everything the eye is capable of in a better way. The same goes for almost every organ in our body. And when we move to microscopic level - our cells, our hormones, etc. - humanity\u0027s efforts to emulate \u0022biology\u0022 are even more pathetic at the moment.\n\nThe reason most people think there is some inherent difference between \u0022biology\u0022 and \u0022technology\u0022 is because we can make machines that are better than us in specific tasks. However, living organisms were \u0022designed\u0022 (for a lack of a better word) with a different goal - to survive at all costs. Humans (and all living things) are able to receive useful information from numerous stimuli, to interpret this information and to act on it in order to survive. And for that to happen living things are equipped to deal very well with everything that comes their way in their habitat. Which is orders of magnitude more complex than anything technology can do today. Given some centuries of continued technological progress and we may get there. I say \u0022may\u0022, because the complexity of life is so big that the task of emulating it gargantuan and unquantifiable - it may take us decades, it may take us centuries or even thousands of years.\n\nSo to summarize - if in the future we develop \u0022technology\u0022 (with which I assume the OP means things made of \u0022artificial\u0022 stuff like metal or silicon) and meet a hostile civilization, which has developed \u0022biology\u0022 (which I assume the OP means things made out of organic matter) AND both species at a relatively similar progress level, I think there would not be any difference. To use the OP\u0027s example - if we shoot missiles at them, they may heal the damage using organic molecules or whatever. If they shoot organic explosive pods (peashooter for teh win! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) at us, our ships will heal the damage using microscopic nanobots, which will use available surplus material to mend the holes in the hulls. So to summarize - at similar progress levels \u0022biology\u0022 and \u0022technology\u0022 are the same thing. Only the source material everything is made of is different (metal \u0026 plastic vs. organic matter).

And then, there\u0027s all the other adaptions an organism would need for protecting itself from radiation that would be mostly useless until it evolved a working nuclear reactor.\n\u003E \n\u003E I know this sounds sorta like the creationist\u0027s argument for \u0022irreducible parts\u0022 (don\u0027t bother wasting your time and looking it up if you don\u0027t know what I\u0027m talking about), but that\u0027s because the best myths are those that start with a basis in facts. \n\u003E \n\u003E So, it seems certain that we should be able to eventually find ways to vastly improve our bodies; as we are intelligent designers, and we can skip *straight* to a better solution that evolution could never be able to find.\n\nWe can make a lot of assumptions there, but that gives us little to no real data or idea. Your example of using existing biology is good. It misses one little point on the way though. Technology can be an opposite concept. A car built from the ground up is specifically different from a horse with a saddle. Both use technology, but one is absent of biology, the other reliant on it.\n\nYes, biology does not use a nuclear reactor. Does it need one?\n\nThere is no quick solution to the travelling sales man problem so to speak (it\u0027s an NP hard compute problem to find the solutions ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) ). EG protein folding (biological problems) or sustainable fusion (technological problems).\n\nEffectively, saying \u0022science can solve\u0022 or \u0022technology can solve\u0022 problems is like saying a very very large hammer can solve problems, or a very big calculator can. None of these things solves problems, people and hard work does. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-23T21:16:02Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2015 09:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Technical Ben**"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T23:00:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...Technology is more durable, it can survive events biology can not...\n\nSeparate these statements. The second is true; the first most definitely is not. All of our technology requires constant upkeep, else it wears out and breaks. There is no self-repair or self-replication of even our most advanced technologies. Biological systems, on the other hand, have had millions if not billions of years to practice surviving, and are hell-bent on continuing that trend. Self-repair systems abound to treat injury from a wide variety of sources, and while they do in fact wear out, there are other systems in place to produce their own replacements.

Of course, there is the problem of your s\\*\\*\\* being highly radioactive.\n\nAnyway, don\u0027t get hung up on irrelavant details. The point is that there are things that life cannot evolve on its own, or would have a very difficult time evolving. Evolution does *not* arrive at the *best* solution, it arrives at the an *optimal* solution. It might be the \u0022best\u0022 solution, but it is probably not. An example is silicon exactly. Even if silicon were better than neurons, how would we ever incorporate silicon transistors into our brains? It\u0027s not possible. The composition of the silicon has to be controlled to an EXTREMELY high tolerance that biology could never achieve. Also silicon does NOT dissolve easily, and the things that it does dissolve in tend to be highly toxic, and actually may convert it into SiO2, which is insoluable in water (I\u0027m not exactly sure what the chemistry is). I do know that yet another reason it would be impossible to get elemental silicon is it is highly reactive with oxygen. Pretty much the instant you expose it to oxygen it forms a thin oxide layer (which protects the silicon deeper inside from oxidizing). Oh yea, good luck growing silicon crystals too. Biology simply cannot make use of silicon transistors, they could never evolve naturally, not in a **trillion** years, so the fact that we don\u0027t use silicon transistors in our brains doesn\u0027t really mean anything."},{"CreatedByName":"LN400","CreatedById":140595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T06:45:58Z","Content":"Just a couple of thoughts. Biological evolution is not driven towards a goal. There is no planning in evolution. No design evaluation. As far as evolution goes there is now and what is physically/chemically/biologically possible right now but evolution has no concept of future. There are no reasons why one would think evolution gives us \u0022the best\u0022. Evolution is full of examples of twists and turns that ended up in dead end alleys, or that worked but makes no sense whatsoever in terms of planning ahead.\n\nThis however is not relevant to whether or not biology is more or less complex than the most complex technology humans have created. It\u0027s been said already in this topic but I\u0027ll repeat it. As far as complexity goes, the most complex technology we have created is barely worth mentioning compared to the complexity of biology. It\u0027s been repeated many times how technology is superior in any and every way but when one shows a giga- (let\u0027s go overboard with a peta-) pixel camera is superior to the eye, I don\u0027t think they understand the complexity involved at every level from light entering the eyeball, and every step, towards the brain processing the neural signals. This whole process is one where biology is superior. So, you have your petapixel camera. What will technology do with that camera other than press the shutter button? How will technology build up an awareness of the world around it to the same level we build up awareness of our surroundings? Yes we do need technology to say, go into environments that would kill us if we didn\u0027t have the tech but that is not an indication of technology\u0027s superiority to biology. Could just as well have been an indication of biology\u0027s command of technology."},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T07:44:24Z","Content":"The distinction between technology and biology gets more and more blurred.\n\nIf we take technology as that which arrises from an \u0022intelligent designer\u0022 (ie we think about it, and make it), and biology as the product of iteration and selection (ie, evolution):\n\nTechnology has yet to achieve any true intelligence.

Some animals avoid eating for long periods of time. Though I think we are mixing up \u0022acquiring resources\u0022 and \u0022acquiring energy\u0022. Uranium is great for energy, but useless for building materials. Thus as an animal is already eating for the building/repair materials, it can get energy at a much more efficient means than uranium.\n\nSuch as solar (or sodium if in a cave) or other animals. There is a reason we use petrol, which is oil, which is a biological construction. Because it\u0027s energy density is amazing, plus it\u0027s storage is rather simple (so less waste on additional systems).\n\nAs said, for an animal to require uranium power, it would need a massive size to offset it\u0027s additional bulk for the containment systems.
