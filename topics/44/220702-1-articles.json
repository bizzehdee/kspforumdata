If this is not one of the direct aims of the initiative, ArianeGroup will certainly be in a position to utilize BEST! as a means to fund, at least partially, the transfer of the knowledge gained during the ongoing development of the reusable booster demonstrator Themis to an evolved Ariane 6 variant.\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://europeanspaceflight.com/esa-publishes-call-for-reusable-rocket-booster-concepts/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://europeanspaceflight.com/esa-publishes-call-for-reusable-rocket-booster-concepts/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0This is great news for European space flight. I find it quite notable the author of this article on the new ESA push for reusability is asserting that it may involve an evolution of the Ariane 6. This is important, for if it is to be reusable then the solid \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u2019s must be dispensed with. Now, it is possible such an evolution would involve the methane-fueled Prometheus engine. But in my opinion, using a completely different engine with even different propellant should not be regarded as an evolution of the Ariane 6. It would be an evolution of the Ariane 6 to reusability if using the same hydrogen-fueled Vulcain engines but not using the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u2019s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuite key for these new launcher developments is to follow the SpaceX model of\u00A0private financing\u00A0for the launchers. That way 90% of the development costs can be saved: a mid-sized orbital launcher can be developed for only a few hundred million development cost, not the billion dollars thought necessary when such launchers were government financed.

There are only two crewed spacecraft ever designed and flown in two years- Vostok and Mercury. Gemini was designed from roughly \u201862 and flew in \u201864 but without crew.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll three of these were barebones spacecraft. They were capable for orbital training flights but not useful 21st century space ops, that is, space station ops.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUseful spacecraft have a much longer genesis- Soyuz (1963-1967 for first crewed flight), Apollo (1961-1968), Space Shuttle (1972-1981), Crew Dragon began development in 2011 and didn\u2019t fly with crew until 2020, Starliner \u003Cem\u003Estill\u003C/em\u003E hasn\u2019t flown with crew, and Orion started in ~2006 or so and also still hasn\u2019t flown with crew.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that Starliner and Orion use existing engines, assuming you refer to launch vehicle difficulties, but if you mean the spacecraft engines, Orion uses tech from both the ATV and the AJ-10 (I think that\u2019s the designation for the main engine\u2026 correct me if wrong) but still took until 2022 to fly, and still hasn\u2019t carried crew. Not sure what Starliner uses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the biggest issue with spaceflight timelines is taking into account institutional and economic factors. I\u2019d say 5-10 years is a better estimate than trying to pinpoint a number, especially when it\u2019s a number below 5.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat makes you think European companies will be interested in building a crewed spacecraft? A European astronaut literally just flew on an American commercial flight. This theoretically could replace reliance on NASA flights and fulfill Europe\u2019s desire for a post-ISS space station expeditionary capability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hate to say this, but I feel like the only way a European crewed launcher ever made sense was in the 1960s, if Britain had tried to develop its own crewed spaceflight using the Lipstick Rocket (I forget the name). By the 1980s and onward, Europe fell into what I call the \u201CSoyuz dilemma\u201D- why build your own government launcher when you can buy launches from someone else? It\u2019s part of why Orion never became an ISS transport vehicle like it was originally intended to. The supplier just changed from Russia to America\u2019s budding private spaceflight industry (really just SpaceX TBH).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut Europe doesn\u2019t have a budding private spaceflight industry, for a few reasons-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Lack of demand from the military. Europe doesn\u2019t launch as many satellites as the US does. Europe might be third in satellite reconnaissance capabilities but their bar on a graph is like a centimeter and the US and China are a decimeter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Lack of demand from private industry. It is my understanding that European telecom companies just have old school constellations of 10-20 satellites. There is no interest in building a Starlink level constellation, which is really the Holy Grail of building a space economy. It\u2019s what\u2019s driving reusable launcher development in China, and although they are a decade behind Starlink and F9, they will get there. Europe won\u2019t because no companies are interested in a Starlink like endeavor, and that\u2019s probably because of reason three.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Europe just isn\u2019t that big, because it\u2019s not a real country. It\u2019s a bunch of countries loosely affiliated. France, Poland, Italy- you name the place- do not need a giant Starlink level constellation to provide internet service across a continent, because even Europe itself isn\u2019t that big of a continent. China and the US and big of course, AND have a huge population to go with that land. Contrast with Russia which is more sparsely populated and wouldn\u2019t need a Starlink constellation either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Europe doesn\u2019t have a global footprint. Especially its navies are limited to operations in the Atlantic. Contrast this with the US and China which desire to be globe spanning in reach, and thus need something like Starlink for internet anywhere anytime.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Lack of political interest and the prestige factor. Do Europeans feel pride in the Union in the same way Americans and Chinese feel pride in their respective countries? Do politicians feel that way, or is it a matter of convenience? A desire to be seen as a global power is what drives space development in China, and after the \u201Cspinoff\u201D and \u201Cscience\u201D days of 1980-2019ish, NASA is very focused on the image of power too (or at least the politicians who fund it are, which is why the Moon gotten chosen as a goal). In contrast, European attempts to carve out a place in the world like that don\u2019t hold a lot of gravity. Europe is still very much an American partner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. Economic factor. Europe is just small. Arianespace doesn\u2019t even seem to have skin in the game, so you have private companies in individual countries competing? China\u2019s GDP is 17 trillion $ and America\u2019s is 26 trillion $. In contrast, Germany, where Rocket Factory Augsburg hails from, has a GDP of 4 trillion $. Now I know these are private companies competing, but realistically a company from a country with 1/4 of the GDP of China and 1/6 of the GDP of the US is not going to have the capital to put out rockets like SpaceX does, and they are not going to put out satellites like Starlink does. Heck, or like China does for that matter (they launch a lot of expendable rockets).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose are two things necessary for a reusable launcher to be worth the development and flight cost.

The cost for such a pressure-fed rocket system, well less than a full size orbital rocket, would probably be in the tens of million dollars range as privately financed by the commercial space approach. \u00A0As a point of comparison the development of the Falcon 1 an actual orbital rocket was only about $90 million by following the private financing commercial space approach which included the development cost of the Merlin engine, a more advanced pump-fed engine then the pressure fed Superdracos.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 Bob Clark\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-02-15T05:32:34Z\u0022 title=\u002202/15/2024 05:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Feb 15\u0022\u003EFebruary 15\u003C/time\u003E by Exoscientist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EEmphasized Falcon 1 was developed at such low cost because it followed the privately financed commercial space approach.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-02-14T19:40:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224366522\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022220702\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221707932683\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002227117\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Exoscientist\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Exoscientist said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEuropean startup gets $44 million for space station transportation vehicles\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDynetics got $253M from NASA to submit a final HLS proposal that didn\u0027t even close \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E wise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that $44M should buy them about 18% of the number of pages the Dynetics proposal is.

The cargo capsule is expected to be ready by 2027 to 2028.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0The Maia launcher of MaiaSpace is a Falcon 1 class vehicle using the Prometheus methane-fueled engine. It is expected to make its first test launch in 2025. Now, consider this: the low cost approach to development of SpaceX is well known now, cutting 90% off development costs. Not generally appreciated though is the SpaceX rapid development approach. They went from the first successful test launch of the Falcon 1 in 2008 to the first launch of the Falcon 9 only two years later in 2010.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I advise MaiaSpace not just emulate the low cost private financing approach of SpaceX but also follow their rapid development approach. If the Maia is successfully launched in 2025, then an upgraded Falcon 9 class version could be ready and launched two years later in 2027. This will be about the time when the cargo capsules will be ready.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne more suggestion. SpaceX and now multiple other space startups have shown privately financed launchers can be developed at 1/10th the cost of the usual government financed approach. But SpaceX and Orbital Sciences, now Orbital ATK, showed also with their Dragon and Cygnus cargo capsules respectively, that cargo capsules can also be developed by the private financing approach at 1/10th the cost of the government financed ones, for only a few hundred million dollars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0But when SpaceX developed the crew Dragon they took funding from NASA. Suddenly, the development costs ballooned to the billion dollar range. I\u2019m saying it\u2019s \u003Ci\u003Ebecause \u003C/i\u003ENASA was paying for it that the development costs grew that high. A crew capsule instead following the private financing approach also can be developed at costs in the few hundred million dollars range.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Then my suggestion to the European companies developing the cargo capsules is to follow the private financing approach of SpaceX, and also \u003Ci\u003Econcurrently\u003C/i\u003E develop crew capsules privately financed. They each can be developed at costs at the few hundred million dollars range. Then both cargo capsules and crew capsules can be developed by the time when MaiaSpace can have a crew capable launcher ready by 2027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0I believe Europe has well enough technical knowledge to advance their own launchers and capsules. The Ariane 5 for many years was the leading launcher for commercial satellites. It was supplanted by the Falcon 9 because SpaceX took the low cost private financing approach and focused on reusability. Europe is now recognizing that is the way to cut costs. My opinion, the new European start ups focusing on the commercial space approach and on reusability will be competitive to the Falcon 9.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Note also in regards to capsules, the Cygnus capsule was actually built in Italy by Thales Alenia.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 Bob Clark\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0Looks like India will have the next manned space program, beating the Europeans:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedOther\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed9843860993\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026amp;module=system\u0026amp;controller=embed\u0026amp;url=https://twitter.com/rory_mg/status/1762447489578262993\u0022 style=\u0022height:724px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 Bob Clark\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-02-27T21:52:40Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2024 09:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Feb 27\u0022\u003EFebruary 27\u003C/time\u003E by Exoscientist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SunlitZelkova","CreatedById":206402,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-02-28T07:42:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224369099\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022220702\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221709067925\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002227117\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Exoscientist\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, Exoscientist said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks like India will have the next manned space program, beating the Europeans:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEurope was never going to beat India.
