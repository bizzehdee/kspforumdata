This does not go very well with acids. Krill, hummer, shells, whole Coral-reefs. With the stress of overfishing the results can be seen by anybody - even when you are just snorkeling. Just compare the development of the last 20 years. \n\nAdditionally alarming is the coral bleaching (you can just google that, I\u0027m sure it turns up some images). This happens typically due to warmer water (other factors possible); as the coral push out their zooxanthellae (they live in symbiosis with these algae) the more acidic water can attack, weaken and finally kill the coral, so their symbiotic algae can not repopulate them (as they are under permanent stress).\n\nThe whole issue here is: the carbon cycle is a highly complex feedback-system (to be more precise: a whole lot of them). You can not pick out a very specific aspect, making wild assumption based on misunderstood technical terms and building up a \u0027solution\u0027 on these \u0027facts\u0027. This does not work.\n\nBut again: Lets assume you are right. How exactly do you explain the constant rise in CO2 levels in the atmosphere since WW2? What other explanation can you offer? I\u0027m bringing this up because: You can\u0027t explain these just with \u0027concentration grades and gradients\u0027 in the larger water bodies of the earth. Oceans are slow, but they are not that dead-slow.\n\nAs we are here in a somehow space-related forum: NASA has a great deal of information concerning the subject, with tons of links to scientific papers, raw data, and a lot more (also a lot of pictures!): [http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/](http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/) \n\nYou can download the CO2 measurements since 1958 as csv-txt and test the validity of your assumptions against this data. If your model can explain the levels we are measuring (not, not just one ore two cherry-picked datasets, but all of them within reasonable deltas) then a lot of people will be highly interested in your findings.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nninja\u0027d...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Those large exchange rates arent necessarily all from absorption. But it is a scientific fact that the water masses ABSORB CO2 directly (without putting it into life), which has lead to an increase in the acidity of said water masses.\n\nPoint is: you understand \u0027absorption\u0027 as in: Is \u0027absorbed\u0027 - hencefore permanently away. This is misleading. CO2 is dissolved in water as the other gasses in the atmosphere too (O2, Nitrogen); CO2 also forms cabonic acid with water (H2CO3). The later is an all but stable acid. Just open a can of soda. When there are more bubbles to see, then heat it up. What happens? If you are looking for an analogy: The water bodies on earth are not CO2 storage, they are more buffers.\n\n\u003E The reason atmospheric CO2 concentrations are rising is because the ocean cannot absorb all of the CO2 right away. Diffusion takes concentration gradients and/or convection, both in the atmosphere and in the ocean. The ocean only removes 30-40% of the CO2 we release per year, the other 60-70% goes into the atmosphere...\n\nI ignore you made-up numbers here and concentrate on the first sentence. So, not \u0027right away\u0027 you say. What time-horizon do you assume? The data in posting you have quoted shows a timerange since 1960. So you do have more than 50 years in mind? You must have - else the effects you claim should be visible in the data ... because if its 50 years - we should see the \u0027absorption\u0027 effects for the gas emitted in the 1960\u0027s.\n\nI can\u0027t see that. Can you? No? So more than 50 years. 100? 200? 1000? What do you have in mind?\n\nAn alternative explanation to yours is: There is no absorption. At least not in the way you are implying.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-26T16:17:13Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2015 04:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by kzauner**\n  \nupdate"},{"CreatedByName":"justidutch","CreatedById":99185,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T16:16:32Z","Content":"We need to create a strain of genetically modified bovines that are able to absorb more CO2 than they expend."},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T16:21:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Even if we could get a tiny self sufficient population colonizing mars.... we\u0027d doom billions... to willfully follow this strategy when it could be avoided is to make yourself a bigger mass murderer than all the mass murderers in history... like... \u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCber-hitler.\n\nNice.

Regardless, given that the oceans are currently absorbing 30-40% of the CO2 humans release, it seems like 50 years might be long enough to reach equilibrium (if it took millions of years, the amount of CO2 absorbed by the ocean would be negligible until millions of years had passed)...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The reason atmospheric CO2 concentrations are rising is because the ocean cannot absorb all of the CO2 right away. Diffusion takes concentration gradients and/or convection, both in the atmosphere and in the ocean.

Also sources choose different ways to show data, for example they may separate or merge effects. Plus bad conversion or translations.\n\nHumans release almost 9 gt by year, this includes the effect of deforestation. From those 9gt by year, less than 30% is absorbed by oceans (2gt) and (3gt) by forest.\n\nOr maybe the 30% to 40% that you are talking about is the one absorbed by the sea from the total cycle (90 sea \u002B 120 Forest \u002B 5 Extra), so in that case seas absorb a 40%.\n\n**Different graphs:**\n\n199x\n\n[http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/pix/research/climate_ecosystems/AnthropogenicCarbonCycleBox2.png](http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/pix/research/climate_ecosystems/AnthropogenicCarbonCycleBox2.png)\n\n[http://worldoceanreview.com/en/files/2010/10/k2_kompo_kohlenstoffkreislauf_e_en.jpg](http://worldoceanreview.com/en/files/2010/10/k2_kompo_kohlenstoffkreislauf_e_en.jpg)\n\n200x\n\n[http://www.globalchange.umich.edu/globalchange1/current/lectures/kling/carbon_cycle/carbon_cycle.jpg](http://www.globalchange.umich.edu/globalchange1/current/lectures/kling/carbon_cycle/carbon_cycle.jpg)\n\n[http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/research/themes/carbon/img/carboncycle.gif](http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/research/themes/carbon/img/carboncycle.gif)\n\n201x\n\n[http://clas-pages.uncc.edu/mesas/files/2015/01/carbon-cycle-boiled.png](http://clas-pages.uncc.edu/mesas/files/2015/01/carbon-cycle-boiled.png)\n\n[http://s20.postimg.org/567ve34l9/Carbon_cycle.jpg](http://s20.postimg.org/567ve34l9/Carbon_cycle.jpg)\n\n\u003E I don\u0027t believe anyone who says they fully understand how the earths climate works, so I do take the explanations about eg. global warming with a grain of salt.

This is at room temperature and pressure...
