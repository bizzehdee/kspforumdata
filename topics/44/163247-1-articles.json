Unlike rockets where you can mess with the nozzle to deal with higher ambient pressure, jets have to draw and exhaust that higher pressure air. I do know that jet engine specific impulse doesn\u0027t change. What I don\u0027t know is\u00A0if\u00A0thrust would be better or worse with thicker air, though. And there\u0027s the consideration that I might not need as much\u00A0speed in thicker air to get as much lift, so I wouldn\u0027t need as much thrust.

Generally jets are speed (velCurve) and pressure (atmCurve) restrained in the game, but this might not be realistic in thicker air. I wonder what happens if I start changing atmosphereCurve as well. Or maybe a combination of changing atmCurve for more thrust, but also changing atmosphereCurve for lower specific impulse at higher pressures, to represent the engine having to work harder to get the needed overpressure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is what I\u0027m hoping EngineSimU will tell me when I have more time to play with it.
