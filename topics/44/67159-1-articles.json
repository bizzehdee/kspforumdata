This makes intercepting one very, very hard. The Asteroid Redirect thing might not cut it. So, the question to the awesome, scientifically minded KSP community is this: What would a manned landing on a comet look like? If you need a justification for why we would send actual astronauts, just assume \u0027Because we can\u0027.
