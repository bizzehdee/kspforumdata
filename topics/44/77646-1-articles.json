Unfortunately, all of the necessary hardware is insanely expensive. The ground station will also require a satellite dish to track the satellite as it passes overhead, which is very challenging to construct or very expensive to purchase. Either way, this option would require much better funding. The advantage is primarily in the data rate. If we want to be able to stream live video from the CubeSat, we have to go S Band.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVHF\u003C/strong\u003E - We would be limited to 200W on relevant bands, but this is sufficient to get the range we need. The hardware can literally be soldered together at home, and if we are worried about radiation, a VHF FM transceiver can be literally wired together with radio lamps that are rad hard by default. Cheap, reliable, and there are amateur radio operators using these bands all over the world that we might be able to ask for help if we lose the satellite. The disadvantage is that we\u0027ll be basically limited to a typical FM radio band, which will give us something like 50kbps - 100kbps. It\u0027s enough to beam down images, but we will not be able to do video.\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExperiment\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are still working out details, but the most likely option is growing moss in hypogravity. A lot of experiments have been conducted on plant growth in hypergravity, and a number of experiments in microgravity have been conducted on the space stations. However, no experimental data is available for the 0g - 1g range. Certain mosses have very strong response to gravity, and there is interest in scientific community in obtaining some real data on that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt wouldn\u0027t be a huge contribution, but it would be something entirely unique that will result in some publications. Unfortunately, none of the people actively involved in this program are experts in the field.

We are discussing possibility of custom tooled parts for the frame, but we need to make sure we can satisfy all testing requirements with these.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMain Board\u003C/strong\u003E - That will almost certainly have to be custom built, but fortunately, there are plenty of PCB printing services out there.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECPU\u003C/strong\u003E - There are a lot of options. The main limiting factors are cost vs ability to withstand radiation of LEO. If we can\u0027t afford it, off-the-shelf CPU/MCU will do, but rad-hard is preferable. Assuming we go with VHF option, which doesn\u0027t require a CPU capable of high data rate, I propose using \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_MCS-51\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E8051\u003C/a\u003E. First, because rad-hard versions are available for reasonable price, under $2k. Second, because garden variety of these is dirt cheap, and we can experiment with them as much as we like. Finally, they are easy to work with. There is a huge amount of development tools available, including C compilers and emulators. If we need to, a custom emulator can be written easily. Power consumption of just over 125mW is also a plus. The largest drawbacks is that it can only execute 1M instructions per second, limiting data rate it can directly beam to the ground station, and the fact that it can only address 64kB of memory. That\u0027s enough for everything but streaming video, though.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMemory\u003C/strong\u003E - Ideally, rad-hard stuff. The fact that we only need 64k with above is a plus, because that stuff also get very expensive. On the other hand, rad-hard memory isn\u0027t as critical as rad-hard CPU, so long as the code is written to take possible failures into account.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESolar Panels\u003C/strong\u003E - This is the place where we cannot go cheap. We will have to buy space-rated solar panels for a number of reasons. They are most exposed to solar radiation, they are a critical point of failure, and they can\u0027t shatter during ride to orbit. All of that adds up to panels designed specifically for space operations, and that means lots of money. Other than the launch, it is likely to end up the single most expensive part of the project.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBatteries\u003C/strong\u003E - LEO gives us 45 minutes of almost total darkness for every 45 minutes of sunlight. Battery must be capable of withstanding large temperature variations, frequent recharges, and still be able to power the satellite on the dark side. We will also most likely rely on the battery to provide power for the transmitter, since that\u0027s likely to draw way more power than solar panels can provide. It does seem, however, that we can find standard batteries for that, rather than reach for space-specific stuff. So while not exactly cheap, this should be relatively inexpensive.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENavigation\u003C/strong\u003E - We will need a GPS receiver on board. It needs to be unlocked to operate at LEO altitudes and velocity, but such units are available.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAttitude Control\u003C/strong\u003E - RCS is not really an option. Fortunately, we don\u0027t need to maneuver. Only adjust attitude. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetorquer\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMagnetotorquers\u003C/a\u003E are available for that. Again, commercial units are unreasonably expensive, but I think we can handle coiling some wire. Mass distribution of the CubeSat will be designed so as to allow relatively complicated attitude adjustments. The CubeSat will constantly spin on one of the axes, which will allow for better stability, attitude adjustments via precession, and will provide small amount of artificial gravity for the experiment.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECooling/Heating\u003C/strong\u003E - Some components are temperature-sensitive. We might need a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_cooling\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethermoelectric cooler\u003C/a\u003E on board, attached to external radiators. Other than that, making sure that most of the sat is reflective should reduce temperature variations.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECamera\u003C/strong\u003E - It sure would be neat to get some pictures from up there. An external camera for cool shots would probably be a good idea. If sensible, an internal camera to watch over the experiment can also be added. It has been suggested that a microscope might be a good idea, which might be possible to swing. All of these will have to withstand radiation of space. Odds are, however, that we\u0027ll simply go for off-the-shelf versions and keep our fingers crossed. Typically, about a week of operation is to be expected from non rad-hard cameras, which should be sufficient to get a few cool pictures and get most of the relevant experiment data.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOther Sensors\u003C/strong\u003E - We can make use of accelerometers and light sensors to help hold/change attitude. Temperature sensors will probably need to be littered through the whole CubeSat to make sure we are aware of any problems early. Experiment will probably require a suit of its own sensors. (More precise temperature, pressure, humidity, O2, CO2, etc.)\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESoftware\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmost everything has to be custom-written. I\u0027m currently working on a simulation to help determine some of the requirements. In particular, these for navigation tolerances, mass distribution, amount of power we\u0027ll need for attitude control, and typical comm ranges to be expected. That simulation will also be used later to help develop software for the cubesat itself. If we are going with 8051, that will be coded on the very low level, with direct access to all the hardware on board. I will also work on software for tracking and communicating with the satellite, which we will try to make available to as many people as possible using amateur radio equipment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFunding\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, this will probably become a KickStarter project. We will need money to buy the parts, probably to pay for at least some of the testing, and finally, pay for a ride to LEO. That last one alone can be anywhere from $30k - $100k. There are, however, certain programs that give free rides to qualifying projects. We will look into that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo money will be taken from anybody until we finalize design, however. So hold your horses.

Might be possible to blast the surface with some gas and do mass spec on it for composition. It\u0027d be kind of expensive, but not unreasonably so. That\u0027s the only thing I can think of that can be done with landing, but not with orbiter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting there is easier than one would think. Still not exactly easy, of course. The launcher would put cubesat on a GTO. Almost immediately, the main propulsion would kick in to change GTO to LTO. This would cost less than 700m/s of delta-V. That puts us on the course for Lunar fly-by. Except, at the top of LTO, the cubesat would be barely moving. Moon would sweep by and toss the cubesat out into interplanetary space going just a touch slower around the Sun than the Earth. Almost exactly a year later, Earth would catch up with the cubesat again. That\u0027s the Earth fly-by. If done correctly, that can toss the cubesat onto trajectory to intercept Mars. About half a year later, cubesat reaches Mars. Trajectory can be adjusted for Mars fly-by to have inclination that matches Phobos\u0027 orbit. A close fly-by allows aerobraking against Mars\u0027 atmosphere. That will take the cubesat from an escape trajectory to an orbit around Mars. A light boost at apoapsis would prevent further decay of the orbit. The most delicate part is the apoapsis itself, however. If it matches orbit of Phobos, the cubesat is already, effectively, on transfer orbit to Phobos. With a few adjustments and a bit of waiting, Phobos intercept is achieved. If all you want is Phobos fly-by or impact, you\u0027re basically there. If you want to orbit/land Phobos, you\u0027ll need to match its orbital velocity. From Mars transfer, that\u0027s 580m/s of delta-V. Total budget for lander/orbiter is under 1.5km/s from GTO to Phobos orbit.
