I\u0027ve been told by a few that an unofficially official part of the process for becoming one is that they will deny your application for like 5-10 years. The first few times without any word other than \u0022Nope.\u0022 and then progressively getting you further through the process, but still saying \u0022Nope.\u0022 each time. The reason for this being that they want people that won\u0027t give up if something looks hopeless. So if you can\u0027t deal with 10 years of rejection, no matter how hopeful things looked, you just aren\u0027t the sort of person they want in space that other people have to rely on."},{"CreatedByName":"GigaG","CreatedById":8013,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T21:52:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E In the early days of manned space program, scientists, pilots and program managers did not know what to expect.
