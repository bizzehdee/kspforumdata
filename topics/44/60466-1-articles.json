You suggest we have everything we need to land men on Mars and establish a base. That is completely false and will be for a long time. Just the simple problem of actually feeding the astronauts for the length of the entire mission (The almost year-long trip to Mars \u002B however much time they\u0027ll spend there \u002B the trip back) makes the entire mission many times more complicated then you suggest it is.
