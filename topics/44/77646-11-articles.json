Mostly because you have thousands rather than hundreds of km you can use for braking. With some reasonable shielding, it\u0027s survivable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EControl is a much bigger issue. Atmosphere isn\u0027t terribly predictable, and this is an extremely delicate maneuver. Still, you have about 30% of escape velocity for your error bars in general for a capture. This would require extendable heat shields that can be used in thinner atmosphere to increase drag, retracted in during passage through thicker atmo, where ablative shield in the front would be utilized, and extended again on exit. On exit, the shields/brakes can be extended more or less depending on how much velocity has been lost.
