The \u0022Goldilocks\u0022 zone is something of a myth too, or at least a rather well debunked idea. The initial idea was based on the assumption that all life as we knew it depended on the sun for energy. Get too far away and it would be impossible for it to exist. However, deep sea exploration proved all that wrong when we found entire ecosystems underwater in the pitch black, that were based on chemosynthesis. That discovery pretty much blew-apart the idea of planets needing to be in a special zone away from their star to possibly harbour life.

Boron has an affinity for ammonia as a solvent, and ammonia contains nitrogen, which can form covalent bonds with boron similar to carbon-carbon bonds. Boron can also form three-center two-electron bonds, increasing its potential to form complex molecules. Boron compounds are highly explosive on Earth, so a much colder planet is a better candidate for this type of life.

It is possible to have something resembling earth like life on a planet closer to its sun than mercury as long as the amount of water on the planet is very low; Such a planet would most likely be tidally locked to its parent star and life would probably inhabit a thin line on the border of the day and night sides of the planet where temperatures are low enough to facilitate the condensation of water.
