These engines, however, don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t need anywhere close to the energy of particle accelerators.

Hope is now often viewed as an emotion that only idiots have, especially when it flies in the face of logic. The change in attitude towards space travel over the decades is a perfect example. Star Trek was once accepted as a believable future for humanity. These days it\u0027s looked at no differently than magic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps another way of looking at it is, the definition of \u0022too good to be true\u0022 has shifted from \u0022news that seems ridiculously good\u0022 to \u0022news that doesn\u0027t seem to be bad.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-02T00:44:53Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2014 12:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by vger\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RuBisCO","CreatedById":59540,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-02T02:53:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECalled it! : \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86010-KSP-Community-CubeSat?p=1270596#post1270596\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86010-KSP-Community-CubeSat?p=1270596#post1270596\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerpenWolf","CreatedById":83222,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-02T05:11:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI defiantly think we can make an engine that just runs on electricity (we can probably get a tiny bit of thrust from launching electrons!) however an engine that requires no power input to run is likely bs.

The solution? Pull out an electric fan, point it at the sail, and watch it go. Of course, in that case, newton\u0027s laws kick in, and any wind the fan is blowing, cancels out what hits the sail, and the boat goes nowhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in space? Were you to aim a laser on the ship at the solar sail, you could conceivably make it move if the heat generated by the emitter was less than the radiation pressure on the sail. The laser itself won\u0027t produce thrust at all (if it did, we\u0027d be using lasers instead of ion drives). The concept should work. It\u0027s mostly a question of how efficient it can work. My laser example would require a ridiculous amount of power (which is why we\u0027d fire it from Earth if we ever wanted to use it).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
