First, there\u0027s modern BVR combat, where aircraft need to get into their weapons range, hopefully undetected, launch, risking revealing themselves, and bolt. That last part is crucial, because firing the weapons is when you\u0027re most likely to revel yourself, and if the enemy gets even an approximate fix on you, they can fire their stand-off munitions and let them acquire once they\u0027re a lot closer to you. And per the g-factors point, your odds of outmaneuvering a missile that got a firm lock on you are\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enot good\u003C/em\u003E. Of course, you have a variety of coutnermeasures, but by far best option is to simply not be in range of the missile heading towards you. You\u0027re firing your weapon in the direction you\u0027re heading, extending its range, and the enemy is, hopefully, not as lucky, and you can put some extra distance by flying fast in the opposite direction. If you\u0027re in a 160km range of a modern AIM-120D that will streak towards its target at mach 4, if the enemy returns fire with a similar weapon, and you\u0027ve been running at mach 2 the whole time, you\u0027d be around 240km away by the time it catches up to you, which means it probably won\u0027t. The risk you\u0027re running is any aircraft or ground launchers that are concealed from you and are closer than the intended target. If that concealed enemy\u0027s missile is still in that 160km / mach 4 ballpark, you need to be more than 105km from a potential counter-launch to be confident you\u0027ll outrun it. And that means you have a 55km margin of advantage. Not bad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is apparent once you start doing the math on the turning around and bolting part. At mach 2, pulling 5g the whole time, your turning radius is about 10km, and doing 180 takes about a minute and a half. By the time you finish your turn, you\u0027re basically the same distance from whatever could have answered, and their mach4 missile has advanced by 30km. Now, it\u0027s 30km out of its max range, but you have less time to run. The net effect is that it costs you about a third of that, 10km, in your margin. It\u0027s \u0022only\u0022 20%, and you still take it, because you still have a 45km advantage, but oh, how you wish you could turn faster. And maybe you do, take the risk, and pull the stick a little harder. After all, you could take a sustained turn at 6-7g in training, and even push into 8-9g in bursts. But is that something you can do in combat conditions? Sometimes pilots find out that they can\u0027t the hard way. Anything we could do to push that limit further out, is going to give your pilots an enormous edge and safety margin in modern air combat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that brings us to the second point. Drones. A drone operator is more likely to stay cool in combat, performing as well as they have in training, the drone can in theory take higher g load, and losing it isn\u0027t as bad as losing a plane and its pilot. It can still be expensive, but now you can play with the balance of cost-to-build vs survivability with both fewer moral conflicts and without running a risk of burning through your pilots too fast if the conflict gets hot. And we\u0027re seeing examples of all of this in practice, ranging from drones meant to perform the same functions as a jet fighter, to lighter drones performing CAS missions or serving as loitering munitions. And it sounds like we should just dump the piloted aircraft and go with drones for everything, but we\u0027re already seeing major limitations in real combat conditions. Communications in the battlefield can be spotty. We see a lot of effective uses of electronic countermeasures, particularly effective against long range drones. We\u0027ve seen everything from unreliable contractors cutting coms, to jammers ranging from ECM trucks to portable devices. A lot of this stuff has been largely theoretical until now, and the battlefield evolves really rapidly, but we\u0027re already seeing ECM measures around Moscow, for example, being very effective against long range drones that have no problems striking targets at that range in other parts of Russia. We\u0027re also seeing a bullseye painted on any control centers. They become priority targets for enemy strikes. If all of your trained pilots are sitting in one truck, even if they\u0027re far away from the combat, they are far easier to hit than if they\u0027re spread between multiple aircraft moving in the sky. If you have a reliable satellite link, maybe you can put your pilots far enough away, but even that depends on the nature of the conflict, and in practice, you often have to balance that against response times. As a result, the long range and marine drones are being controlled from central locations, but CAS and loitering munition drones are usually operated with the infantry or artillery units they\u0027re attached to, and so they\u0027re set up with their command, making them juicy targets for artillery and even ballistic missile strikes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027re still shifting more and more focus towards drones, but I don\u0027t think we\u0027re going to replace piloted aircraft any time soon, and so the ability to pull high g turns to get out of harm\u0027s way is still going to be very much desired. Anything we can do to improve that, people are going to be trying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224377974\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224370\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221712371812\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022197504\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spacescifi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 4/5/2024 at 7:50 PM, Spacescifi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was thinking about how we handle g-force better lying down on our backs, and how it probably would hurt a pilot\u0027s lower back in the sitting position when they pull a bunch of gees in a tight turn all of a sudden.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt really would be lying down for a plane, as its lift can push much harder than its thrust. But that\u0027s kind of part of the problem. For a turn, you want to lie down. Lets say we fix the problem of seeing from that position with displays. Engines on afterburner are still capable of more than 2gs. That\u0027s basically a guaranteed brown-out if you\u0027re flying feet first. Well, what if you fly head first? Now you have all sorts of safety issues while landing... And overall, just the fact that you might be accelerating or decelerating at a few g while also performing a high g turn means the angle has to adjust. Putting a full tilt bed in the plane sounds like a nightmare.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere I can see this working is space. Main rocket pushes you forward, and that\u0027s the thrust you get. It does give you that \u0022standing\u0022 position. And we see it recognized in sci-fi. The example I\u0027d use is Starfuries in Babylon 5. Whoever designed these, put a lot of thought into it. They have four main thrusters with a smaller reverse attached to each. They are placed in X-configuration on \u0022wings\u0022 (really just structural pilons), with more span horizontally than vertically. Why? Because just like with linear acceleration, rotation generates g forces on your body, and you can be spun around your vertical axis a lot faster than around any horizontal axis. So if you need to make a rapid turn, that\u0027s the direction you\u0027re going to go. That\u0027s where the realism in the show ends, as you\u0027re seeing these things engage in dogfights using projectile weapons. That is a lot more cinematic, of course, but we\u0027d still be dealing with BVR combat in space, if it ever becomes a thing, and you\u0027d have all of the considerations from the first part of this post coming up. The difference is that now you don\u0027t have air to play against. You can go as fast as you want, but you better have fuel left to slow down afterwards. And that\u0027s the same fuel you\u0027ll be burning doing any sharp turns. So now it\u0027s really a game of how fast you want to be trying to get out of a missile\u0027s range, and how hard you\u0027re prepared to maneuver once it catches up to you. How much is it keeping in reserves while \u0022playing dead\u0022 coasting towards you?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope we\u0027ll never find out. As much as wars suck, wars in space are going to suck more.

First, there\u0027s modern BVR combat, where aircraft need to get into their weapons range, hopefully undetected, launch, risking revealing themselves, and bolt. That last part is crucial, because firing the weapons is when you\u0027re most likely to revel yourself, and if the enemy gets even an approximate fix on you, they can fire their stand-off munitions and let them acquire once they\u0027re a lot closer to you. And per the g-factors point, your odds of outmaneuvering a missile that got a firm lock on you are\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enot good\u003C/em\u003E. Of course, you have a variety of coutnermeasures, but by far best option is to simply not be in range of the missile heading towards you. You\u0027re firing your weapon in the direction you\u0027re heading, extending its range, and the enemy is, hopefully, not as lucky, and you can put some extra distance by flying fast in the opposite direction. If you\u0027re in a 160km range of a modern AIM-120D that will streak towards its target at mach 4, if the enemy returns fire with a similar weapon, and you\u0027ve been running at mach 2 the whole time, you\u0027d be around 240km away by the time it catches up to you, which means it probably won\u0027t. The risk you\u0027re running is any aircraft or ground launchers that are concealed from you and are closer than the intended target. If that concealed enemy\u0027s missile is still in that 160km / mach 4 ballpark, you need to be more than 105km from a potential counter-launch to be confident you\u0027ll outrun it. And that means you have a 55km margin of advantage. Not bad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is apparent once you start doing the math on the turning around and bolting part. At mach 2, pulling 5g the whole time, your turning radius is about 10km, and doing 180 takes about a minute and a half. By the time you finish your turn, you\u0027re basically the same distance from whatever could have answered, and their mach4 missile has advanced by 30km. Now, it\u0027s 30km out of its max range, but you have less time to run. The net effect is that it costs you about a third of that, 10km, in your margin. It\u0027s \u0022only\u0022 20%, and you still take it, because you still have a 45km advantage, but oh, how you wish you could turn faster. And maybe you do, take the risk, and pull the stick a little harder. After all, you could take a sustained turn at 6-7g in training, and even push into 8-9g in bursts. But is that something you can do in combat conditions? Sometimes pilots find out that they can\u0027t the hard way. Anything we could do to push that limit further out, is going to give your pilots an enormous edge and safety margin in modern air combat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that brings us to the second point. Drones. A drone operator is more likely to stay cool in combat, performing as well as they have in training, the drone can in theory take higher g load, and losing it isn\u0027t as bad as losing a plane and its pilot. It can still be expensive, but now you can play with the balance of cost-to-build vs survivability with both fewer moral conflicts and without running a risk of burning through your pilots too fast if the conflict gets hot. And we\u0027re seeing examples of all of this in practice, ranging from drones meant to perform the same functions as a jet fighter, to lighter drones performing CAS missions or serving as loitering munitions. And it sounds like we should just dump the piloted aircraft and go with drones for everything, but we\u0027re already seeing major limitations in real combat conditions. Communications in the battlefield can be spotty. We see a lot of effective uses of electronic countermeasures, particularly effective against long range drones. We\u0027ve seen everything from unreliable contractors cutting coms, to jammers ranging from ECM trucks to portable devices. A lot of this stuff has been largely theoretical until now, and the battlefield evolves really rapidly, but we\u0027re already seeing ECM measures around Moscow, for example, being very effective against long range drones that have no problems striking targets at that range in other parts of Russia. We\u0027re also seeing a bullseye painted on any control centers. They become priority targets for enemy strikes. If all of your trained pilots are sitting in one truck, even if they\u0027re far away from the combat, they are far easier to hit than if they\u0027re spread between multiple aircraft moving in the sky. If you have a reliable satellite link, maybe you can put your pilots far enough away, but even that depends on the nature of the conflict, and in practice, you often have to balance that against response times. As a result, the long range and marine drones are being controlled from central locations, but CAS and loitering munition drones are usually operated with the infantry or artillery units they\u0027re attached to, and so they\u0027re set up with their command, making them juicy targets for artillery and even ballistic missile strikes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027re still shifting more and more focus towards drones, but I don\u0027t think we\u0027re going to replace piloted aircraft any time soon, and so the ability to pull high g turns to get out of harm\u0027s way is still going to be very much desired. Anything we can do to improve that, people are going to be trying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt really would be lying down for a plane, as its lift can push much harder than its thrust. But that\u0027s kind of part of the problem. For a turn, you want to lie down. Lets say we fix the problem of seeing from that position with displays. Engines on afterburner are still capable of more than 2gs. That\u0027s basically a guaranteed brown-out if you\u0027re flying feet first. Well, what if you fly head first? Now you have all sorts of safety issues while landing... And overall, just the fact that you might be accelerating or decelerating at a few g while also performing a high g turn means the angle has to adjust. Putting a full tilt bed in the plane sounds like a nightmare.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere I can see this working is space. Main rocket pushes you forward, and that\u0027s the thrust you get. It does give you that \u0022standing\u0022 position. And we see it recognized in sci-fi. The example I\u0027d use is Starfuries in Babylon 5. Whoever designed these, put a lot of thought into it. They have four main thrusters with a smaller reverse attached to each. They are placed in X-configuration on \u0022wings\u0022 (really just structural pilons), with more span horizontally than vertically. Why? Because just like with linear acceleration, rotation generates g forces on your body, and you can be spun around your vertical axis a lot faster than around any horizontal axis. So if you need to make a rapid turn, that\u0027s the direction you\u0027re going to go. That\u0027s where the realism in the show ends, as you\u0027re seeing these things engage in dogfights using projectile weapons. That is a lot more cinematic, of course, but we\u0027d still be dealing with BVR combat in space, if it ever becomes a thing, and you\u0027d have all of the considerations from the first part of this post coming up. The difference is that now you don\u0027t have air to play against. You can go as fast as you want, but you better have fuel left to slow down afterwards. And that\u0027s the same fuel you\u0027ll be burning doing any sharp turns. So now it\u0027s really a game of how fast you want to be trying to get out of a missile\u0027s range, and how hard you\u0027re prepared to maneuver once it catches up to you. How much is it keeping in reserves while \u0022playing dead\u0022 coasting towards you?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope we\u0027ll never find out. As much as wars suck, wars in space are going to suck more.
