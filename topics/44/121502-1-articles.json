For example I had exactly no clue how to make a 3D model before playing KSP, now of course Win 10 has a 3-d modeler, but its pretty crappy compared to blender. If I need to make a model of say a molecule now I could pretty easily do it, as long as the program which I send it to can handle blender.

This could be very important time saver in genetic engineering because previously you have to make a gene and see if it will fold or not, now you can stop the folding at the hold up point and (comparing native with engineered) see what is the major holdup in folding by manually moving a side-chain around. Of course if there is a neutral site that is blocking the folding, you can essentially co-transform the second site so that it accommodates the fold.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-23T21:37:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Elol, I was told that I could not present a link with out giving an opinion.
