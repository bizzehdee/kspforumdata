Females select big, strong, hard working, and faithful men to father their children. Conversely, men maximize their fitness by selecting women whom are younger, which means being more childlike. This is because younger women are going to be able to make more kids on average between the time of first copulation and menopause.

It has been shown that the type of male women select as a (potential mate) varies. When fertile, they tend to seek out stonger, more maschuline men, when looking for a longer term relationship and/or ge looking for someone to care for the children they generally look for softer, more caring traits. These, of course, are averages, but can be substantiated statistically. Some people don\u0027t really like these results, as they are a bit at odds with our cultural perception of what a child producing relationship should be and look like, but hey, it\u0027s how nature put it together. From a genetic/evolutionary point of view it actually makes quite a bit of sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease note that I am in no shape, way or form suggesting that women are inherently unfaithful.

All the others might or might not be true, depending on the story you wish to tell.

Any human from whatever culture will at a glance be able to tell that those are supposed to be the female counterpart of the male Kerbals we already know, presuming they are actually sexually reproducing creatures.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drunken Hobo","CreatedById":52000,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-04T02:10:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll say the same thing that I always say when female kerbals are discussed - I don\u0027t view kerbals as sexual beings.
