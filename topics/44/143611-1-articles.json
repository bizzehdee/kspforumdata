Anthropoid apes already had big and developed brains. Our cousins chimps use tools too, and learn how to do it from elder members of their group. It stands to reason australopithecs or even earlier forms already posessing brains comparable to chimpanzees knew how to use two stones to crack a nut.

They are tool-making, not just using.
