His math stated without them no thrust could be generated. The normal Cannae drive had the slots, the null-test device did not. So basically what happened was that they had one engine that was supposed to work, it did. They had another engine that was supposed to fail, it failed.

Instantaneous like how a lightbulb is \u0027instantaneous\u0027. Not physics breaking instant. Anyway, if the effect could not have been caused by the heating of atmosphere because if this were true you would have seen a delayed but gradual increase in thrust once activated (as the components warmed up to the power), followed by a delayed but gradual decrease in thrust after the engine was turned off. This gradual increase/decrease was not observed.

My personal shortlist of ordinary explanations:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Interactions with the Earth\u0027s magnetic field. Essentially, if you have a metal plate and put some AC through it and a magnetic field is present, the field is going to \u0022deflect\u0022 the current and cause eddies. Those will have a unidirectional magnetic moment (the magnetic field breaks time reversal symmetry, that\u0027s why this is allowed to happen), which then interacts with the magnetic field again and cause a torque.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Near field effects. Less likely because cavities even made out of paper-thin copper are quite good at completely containing GHz waves, and near field effects would require some radiation to escape. They\u0027d need to tunnel through leaky seams or escape via...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Vibrations. A very long shot, but there will be oscillating stress on the cavity walls.

Then the heated air does not escape immediately, it only escapes at a speed proportional to the pressure differential, which only slowly builds up as the temperature rises. And from what I read, the cavities of the Cannae thing are quite tightly sealed up, any holes would be tiny. So there would be a delayed response, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if thermal expansion produces thrust somehow here, there should be an opposite thrust while the device cools down.
