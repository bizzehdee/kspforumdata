Once the other two separated, all that had to be done to completely isolate the CMP from the rest of humanity was for the CSM to follow it\u0027s trajectory around to the far side, where radio signals from Earth, or from the astronauts on the near side, couldn\u0027t reach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/Images/StarChild/space_level2/apollo_csm_small.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022apollo_csm_small.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EOn one side of the Moon, this.

What would that make you feel, knowing you\u0027ll have to train so hard to only get 110km from the surface? How would you deal with the isolation? Would you worry about the say of your Moonwalker comrades, because remember, if they die down there, you would be the sole survivor. Or would getting a view of the Moon that not even the other two crewmembers will ever get help make you feel secure as a vital part of the mission?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rpayne88","CreatedById":58336,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T20:19:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECorrect me if I\u0027m wrong, but weren\u0027t they given the opportunity to return to the Moon on a future mission and land?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T20:36:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI recall reading that Mike Collins was offered a chance to command Apollo 17, but he chose to retire from the astronaut program instead. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I think it would be important to avoid the Buzz Aldrin trap...
