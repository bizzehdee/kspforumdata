What brings the cost down isn\u0027t reusability, it\u0027s demand. It will still be a while before a reusable spaceplane becomes cheaper than mass-produced disposable launchers.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t even know where to start with this. You\u0027re right that a spaceplane would be reasonably expensive to design but, by the same token, rocket designs don\u0027t just pop out of the ground either. Designing a new launch system is going to be relatively expensive whatever launch mechanism it uses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat makes space launch costs expensive, however, is related to number of launches in a couple of ways, by far the largest of which is manufacturing rocket components. There are costs related to actually operating each individiual launch but these are miniscule in comparison to the cost of manufacturing huge single-use spacecraft. It is frankly absurd to suggest that building and maintaining a reusable spaceplane would make it as expensive to operate as a disposable launch vehicle - indeed this is analoguous to suggesting that it would be somehow cost effective to use aeroplanes or cars once before disposing of them. The fact that a rocket is used less often is a factor but unless you\u0027re never going to use your new spaceplane more than 3 or 4 times, you\u0027re going to make a cost saving. If it spends most of its time in the hangar, that is still far more efficient than it spending all of its time being constructed before launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent average number of satellite launches per year is presently over 120 and increasing. The first operator of a reusable SSTO would have the opportunity to corner a significant percentage of this market thus it would not be unreasonable to imagine a fleet of 6-10 SSTO spaceplanes all performing hundreds of launches over a relatively modest 15 year lifetime meaning that each launch vehicle could still be profitable at a cost of $billions per unit. Of course, such a cost is unlikely, given that a plane-like launch is far more efficient in atmosphere than a rocket launch meaning that payload fraction would be vastly increased so the vehicle would end up being substantially smaller than other comparable launch vehicles - another point in favour of this design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an example, the Skylon launch vehicle has a projected unit cost of \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A3190 million, which is only marginally more than that of an Ariane 5 but is designed for use more than 200 times. It\u0027s simply crazy to suggest that we wouldn\u0027t see a massive fall in the cost of payload delivery from such a system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerekL1963","CreatedById":57091,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T17:59:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fuzzy Dunlop\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fuzzy Dunlop\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you can launch more cheaply and reguarly then you can get away with a cheap, shoddy satellite.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly, this isn\u0027t even remotely the case.

After all, for what a shuttle launch really cost (500-1,500 million depending on who you ask and how you measure), you can do a lot of stuff. As to the specific Soyuz numbers... well, there\u0027s this problem with Soyuz, which one you pick? Are we counting the differences in launchers, model, etc? And Progress? What about the satellite launches by the same family of boosters, do those count as Soyuz payloads?

Specialized tugs for orbital repair and resupply without getting humans in danger and increasing cost. Even, thinking on the future for when you have the basic stuff covered economically, it might be nice to have reusable upper stages to move the other stuff around, standardized station modules to establish systems of depots. Habs to endure the travel between them, and the landers and surface systems when we eventually get somewhere. A complete toolbox, in other words, instead of a swiss army knife. It would undoubtedly end up being cheaper for the results whatever you are after, IMO, and every piece is useful on its own. Not to mention each can be developed without \u0022taking a decade out\u0022 on manned spaceflight, or without having your whole budget for manned spaceflight revolving around a single item, proudly self-declared \u0022the most complex piece of machinery of all times\u0022.
