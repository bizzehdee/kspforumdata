Notice that it\u0027s the only medium rocket Russia uses, they simply don\u0027t need anything else. Proton, though many small iterations, also went from an unreliable mess to a rocket that fails about once in 30 years. Those always formed the backbone of Soviet Space program, and continue in Russian one. Many other designs (including Zenit and small, ICBM-based launchers) were created via iterative design. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and US has some examples, too, namely Atlas, Delta and (to a lesser extent) Titan.
