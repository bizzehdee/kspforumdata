If we crack the FTL egg within a couple of decades (optimistic, yet possible), no one would wait for us to start mining the asteroid belt. The public, once informed of the possibility to get to the nearest star and back within a month, would most likely get behind a project to build such a ship. Rockets would carry materials into space, the ship would be constructed, and then depart.

That\u0027s a third of the time it would take a VASMIR propelled Mars mission to just get to Mars. Even if it was just a simple land and return, that\u0027s all we would need to ignite the public interest. \u0022first man to walk on another planet around another star\u0022 \u0022(insert astronauts name), faster than the fastest man alive!\u0022\u0022Star Trek: it\u0027s no longer fiction\u0022 All of those headlines have quite a ring to them.
