They found water vapor (~100 ppm), but no methane or carbon dioxide (upper limits on concentrations unclear). The measurements also pinned down the mass and orbit a bit better, (inclination frustratingly close to transiting, ~0.476 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E making it more Saturn-like, and no eccentricity to speak of) Rotational speed is \u0026lt;5.8 km/s, so for any plausible radius the sidereal days are longer than Jupiter\u0027s.
