Because it had what strikes me as a very Kerbal cause--someone miswired the connection between the guidance system (which worked perfectly) and the thrust vectoring gimbal servoes (which worked perfectly), so when it started leaning a little to the left after liftoff, the guidance system said, \u0022hey, turn right,\u0022 and the gimbal heard \u0022hey, turn left,\u0022 so it did, and the guidance system started saying \u0022right, right, RIGHT!\u0022 louder and louder, and the gimbal was hearing left all the way, and soon, it was hard over to the left because that\u0027s what the commands it received said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe runner-up is a fairly famous clip of an Atlas in ICBM configuration being launched where it oozes off the pad slowly and sort of drunkenly wobbles its way into the sky for the first few seconds, before it has some speed built up and straightens up and flies right... and then one of the booster engines undergoes rapid unplanned disassembly, and it ever so slowly tips over to that side, finally ending up at about 90 degrees to the flightpath and completely enveloped in its own exhaust plume before they send the Destruct command. That one strikes me as Kerbal for three reasons. First, you wouldn\u0027t believe the number of boosters I\u0027ve had seemingly fly just fine until they get to some point in the burn, the CG versus CP geometry changes, and it starts tumbling. Second, that drunken wobbly stagger off the pad just feels like something that Jeb would build. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the third, and biggest, reason it feels Kerbal to me is the cause of the entire accident. One of the launch clamps released something like a quarter-second after it was supposed to--and after the other one did release. This caused the whole vehicle to rotate just enough that it partially crushed the booster engine on the OTHER side against its launch clamp, leaving it generating only about half thrust--hence the slow acceleration and drunken wobble off the pad, due to a low TWR and thrust asymmetry. (In the closeups of the aft end of the rocket at launch, you can see the verniers frantically correcting for the asymmetry.) The rocket managed to survive liftoff, and might have been able to compensate for the reduced thrust with a longer booster burn time, but when the damaged booster engine finally ruptured and destroyed itself, the thrust asymmetry was more than the verniers could handle (though they damned well TRIED to--notice how slowly it tipped over!) and it finally tumbled. (Side note: the guidance people were ECSTATIC at that flight\u0027s results, because not only was it not THEIR fault, for once, but they could prove that their system fought the good fight right up to the very end, nearly saving the mission and definitely saving the launch pad\u0027s support equipment by getting it up to about T\u002B30 seconds before the tumble... and still fought the end even after the booster engine exploded and the mission was doomed. \u0022Well, OUR part worked far BEYOND what it was supposed to! Hooray!\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, in that case, a multi-million dollar test missile was destroyed by a slightly sticky holddown clamp.

The problem caused 2 fatal crashes before the NTSB had enough cross-referenced information from all of them to work out the real cause of it. If the temperature in the tail oscillated between freezing and warming too quickly, as might happen when descending from high altitudes very fast to avoid bad weather or turbulence, a mechanical servo controlling the rudder could seize up, and then finally come free again, BUT when it came free, in some rare cases it could came free with inverted behavior. The effect was that when the pilot pushes right rudder, the plane actually gives left rudder, and visa versa. They\u0027d correct a drift to one side, discover that it\u0027s drifting more to that side, so they\u0027d try to correct harder, and it would be drifting more, then the plane would stall out and spin and they\u0027d try to pull out of the spin using the standard textbook technique - give hard opposite rudder to stop the spin, while diving to get speed back. But the whole time their attempt to stop the spin was actually the cause of the spin because of the inverted rudder controls. The investigators had a hard time discovering the problem because all the electronic recorded data seemed to indicate that the pilots were deliberately causing their own accidents, and just flying very stupidly. (The black boxes were recording the actual position of the rudder, rather than the position of the pilot\u0027s controls, so the fact that the rudder was moving opposite of the rudder pedals wasn\u0027t discovered.) The NTSB, as usual, was quick to blame the pilots assuming they were just morons who don\u0027t know how to pull out of a stall spin. It wasn\u0027t until a third incident in which the problem happened at a higher altitude, and the problem righted itself again before the plane ran out of altitude so the pilot was able to pull out of it and land, that they found out what was happening (because now they had a live pilot to interview).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was a recall and the faulty part was replaced on all 737\u0027s, but there had been a long window of time for several years when the problem existed and nobody knew about it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-19T10:59:21Z\u0022 title=\u002201/19/2014 10:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Steven Mading\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Axder","CreatedById":57767,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-19T12:11:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell for me its space shutle made by Top Gear crew.
