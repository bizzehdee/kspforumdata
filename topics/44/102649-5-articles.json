Einstein was wrong about the speed of light being the same, because what if there\u0027s a conveyor? Subtract the speed of the conveyor from C and you get the real truth.

Though, it will carry on at that speed for quite some time before slowing down significantly, sure.

An *accelerating* belt can exert quite a bit of force on an airplane, because of the wheels\u0027 moment of inertia. Which is precisely what the belt has to do if it\u0027s too constantly match airplane\u0027s wheel rotation speed. It will be accelerating.\n\nIf we simply take the \u0022myth\u0022 at its wording, and assume that speed is measured same way as for the car, so we require that belt speed always matches rotation of the landing gear, we can actually solve this constraint problem, so long as we assume real wheel with real moment of inertia. The solution, however, produces quite insane acceleration for the belt. Something like 10g for an ultralight at full throttle, and even much higher for larger planes.\n\nBut if our only requirements is that we match the \u0022myth\u0022 briefly, this is feasible to set up for a light plane, and an accelerated belt would, in fact, keep the plane completely stationary despite engine running at full power. Very briefly. Then the relative speed between plane and conveyor belt will get above safe limits, landing gear will disintegrate, and you\u0027ll destroy the plane. Or more plausibly, you\u0027ll run out of juice in whatever it was that you used to yank the belt from under the plane. Either way, the whole thing will last a few seconds tops."},{"CreatedByName":"mrfox","CreatedById":69277,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T17:04:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E After that I\u0027ll probably end up working in South Africa flying Caravans.\n\nThat doesn\u0027t sound half bad to me!"},{"CreatedByName":"0111narwhalz","CreatedById":110660,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-13T17:25:20Z","Content":"Look at it this way: To what does each vehicle apply its reaction?

The exact method is, yes, for various reasons, but a seaplane in a moving water stream can easily be prevented from lifting off, *without* destroying its pontoons. A typical \u0022flying boat\u0022 design can plow through water easily enough that it may as well be a speedboat if you take away its wings.
