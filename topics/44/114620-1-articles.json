Obviously, to get an optimistic timeframe given current funding you would need to push the whole thing back a few decades, but actually the concepts themselves are very, very detailed and very, very interesting in my opinion. It gives real numbers to my dreams, and I like that ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nAfter the SLS Initial Test (2018), the SEP demo (2020?), Orion\u0027s first (2021?) and second (2023?) crewed flight, two Mars-simulation missions in cislunar space (2025-2027?) and a robotic EDL test (2026?) the real Mars mission could start.\n\n![figure4.jpeg](http://online.liebertpub.com/na101/home/literatum/publisher/mal/journals/content/space/2015/space.2015.3.issue-2/space.2015.0018/20150616/images/large/figure4.jpeg)\n\nThe Phobos manned mission described requires 4 SLS launches:\n\n1. First, a 100 kWE SEP Tug, a Phobos Transfer Stage (PTS) and a Trans-Earth Injection stage (TEI).\n2. Second, another SEP Tug, this time with a Phobos Habitat module\n3. Third, a Deep Space Habitat (DSH) and a Mars Orbiter Insertion (MOI) stage into High Earth Orbit (HEO), where it will await crew\n4. Fourth, an Orion crew module (CM) with 4 crew members to be launched in HEO to dock with Launch #3 payload. The Exploration Upper Stage (EUS) would then ferry the whole thing through trans-Mars Injection (TMI). Transit time: 200-250 days\n\nThe modules would then be assembled in High Mars Orbit (HMO). The CM would separate from the DHS and the TEI stage would separate from the PTS, allowing the DHS and the TEI stage to be docked together and stay in HMO. The rest all docks together and spends 300 days on Phobo\u0027s surface, shielding from 50% or so of the radiation. After that, the modules can meet back with the TEI stage in HMO, and, after a 200-250 day cruise, the crew can reenter on Earth inside the CM.\n\n![figure9.jpeg](http://online.liebertpub.com/na101/home/literatum/publisher/mal/journals/content/space/2015/space.2015.3.issue-2/space.2015.0018/20150616/images/large/figure9.jpeg)\n\nThe Mars Mission would instead require 6 SLS launches:\n\n1. 4.5 years before the Crew Launch, a 100 kWe SEP Tug would be launched with a TEI stage. In 3.8y it would reach HMO.\n2. Half a year later, another 100 kWe SEP Tug would bring a DSH resupply module and a MAV(Mars Ascent Vehicle)-to-HMO(High Mars Orbit) boost stage into HMO in 3.5 year\u0027s time.\n3. 1.5 years later, a 2-man lander would be launched to loiter in HEO.\n4. Half a year later, the upper stage (EUS) is launched and docked with the Lander. They are later aero-captured in HMO and the Lander docks with the TEI Stage (Launch #1) and the DSH resupply module.\n5. 1.5 years later, a DSH together with a MOI stage are launched and loiter in HEO.\n6. Finally, 4-crew Orion and an upper stage (EUS) launch toward HEO, where they dock with the DSH\u002BMOI stage of Flight #5.\n\nAfterwards, DSH\u002BMOI\u002BCM\u002BEUS from Flights #5 \u0026 6 perform TMI burn and reach HMO in 200-250 days. Here, the CM and the DSH dock with the TEI\u002BDSH resupply\u002BLander from previous flights. Two of the four crew members move into the Lander and depart for Mars\u0027 surface. \n\nThe Mars Lander is a 12 m diameter traditional entry vehicle with heat shield andno parachutes or deployable aerodynamic decelerators. At about Mach 2, supersonic retro-propulsion (SRP) rockets would be ignited to perform the final descent and landing. Supersonic retro-propulsion has been validated to some extent by Space in their flight tests to return their first stage boosters for reuse. The propellants in this concept would be MMH and MON-25, using current technology pump-fed engines similar to the RS-725 or the Proton 3rd stage engine. The lander would have about a 75-ton entry mass and deliver a useful landed payload mass of about 23\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0t. Peak deceleration during EDL would be 6.4 g, touchdown would occur at \u003C5 m/s.\n\nAfter a 24 day stay, the MAV brings back the two men/women into LMO (Low Mars Orbit). Finally, the MAV-to-HMO boost stage of Flight #2, which had reached LMO previously, after having undocked from the DSH Resupply module. The MAV-to-HMO boost stage brings them back to HMO, where they dock, meet with the rest of the crew and perform TEI back to Earth.\n\nI know it\u0027s just sci-fi currently, but to me it looks (from a technological point of view only) very feasible. It would be cool to see this done in KSP ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) What do you guys think of it?\n\nThe whole thing, with even more info, figures and tables, [can be found here](http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/space.2015.0018)."},{"CreatedByName":"epoca","CreatedById":136475,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T00:52:41Z","Content":"Very cool and informative!
