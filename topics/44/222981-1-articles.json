Thus the reason for crewed space warships being so common in scifi. On the other hand drone vessels operating under the command of one or just a few crewed vessels would seem to give the best of both worlds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it\u0027s not that simple since both designs have costs and advantages.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCrewed Vessel Advantages: Can make judgement calls... especially when it goes beyond the scope of the original mission, something a robo-mind or machine would never do unless it thought like a human. Also humans can make minor ship repairs on the go (fix leaks or patch hull damage). Lower cost of ship construction, as it is understood crew will do regular maintenence on vessel to keep it in it\u0027s best operating condition.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCrewed Vessel Disadvantages: Increased operating cost due to the crew being on board. Also crew can die.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDrone/Robot Vessel Advantages: Decreased operating cost due to no living people aboard that you have to pay or risk losing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDrone/Robot Vessel Disadvantages: Increased ship building costs, as the ship will need to be built more reliable as it has no crew to do routine maintenence. This may lead to to a smaller automated fleet as opposed to a crewed one, or at the very least a less maintained one, since crewed vessels will be doing a lot more maintenence on their vessels than robot ships that either won\u0027t or only do the bare minimum. Meaning crewed vessels over multi-month missions would perform better than the robo-vessels that cannot do routine maintenence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther Question: What kind of maintenence on a spaceship (especially a scifi kind or close) would having a crew be ideal for? My guess is for patching leaks and replacing mechanical parts BEFORE they totally fail and etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is for vessels that will spend months away from base without ressupply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess the closest analog are navy nuclear powered USA warships. But the big difference with outer space is the environment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only regular maintenence you need on a crewed space vessel is life support, propulsion, and weapons to make sure they still work or work properly. Probably less wear and tear since outer space is not like the ocean nor does it have waves crashing into the hull.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA robot vessel has no life support, but any wear and tear done to any part of it\u0027s propulsion or weapon or sensor systems is unlikely to be repaired.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond Question: What parts on a robot vessel will wish they had a crew to maintain them over the months and begin to wear out faster than if they had a crew to do regular maintenence?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-01-14T05:13:17Z\u0022 title=\u002201/14/2024 05:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jan 14\u0022\u003EJanuary 14\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-14T08:28:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you put your finger on it within the first two sentences.

Of course they could carry drone ships to do that. I think most classic SF got computers very wrong, and while having people as crew creates drama, computers realistically control virtually all aspects of space combat. The extreme case might be the Culture series ship minds. People are always involved in the stories, but the nitty gritty space combat is done by ships/Minds, not manually by people\u2014who are relegated in combat to man to man (man to mind or knife missiles, etc) in small scale actions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a digression, but I always felt that the droids in Star Wars were a source of cool plot options vs the idiotic way the whole series of films in fact went. They are clearly AGI, and have full agency. No reason not to have the droids fly the starfighters, etc. A great place for plot there would be to have them revolt against their clear enslavement.

With lots of space (har har), what\u0027s the incentive for warfare? Habitable worlds? That would probably be species-dependent, what\u0027s habitable to US, might be awful for some aliens. Resources? Loads of useful stuff in the universe, is any solar system that much better than another for rare Earths, water, carbon, etc?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. What is the goal of warfare (relates to #1)? Secure a world intact for colonization/resources? Secure a region of a solar system for resource extraction? Secure something else intact\u2014say special regions that allow FTL (#3)? Genocide (who cares about resources, we want to wreck entire worlds, Death Star style (or just some object with high velocity relative to c thrown at a world)!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. What is the FTL in this universe (or is that not a thing)? This would presumably drive the nature of encounter battles (assuming some rationale in #1/2).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3a. Continuous FTL (Star Trek, Known Space books (Niven))?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3b. Stargates (2001, Babylon 5, etc)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3c. \u0022Jump\u0022 drives (traveller RPG, Star Wars, etc\u2014enter hyperspace some time increment later you appear elsewhere)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3d. Something else?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. The methods above can have rules, like traveller does\u2014FTL doesn\u0027t work where space is sufficiently curved (gravity wells), so ships exit FTL some distance from worlds, then travel in normal space. Same can be done with stargates\u2014either they can\u0027t be built in certain places (because plot-device physics), or they might be a sort of quasi-natural thing, where \u0022hyperspace/subspace/whatever\u0022 is only accessible in discrete regions of space\u2014making those chokepoints and hence valuable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll the above relate to drones (or AI) vs crewed vehicles. If people (using this broadly to include all sentient races in the universe) need to get someplace\u2014to and from places where people can live, etc\u2014then those crewed vehicles are possible targets, and might have to have military capability. Of course they could carry drone ships to do that. I think most classic SF got computers very wrong, and while having people as crew creates drama, computers realistically control virtually all aspects of space combat. The extreme case might be the Culture series ship minds. People are always involved in the stories, but the nitty gritty space combat is done by ships/Minds, not manually by people\u2014who are relegated in combat to man to man (man to mind or knife missiles, etc) in small scale actions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a digression, but I always felt that the droids in Star Wars were a source of cool plot options vs the idiotic way the whole series of films in fact went.
