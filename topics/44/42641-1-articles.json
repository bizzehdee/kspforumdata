From a physics stand point this concept is very strange to me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Let\u0027s imagine for example that you put a wind turbine on the side of an acceding rocket. The turbine will generate a lot of electricity from rushing through the air, however this electricity is harvested from the force of the rockets momentum and manifests in the form of extra drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith solar energy there is no question as it comes from the sun burning itself out over a long period of time and that energy is being produced whether or not we make use of it. However with wind turbines, wouldn\u0027t their be an inherent slow down of wind that impacts the turbines? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif energy cannot be created or destroyed then converting the kinetic energy of the wind to electricity might cause some kind of inherent effects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGranted these effects would be much less than what is caused by a large square building. I am not trying to preach about save the world or anything, I am just generally curious about the physics of it. Is wind and weather slimier to solar in that that energy is being used regardless of our exploitation of it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(side note)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I hope one day to have a form of green generator for the sake of saving on my power bill.. my word power companies are expletive!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E also solar energy relies on using solar power to knock electrons from the solar cell? if this is the case wont a solar cell become depleted after a while, as the positive ions begin to outnumber the available uncharged atoms of the crystal structure?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-15T20:35:38Z\u0022 title=\u002208/15/2013 08:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by fancycat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"drakesdoom","CreatedById":57297,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T20:32:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn all reality wind turbines are harvesting solar energy that has already been converted into kinetic energy known as wind by the weather patterns of the earth which are established by the uneven heating of the air by the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kimberly","CreatedById":71980,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T20:33:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Wind energy\u0022 is basically the use of kinetic energy.

All renewable sources ultimately come from the Sun, so as long as the Sun burns and remains cool enough (so for at least another billion years). Wind is generated by the Sun heating up the ground, causing air to convect, and Turbines tap into that constantly replenished source of energy. So really, renewable energies are not a form of perpetual movement. Just extremely long duration movement.
