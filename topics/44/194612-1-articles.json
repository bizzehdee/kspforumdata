By messing with FTL.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nConsider that if you had an FTL jump drive, what if you HAD to match the speed and trajectory of the mass you wanted to jump near before jumping?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOtherwise you waste some of the ship\u0027s energy reserves and do not jump, also somewhat decreasing your jump range as well \u00A0Let\u0027s say you had a 1000 LY jump drive, so a failed attempt at jumping to Proxima Centauri would lose about 4 LY of your jump bank for nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can jump however close or far you want... so long you do it in space only.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo the consequences are: Now you have to somehow calculate... or let\u0027s be real, let your computer calculate the ACTUAL speed and trajectory of stars lightyears away whose light is several years out of date.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think we CAN do that even now. The calcuations, but obviously daisy chaining small jumps is the best way to navigate, as the farther out a star is the harder it becomes for a computer to calculate it\u0027s realtime speed and trajectory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fictional constant acceleration 1g or higher drive shows it\u0027s real worth here, since now you need it to adjust for speeds and trajectories or else you will never be able to FTL jump.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConveniently, this a least partially solves the WMD problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince an FTL warp drive with constant 1g acceleration means you can spend a year reaching 99% lightspeed and then FTL warp to Earth, drop out of warp on a collision course with Earth and boom! Devastation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy jump drive solution as presented means matching speed and trajectory real-time, so even if you jumped into low planetary orbit you would only fall straight down... hardly relativistic WMD.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suppose if one wanted to be nasty they could jump a LY away, and spend about a year accelerating toward Earth for a colision course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven so, that provides preparation time for the defending planet if tech levels are equalized.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurthermore it only takes a few vessels, maybe even one to jump along the madly accelerating ships course and chuck out debris in it\u0027s path.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDefending vessel\u0027s will likely jump using the home solar system\u0027s star as a point of trajectory and speed reference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt those incredible collision speeds, the attacking ship is very likely to die from literally flying at relativistic speeds into debris that is stationary relative to itself (much as the sun is compared to it\u0027s orbiting \u0027children\u0027).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nQuestion: How hard is it to calculate the real-time trajectory and speed of a star in real life that is lightyears away? Can it be done with high accuracy, likely diminishing the farther out one tries to calculate?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike Proxima Centauri is quite doable, but trying to calculate a star\u0027s real-time speed/trajectory a hundred LY out?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProbably harder... maybe not impossible though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat do you know of this subject?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-06-10T04:50:17Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2020 04:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-10T06:02:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe velocity of star moving towards or away from you is easy. We can watch the lines in spectrum of a star caused by\u00A0various atoms in the star\u0027s atmosphere and measure its relative velocity to within a few centimeters per second in some cases based on red/blue shift. We do that to find planets, so that\u0027s a solved problem. Measuring transverse velocity... Well, that\u0027s a whole another problem. Essentially, without visiting the star, you just watch it for a very long time and see how it moves in the sky. Precision on that is bad and gets worse with distance.\u00A0Speaking of distance, we have the exact opposite problem. We can measure direction to the star extremely precisely, but outside of nearby stars where we can get pretty close with parallax, measuring distances to stars involves a lot of very rough estimates. Often, best we can do is watch an entire cluster of stars, assume they move at orbital speed on average, and use that to estimate distance from galactic center, then extrapolate the rest.\u00A0So if you just pick a star from catalog that\u0027s a few hundred light years away, you can aim at it well enough to pass within its planetary system, so long as you don\u0027t take more than a few years getting there, but if you have to know the distance in advance, you\u0027ll drop out of FTL nowhere near it. In fact, you\u0027re more likely to be closer to some other star than the one you were going to when you drop out of FTL - that\u0027s how bad some of our distance measurements are.\u00A0And if you can detect the approach and time jumping out, you still won\u0027t be able to correct for velocity difference reliably, and can have as much as a few kilometers per second of unaccounted difference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe situation improves drastically for stars you can visit. Pulsar navigation we\u0027ve been able to test lets you measure your position in the entire galaxy to within a few kilometers of absolute error. Drop a satellite in orbit of a remote star, compare its readings to the one on Earth, and you\u0027ll know the relative velocity of the system\u0027s barycenter with as much precision as you likely to ever need. If you kept track of the reference pulsars all\u00A0the way to the star, you will know the location to within a few kilometers as well. Once you have local neighborhood mapped, keeping the positions and velocities up to date, and even accounting for gravitational interaction is not that hard.\u00A0That gives you enough precision to\u00A0FTL directly into low orbit of a charted planet anywhere in Milky Way if you cared to. And again, the navigation bit\u00A0is existing technology that we\u0027re not using only because GPS-like approach is even more precise within our immediate neighborhood, and that\u0027s all we get to play with. So for charted stars, this is a solved problem. Except for FTL itself, of course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah, if you\u0027re trying to come up with fiction reasons why you can\u0027t go to ramming speed, then FTL into a populated planet, effectively nuking it from safe distance and without warning, this works, so long as you have a workaround for exploration. Perhaps, requiring multiple iterative measurements and jumps to get to a star you\u0027ve never been too before, dialing in correct position and velocity as you get more information. Nobody said getting to a star has to be easy the first time you\u0027re going there, so long as it\u0027s still possible to get there within some reasonable time and you can establish convenient routes once it\u0027s been properly explored, which this limitations seems to fit well with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know where to even begin coming up with a physics explanation for why FTL might work this way, but meh.

Maybe this isn\u0027t total nonsense even from perspective of physics. Something like Alcubierre Drive gets capricious when moving near a massive body. Math on this is a little beyond me, but the short version is that conservation laws still exist, and for Alcubierre Drive to move along arbitrary trajectory, it has to radiate gravitational waves, meaning you\u0027ll either be losing an absurd amount of energy or will be forced to drop out, unless, of course, you travel along a trajectory that still conserves relevant orbital elements.\u00A0The caveat is that it\u0027s nothing as simple as \u0022you need to match target\u0027s velocity\u0022, because what you\u0027re really doing is matching orbits, and I\u0027m pretty sure orbital strike via Alcubierre would still be quite possible.

Rather, it would simply look these up in a publicly available star catalog. You are at X, you want to go to Y, so the navigation computer will pull out all relevant numbers from its database in a split second. The work for measuring these was done by someone else - someone who can do these kinds of measurements far more precisely than your ship ever could.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis kind of activity is called \u003Cem\u003Eastrometry\u003C/em\u003E. Compared to \u003Cem\u003Eastronomy\u003C/em\u003E, which studies the objects it looks at, astrometry missions are much rarer. But every once in a while, we launch one, or we repurpose an older telescope for an all-sky survey in order to re-check or improve our measurements. Astrometry datasets are the foundation of almost all astronomy work, as they let scientists accurately plan and put into context their specific object obervations. Currently, we have one dedicated astrometry mission out there: the European Space Agency\u0027s Gaia mission. I heartily recommend you look that one up - how it works, what its goals are, what it has achieved so far, and the absurd computational effort that stands behind the data it transmits.

That last one, of course, assumes that such space exists, and that we can create localized wormholes to enter and exit it.

Unless you\u0027re getting into a lot of specifics of how said FTL works in the first place, that doesn\u0027t seem relevant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: You know? Maybe this isn\u0027t total nonsense even from perspective of physics. Something like Alcubierre Drive gets capricious when moving near a massive body. Math on this is a little beyond me, but the short version is that conservation laws still exist, and for Alcubierre Drive to move along arbitrary trajectory, it has to radiate gravitational waves, meaning you\u0027ll either be losing an absurd amount of energy or will be forced to drop out, unless, of course, you travel along a trajectory that still conserves relevant orbital elements.\u00A0The caveat is that it\u0027s nothing as simple as \u0022you need to match target\u0027s velocity\u0022, because what you\u0027re really doing is matching orbits, and I\u0027m pretty sure orbital strike via Alcubierre would still be quite possible. In fact, it might be easier than hitting parking orbit. But at least that\u0027s some sort of real physics motivation for why it\u0027s not complete malarkey. Maybe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI love these kinds of questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo here\u0027s an idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you jump from one point to another, you are not just changing position. You\u0027re also changing a lot of other things. You\u0027re going from one gravitational potential to another and from one gravitational gradient to another. Remember that every massive objects exists inside a gravitational potential well with a particular depth (potential) and a particular slope (gradient). Together, they give you the vis-visa equation, which tells you how much specific mechanical energy the object has.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s also the underlying velocity of the gravitational potential well, since the object you\u0027re orbiting is itself moving through space. This isn\u0027t an issue if you are jumping from one orbit to another around the same object, but if you are jumping between objects (say, from Earth to Jupiter), then you have to model the whole thing as the superposition of the two planetary gravitational fields WITHIN the solar gravitational field.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to jump from one star system to another, then you have to model it as the superposition of the two stellar gravitational fields within the galactic gravitational field.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo use this in the story to limit FTL -- you can say that the hyperdrive/jumpdrive/etc. can only execute a jump that crosses two spheres of influence. So you can jump from one planet to another, but not from a moon of one planet directly to another planet. You can jump from one star system to another, but not from one\u00A0planet directly to another star system.\u00A0\u00A0You can jump from Ganymede to Europa but you cannot jump from a random Jovian orbit to Europa. You can also say that the energy requirements for any jump depend on the difference in the vis-visa energies of the two orbits,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Etaking into account\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0all involved gravitational fields.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example: if you want to jump from a low lunar orbit to an orbit around Titan, you\u0027d first have to use regular chemical propulsion to burn out of lunar orbit until you were free.
