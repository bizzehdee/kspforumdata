Torque is essentially a moment so if you just want a snapshot we can use the moment formula which is simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoment/torque = Force x Perpendicular distance\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCS has a strength of 1KN. Assuming you have a simple setup and mount 4 radially on a 1.25m diamter part and make it spin in a circle. Take the distance from centre (radius so that\u0027s 0.625m here) x Force of 1KN x 4 (because there are 4 thrusters). You would end up with 2.5 KNm of torque if you tried to roll. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReaction wheels are easier. It lists torque in the description and assuming your craft doesn\u0027t bend like a banana you can directly compare your RCS torque with the value for reaction wheels regardless of placement. The cheapest reaction wheel for example has 8KNm of torque so for your 1.25m part the reaction wheel would be stronger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that reaction wheels don\u0027t scale with size or placement. If we bump the core part up to 2.5m then reaction wheels stay the same but RCS gives (1KN x 1.25m x 4) 5KNm but RCS is very similar that cheap reaction wheel on the 3.75m parts (1KN x 1.875m x 4 = 7.5KNm). Stick your RCS on arms out from the main body and roll-torque goes through the roof. Have sets of thrusters at each end of a long craft and you\u0027ll flip end over end much quicker with RCS than reaction wheels (same formula applies but now you\u0027re measuring length of craft between thrusters and CoM) for. On the flip side reaction wheels are simpler both in placement and logistics of operation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-30T16:18:45Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2014 04:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MarkyJ279\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
