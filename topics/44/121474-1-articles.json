Without hydrogen-containing fuels, your only option for orbital launch is running an NTR off nitrogen or CO2, which gives you ISP in the 500s IIRC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, this means that a Mars surface colony with sufficient infrastructure can send stuff into Martian orbit and back to Earth with a fleet of reusable SSTOs, or even mass drivers (harder on Mars than the moon, but its atmosphere is pretty thin which makes it easier to fling stuff to hypersonic speeds at the surface without it disintegrating). This is unlikely to be possible on Venus without exotic drive systems like gas-core NTRs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RuBisCO","CreatedById":59540,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-23T14:51:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell Venus does have H2SO4, that can be made into water easily.
