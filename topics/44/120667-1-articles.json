It has ti do something with the fact that if the holes don\u0027t fill current falls and the layers can degrade. My understanding is 30 years old so .......\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.crystec.com/klldope.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.crystec.com/klldope.htm\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts sort of like pipe dope, you use pipe dope between two milled ends of the pipe because although the pipe will pass liquid, when its not flowing without the dope in the threads, the pipe will leak. Not only is this messy, but it causes erosion of the threads and will make the problem worse. So being a dope in a leaky world is a good thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
