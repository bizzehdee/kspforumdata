A flow initiated by salty water (brine) could rearrange grains or change surface roughness in a way that darkens the appearance. How the features brighten again when temperatures drop is harder to explain.[10][16]\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe seasonality, latitude distribution and brightness changes strongly indicate a volatile material \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACsuch as water\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC is involved, but there is no direct detection of one. Some hypotheses on the formation of these features have been proposed. One hypothesis is that RSL could form by rapid heating of nocturnal frost.[12] Another one proposes flows of carbon dioxide, but the settings in which the flows occur are too warm for carbon-dioxide frost (CO\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2), and at some sites is too cold for pure water.[12] Other hypotheses include dry granular flows, but no entirely dry process can explain seasonal flows that progressively grow over weeks and months.[15] Seasonal melting of shallow ice would explain the RSL observations, but it would be difficult to replenish such ice annually.[15]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe leading hypothesis involves the flow of brines \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACvery salty water.[17][13][18][14][19][20] Salt deposits over much of Mars indicate that brine was abundant in Mars\u0027s past.[10][16] Salinity lowers the freezing point of water to sustain a liquid flow. Less saline water would freeze at the observed temperatures.[10] Thermal infrared data from the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) onboard the 2001 Mars Odyssey orbiter, have allowed the temperature conditions under which RSL form to be constrained. While a small number of RSL are visible at temperatures above the freezing point of water, most are not, and many appear at temperatures as low as \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u212243 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C (230 K). Some scientists think that under these cold conditions, a brine of iron sulphate (Fe2(SO4)3) or calcium chloride (CaCl\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) is the most likely mode of RSL formation.[21] Another team of scientists reported that the evidence for hydrated salts is most consistent with the spectral absorption features of magnesium perchlorate (Mg(ClO4)2), magnesium chloride (MgCl2(H2O)x) and sodium perchlorate (NaClO\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4).[17][20]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese observations are the closest scientists have come to finding evidence of liquid water on the planet\u0027s surface today.[10][16] Frozen water, however, has been detected near the surface in many middle to high-latitude regions.
