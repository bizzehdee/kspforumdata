If you burn more its going to be almost all in the horizontal, which means that your horizontal traverse on retro and horizontal error or retro will be much greater. Your \u003Cem\u003Ebarge\u003C/em\u003E on the other hand is setting in the Atlantic trying to hold a GPS position. If you come in at a 45 you only really need to kill vectors that create error which is a smaller proportion than if you reenter at a 10 degree angle with 2 or 3 times the horizontal velocity (factor in that the atmosphere pressure at height is not perfectly uniform).\u00A0 Remember the idea that the most efficient place to burn at apogee, they are gaining 1500 m/s how many seconds to reach apoapsis. Considering that w2r at horizontal vector of 1847 is 2-3%% gravity, and at 4km/s is about 25% of gravity, which means your vertical slows down much more slowly you have to burn much later and at a higher altitude, and you have much less control over where you reenter. The fuel reserve also needs there for an engine failure, because they will need more burn time to reach MECO energy and need more fuel for the back-burn. At 4 km/second, if you have an engine loss a barge landing is impossible. If the Stage value is 100 times that of fuel, then you don\u0027t care about fuel if you are recycling and can make first stage slightly larger and less efficient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCouple of problems I see in going over the flight data, Max Q comes well after Mach X-over, their payload nose-cone is not ideal, and it appears that boundary collapse is creating alot of turbulence around the plume area. Here is an area of improvement, if they give the nose cone a more Sears-Haack shape, then their Max-Q would come at a lower altitude, but allowing them to turn more quickly and efficiently. Because of the expense of the fairings and nose-cone they are going for non-ideal shapes. Presumably if they can find a way to recycle it make them much more cheaply these they will have better flight dynamics. They could make the first stage smaller and second stage larger, or burn 1st stage higher and more horizontal\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe economics you need to understand is this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNose cone (independent of first stage) cost, weight, turnaround cost and time.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFairing (almost independent of first stage) cost, weight, turnaround time cost and time.\u003Cbr\u003E\nStage 1 (can vary in size or height, made slightly wider, slightly more fuel)\u00A0 initial (fixed) cost per unit size, recycling (variable) cost per unit size, fuel cost (variable) and cost per size increase. Stage 2 (can vary in size or height, \u0022 \u0022, \u0022\u0022 ), cost per unit, fuel cost variable.\u003Cbr\u003E\nStage 3 (payload) variable, but effects nose cone and fairings. Adjustment cost for wider payloads versus economies of scale for larger defined fairings and nose cone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way the payload is set up the launch and second stage can be more robust, launch phase can carry more fuel, even have one or two more engines. If the rocket is truely recyclable they can go with the expensive but much less turbulent engines, which would allow for a higher max-q (Max-q is the compresssion of thrust and atmosphere on the most weight sensitive part of the rocket, and if you have turbulent thrust then the atmospheric component has to be lower).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-29T17:09:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222548264\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002288441\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461941864\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157695\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sevenperforce\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, sevenperforce said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, one of the benefits of living on a mountain in Ecuador is much less dust, greatly reducing hoovering time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry, couldn\u0027t resist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs the 2 km/s vs 4 km/s break taking into account RTLS vs downrange recovery?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2km/s was presumably used in the recent downrange landing. \u00A03.5 (or more)\u00A0km/s is what you get if you burn the landing reserves. \u00A0 You will need many more reserves if you have to brake 4km/s. \u00A0- Note that these numbers appear fishy: if the fuel reserves for an empty booster can provide either 1.5\u00A0km/s up for an empty booster \u002B a full upper stage or 2km/s arresting down velocity of an empty upper stage (plus some more due to gravity overcome on the way up), something doesn\u0027t add up. \u00A0This was pretty much the point of my comment: the MEC given for Falcon 9 seems absurdly low, and seems to be an issue if Falcon Heavy has to do anything similar. \u00A0My guess is they are going much faster during MEC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222548212\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002288441\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461940276\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107380\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, PB666 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, it quite simple, those engines start out at 1.2 g of six parts , five go to gravity (hoovering), 1 goes to forawrd momentum, this goes up to 800 km/hr about 1.6 g (not factoring in drag) exactly at which they throttle down to about 1.4 g.

Their final stage 1 velocity was 6680 km/h. which is 6680 megometer/hour which is 6680/3.6 meters per second = 1856 meters per second, at apogee it is lower. I have the precise flight numbers I just haven\u0027t presented them yet. The numbers do not need to be precise since there is a conversion of kinetic to thermodynamic energy in post staging, but as the vehicle levels out and adds more horizontal velocity to circularize those differences become meaningless because almost all the kinetic energy is in the horizontal vector. I am not sure when it is trajectory that the backburn took place, but its vertical ascent of at least 1000 m/s would have left \u0026lt;1500 m/s of horizontal velocity, given no payload and the fact that most of its velocity came in the last few second of flight, the ISP as at max, it would have required little fuel. I think the primary concern was to establish a trajectory that intercepted the barge, given drag. A lower descent angle means more energy is lost via drag, a higher descent angle means more control with regard to target landings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSRBs are problematic for vertical ascents, because you have the risk of hitting ground targets (which for the most part game we laughably ignore launch pad damage). The 800 kmh means you could add more fuel and use two SRBs that blew off at 800.
