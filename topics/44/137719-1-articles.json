Religion is simply the low-hanging fruit everyone wants to banter around. With that said, there are many reasons people are starving on earth and the biggest one is not global climate change but the action of governments. During the Cold War, the United Nations reported that nearly 1/2 of all food aid being sent to Africa was being redirected to certain nations by the nations it was intended to help feed - the reason was to use the foodstuffs to pay for more weapons.

Almost all of the people who are well above the marginal income are college educated and are engaged in some type of professional or higher end business activity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically it works like this, the government feeds money into a space program. Then the question we ask is where that money goes. For most of the space program the materials and the labor are local to that country, particularly if you are the US. Hydrogen is made from methane, which comes local, kerosene is distilled from oil or from natural oils. Oxygen is made locally, the bauxite for the metal is regional. The people crafting the parts are local. Unlike most things, like building a car, the multiplyer effect is high. But the people who work for the space companies and their contractors are almost all super-marginal incomes, which means they pay money into the economy at a higher rate, and the business that develope around NASA and places the like almost all support higher wager earners that have super-marginal incomes. So the government gets alot of the money back in revenue. So much of the cost can be justified from the government income point of view. (I will get to the starving in a bit don\u0027t worry)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition to this, and even more importantly the space industry warrants education and training in high technology and engineering. When those people retire from that industry and go into the private sector they carry ideas and creativity with them that spawns whole new non-space industries. In addition the space industry warranted compacting and lightening of many technologies, and as part of this trend it has ultimately lowered the cost and increased the performance of many technology. Not just the space industry, the entire defense industry. The government realized during WWII that correct targeting of trajectories and ballistics required faster electronics, but because of the finite limit of light, only smaller things could go faster. So as a consequence the government was providing an additional impetus to make things go faster, and in particularly faster than our political competitors in the East bloc. So now we have a whole very productive sector of our economy based entirely on post WWII technologies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem with our welfare system of the 70s is that it gave people money for having kids and doing effectively nothing, both leaders that increased funding pointed out the future failure, giving impoverished people food is not the answer (or simply a short term fix). You want to give them jobs, and those jobs should push their kids to get training. As a matter of fact we have more than enough food in the US to feed ourselves and alot of the world, we waste food on feeding cows and eating the rather unhealthy products. We have more than enough capacity to feed, what we need more of is the capacity to employ, not just employed but to create industry expanding and job-creating jobs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is were gov\u0027t funded \u003Cstrong\u003EScience\u003C/strong\u003E and Space science comes in. We attract the people who want to work into industries that are an education in-and-of-themselves, but require some training. This demand for labor drives people from the non-elite economic sectors into the trade-schools, appreticeships, 2-year colleges, engineering, physics, computer science, biology, and Ph.Ds in programs that are socially productive. This then spurs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou talk about miracle drugs like biologics, all these things you see advertised on T.V. and you think wow this just appeared. Nope, it didn\u0027t some of these biologics are now almost 30 years old, and we (that means I) were personally making similar things and the leaders 20 years prior to that, and so that our search for these miracle drugs in their current form began 50 years (not some rewriting of the form but in their current basic form a monoclonal antibody). Industry can do the same thing, but they are not quite as quick, infact alot of the miracle drugs, the prototypes specificities were created in university and paid for by the government, often for doing something other than killing cancer or fighting autoimmune disease. The only thing industry does is take a mouse antibody and humanize it, mass produce it and charge people 30,000$ per dose. Government research is finding new ways to diversify the reagent (so that it is non-proprietary, and new ways of making the reagent much more cheaply).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you then argue that space has no immediate benefit, well it does, we have satellite commmunication, weather satellites (save millions of lives along the coasts), information satellites, going to have broadband arrays soon. Satellites stabilize the world by monitoring weapons programs (we haven\u0027t had a WWII like conflict in 70 years). But even if we ignore all of these things, you get an amazing benefit of new technologies and new observations over much longer periods of time. Space science right now is telling us exactly how fast the ice sheets are melting, how much ground water we are losing, were future crops are likely to fail, where deforestation has it greatest impacts. Space science tells us for instance exactly were around New Orleans that sea level rise and subsidence are most rapidly eroding defensive water works, can help to plan remedial measures. I know a guy right here in Houston that used satellites to determine how to best manage spoil banks (dredge from ship canals) so that they are a benifit to the enviroment, building estuaries from shrimp and fish, sea grasses, lowering sediment transfers, etc. Space will be offering people globally with limited access to the internet the ability to connect to the internet and learn even when the corruption of local governments interfere with education.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can give you an example, the Texas Medical Center is the largest medical center in the world and is a huge boom for Houston, it would certainly be here without government funding, but it would be nowhere near as big, the gov\u0027t dime attracts the kind of thinkers that collaborate with the medical scientist. The fact that Rice university is right across the street and has facilities in the med center, and the fact you these swirl of ideas. Clinicians that treat exotic diseases don\u0027t often have the facilities to analyze the data they collect, but government and interested industries provide resources for detailed analysis that allow treatments to be made more effectively.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat about our neighbors, the attraction of NASA and TMC also attract laborers from other countries that come here to do jobs americans just don\u0027t want to do in the hot sweltering enviroment, These are not third world jobs, people can earn 10$/hour or more and work 60 hour weeks. These jobs result in remittances back to Mexico, Guatamala, Honduras, Salvador even places as far south as Brasil and Chile and boost those economies. They work in industries that build homes for people who work in the industries, they work in restaurants.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe answer is that the closer you are to government underwritten technology industries the more likely you are to have a better paying job with better benefits and that effect can transfer from local economies into the regional or continental economy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne asks the basic question why is the US economy doing so well compared to the rest of the world after the economic meltdown of 2008. Since my reply might be considered political, go see what the world bank and the UN has to say about what the US did right and what other economies did wrong. Somewhere buried in their the US gov\u0027t spent money on energy technologies and infrastructure - and gee golly some of it was horrifically wasted - by for some odd reason we have better employment and faster growing economy. Now also take a look at the amount of money the US spends on NASA versus GDP and the amount the EU spends and Russia spends. \u0027Nough said. One of the benefits was not rocket science - \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes#Second_World_War\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes#Second_World_War\u003C/a\u003E if you get no other benefit, during a time of recession you get a benifit out of technology industry investment (particularly research side since it does not compete with the private sector). On top of that benefit you benefit colleges and university with the demand for students who go into industries if they can get student loans in support of their education. Then on top of that you get the productivity gains when the economy improves.\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you toss your pennies at NASA, NASA tosses those pennies back at your kids, your friends, your neighbors on the other side of the border. So now we have SpaceX in Boca Chica, and we have all those jobs in Brownsville that will follow, and the folks who build those homes commuting from Mexico, and the associated economic traffic that feeds commercial industry. How is SpaceX doing without government contracts? Think about something else, when those tech positions fill up and overemployment is a problem, we generate visas extensions so that people from outside the US can work here longer, learn more, take more expertise back to their home countries. Tech industry in the US is at saturated employment, alot of people in the US who work in those industries come from places like China, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Philipines, Mexico, Brasil most of them are on Visas and will someday return.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I have my own pitch, deep space science (telescopy, and deep field resolution) will be the big payback in 50 years, planetary resolution will be the big payback in 1000 years or more. In my opinion there is no amount of money that is too great to spend on space science, provided that broader science is properly funded (Its not). The telescopy offers potentially great rewards, but it also can potentially avert great risk (like asteroids, unstable stellar neighbors). These space science programs are expensive, but they can guide us whether physics is going the right or wrong direction. We have to look at the risk versus reward of these programs. I would have no problem what so ever with NASA returning to 1970$/GDP spending levels. Right now there is a push to discover how the Cannae drive works, and I can tell you that in its present form its likely a trivial technology, but it does not have to stay in its present form. 50 years from no you could have communication and information satellites 10,000s whizzing around at decay altitudes that are keeping orbits 1 meter apart from each other, and you would never have to worry about being out of a network again. Satellites that do not wear out, and cannae drivin bots that replace their solar panels every 50 years. Cannae can evolve and potentially create more efficient motors, generators, etc, not perpetual motion machines, but basically frictionless machines that do not waste, coupling that with better superconductors you could have generators in cars that perfectly capture breaking energy and give it back on acceleration. You could potentially create friction less motion of wind over cars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWho is funding Cannaes research?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen of course there is past research into Quantum mechanics, the connotations of which for engineering are still in its infancy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJustified, heck yes, we need more of it, don\u0027t let the price tags fool you, its a big payback for societies willing to pick up the tab.
