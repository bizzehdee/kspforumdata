All the ISPs are adjusted up. So the only difference is burn time..\n\nWell for one, make the same mistake in RSS and stock, and that mistake will eat 3 times more out of your delta V budget in RSS. So you better not make mistakes.\n\nAlso the difference in what it takes to do a mission isn\u0027t the same for all mission profiles.\n\nIf you try to go to LEO, where the delta V requirement is only 4 km/s higher, well maybe you need a rocket that is 4 times more massive, but you can do it with a 2 stage rocket, so it\u0027s not very hard.\n\nIf you go to the moon and back, your rocket has to be 30-40 times more massive than the equivalent rocket in stock KSP, because the difference in delta V is now 11 km/s instead of 4. As the mission gets more ambitious the difference becomes even greater still, and pretty soon the difference between stock and RSS becomes ridiculous.\n\nStock parts aren\u0027t actually that bad anyway. You can push a respectable 3% payload fraction with a 3 stage rocket. That\u0027s not quite as good as real rockets, but then you get to orbit. Now you get to use that incredible LV-N which gets 800 ISP while using really dense fuel that never boils away.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-27T01:34:24Z\u0022 title=\u002203/27/2015 01:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by maccollo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jovus","CreatedById":117163,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T01:30:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t see how RSS is harder than stock unless you use stock parts in RSS in which case you are crazy.

The first is the inclinations; you don\u0027t know how convenient it is that KSC is in the plane of the ecliptic until it isn\u0027t.\n\nThe second: liquid engines are in a vast majority of cases not in fact throttleable.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-27T01:37:49Z\u0022 title=\u002203/27/2015 01:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jovus**"},{"CreatedByName":"Woopert","CreatedById":84274,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T02:37:43Z","Content":"I find that the design in RSS is also quite different. It\u0027s more of an iterative process rather than putting fuel tanks of the same type together. In RSS with Realism Overhaul, you must choose what fuels to use based on size limitations, boil off rates, efficiency, and other factors. I have two separate installs to enjoy both simultaneously because I don\u0027t think that neither RSS nor stock should replace each other. Why not both? ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) It\u0027s also fun with Realism Overhaul because you can choose from real life engines with real stats, and you feel like you\u0027re a real engineer, sort of. The burn to orbits are also different because instead of reaching an apoapsis and circularizing from there, most real life launches are done all at once with the engines burning the whole time, because engine restarts can get complicated. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Dkmdlb","CreatedById":70275,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T05:06:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E All the ISPs are adjusted up.
