If an adult wasn\u0027t a master of all the technology of the time, they at least understood it. Stability to society brought with it the ability to get by with hard work and obedience, with only enough intelligence needed to execute orders/directions. As civilization grew people could specialize in one area - they could learn less in total and invent less in total, and still advance our tech level. Likewise, as the population grows exponentially, you have exponentially more chances for people to have a unique insight/inventive idea/ be simply exceptionally intelligent without the average intelligence increasing. With these factors in mind, the average intelligence could drop quite a bit and we\u0027d still see rapid technological progress as knowledge accumulates, people specialize, and the population simply grows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-15T06:45:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223219543\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022167087\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221510706476\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022156657\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HebaruSan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, HebaruSan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith all respect to Mr. Ball and his service, it\u0027s misleading to represent those as his verbatim words.

The responses fail to be planned or thought out but more or less tend to be compulsion and even if they don\u0027t enjoy the addition these compulsions can be turned on by stimuli within the environment (for example information sent to your cell phone that you are unaware of).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe software programmers are very well aware of this, they create games and apps with periodic messaging and rewards there are designed to ping the addition centers in order to retain interest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as twilight societies, this always happens, and you don\u0027t need cell phones.

You store everything on your laptop, which really great for computer industry cause laptops and cell phones get replaced every two years, rather than 6\u00A0 to 10 years like desktop. Of course you need to bundle your cable with high-speed internet and cell phone service (family of 4 may 250$/month). Ten years ago I paid 40$ a month for internet and phone service. People don\u0027t cook, they eat out or buy prepackaged food in which they have no idea how much sugar and salt is in it (More than half of Americans now suffer from some form of diabetes or high blood pressure). Then you have to buy the drugs to treat the illnesses, surgeries to treat carpul tunnel syndrome.\u00A0 Then get gastric bypass surgery to treat the obesity. If we exclude the raw resource price of food and gas/electricity required to cook it, basic cost of TV and telephone service, what we see is the variable costs of living are rising at the same time wages are not rising which explains why people are not saving.

To the victors go the spoils of war. If you want to go into paleoanthropology its called the e\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalization_quotient\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Encephalization quotient\u003C/a\u003E. Somewhere about 1 mabp hominids achieved half of the human value, about 350,000 years ago homo heidelbergensis/rhodesiensis achieved an EQ not-statistically different from our own. So from objective criteria intelligence and civilization are not well correlated with time or EQ.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat we commonly refer to as intelligence is more or less events that have occurred since the end of the last ice-age, and it largely the result of an expansive global population (something to begin with humans had little control over, although now it appears we have faulted the climate cycle and ended the transition from the mini-ice age into a full fledged ice age). The intelligence, IQ, that typically gets ranked has really more to do with socialization and communication than anything else. [Although I dare say that in the information age good information appears to be a premium]. Civilization in and of itself appears to have been problematic. During the Mesolithic-Neolithic boundary in Europe denoted by the demarcation of the dolmen and LBK cultures, the Mesolithic peoples were eating a better diet, longer lived, better bones, healthier. In the case it would appear that having more children beats having a better or more stable culture. As is the case the LBK cultures eventually collapsed, but in their wakes more resilient culture and waves of settlers came from S.Europe and Mediterranean with waves of new technology and eventually cultural replacement occurs. In fact if one looks at the historical record and historical archaeology the one consistent feature is that dominant intelligence culture of the period essentially collapse, often for internal reasons sometimes for external. We can take the zoroastrian culture, during the period of its expansion it was one of the most progressive cultures of its time, the magi became the teachers of kings well outside the area of Persian domination (these were well sought after teachers, similar to the oracles of ancient egypt). But look at the culture now, its virtually vanished from Persia, Iraq, Near East, Afganistan, Pakistan. When we talk about the emphasis of monotheism in the bible it largely is due to the influence of the Magi.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCollective intelligence is not really about a people or civilization, as we inspect the near eastern cultures one can see that over time apex of western \u0027intelligence\u0027 flowed from place to place, first from Anatolia to Egypt and Mesopotamia, then to Greece and Persia, then Italy, then back across Asia and back into Italy and into the heart of Europe (with the break down of centralized religion) and then into the Americas. Centralization of control appears to be rather counter productive to the growth of modern intelligence, collective intelligence tends to flow to where it can essentially rule itself (sort of like the schools of the ancient Greek philosophers . . . and of course we know what happened to Socrates when he question the politics of his time).\u00A0 The point is that no-one really owns it, if one society takes a ludite view\u00A0 to science and technology (or is ruled by insecure autocrats), the apex of intelligence simply moves, some of the motion follows genetics, but alot is just flow of ideas and retrospectives on failure as the stepping stone of next apex. (We can see for instance very astronomical growth of science and technology in the East: Japan, Korea, China!!!, Vietnam, Indonesia, Taiwan. A child of the south, it is very well apparent in our system of education why the US is falling behind and Asian (non-x-ian societies are moving upwards). When I talk to my Asian friends none of them put the obstacles in front of their child\u0027s education that typical native born southerns do. \u00A0 But given that communal intelligence is not necessarily genetic, if you are in proximity to an apex, the access to the intelligence increases markedly, its just no a guarantee that the intelligence of the geographically defined culture will pass to the next generation efficiently.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI used to review alot of manuscripts from china, two decades ago the quality of submitted manuscripts was terrible, over time the number of papers submitted increased 20 fold and the quality greatly improved. With alot of plagiarization but in plagiarizing other papers it does mean that the authors are at least familiar with what\u00A0 good argument is, that they choose to organize their logic according to something that has already worked. The improved science in china in the last 20 years would reflect 50 years of science evolution in the west for decades earlier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically what would happen if humans and another less intelligent species came in contact, if that culture was capable of learning from humans it could advance in intelligence quickly. If that culture was not capable of learning, even if energy was put into the process then I would argue it was not capable of human intelligence. For that intelligence to persist in subsequent generations requires a genetically encoded facility to learn. Thus if the intelligence does not stick between at least one generation, it was not intelligence, just mirroring behaviors. Again how do we define intelligence, well put KSP in front of them and see if they get a kick-out-of building rockets and watching them blow up. That rise in blood pressure that happens trying to see if you have enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to reach orbit, or whether you began your landing burn soon enough.

The one major reason is that we don\u0027t actually know when grammatical language evolved, it was likely very long ago. There are predictions ranging from (50) 125 kabp to 1 Mapb (even 2.6 Mabp). To be certain \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkana_Boy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETurkana Boy\u003C/a\u003E likely had a language much more sophisticated than chimpanzees. And it should be noted that somewhere between 2.1 and 1.8 M years ago turkana\u0027s ancestral population had members that ventured out an survived in places like China, the Caucasus, Indonesia (which appears to include Flores Island). When we talk about humans and our manipulative behavior a key hallmark of that behavior is to explore new habitats and exploit them creating the necessary technologies and educating other tribe members. They had it, in fact if we ask the question about what happened to the asian variants of H. erectus, at least one of the answers lies in the mitochondria of Desinovan late archaic that shares common recent genetic ancestry with Indonesians (the node is about 8%). So they had enough language to qualify them as mates for people who did speak human language. Its not clear that there was sufficient enough gene flow from africa to Asia in the 1 to 2 million year period to justify unidirectional geneflow of language from Africa to Asia. (So either they develope language independently or it existed 0.5 million years before Turkana Boy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are looking for major differences between Turkana boy and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taung_Child\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETuang Child\u003C/a\u003E (2.8 Mabp) you will find differences in the size of the calvara but not much else, and more importantly Tuang lived in africa at a time we first start seeing stone tool use increase (2.6 Mabp) over and above what other apes use. The importance is that the same parts of the brain used for language are also used for tool synthesis. One of the articles that studied Tuang child basically identified some slight enlargment of the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broca%27s_area\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBroca\u0027s region\u003C/a\u003E of the brain not seen in parallel or earlier lines of hominids. This area is also responsible for motor skills involved in action recognition and reproduction, something very beneficial for tool production.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that a good guess is that an increase in crafting skills was associated with improved language over what we observe in chimpanzees and gorillas. This was followed be increases in stature of homo erectus and then increases in EQ and areas devoted by language and logic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe process occurred rather quickly in the animal kingdom which had and EQ of 2.5 going into the process and 7.5 leaving the process in\u00A0 period of 3 million years.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK the next reason is why. There are a couple of base reasons, between the time of gorillas and chimpanzees,\u00A0 protohumans may have engaged in panspermy, that is bonobo-like mating arrangements (make love not war). Humans and chimps are certainly a departure from gorilla-like (Winner takes all, though this is in question). Panspermy increases the rate of evolution in males and the study of human-chimpanzee Y reveals a rapid acceleration of evolution. The second reason why is the movement of Miocene anthropoid apes from Asia to Africa about 10 million years ago, the rate of evolution of apes baseline mutation rate is higher in the tropics.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA third reason is about 2.5 million years ago there was a shift in the periodicity of climate cycles from short brief cycles to cycles that lasted many 10s of 1000s of years. This began to dry the climate of Africa and create more complex habitats. Water was no longer widely available, and animals became migratory. So there was a push in the change in mutation rates and a pull in the forces of selection. Despite the current modern appearance Africa continued to be the driving force human evolution even after humans left Africa, this is probably due to the hominid-technology level carrying capacity of Africa during the ice ages. Gene flow appears to generally have been from Africa outward on multiple occasions after 1.8 Mabp although counter flow is likely. Some of the most genetically isolated areas on the planet are still in Africa with still buried pockets of long-held diversity. An example of this is the recently discovered Y-chromosomal \u0027Adam\u0027 chromosome in an African American male whose ancestors came from central Africa. All of these signs present Africa as both a genetic and cultural pulse that at first occurred at period of 100,000s of years and later 10,000s of years. So looking at Modern Europeans there are signals of egression from the horn of Africa, from the middle east, from Morocco and as far and east as Nigeria, even within the isolate Irish population you see signs of recent contribution from West Africa. Within Asia\u0027s the highest signal from neanderthals comes from middle-east/NE Africa is found in Japanese. Later middle eastern contribution was diluted by African migration since 80000 years ago. So this is basically the intelligence pre-technology. One oddity in the data the first pottery is from the sea of Japan, but there appears to been some pottery in Africa and some form of math before 10,000 years ago. One of the ironies is that Spain, which had the last signs of Neanderthals have just about the lowest percentage of Neanderthal genes compared to other Eurasians. Spain genetically looks more like an extension of Africa than of Europe. The signs of late paleolithic African migration are far reaching including India, Pakistan, the Turkic people (but not Japanese), Australia, Indonesia Taiwan aboriginal population and even Pacific islanders. Thus each migration from Africa may have brought better mobility technologies. This is on top of technologies that allowed people to travel over the Wallace line 1.3 million years ago (in Indonesia). Its not surprising that Egyptian civilization, with an emphasis on the Nile was the first great civilization.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo in the perspective we need :\u003Cbr\u003E\nMillions of years (at least 3) and\u00A0 a good baseline species\u003Cbr\u003E\nAn environment that forces evolution and promotes new forms of selection\u003Cbr\u003E\n[Optional] Some sort of brain-tying of language-to-technology allowing for bipartite selection on one benefiting the other.\u003Cbr\u003E\nPlaces for technology to travel to and be shared.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA development of travel/trade technologies (very much favors trading but also hoarding trees-rollers- to build magnificent monoliths)\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith trade comes a need for math skills\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith trade comes the need for negotiating and record keeping (How many oxen do you owe me after I sold you ten carts of wheat).\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith record keeping comes writing, laws, proclamations, manuscripts, papers, journals, science. . . . . . . .\u003Cbr\u003E\n--- Success of the individual in commerce being tied to success of society (efficient economies tend to build successful societies)\u003Cbr\u003E\n--- Success of the individual in matters of state and religion ~ sometimes ~ beign tied to long term success of societies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3 million years ago it would have been very difficult to predict when a naked-ape would generate the critical mass to become sophisticated, even 100 kya it would have been difficult, there were signs (blombos cave). This is the period with the greatest change in EQ, but civilization was not inevitable, around 12,000 years ago, when you see the cultivation of rye in Greece and turkey ....and also the first carvings of the Sphinx. You can look at South America, virtually unoccupied 14000 years ago, by 12,000 years ago scientist find the remains of plants, the overwhelming majority of which are now cultivated as crops and have been so for 8000 years. 16,000 years ago in Japan, pottery; a little later pottery with covers for storing dried fish an entire winter season, beans, etc. Right there, about 12,000 years go and outsider might look and reflect that there were signs of an inflection in process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother issue is self-criticality are they aware that something has changed. Obviously if last year a car did not exist and this year you are driving a model -T then you probably can philosophize about it. When I was 8 I watched on TV a man land on the moon, i kind of knew from my parents that TVs were a new thing, but then I saw that an I knew humans had done something, at the age of 10 i got my first handheld transistor radio (god I wish I hadn\u0027t throw it away) for a few bucks. You know things are changing when children who, only have a few years of experience, can see it. We go back to the mythologies 4 to 6 thousand years ago . . the great flood . . . .fruit from the tree of knowledge of life .. .\u00A0 the lost garden. Are these not self-recognitions that the laws and norms of the uncivilized had given way to the constrictions as well as benefits of civilized society. About the same time we see \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Hammurabi\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHammurabi\u0027s stele\u003C/a\u003E. Laws are to prevent people from doing things you don\u0027t want them to do, often animistic things that mess up civilizations (like sneaking in the middle of the night and stealing the kings daughter as your princess). These things fall along the lines of social intelligence - - - - Do I live in a civilation, do I recognize the good it does me, do I grow/defend it, corrupt it or leave it. Obviously we are aware of the rise-and-fall of empires (Roman, Third Reich, Czarist), but its also true that the ancients were equally aware of civil faux-pas (from Samuel to the Maccabean revolt is a repeat lesson in this with a religious spin on everything) the question is whether they were aware at their time or after in the writing of philosophers and Theologians.\u00A0 A key point about self-criticality is whether one or two sacrificial philosophers point out problem behaviors or the entire society is aware (example would be electing a president who has 20 claims of sexual harassment against him). Are we aware or just not enough aware to save ourselves only after the waterfall is in site, that is the question? Where do we draw the line on social intelligence. Along the way of civilization there was Samuel, Socrates and his Syracrus, Jesus and the sins of the fathers versus Nero and Emperial rome, Atilla, Khan, Richard III, Hitler, Stalin, Tojo,\u00A0Pol Pot, Amin. Do societies recognize a digressive force or only when that digressive force is of immediate socially erosive nature. Have there always been benefits of such autocrats for those who support them or are they supported just because a system deems it a prerequisite.\u00A0 The Ancient Greek\u0027s had a knack for painting the hero\u0027s as tragic and is probably the best evidence of self-criticality, that somehow while the god\u0027s promoted you in life, the also tied you so that your self-promotion would be your downfall.

There have been arguments that bipolar disorders and types of schizophrenia\u00A0 had selective value in past societies by adding drive an instability into group behaviors not to push them apart but when people are too social (like a herd of sheep) what happens is they fail to evolve in the face of variable selection.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLets take a look at some of the stuff, In Japan apparently 30,000 years ago some people took off across the pacific ocean (about 100 kilometers) and left human remains on Islands of the Okinawana chain. It now seems likely that around 15,000 years ago people took of across a sizable voyage in the pacific traveling down the NW American coastline and rapidly b-lined to South America. No-one in their right mind says, hey lets go hunt seals off this coast 3000 maritime miles away.\u00A0 We know why Leif Ericson did it, his family was basically fringe looking for someplace where he had a better rap. My opinion is behavioral variance is as much a part of the human social evolution as immune variation it apart of the \u0027herd immunity\u0027. With every variable trait (afterall selection is variable) there is the good and the bad. Then gene that may have prevented shellfish sickness in mesolithic societies seems to cause T1D and celiac disease in cereal based societies.

The one major reason is that we don\u0027t actually know when grammatical language evolved, it was likely very long ago. There are predictions ranging from (50) 125 kabp to 1 Mapb (even 2.6 Mabp). To be certain \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkana_Boy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETurkana Boy\u003C/a\u003E likely had a language much more sophisticated than chimpanzees. And it should be noted that somewhere between 2.1 and 1.8 M years ago turkana\u0027s ancestral population had members that ventured out an survived in places like China, the Caucasus, Indonesia (which appears to include Flores Island). When we talk about humans and our manipulative behavior a key hallmark of that behavior is to explore new habitats and exploit them creating the necessary technologies and educating other tribe members. They had it, in fact if we ask the question about what happened to the asian variants of H. erectus, at least one of the answers lies in the mitochondria of Desinovan late archaic that shares common recent genetic ancestry with Indonesians (the node is about 8%). So they had enough language to qualify them as mates for people who did speak human language. Its not clear that there was sufficient enough gene flow from africa to Asia in the 1 to 2 million year period to justify unidirectional geneflow of language from Africa to Asia. (So either they develope language independently or it existed 0.5 million years before Turkana Boy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are looking for major differences between Turkana boy and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taung_Child\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETuang Child\u003C/a\u003E (2.8 Mabp) you will find differences in the size of the calvara but not much else, and more importantly Tuang lived in africa at a time we first start seeing stone tool use increase (2.6 Mabp) over and above what other apes use. The importance is that the same parts of the brain used for language are also used for tool synthesis. One of the articles that studied Tuang child basically identified some slight enlargment of the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broca%27s_area\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBroca\u0027s region\u003C/a\u003E of the brain not seen in parallel or earlier lines of hominids. This area is also responsible for motor skills involved in action recognition and reproduction, something very beneficial for tool production.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that a good guess is that an increase in crafting skills was associated with improved language over what we observe in chimpanzees and gorillas. This was followed be increases in stature of homo erectus and then increases in EQ and areas devoted by language and logic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe process occurred rather quickly in the animal kingdom which had and EQ of 2.5 going into the process and 7.5 leaving the process in\u00A0 period of 3 million years.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK the next reason is why. There are a couple of base reasons, between the time of gorillas and chimpanzees,\u00A0 protohumans may have engaged in panspermy, that is bonobo-like mating arrangements (make love not war). Humans and chimps are certainly a departure from gorilla-like (Winner takes all, though this is in question). Panspermy increases the rate of evolution in males and the study of human-chimpanzee Y reveals a rapid acceleration of evolution. The second reason why is the movement of Miocene anthropoid apes from Asia to Africa about 10 million years ago, the rate of evolution of apes baseline mutation rate is higher in the tropics.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA third reason is about 2.5 million years ago there was a shift in the periodicity of climate cycles from short brief cycles to cycles that lasted many 10s of 1000s of years. This began to dry the climate of Africa and create more complex habitats. Water was no longer widely available, and animals became migratory. So there was a push in the change in mutation rates and a pull in the forces of selection. Despite the current modern appearance Africa continued to be the driving force human evolution even after humans left Africa, this is probably due to the hominid-technology level carrying capacity of Africa during the ice ages. Geneflow appears to generally have been from Africa outward on multiple occasions after 1.8 Mabp although counter flow is likely. Some of the most genetically isolated areas on the planet are still in Africa with still buried pockets of long-held diversity. An example of this is the recently discovered Y-chromosomal \u0027Adam\u0027 chromosome in an African American male whose ancestors came from central Africa. All of these signs present Africa as both a genetic and cultural pulse that at first occured at period of 100,000s of years and later 10,000s of years. So looking at Modern Europeans there are signals of egression from the horn of Africa, from the middle east, from Morocco and as far and east as Nigeria, even within the isolate Irish population you see signs of recent contribution from West Africa. Within Asia\u0027s the highest signal from neanderthals comes from middle-east/NE Africa is found in Japanese. Later middle eastern contribution was diluted by African migration since 80000 years ago. So this is basically the intelligence pre-technology. One oddity in the data the first pottery is from the sea of Japan, but there appears to been some pottery in Africa and some form of math before 10,000 years ago. One of the ironies is that Spain, which had the last signs of Neanderthals have just about the lowest percentage of Neanderthal genes compared to other Eurasians. Spain genetically looks more like an extension of Africa than of Europe. The signs of late paleolithic African migration are far reaching including India, Pakistan, the Turkic people (but not Japanese), Australia, Indonesia Taiwan aboriginal population and even Pacific islanders. Thus each migration from Africa may have brought better mobility technologies. This is on top of technologies that allowed people to travel over the Wallace line 1.3 million years ago (in Indonesia). Its not surprising that Egyptian civilization, with an emphasis on the Nile was the first great civilization.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo in the perspective we need :\u003Cbr\u003E\nMillions of years (at least 3) and\u00A0 a good baseline species\u003Cbr\u003E\nAn environment that forces evolution and promotes new forms of selection\u003Cbr\u003E\n[Optional] Some sort of brain-tying of language-to-technology allowing for bipartite selection on one benefiting the other.\u003Cbr\u003E\nPlaces for technology to travel to and be shared.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA development of travel/trade technologies (very much favors trading but also hoarding trees-rollers- to build magnificent monoliths)\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith trade comes a need for math skills\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith trade comes the need for negotiating and record keeping (How many oxen do you owe me after I sold you ten carts of wheat).\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith record keeping comes writing, laws, proclamations, manuscripts, papers, journals, science. . . . . . . .\u003Cbr\u003E\n--- Success of the individual in commerce being tied to success of society (efficient economies tend to build successful societies)\u003Cbr\u003E\n--- Success of the individual in matters of state and religion ~ sometimes ~ beign tied to long term success of societies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3 million years ago it would have been very difficult to predict when a naked-ape would generate the critical mass to become sophisticated, even 100 kya it would have been difficult, there were signs (blombos cave). This is the period with the greatest change in EQ, but civilization was not inevitable, around 12,000 years ago, when you see the cultivation of rye in greece and turkey ....and also the first carvings of the sphinx. You can look at South America, virtually unoccupied 14000 years ago, by 12,000 years ago scientist find the remains of plants the overwhelming majority of which are now cultivated as crops and have been so for 8000 years. 16,000 years ago in Japan, pottery a little later with covers for storing dried fish an entire winter season, beans, etc. Right there, about 12,000 years go and outsider might look and reflect that there were signs of an inflection in process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother issue is self-criticality are they aware that something has changed. Obviously if last year a car did not exist and this year you are driving a model -T then you probably can philosophize about it. When I was 8 I watched on TV a man land on the moon, i kind of knew from my parents that TVs were a new thing, but then I saw that an I knew humans had done something, at the age of 10 i got my first handheld transistor radio (god I wish I hadn\u0027t throw it away) for a few bucks. You know things are changing when children who, only have a few years of experience, can see it. We go back to the mythologies 4 to 6 thousand years ago . . the great flood . . . .fruit from the tree of knowledge of life .. .\u00A0 the lost garden. Are these not self-recognitions that the laws and norms of the uncivilized had given way to the constrictions as well as benefits of civilized society. About the same time we see \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Hammurabi\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHammurabi\u0027s stele\u003C/a\u003E. Laws are to prevent people from doing things you don\u0027t want them to do, often animistic things that mess up civilizations (like sneaking in the middle of the night and stealing the kings daughter as your princess). These things fall along the lines of social intelligence - - - - Do I live in a civilation, do I recognize the good it does me, do I grow/defend it, corrupt it or leave it. Obviously we are aware of the rise-and-fall of empires (Roman, Third Reich, Czarist), but its also true that the ancients were equally aware of civil faux-pas (from Samuel to the Maccabean revolt is a repeat lesson in this with a religious spin on everything) the question is whether they were aware at their time or after in the writing of philosophers and Theologians.\u00A0 A key point about self-criticality is whether one or two sacrificial philosophers point out problem behaviors or the entire society is aware (example would be electing a president who has 20 claims of sexual harassment against him). Are we aware or just not enough aware to save ourselves only after the waterfall is in site, that is the question? Where do we draw the line on social intelligence. Along the way of civilization there was Samuel, Socrates and his Syracrus, Jesus and the sins of the fathers versus Nero and Emperial rome, Atilla, Khan, Richard III, Hitler, Stalin, Tojo,\u00A0Pol Pot, Amin. Do societies recognize a digressive force or only when that digressive force is of immediate socially erosive nature. Have there always been benefits of such autocrats for those who support them or are they supported just because a system deems it a prerequisite.\u00A0 The Ancient Greek\u0027s had a knack for painting the hero\u0027s as tragic and is probably the best evidence of self-criticality, that somehow while the god\u0027s promoted you in life, the also tied you so that your self-promotion would be your downfall. Philosophically we can paint this as a vestigial behaviors, but then we look at our most popular politicians (\u0022this is going to be the greatest thing ever\u0022) and wonder why \u0027socially-intelligent\u0027 people now fall for the propaganda that a 2500 year old Greek philosopher would not fall for. This type of intellectual evolution is slow and very cyclical in its nature.\u00A0 \u00A0 One of the reason I left my field of study and not to go back there was the recent rabid insistence on self-promotion . . it bothers me that they want their employees to face and tweet when I saw that as one of the biggest problems in the workplace and not surprisingly they are falling apart financially. This will be a domino effect in higher education, its coming. Social intelligence is a very plastic thing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVery good and filling, plenty of things I did not know some had erectus genes, well at least they can not mock Europeans for being Neanderthals.

It needed an high enough population pressure and opportunity, early farming would be very hard work and not something you would do if you could hunt.
