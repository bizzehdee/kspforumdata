She talks a lot about how people reacted to the data as it unfurled and slowly pieced together some rather amazing big pictures.

Cassini was a cool mission. I\u0027m looking forward to when they go back to Titan and hope they send something to Enceladus at some point (maybe a Europa clipper type mission). I know Dragonfly is one in the works for Titan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
