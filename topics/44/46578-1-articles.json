I suppose we could send one bomb after another, but I\u0027d rather detonate something that would cover it with some kind of paint and let the Sun do most of the work. We would have to do it a long time before impact. If if comes from the direction of Sun, we will not see it until it\u0027s too late. That\u0027s what happened in Chelyabinsk with a small boulder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the \u0022a smaller one would just disintegrate\u0022 thing I often hear in these kinds of discussions, there\u0027s Chelyabinsk and Tunguska.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAirburst of a lump the size of Eiffel tower could probably be capable of setting on fire a small country just by heat radiation. The pressure wave would do the rest. Also everything in the path of it travelling through the atmosphere would be charred because of the radiative heat or reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll these effects are no different from a nuclear weapon, except many times greater and without the radioactive fallout.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHuge asteroids don\u0027t scare me. You can spot them from great distances before they come near Earth, so you can accept death and enjoy the society as it breaks down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat scares me are the small ones capable of sneaking up on you and obliberating the area of several Long Angeles cities.
