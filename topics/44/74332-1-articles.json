The proof is as follows: Assuming that a plane is infinitely-sized, we can say that each plane contains an infinite amount of matter. Therefore, if all the matter in the plane has mass-energy, we can assume that each plane has an infinite amount of energy. Since infinity plus or minus something is still the same number (look up the infinite hotel if you doubt this), creating or destroying energy in the plane will not change the amount of total energy in the plane. Therefore, in another plane, we can create or destroy energy without being prevented from doing so by the second law of thermodynamics.
