Virtually all orbital maneuvers involve some sort of elliptic transfer.

First of all, the numbers for transfers between various orbits are still \u003Cstrong\u003Eentirely\u003C/strong\u003E valid even if you don\u0027t use the numbers for launch. For example, if you\u0027re staging for a cislunar mission at the space station, then you can simply use your launch vehicle\u0027s stated ISS payload and start from there. Moreover, because the periapse and apoapse burns are shown separately, you can start or end halfway through a Hohmann transfer. If your launch vehicle can deliver 10\u00A0tonnes to GTO then you can still calculate the required GEO circularization burn without necessarily knowing the exact dV burned to get onto the GTO; if you\u0027re coming back from a cislunar mission and passing through EML-1 then you\u0027ll be able to estimate the apogee burn for aerobraking without worrying about the launch dV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, and more to the point, the surface periapse velocities given in the tables are decidedly\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the same as the ones provided in the dV map.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRather than going through the excessive pain of adjusting for T/W ratio and atmospheric drag and calculating the ideal gravity turn and everything else, I\u0027ve simply used an\u00A0average figure for total gravity drag and atmospheric drag in launches -- 1.5 km/s -- and added that on to the putative Hohmann transfer perigee velocity when determining the values for the dV map. I also subtracted the 465 m/s rotational speed of the Earth at the equator for the best-case simplification. Thus, even though a launch vehicle obviously does not make an instantaneous horizontal burn equal to the Hohmann transfer perigee velocity at the launch pad, it will be as if it burned that amount of dV plus an additional 1.5 km/s in order to get onto a trajectory that can be circularized. That\u0027s what is shown on the dV map.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNaturally, the launch dV requirements will be highly dependent on the launch vehicle; a narrow rocket with a high T/W ratio will be able to get away with lower launch dV than a wide\u00A0rocket or a VTHL spaceplane\u00A0with poorer thrust. But the launch dV values provided give a reasonably good estimate for the dV you need. In most cases, serious mission planning will involve the use of actual quoted figures for a given launch system, so you know what can be delivered to your initial parking orbit and you can plan from that starting point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe launch dV values are also useful for comparative reasons. If your launch vehicle can deliver a given payload a 100x100km LEO with 1200 m/s of remaining dV, then you can predict the remaining dV for a launch to the ISS by looking at the difference between the circularization dVs and the launch dVs. This works with both the table and the map. Launching from the surface directly to the ISS will cost you 88 m/s more in your initial burn and 86 m/s more in your circular burn than launching to 100 km would. This may or may not be more efficient than first launching to 100x100 km and then doing a Hohmann transfer up, depending on inclination changes. However, if it\u0027s something like a launch to EML-1, then you will have significant savings by launching directly from the surface compared to launching to 100x100 km and then doing a transfer. This will limit your launch window, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of these factors need to be considered.

When the apsis on the horizontal axis matches the apsis on the vertical axis, the orbit is circular and has only one speed; when the axes don\u0027t match, there is a high apsis (the apoapse/apogee) and a low apsis (the periapse/perigee).

When you talk about orbits for me its potential and kinetic energy thats they way I think (IOW before KSP this is how I solved), so if I am not offered any solution, I will naturally solve for those two for any orbit I want to solve. If you take the integral of \u003Cem\u003Eu\u003C/em\u003EH you can solve for potential energy for any two positions about a warp in space-time, so thats damn easy, at least for me. The rest is just velocity energy differentials. The reality is if you know how to calculated the celestial gravitational constant for any body, the math suddenly becomes much easier. 3.98E14.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSee, in the game your conics show you the dV required for each segment, but for planning you only need to know total dV for each transfer. Let the game split them. If you had an excel table you simply put in your orbit your target orbit and the eccentrity and let the hidden vbasic function spit out a total dV, its pretty philosophical since you still haven\u0027t handled inclinations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheoretically for any switch you hohmann burn at the asc or des node (with a vector for inclination and at apo you burn both simultaneously for remaining inclination and circularization, but if you are catching target you might burn part of the orbit inorder to create an orbit that has an apo that coincided with the target and perform a second burn for an efficient use of dV for both inclination and orbit matching. In the game I do this alot for docking from launch, as part of my game I have a factory at 600k that needs to be resupplied, so I am going to use several burns, first one at peri to reach apo, then a second at apo to creat an orbit that will intercept target and finally a third burn to match target speed. I can throw inclination burns needed into this at my convenience. Doesnt really fit into the tabular form you provide. But what would be convenient is to know the total dV of the target intercept. The problem is that the greatest source of variation is in the launch to dV. If I let McJeb do it, its often a wash, or inefficient, if you do it manually you are often left short or excess of fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what I really need is a launch program that looks at things like CoD, the maximum dynamic pressure, maximum thrust to weight ratios,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore we run into inaccuracies when you start dealing with things like 3-body problems, inclinations, interception, ect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe highest energy inclination differences per degree however are the inclination changes required for circulation after launch, which you basically swept under the rug.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-01T14:48:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222487567\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022135435\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221459521756\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107380\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 minutes ago, PB666 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThats not exactly true because you know the semi-major axis of a circular orbit and for an elliptical orbit its\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\npe/2 \u002B apo/2 \u002B r\u003Csub\u003Esurface,central body \u003C/sub\u003Eand if you cannot calculate v at apo and peri, well need to spend more time on the wiki pages.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe run into inaccuracies when you start dealing with things like 3-body problems, inclinations, interception, ect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe highest energy inclination differences per degree however are the inclination changes required for circulation after launch, which you basically swept under the rug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWasn\u0027t really intending this particular dV map for use in the game; that\u0027s why I said it was for planning lunar missions.

My exit potential is 62574638/kg No problem, if I do not add dv I will have an orbit about a point center that is basically two infinitely close lines that touch the center of the point mass (essentially it would be a black hole and I would fall into it).

Now I already have a pretty good idea, because GSO is relatively close in energy to the hills radius Epot and So from the surface that is simply (2*u/r)\u003Csup\u003E0.5\u003C/sup\u003E = 11,187 so I kind of know that dV is going to be less than 3277.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now I want to have an orbit that goes from Surface to GSO. Ok lets assume that both orbits are circular orbits.\u00A0 To get to GSO I need to add 53121104/kg joules from an object just standing on a non-moving surface. The problem is that velocity gets me to GSO from the surface but it doesn\u0027t keep me there, I need to add additional energy to keep me there, so I have to add some more E to keep me. To stay at that distance all I need to do is add half the potential from GSO to exit this gives a velocity of 10756. Since I have already put 7910 into getting to my surface orbit I simply [cough] need dV 2345 which needs to be parse into an initiation burn and a completion burn. Its not going to be this good, there is waste because there are two burns required to reach a circle and two more required to reach GSO. Whereas if I launched strait up to GSO and burned it would be 13400 dV. Thus circularization is good at LEO and burn to GSO compared to burn up and circularization at GSO. Meaning if you have to burn vertical and horizontal, by all means do it at a lower altitude. However there are still better choices, because all I need to do is get a high enough vertical velocity to keep me from slamming into the thick atmosphere while I do a horizontal burn. I can get closer to the 10756 if I blow off what it took me to get to 10,000 meters (about 450 dV) and assume that I had a fast perfect burn to elliptical GSO from there, and avoiding the circularization.\u00A0 There is a good space ecology reason for doing this and not circularizing first, any stages you burn through to reach GSO from a pe of say 10,000 to 80,000 meters, or even a bit into the circularization burn, they fall promptly back down to earth or into decay circularization to earth.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reality is the approach up to 80k alt is going to have to be an engineer approach, not pure math, a strategy of simulation based on maxima and NGO setpoints (e.g. maximum dynamic pressure) CoD, turns. But the point is at 80k you want to be on that GSO ellipse and very close to have accelerated to intercept velocity, and not spent much more energy fighting gravity than spent fighting drag (that is a reason for small craft getting CoD to absolute minimum is essential). At that point you can delta the difference between Erequired - EIdeal \u002B Esurface velocity of earth at whatever latitude and determine the launch anomaly. Someone had a post the other day about Cygnus futzing up the parameters, but what they don\u0027t see is that drag is an estimate, the atmosphere is not perfectly predicable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBTW GSO has a radius of 42,163.96 km = Roughly\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0 CubeRoot( 398600442000000 /( 2*pi* 365.2422 /( 24* 60 * 60 * 364.2422 ))\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E)\u00A0 ok maybe not roughly\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-02T14:20:40Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2016 02:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
