It would splat. Or it\u0027d stop working. Also, I can\u0027t really imagine atoms enlarging - cells are small enough that parts of it are only several layer of atoms (like membranes)...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. You\u0027d fall for infinite time due to the spacetime curvature. Or you won\u0027t feel anything but the fact you\u0027ve done a silly thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Don\u0027t get it - if you mean similar to the 5th question, look below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Don\u0027t get it (again) - if you mean ionizing radiation, two of them is a particle (specifically, baryon) already - He nucleus and electron. The other one is force carrier particle (boson) - a photon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Impossible - one of the people who taught me cosmology says that \u0022the universe have to get no limit - else, light would fall to the edge\u0022. So it\u0027s like chasing your own shadow, more parts of the universe becomes apparent while those things you left behind will fade away and never able to be seen again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-19T08:37:27Z\u0022 title=\u002210/19/2014 08:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by YNM\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"How2FoldSoup","CreatedById":82003,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-19T04:23:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had this exact conversation with a prof like 3 weeks ago..its a great question\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
