Rather, the projectile is fired using explosive pressure out of a rifled barrel in the same way as a conventional gun. The difference is that there are openings in the back of the barrel which allow a portion of the exhaust gases to escape out the rear of the gun, producing forward thrust to the gun (not to the projectile) to counteract the recoil \u0022kick\u0022 from the shot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe primary job of the exhaust gases is too push the projectile down the barrel so that\u0027s what the system is optimized for. The holes which allow spent exhaust to escape rearward and counterbalance recoil cannot be optimized for thrust, so the escaping exhaust is never \u0022choked\u0022 as in a conventional rocket engine. It has more in common with air escaping from a balloon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that despite the appearance of an aerospike producing a straight column of fire is deceptive; it is less efficient at any altitude than a conventional nozzle sized for that altitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"farmerben","CreatedById":190194,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-13T14:51:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood reply, severperforce!\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the more choked the exhaust the higher the pressure driving the projectile.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe shape of the exhaust nozzle determines how much forward the thrust the gun will get, to counterbalance the rearward force on the interior face of the choke.\u00A0 The difference between a good and bad nozzle is mainly how much recoil is felt, less so the projectile.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA reccoiless also had to deal with sudden changes in pressure and flow rate.\u00A0 In muzzle loading arms it is not uncommon for the breach face to be round or conical, allowing more propellant to burn late.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
