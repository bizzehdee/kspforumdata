One of the main reasons we haven\u0027t yet been to Mars is that in the late \u002780\u0027s the US government asked NASA for a report on the feasibility of returning permanently to the Moon and then heading onto Mars. This study was written up in the \u002290-Day Study\u0022, and gave an estimated cost of about $500 billion. This plan called for a huge space station to be built in orbit where they could build and repair spacecraft as well as the stuff that the ISS does now.

People have been studying all sorts of ideas for creating large scale spaceships and we\u0027ve found that a few ideas are hypothetically maybe possible, but those that are are also extremely expensive and often not practical on any level. Game and movie spaceships almost always have next to no research in their design at all because they\u0027re not supposed to be scientific, they\u0027re just meant to look cool. Pure fantasy. So studying them is pointless. There are exceptions to the rule, such as the Venture Star from Avatar, which while apparently an overly optimistic estimate of it\u0027s potential capabilities, is in fact quite a realistic design. Of course, it is also extremely expensive and relies on the fact that they know there is an abundance of a room temperature superconductor at the target planet to be considered worth it\u0027s use.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-23T02:36:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2013 02:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Kerbface\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aandred","CreatedById":67281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T12:43:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MBobrik\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MBobrik\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Epowered flight was a fantasy 150 years ago.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a difference between a fantasy and a theoretical possibility. 150 years ago powered flight was the latter.

The reason why is that the 39 day VASIMR requires a 200MW(electric) power source. For the 39 day scenario this kind of power is not achievable with anything like current technology in terms of solar. It is certainly more possible with nuclear reactors but 200MW is 33,000 times more powerful than any space nuclear reactor ever flown, the Soviet era Topaz reactors. The biggest American space nuclear reactor was SNAP-10 and that one only managed 500W(electric). I think that the 39 days claim also assumes reactor power to weight ratios far in excess of anything achieved so far. I think a 200MW space nuclear reactor is doable with lots of research and development work, but unfortunately none of this is currently being funded. Since Frank Chang Diaz \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E a rocket scientist I\u0027m sure he is well aware of this, but it seems like he is making a pitch for a much smaller 1MW solar (this would still be a football field sized array) VASIMR cis-lunar cargo ferry; not very fast, but efficient at transferring big payloads.

The fluid between ice crystals is still liquid, chemistry is slowed, not stopped, and the state can only be sustained for a few months. If these animals were cooled to temperatures required for true long-term stability (i.e. below the glass transition temperature) they would not survive.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-26T04:35:30Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2013 04:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tangent\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"karolus10","CreatedById":17876,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T06:34:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGoing to mars with both chemical and NTR rockets is perfectly possible but starting manned program to mars require more money (still not much vs money that military projects spend every year) and public support witch both lack today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso \u0022mars to stay\u0022 aren\u0027t really bad idea after all - flying all the way to mars only to go back in closest launch window is a waste, but permanent \u0022colony\u0022 will require also much more launches before initial mission, so most base components will be waiting for assembly (or first stage of assembly will start using heavy rover) when initial crew will be launched - people can bear living in small space in short term mission but, Mars One idea to send people to live in small thin-can and make them wait for next modules (with people too so, not add up too much space) is at least concerning :/.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I believe that inflatable modules are the future building bricks of both mars and lunar habitats.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.biospherefoundation.org/cameronmars.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022cameronmars.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT_1: shorter travel time require larger \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV with reduce payload size (not viable for cargo missions) and also add danger of overshooting the mars and be the furthest from earth coffin record holder (no free return).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT_2: about hibernation...

We could do a lot more science at a much smaller cost with robotic missions. With manned missions, the vast majority of the mass sent to Mars are to simply to keep astronauts alive. There is also the strong concern about bio-contamination before we figured out if Mars has / had indigenous life forms - with manned missions bio-contamination is almost unavoidable. Thus for Mars I think we should really focus on developing a cheap \u0026amp; robust sample return mission architecture and execute several such missions to return samples from multiple sites (including subsurface).
