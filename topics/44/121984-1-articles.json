That is, if you pay the enormous cost of sending some kind of mining equipment that can mine up the soil and then bake out the water, you would be able to collect, a drop at a time, water, which happens to contain the lightest element in the universe, hydrogen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis lets you make rocket fuel - methane or liquid H2 - entirely from resources found on Mars itself.
