However, I\u0027d have to agree that the traditional view of five senses is a bit limited. Maybe one could speak of sensors instead of senses, since science tells us we are pretty much all mechanical anyway and just very fancy machines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI often wonder what it is like to detect heat like a snake, to have the spatial perception of a small bird or the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://mollylambert.tumblr.com/post/43356695/hyperspectral-color-vision\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Etrinocular vision\u003C/a\u003E of a Mantis Shrimp with eyes that have not three, but sixteen different kinds of color receptors. The somewhat sad truth is we will never know, since our hardware is so different that we cannot even imagine. When we do try, it always ends up translating those things to sensory input we know (like the thermal imaging we all know and love from Predator) and that - of course - does not get us anywhere we haven\u0027t been before. We even shaped the world around us to match our internal wiring. As monkeys that lived on plains we don\u0027t do well with complex three dimensional spaces. Instead we simplify those into series of surfaces - or floors - that we do easily understand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe that we will learn to artificially build new organs in the distant future along with a brain structure to operate them. Those developments have already started in the shape of kidneys being experimentally printed in laboratories, but it will probably take generations before we can match the quality of real organs, so improved and new organs are a long long way off. Only then it might be possible to finally perceive those things we were never able to feel, see or touch before.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ROFLCopter64bit","CreatedById":58314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T10:44:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Camacha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Camacha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMaybe that we will learn to artificially build new organs in the distant future along with a brain structure to operate them.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the time the technological singularity comes around, we should be able to create a computer chip that implants into our brain, allowing us into the realm of superintelligence.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grahamglas","CreatedById":57452,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T23:50:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBalance is composed of three aspects\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Visual, we basically triangulate with our binocular vision and to a degree with the focal lenghth of our eye this positions our head (sight)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Skeletal, pressure sensors throughout our body feed back information fixing our posture and if any parts of our body touch the world we use our awareness of posture to caculate our position.
