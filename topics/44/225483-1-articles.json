I see several historic Apollo landing sites fairly close to the Moons equator. So I want to establish a lunar orbit with near 0 degree inclination.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI can use MechJeb and the Lunar Transfer Planner mods to minimize delta-v during TLI... but I don\u0027t know how to adjust my maneuver node to minimize my destination orbit\u0027s inclination. I don\u0027t even know if it is possible. (also, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E doesn\u0027t show destination orbit inclination, only \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E, so I am eyeballing it).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know I can wait until reaching the Moon\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, and then get the inclination and LAN info. At that point, I can somewhat adjust inclination with a burn just inside the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. But I cannot get close to 0 degrees unless I burn at the closest Ascending Node or Descending Node, at which point, I am close enough that it will cost a lot of fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would think that the Moon\u0027s equatorial/rotational plane would intersect the Earth twice per month, and that would be my window for a Hohmann transfer, but can\u0027t seem to see that happening. To clarify before any confusion, I am not asking about the Moon\u0027s \u0027orbital plane\u0027, which intersects my launch site\u0027s plane twice a day. That\u0027ll get me a lunar encounter just fine, but puts me into a higher inclination orbit about the moon (usually 28 degrees or so).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could be thinking about this all wrong, so please point me in the right direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy questions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a way to minimize the delta-v needed for that late plane change to 0 inclination, with better timing or adjustments during the TLI burn back at LEO? Or perhaps a mid-course correction burn (half way) still days away from Moon \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs it a mistake to even try for a lunar equatorial orbit for this mission? Can this only be done with an expensive burn close to the Moon? Is a MechJeb Hohmann transfer simply the wrong starting point, and I need to instead make several manual burns? Or is there a calculator that exists to do this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow did the real Apollo missions seem to arrive at the Moon? I\u0027ve read \u0022Apollo by the Numbers\u0022, which gives lots of details, but still can\u0027t find out the inclination in their lunar orbits (just \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E). All I can tell is, most Apollo CSM crafts did a single plane change while in a circular orbit after they decouple the LM, so as to make rendezvous easier. That may imply were not equatorial. But I still don\u0027t understand what inclination they arrived into orbit with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"farmerben","CreatedById":190194,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-18T14:36:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInclination changes cost much less fuel if you are at apogee and have a highly elliptical orbit.\u00A0 It might be possible to set your perigee as low as possible for the intercept.\u00A0 Take the most elliptical orbit you can.\u00A0 And do your inclination changes where your speed is minimum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ker Ball One","CreatedById":229977,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-18T14:46:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224408639\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022225483\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221721313374\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022190194\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022farmerben\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 minutes ago, farmerben said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInclination changes cost much less fuel if you are at apogee and have a highly elliptical orbit.\u00A0 It might be possible to set your perigee as low as possible for the intercept.\u00A0 Take the most elliptical orbit you can.\u00A0 And do your inclination changes where your speed is minimum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat may save some fuel, but at the expense of a lot of time.\u00A0 Which I don\u0027t have in a RP-1 crewed mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom what I understand, that method succeeds best when apolune is near the ascending or descending node.\u00A0 But you still have to be in an orbit already.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m looking for a point in the journey that is between the Earth and the Moon, but not yet within the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E of the moon.\u00A0 There should be a point that is on the equatorial plane of the Moon, and thus equivalent to the ascending or descending node.\u00A0 But since patched conics don\u0027t display that kind of orbital information until you are inside the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, I\u0027m finding it difficult.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-07-18T14:47:21Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2024 02:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002234 min\u0022\u003E34 minutes ago\u003C/time\u003E by Ker Ball One\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
