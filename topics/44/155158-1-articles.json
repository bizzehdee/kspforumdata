I have followed the publications over the last years but i am not an astronomer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is no easy answer to your question. Sol\u0027s Oort cloud has revealed itself through gravity and the origin of the comets, but it\u0027s total mass is very low compared to what\u0027s farther inside. Some objects might even be interstellar and only gravitationally bound on a temporary basis. If they are gravitationally bound their orbit times may reach 10.000s or even hundred thousands of years. This is according to the model of the formation of \u003Cem\u003Eour\u003C/em\u003E system and that system seems to be somewhat special compared to what was discovered in the last 15 years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe accretion disk seems to be a common part in the formation of star systems because quite a few are being observed. But then things mostly seem to go separate ways (note that i am a little cautious with my formulations :-)). In our case things were sorted quite well, rocky planets inside (still, this observation is probably just about to change fundamentally), gas giants outside. What was discovered in other systems until now is mostly different. But the observations could be influenced by our limited observation techniques. Whether a cloud of icy rubbish forms depends on when and where the accretion disk forms and how the system evolves. Our system always remained in a quiet environment and could have been able to collect interstellar dust that is now more or less bound or even exchanged with neighbours. The cluster Sol originated from has dispersed but some of the former members are still detectable*.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore i blather too much: there is no easy answer to your question. Proxima Centauri may have an Oort cloud as well, until recently it wasn\u0027t even sure whether the star is bound to the Alpha Centauri system.
