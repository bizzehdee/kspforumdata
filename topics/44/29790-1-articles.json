The ones that directly use the fusion products for the exhaust depend on the fusion reaction and the nozzle scheme (hell, one of those is thermonulcear Orion), and then you get to the concepts that use the fusion reaction to heat another propellant, with much lower isp (still thousands of seconds to tens of thousands of seconds).

As you can see, heavy. You can see a schematic of the different engine systems on page three.
