A gas giant has moons too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the main issue lies in the gravity well. To hold an atmosphere in the goldilocks zone that retains water you need a pretty high escape velocity. Too low and you bleed your oceans into space. This is the main barrier for a habitable moon. The biggest moons in the solar system are only about 1/40th the mass of earth. Mars is probably close to the lower limit for a habitable planet (seems to have had liquid water at some point) and it is still about 5 times heavier than the biggest moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we need to get heavy moons. If the moon has to coevolve with the primary you need a pretty heavy parent. A big moon requires a lot of stuff, so you need a big gravity well to scoop up the materials. So you\u0027re looking at a jupiter mass object. Furthermore, gas giants don\u0027t like to form close to their parent stars. So you need them to migrate towards the goldilocks zone after formation. If the moon has to be captured you\u0027ll have some rather crazy capture dynamics. You\u0027ll probably end up with a Earth-Theia impact scenario.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, big habitable moons are going to be very rare and you\u0027ll predominantly find them around gas giants.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuch a big moon is going to experience some serious tidal forces. If it isn\u0027t tidally locked you\u0027ll get massive tidal bulges. If it is tidally locked you\u0027ll have a day/night cycle roughly equal to the orbital period. This means long days with big heat differences, so you\u0027ll see big storms. In either case I don\u0027t recommend living near a shoreline.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you orbit a gas giant you\u0027ll likely see some very pretty auroras.

All four Galilean moons are tidally locked to Jupiter. And this is going to be the situation for any large moon that has formed near a gas giant. That means you can\u0027t rely on moon\u0027s rotation for day-night cycle. Instead, it has to be the moon\u0027s orbit around the planet that provides the day-night cycle. A cycle significantly longer than Earth\u0027s is going to cause very extreme temperature variations, so it has to be on the order of couple of days. This would put Io in the golden zone for habitable moon if Jupiter was in Sun\u0027s habitable zone and Io was a bit larger. But Io experiences all sorts of problems due to its proximity to Jupiter. An Earth-like planet in such a low orbit would be losing too much of its atmosphere and having too much geological activity for any complex life to be plausible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other possibility is having the moon orbit far enough from the parent planet to prevent tidal locking. Large moons aren\u0027t supposed to form so far out, so it\u0027d have to be a capture. But a capture from the wrong part of the system would mean that the moon missed out on the young Earth stage of development crucial for generating sufficient quantities of organic molecules needed for life to start. So it needs to be a capture from habitable zone. But we have a gas giant in a habitable zone of this star, so not much else. Now we are looking at a capture from another star system, a planet that got knocked out of its cozy habitable zone orbit, remained frozen in the void, and became alive as a captured moon of a gas giant in a habitable zone of another star.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure in all of cosmos such things happen.

An impact event in early formation can result in an Earth-sized moon that\u0027s far enough from the super-Earth to prevent tidal locking. And it would allow normal geological evolution of the planet, allowing for subsequent biological evolution if the conditions are right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, I\u0027d go with a moon of a super-Earth if I was looking for a habitable moon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"crazyewok","CreatedById":97592,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-23T17:01:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell we may have one in our own solar system.

A 13 jupiter mass object at the boundary between a planet and a brown dwarf would probably have at most 1 earth mass worth of moons.

That\u0027s a 4 MJ planet at 5 billion years old. A 10\u002B MJ planet could very well put out enough radiation in the first few hundred million years of its life to boil away the atmospheres of close-in moons. Brown dwarfs would be even worse; in addition to their greater mass, they\u0027d get an extra burst of initial heat from deuterium fusion. You also may end up with a goldilocks zone of distance from the planet where the tidal heating and radiation levels are suitable for a moon to retain a habitable temperature and atmosphere. Finally, remember that just because a planet is of earthlike size and composition and located in the habitable zone it isn\u0027t necessarily actually habitable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, it would be quite possible for a planetary system to have multiple habitable worlds.

Nevertheless, you could probably fit a total of four habitable moons into a system if you were very lucky, and maybe a couple trojan planets. With much smaller gas giants, too small to have habitable moons, you could probably still fit a few planets at the trojan points.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T22:18:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jwenting\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jwenting\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eor you\u0027d need a star in the final stage of its evolution that has gotten a lot hotter than it originally was, moving the habitable zone out towards that gas giant.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther solar systems have gas giants in other orbits than far from the sun, some are very close, some chance you get some of them in the goldilock zone. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadiation from gas giants, Jupiter has lots of radiation, Saturn has little.
