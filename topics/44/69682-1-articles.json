But if you use many smaller engines, you can use processes closer to mass production and cut the costs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, imagine you need a mould for one part. If you have a big engine, it will be a big part, the mould will be very expensive (doesn\u0027t scale linearly with size), you will need advanced techniques to keep the metal liquid everywhere and avoid issues with thermal contraction (when the metal cools, it shrinks).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if you use a cluster of smaller engines, the mould will be smaller, hence cheaper and easier to use, and you will use it much more often.

The Proton rocket is built with a large central oxidizer tank, and its side-tanks hold the fuel and have the engines mounted on them. The reason for this was because the diameter of the oxidizer tank (a little over four meters) was the largest the Russians could transport by rail. So the side tanks/engines are strapped on at the launch complex to make a larger first stage than could be transported across country.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
