The reasons why refined Uranium and plutonium are expensive is cause they are purposely kept expensive for security concerns as mass production of cheap refined Uranium and plutonium would make nuke making easier. Though the country\u0027s the USA didn\u0027t want to get bomb have....so that may be a non issue now. Anyway from the books and papers I was reading they got the amount of fission material down to very low and manageable amounts, the problem again being security. As for the need? Well you will get a situation of once the capability to launch huge payloads appears a market will as the resources of NEO and solar system planets suddenly becomes very very affordable. I think one estimate during the project was 5 cents a pound once it was all set up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPotentially you could just remove the fission material anyway and have a fusion pulse craft. I mean you can very well ignite deuterium or tritium now with laser, amateurs are doing it DIY at home. The problem is sustained fusion as sustaining the reaction burns the reactor out, but with pulse propulsion you don\u0027t need to sustain it as you are meant to do it in bursts. So that may be a option, one at least worth looking at anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the end of the day its only poltical will and safety concerns holding things back. And if the world gets desprate for resources in a century or so then the safety concerns dont become a issue if people are dieing even in the west from poverty.
