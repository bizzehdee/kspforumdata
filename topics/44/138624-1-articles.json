So that the intergalactic expansion of space-time should not have that much effect on the internal structure.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is dark energy, if dark energy acts in the vacuum of deep space the stretch\u00A0is being born by dark matter in intergalactic space and again what goes on in galaxies and the internal motion, given the contribution of dark matter to the motion of galaxies we would be hard pressed to see its effect. If dark energy acts ubiquitously, a concept in and of itself is difficult\u00A0to reconcile in a relativistally smooth manner, it is counteracting the force of gravity, then the graviational constant\u00A0would have problems. For example,\u00A0if you had a very dense body, like say Mercury, its gravitation constant would be much higher than a massive less dense onject like neptune. In addition it would completely counteract the affect of dark matter.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is all I want\u00A0to say given so little known about dark energy, the effects could be inverse scalar on energy load and could have miniscule effects in dense energy space and overwhelming effects in massless space, but even here we are unaware of the scale.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRather than predicting any effects on galaxies I suggest we wait until at least some science comes in and addresses descrepancies.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-01T22:46:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes.

It\u0027s an interesting question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause small objects like galaxies (wow, I just called galaxies small) are gravitationally bound, they won\u0027t be getting much bigger anytime soon. The closer you are to a massive object (like a galaxy or planet) the more it\u0027s gravity pulls on you. That\u0027s why most galaxies are not falling into each other unless they are very close (like Milky Way/Andromeda). Similarly, the expansion force is not very strong on objects that are held tightly together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImagine you are lying on your back on a sphere that is magically floating above the ground. A very large sphere would be quite comfortable to lie on, if it is many times larger than you. That is like what galaxies feel from the expansion force. If the sphere were smaller, it might be less comfortable, because the steeper curve pulls you down more. A sphere that was very small would hurt a lot! When you lie on your back on Earth\u0027s surface, can you tell it\u0027s round? Probably not. That\u0027s because you are so small compared to Earth that the amounts of it\u0027s circumference you encounter in daily life (unless you are an astronaut or something)\u00A0are not large enough to show any noticeable amount of curvature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is theorized that if the expansion of the universe continues to accelerate, eventually the expansion force would overcome gravity and galaxies, then even stars and planets, and finally atoms until the universe was full of nothing but the most basic sub-atomic particles, which would continue to move away from each other until no two particles are in each others\u0027 observable universes, and then literally nothing would happen ever again. Or maybe there would be another Big Bang. We really don\u0027t know what will happen. But that would only occur in over 10\u003Csup\u003E100\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0years, so we\u0027ve got plenty of time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo summarize, galaxies are not expanding significantly with the rest of the universe because they have strong gravity near them, and the expansion force isn\u0027t very strong over small distances.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope this helps explain your question!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Neriux","CreatedById":202160,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-05T03:49:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, your universe theories is great, but look at it as at bobble wave \u0022speed of light\u00A0effect\u0022.
