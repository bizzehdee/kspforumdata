Since you are orbiting a planet, this means the position of the planet seems to move around you and returns to your starting point after one rotation. In KSP this is most visible in the navigation ball. Your perceived orientation moves all the time, ending up where you started again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScenario B - blue triangles on the right: This is how I always imagined it. It is more like begin attached to a string and flung around. Looking down on the planet I would be facing the planet the entire orbit. Looking at space stations this also seems to be the logical way to go, but I might be entirely wrong.
