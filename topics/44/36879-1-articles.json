I *think* it represents the angle where the satellite would be at a given time, if it were on a circular orbit around the focus. But wikipedia is clear that it is actually a \u003Cem\u003Eparameter\u003C/em\u003E, not an \u003Cem\u003Eangle\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mean anomaly (M) can be found from the eccentric anomaly (E) and the eccentricity (e) via Kepler\u0027s Equation (which has no closed-form inverse): \u003Cem\u003EM = E - e*sin(E)\u003C/em\u003E. The mean anomaly is useful for finding the time at a certain point in an orbit, since the time of a given mean anomaly is just \u003Cem\u003Et = M/n\u003C/em\u003E (assuming M = 0 at t = 0), where n is called the mean motion, and is related to the orbital period (P) by \u003Cem\u003En = 2\u00C3\u00E2\u201A\u00AC/P\u003C/em\u003E. The mean motion is the constant angular velocity of this fictitious angle M.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I\u0027ve seen so far, it occurs to me that there\u0027s not really any advantage to treating M like an angle. It doesn\u0027t represent a physical angle, or interact with other physical angles, and it isn\u0027t involved directly in any trigonometric relations. Since it\u0027s just a parameter, what makes sense to me is to normalize it, by dividing by 2\u00C3\u00E2\u201A\u00AC, so that it varies from 0 to 1 during the course of an orbital period. Similar to the way that Plank\u0027s constant was normalized to create h-bar by dividing by 2\u00C3\u00E2\u201A\u00AC, we could define \u003Cem\u003EM-bar = M/2\u00C3\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, to get the time at a location in orbit, instead of dividing by a fictional angular velocity (\u003Cem\u003Et = M/n\u003C/em\u003E), we simply multiply by the orbital period (\u003Cem\u003Et = M-bar * P\u003C/em\u003E). This shows that M-bar, rather than being a fictional quantity, is merely the fraction of the orbital period completed thus far (t/P). Furthermore, we don\u0027t even need to define mean motion at all. We\u0027ve \u0022refactored\u0022 to eliminate two intermediate fictitious variables, and replaced them with a simple fraction of an existing physical variable. This seems much simpler and more intuitive to me than a non-existent pseudo-angle and its pseudo-velocity. (For example, saying M-bar = .25 makes it instantly clear that an object is a quarter of the time into its orbit, whereas M = 1.5707 may not be immediately recognizable as \u00C3\u00E2\u201A\u00AC/2, and therefore one quarter of 2\u00C3\u00E2\u201A\u00AC. And that\u0027s with just a simple fraction.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my question is, why don\u0027t we do this? I know its just a simple matter of scaling, but what is the point of scaling M to the range of 0...2\u00C3\u00E2\u201A\u00AC rather than 0...1? Is this merely a case of \u0022this is the way we\u0027ve always done it, and it works well enough\u0022, or is there some benefit somewhere to keeping M as an angle? Maybe a trigonometric relation that I\u0027m unaware of? I assume Kepler originally derived it in terms of angles, but that doesn\u0027t mean we need to stick with that notation if there\u0027s a cleaner, functionally equivalent notation.
