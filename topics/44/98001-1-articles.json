The presence of such a steam atmosphere during accretion may have significantly influenced the early thermal evolution of both Earth and Venus.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think a model that doesn\u0027t account for an early steam atmosphere is incomplete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E It turns out, our intuition (perhaps coming from evolving on a non-tidelocked planet) appears to be wrong.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not ready to say that based on one paper. As a molecular biologist... I\u0027m used to a whole lot more controls, and looking for other variables that could affect the outcome. You haven\u0027t linked the paper, but so far it sounds to me like the atmosphere model is too simple (considering only a CO2 atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECurrent thinking is that life on Earth was likely started around oceanic thermal vents. I could certainly see that happening in a tide-locked world setting.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot really, thats sort of the pop-culture interpretation, which is a little out of date. As per the RNA world hypothesis, when looking for the first life, we look for the first self replicating RNAs. We\u0027ve made a number of RNA directed RNA polymerase Ribozymes (that is, RNA that copies other RNAs).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt turns out, cryogenic conditions are actually much better for this to occur, and as water begins to free, inclusions in the ice start to concentrate various compounds. By some models, the first cells were more like ice bubbles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne should also consider where the nutrients form, vs where the life may start. The best conditions for the synthesis of the precursors (such as nucleotides of the RNA bases from formamide) often need heat, but then the best conditions for those bases to form a self replicating RNA seems to be a lot colder (so maybe they form in one set of conditions, and diffuse to another location with other conditions).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there\u0027s the observation that nucleic acids absorb strongly in the UV, possibly implicating exposure to light in abiogensis (ruling out deep sea vents, though life later could have moved there, and they\u0027d be a good spot for chemical precursors). Then we have to consider the first self replicating nucleic acids would lack a helicase enzyme -\u0026gt; but in the lab we replicate nucleic acid sequences without helicases by thermal cycling. Some studies suggest a Day-Night cycle would have provided that thermal cycling to allow separation of strands for the next round of replication -\u0026gt; perhaps some current near an undersea heat source could provide that, but the losses due to diffusion may be too high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the day/night cycle is needed for abiogenesis, then the tidal locking would have to occur slow enough for life to arrise first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere are plenty of other habitability issues (could you have a carbonate-silicate cycle without global oceans?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne also has to consider that when photosynthesis happened on Earth.
