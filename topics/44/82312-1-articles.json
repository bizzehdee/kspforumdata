I wanted to make something a bit more practical, so I\u0027ve been working on a safe electric launch system for model rockets. Excuse any circuit diagram errors or what have you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the whole setup:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aYg5nWc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022aYg5nWc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big white box is the launch controller, the little white box is the launchpad control box, exiting it is a couple of alligator clips connected to an igniter. The blue cable is just a standard network cable. I used standard RJ45 sockets for two reasons, one, I had them lying around, and two, with a crimping tool, you can make a cable any length you want. I also made sure to only use pins 3, 4, 5, and 6 on the sockets so that a digital telephone cable can be substituted for the CAT5 network cable, using socket reducers. The cable shown is just for show, when using the rig I use a 6m cable that I made up for extra safety.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/R9QSCA0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022R9QSCA0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wnOgD6w.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022wnOgD6w.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese images shows the control panel, with the two green test LED\u0027s lit up. Basically, the first LED tells you if the cable is plugged into the launchpad correctly, the second LED tells you if the igniter is functioning. The idea of these extra circuits is that you can do a little troubleshooting before launch, and after a failed ignition attempt. There\u0027s nothing more dangerous than pressing the GO button, seeing nothing happen, then walking over to the rocket and dicking around with it to see what the problem is. This can tell you if your igniter hasn\u0027t gone off, or if it did go off and just didn\u0027t light the rocket, or of there is a cabling issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/T0SqDnf.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022T0SqDnf.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShown here is a used igniter attached to the pad control box. It is just a pair of twisted solid core copper wires from a CAT5 cable, attached to a 10 Ohm resistor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IbaGdX8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022IbaGdX8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the MS paint schematic I drew up for the box. My end design was slightly different, I think I used two 10 kOhm resistors instead of one 100K resistor, and I have toggle switches instead of momentary switches because I bought the wrong ones. The voltage to the LEDs is a guestimation, but since they neither blow the globe nor fire the igniter prematurely, I haven\u0027t needed to change them. It uses two 9V batteries in series to give 18V. When the go button is pushed, 18v passes through the 10 Ohm resistor in the igniter, causing it to glow red and then self destruct after about 3 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve used it to reliably fire off about 10 small R-candy ignition charges, but yet to launch a rocket with it, as I live in an apartment and my upstairs neighbors would be upset if I poked a hole through their floor. I\u0027m sharing this mostly to show off what I\u0027ve learned, but also to share a bit of knowledge with anyone else who might be interested in amateur rocketry (as if there would be someone like that on the KSP forums...)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"indroth","CreatedById":115621,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-21T21:19:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Agent86\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Agent86\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E The voltage to the LEDs is a guestimation\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat really matters for an LED is the current.
