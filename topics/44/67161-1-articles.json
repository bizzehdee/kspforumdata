For those that don\u0027t know about this mission, it was the replacement for the chang\u0027e 3 mission in case something went wrong (like chang\u0027e 2, voyager 2 or viking 2) and will launch in 2015 (there are rumours it has been put back to 2016 though). It includes a lander and rover (name unknown, my personal suggestion is Jinglong-golden dragon) which will edited for a new mission, unsure what this is yet. I am very excited for this mission \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.
