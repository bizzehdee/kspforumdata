For most space launches, the most expensive part is actually the payload. It\u0027s probably some of the most sophisticated technology we have, designed to operate in the harshest of environments for possibly decades.\u003Cp\u003EFor things like supplies to the ISS, which could conceivably be a few thousand pounds worth of food, water, hammers and duck tape, this concept could really make sense. However, such a niche market does not currently justify the costs of getting an entire Big Dumb Booster industry off the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m amazed that this thread was revived last month, after such a long time. But, since it\u0027s active again, I guess I\u0027ll re-interate the key point I made earlier...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne word- fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe vast majority of the mass of any mission is fuel. That expensive, 10 kg probe might be 20% of the mission budget, but it\u0027s sitting on 90 kg of fuel that has to get it from Low Earth Orbit to its destination- and that\u0027s not cheap. In fact, part of the reason that the payloads are so expensive in the first place is to lower the required fuel mass. Ion thrusters, high-ISP resistojets; why do you think anybody uses these? Because the additional cost of the more complex and high-tech engines is much less than the reduced launch-costs from not having to lift as much fuel to orbit, and thus being able to use a lighter (and therefore, cheaper) lifter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the low-reliability variety of Big Dumb Booster (\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EREMEMBER- Big Dumb Boosters come in two varieties, the high-reliability ones like Sea Dragon, which are highly-reliable but just have terrible mass-fractions, and the low-reliability variants like Aquarius which have both terrible mass-fractions AND reliability, but *even lower* per-kg cost\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E), you can tell the engineers: \u0022hey, you\u0027ve got 20 kg\u0027s dry mass to play with on the probe instead of 10 kg, and can do it with lower ISP engines too\u0022 and lift 300 kg of fuel on separate Big Dumb Boosters (which can easily achieve 1/4th the per-kg launch costs or less), and *STILL* do the whole thing cheaper than with a smart rocket that can launch 100 kg to orbit in a single go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHAT is why that sub-type of Big Dumb Boosters make sense. It\u0027s not to launch the expensive parts of interplanetary or even trans-lunar missions, it\u0027s to launch the cheap parts: namely the fuel, food \u0026amp; water (for manned missions), extra coolant, spare parts (currently useful only for manned missions or ones operating close to manned stations- but DARPA is working on simple robotic repair probes that could perform some simple repairs and maintenance without the need for humans nearby...) etc. separate from the rest of the payload. You stock up more than what you need, and if the BDB fails to make orbit with the cheap payload, you just load another one up and try again (NOTE: you launch this stuff BEFORE the main mission, in case you need to try more than once...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EP.S.\u003C/strong\u003E I think there\u0027s been a lot of confusion about this issue, since there are actually two *entirely different* types of Big Dumb Boosters discussed in this thread. Low-reliability variants, like Aquarius, that achieve the lowest cost-per-kg of payload to orbit (even after accounting for a high rate of launch-failures) ; and high-reliability Big Dumb Boosters like Sea Dragon, which aren\u0027t as cheap as rockets like Aquarius, but are still much cheaper than conventional \u0022smart\u0022 rockets. High-reliability Big Dumb Boosters like Sea Dragon are \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eperfectly safe\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E to load extremely expensive payloads on. They don\u0027t necessarily fail more often than \u0022smart\u0022 rockets, in fact if anything with their more generous engineering margins they should fail LESS often- they just are much, much larger (and cheaper) rockets on the launchpad compared to the size of the payload they\u0027re launching...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EP.P.S.\u003C/strong\u003E Sea Dragon was designed to launch larger payloads than Saturn V because it was designed with single-launch Mars missions in mind (to avoid the need for orbital docking of multiple components, like in the modern-day \u0022Constellation\u0022 mission-plan). It was also designed to carry heavier payloads because the designers (correctly) assumed that if there was less price-pressure on the payload to shave every possible ounce off the mass, a heavier payload mass would result, as the optimal balance of launch costs vs. costs of shaving payload mass would be different with lower launch-costs. Let me emphasize that there is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eno reason\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E you can\u0027t design a Big Dumb Booster to carry a payload in the size-range of Saturn V, SLS, Ares V, Falcon 9, or even the Falcon 1 if you wanted. Big Dumb Boosters of this type are so-named not because they are necessarily large (in absolute terms), but because they are much larger \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ecompared to the size of their payload\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E than conventional \u0022smart\u0022 rockets with the same payload-capacity. Thus, a Big Dumb Booster with the lifting-capacity of Saturn V would be smaller than Sea Dragon, but bigger than Saturn V was, and a Big Dumb Booster the size of Saturn V would have a much smaller payload-capacity than Saturn V, but a much lower per-kg launch cost...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-03T08:54:44Z\u0022 title=\u002210/03/2015 08:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-03T08:51:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlmost all customers want a large payload placed in \u003Cem\u003Egeostationary transfer orbit\u003C/em\u003E with a high level of reliability; how much you can place into LEO with your fictional low mass-fraction booster is irrelevant in this case, because trying to boost further to relatively high-energy orbits like GTO with a low mass-fraction stage is a fool\u0027s errand.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-03T09:19:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kryten\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kryten\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlmost all customers want a large payload placed in \u003Cem\u003Egeostationary transfer orbit\u003C/em\u003E with a high level of reliability; how much you can place into LEO with your fictional low mass-fraction booster is irrelevant in this case, because trying to boost further to relatively high-energy orbits like GTO with a low mass-fraction stage is a fool\u0027s errand.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKryten, I think you miss two fundamental distinctions here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(1) The Big Dumb Booster\u0027s payload isn\u0027t necessarily \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Elarge\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.

The Big Dumb Booster will still be much cheaper despite its larger size, though, due to the much less precise construction/manufacturing techniques that the wider engineering-margins allow you to safely utilize without sacrificing reliability (if you are willing to take a hit to reliability as well, you can get even lower per-kg costs, with better mass fractions, though, like with Aquarius: but that is only suitable for cheap payloads like the fuel to get from LEO to GSO...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAnything that you launch to LEO is payload\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, by this definition.
