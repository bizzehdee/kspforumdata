Human desires are all over the place, although most people have basically the same set of desires (eat, sleep, fornicate) we all know of \u0022evil\u0022 people who desire the pain and suffering of other humans, it amuse them, it pleases them; heck we even know of freaks whose desires are bizarre, like \u003Ca href=\u0022http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/offbeat/2005-07-22-tickler_x.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eserial ticklers\u003C/a\u003E. So what exactly would a hyper-intelligent human do? I don\u0027t know, I\u0027m not hyper-intelligent so I can\u0027t think up or even comprehend what such a being would do, but I can put good odds that it could do very bad things! We know that regular humans can do evil things, and desires can be independent of intelligence. A Hyper-intelligent human is still going to want things human want, and most people at one time or another want power, want authority, now imagine having the intelligence to take over the economy and the world and getting absolute power coupled with a rather common human desire for such. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah to avoid such a fate with SAI, SAI will need to be programed with desires that keep it subservient to humans, SAI would need an index of desires very different from humans and very well programmed to avoid paradoxes. At present with WAI that not really a problem, because WAI don\u0027t really have desires other then \u0027process input spit out output\u0027. The only problem is that even if we make a WAI that can win a turing test it won\u0027t be able to build a bike, walk a dog, design a phone, etc, it won\u0027t be able to do anything other then win turing tests.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-12T23:00:40Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2014 11:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by RuBisCO\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eupdate\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vger","CreatedById":67603,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-11T20:36:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETest #2 genuinely freaked me out a couple times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENaa, no way this kind of tech isn\u0027t going to get abused \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
