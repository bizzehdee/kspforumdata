But the quote above and the visibly fine spinner and fan disc in the photos contradict the idea that it was a hit from a fan or compressor piece. In fact judging from the picture the gap between windows is well behind the compressor plane. The dents at the wing root are closer to that plane, and there are windows right above there. To me it looks like that for whatever reason the inlet cowling broke up, some part of it flew into the wing root,\u00A0up and behind from there hitting the fuselage on its way to history. Some part of the cowling probably went through the engine, but they are made from materials that the engines can pass without exploding. Just for this reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, and the second article mentions this having happened at around 30k feet, so we can pretty much forget about bird strike as the immediate cause.
