Earth will face the same fate as Venus, a runaway greenhouse, long before the red-giant phase of our sun. Based on what we know, it took 4 billion years to get to us... but with a star of our mass and our distance from the sun, we shouldn\u0027t have had 4 billion years. Smaller stars last longer, but then you get other problems - like light shifting to lower wavelengths, which don\u0027t penetrate atmospheres as well... at least atmospheres of our composition, which poses problems for photosynthesis and thus puts limits on life with high metabolic rates, and overall diversity and tiers to the \u0022food chain\u0022; or tidal locking (which depending on the variables, can cause the atmosphere to all freeze out on the dark side).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#5)\u00A0Given the rate of resource consumption of our civilization, it will probably be very short lived on the cosmic scale (lets say 10k years post industrial or less) unless we spread out into space.

In fact, given the speed at which the Galaxy can be colonized relative to the age of the Universe, or even just Earth, it seems that the first civilization to achieve interstellar travel is going to find the galaxy empty and theirs for the taking.

Creationists will insist that abiogenesis is impossible without some \u0022intelligent designer\u0022 - obviously this isn\u0027t\u00A0 true and not a subject that we should discuss... but it is worth considering that abiogenesis is actually quite improbable. I\u0027ve listened to/read many lectures/papers on topics related to abiogenesis. Many of these focus on some particular environment as being the place that this or that was formed. Its becoming a consensus that there was no one environment where life formed, but a variety of different environemtns producing different compounds in different areas that could then diffuse. \u0022Chemical evolution\u0022 and \u0022metabolism first\u0022 are often spoken of. Some essential compounds may have been forming in hydrothermal vents. Some compounds would only form in cryogenic conditions.

The particularly strong absorption of DNA/RNA to UV may not be a coincidence, but something that was essential when life was starting - here its important to note that atmospheric composition affects which wavelengths get through, and smaller stars will radiate less UV light and more IR light (IR and visible light being too weak to do much of interest for carbon based biochemistries)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Atmosfaerisk_spredning.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022300\u0022 src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Atmosfaerisk_spredning.png\u0022 width=\u0022588\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen we replicate DNA in the lab, we use a technique that you\u0027ve probable heard of...

When making DNA constructs, we use a dye that associated with DNA under UV light (well, now they have dyes that work with violet/blue light in the visible spectrum rather than UV), when cutting out a band of DNA, one would be careful to minimized the time of exposure to UV, because it does cause mutations. Too much energy can cause things to break apart, not enough energy, and the chemical reactions you need won\u0027t occur. There has to be a balance. For a given temperature and UV intensity, only certain combinations of start size and atmosphere will work. A red dwarf may warm a planet enough for liquid water, but with the energy shifted into lower wavelengths, the amount of UV is going to be less than what earth experienced. While low UV levels would generally be good for life now, it may be bad for the process of abiogenesis. Imagine if you needed a certain UV flux to get abiogenesis to occur, and that you simply won\u0027t get the right overlap of temperature and UV flux from red dwarves. If that were true, then the most common type of star in the galaxy/universe would presumably have no life bearing planets (but the tidal locking thing may also lead to the same conclusion, and even if not, the low visible light intensity would mean that the biosphere would not have as many trophic levels and not\u00A0be as rich in biodiversity as ours).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nData of the early ocean and atmosphere is missing.
