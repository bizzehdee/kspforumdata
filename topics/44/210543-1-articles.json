The expansion is \u003Cem\u003Eaccelerating\u003C/em\u003E. This means that there are no truly inertial reference frames in the universe. Everything is always accelerating, in 4d. Could this be the source of gravity? All mass distorts the fabric of spacetime as it resists this acceleration ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know it\u0027s more Issac than Albert, but to create my own rubber sheet analogy...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImagine the ubiquitous rubber sheet inside the ubiquitous space ship without a window, and you are accelerating at 1g. No way to tell you\u0027re not standing still on earths surface right? Equivalence principle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you put a marble in the middle of your rubber sheet and it makes a small dimple, a 3d analogue of a 4d gravity well. It looks exactly like it would look here on earth. But now you tweak the engine to increase the acceleration to say 1.5g. What happens to the dimple? It gets deeper right? It would look like the marble has gained \u0027weight\u0027. With the engine off, no matter how fast you are travelling, the marble will not distort the sheet, it has lost all of it\u0027s \u0027weight\u0027. If you can picture this all shifted up one dimension, you\u0027d say it had gained/lost \u003Cem\u003Emass\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy conjecture is that gravity is our 3d perception of the response of spacetime to mass being accelerated through 4d space.

I like this kind of conjecture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne correction/caveat. The concept of a 3D expanding balloon is often used to illustrate the idea of metric expansion of 2-space, which can then be used to conceptually understand the metric expansion of 3-space. However, the expansion of 3-space itself is not occurring \u0022in\u0022 4-space. The universe is (as far as we can tell) topologically flat; it should not be supposed that the 3D universe is expanding in a 4-dimensional hypersphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo with that understanding: yeah, I can\u0027t think of any specific reason why the stress-energy\u00A0momentum tensor that defines spacetime curvature in general relativity could not be the result of 4-dimensional acceleration. Whether true or not, it\u0027s certainly a great way to conceptualize it. However, if there is actul physical acceleration in 4 dimensions which causes gravity,, such 4-dimensional acceleration would be\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eindependent\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of the observable accelerating metric expansion of space. And we should be able to know this anyway because the rate of expansion of the universe has changed through its history, but there is no evidence that the degree to which mass curves space has ever changed through the universe\u0027s history.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-11-13T19:00:02Z\u0022 title=\u002211/13/2022 07:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 13, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by sevenperforce\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boriz","CreatedById":219053,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-13T20:21:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224198441\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210543\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221668365954\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157695\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sevenperforce\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n57 minutes ago, sevenperforce said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, the expansion of 3-space itself is not occurring \u0022in\u0022 4-space.

The basic description of general relativity is quite concise:\u00A0Space-time tells matter how to move; matter tells space-time how to curve. An object in a gravitational field isn\u0027t actually being acted on by an outside force; rather, it\u0027s simply following a straight line in curved space.

What is it about inertial mass which curves space? Why is it that space is always curved exactly the same amount for any specific amount of inertial mass? There\u0027s no apparent reason for this. You could imagine an object which has a lot of gravitational mass (curving space a lot) but little inertial mass, or an object which has a lot of inertial mass (high resistance to force) but very little gravitational mass, but that\u0027s never the case.

Special relativity tells us many things, but one thing it assures us of is that there is no way to tell the difference between acceleration of your reference frame and acceleration due to gravity. If you are in a box and you measure your local\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eg\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to be 3.721 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E, you\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0be on the surface of Mars. But you could also be in a spaceship accelerating at 3.721 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E, or you could be on an elevator on Earth accelerating downward at 6.09 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E, or you could be on the inner surface of a 744-meter-wide ring rotating at approximately 1 rpm. You don\u0027t know, and there\u0027s \u003Cstrong\u003Eliterally no way\u003C/strong\u003E for you to find out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsider the rubber-sheet analogy above. The rubber sheet is a 2-dimensional analogue of 3-space. If a 2-dimensional sheet is placed in a gravitational field with a vector perpendicular to the plane, then mass will quite obviously stretch the 2-dimensional sheet into that third dimension, causing simulated gravity. But we also know that acceleration fields are source-invariant. So if you have a rubber sheet on a spaceship which is accelerating at 1 gee perpendicular to the plane of the sheet, then the same thing will happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll we have to do, then, is add another spatial dimension. If 3-space is being accelerated through 4-space, then the resistance of inertial mass to acceleration will cause the 3-space to curve into the 4th dimension, causing gravity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boriz","CreatedById":219053,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-17T23:39:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224199818\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210543\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221668692128\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157695\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sevenperforce\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, sevenperforce said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the part that is wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry, poor choice of words.
