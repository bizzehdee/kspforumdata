I have a 1 TB in a OneDrive because I bought Office 365 for students with a license for four years :-) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI decided to use it some when I have the 1 TB given to me from Microsoft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could also recommend some good converter I could use these files from Fraps, because from what I remember, not all video editors, recognize them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast hotels could use some one recommend me a good program to record video from games that did not use a lot of computer resources, because my computer is not the newest, I bought it in 2008, then was pretty good, gave on it 2,000 z\u00C3\u2026\u00E2\u20AC\u0161 plus 300 z\u00C3\u2026\u00E2\u20AC\u0161 for Windows XP now I have Windows 8 (upgraded to 8.1 for free) for 300 z\u00C3\u2026\u00E2\u20AC\u0161. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy mother scolded me a little, for extravagance, we are not rich.

I used not to the rejection argument that the computer needs to learn :-), because I was studnet (though I\u0027m still a) said that the old computer breaks down (which was true). My mom\u0027s a little bit why I protested that buys a computer for 2000 z\u00C3\u2026\u00E2\u20AC\u0161 why not 1,500? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI said I deserve some fun after class at the university :-) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow again planning to buy a new computer because there are problems with lauching the newer games.
