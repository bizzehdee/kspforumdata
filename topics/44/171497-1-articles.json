However, truncated spheres cannot be oriented in such a way as to produce list, and therefore must enter ballistically, which is rather hard on the occupants. US entry vehicles have been conical, because a conical capsule (while not as efficient in terms of space used or launch vehicle size) can be steered to produce lift and adjust the rate of descent. Steering can also direct them more accurately to a particular point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemember that it is compression, not friction, which generates 99% of heat on re-entry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat we identify as temperature is based on the average speed of the individual molecules in the air around us. This is actually a pretty steady clip; the average speed of an oxygen molecule in the air around you right now is about 450 m/s. Each time an air molecule hits your skin, there\u0027s an exchange of kinetic energy; if you\u0027re warmer than your surroundings, the air molecule gains energy and so you feel cool; if you\u0027re cooler than your surroundings, the air molecule loses energy and you feel warm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHigh in the atmosphere, air molecules are moving much faster since they receive more direct heat from the sun, but molecules are few and far between and so there is less opportunity for thermal transfer, which is what allows water vapor to condense into clouds or even ice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen a re-entry capsule slams into the atmosphere, air molecules are pressed together faster than they can flow around the heat shield. This compression causes the molecules to collide with each other much more frequently, building up kinetic energy which eventually becomes so great that the molecules ionize and turn to plasma. The reason for the blunt-body shape of a capsule is not only to expose as much surface to the atmosphere as possible, making drag maximum, but to shape the flow of plasma such that most of the heat flows out around the capsule rather than being transferred to the heat shield. Most of the heat taken by the heat shield is actually due to radiative heating from the plasma (ionized air releasing photons which strike the heat shield) rather than thermal transfer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-01T14:52:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223307452\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022171497\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221519900303\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022174016\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zeiss Ikon\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, Zeiss Ikon said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFluid Dynamics does not coexist well with the desire for an exact mathematical description.\u00A0 Numeric methods are the rule, even at the theoretical end ...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd even then the proof\u00A0work can only be empiric.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223307557\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022171497\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221519913624\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157695\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sevenperforce\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n39 minutes ago, sevenperforce said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRussian capsules use a truncated sphere as their re-entry vehicles because this is the most efficient use of space.

That is why it was decided to go with the \u0022headlight\u0022 shape that the Soyuz uses\u2014a hemispherical forward area joined by a barely angled (seven degrees) conical section to a classic spherical section heat shield. This shape allows a small amount of lift to be generated due to the unequal weight distribution. The nickname was thought up at a time when nearly every headlight was circular.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-01T16:12:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223307519\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022171497\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221519910097\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022147660\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MaxwellsDemon\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, MaxwellsDemon said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E\u00A0 I\u0027m embarrassed to admit how recent it was that I finally \u0022got\u0022 why blunt-body reentry works better (heatwise, as well as brakingwise) than other shapes.\u00A0 I had taken it on authority, of course, figuring that someone else knew this stuff better than I did, but it took a while before I found an explanation (in an old NASA book, no less) that finally allowed all the pieces to fall into place for me.\u00A0 \u00A0Many things about space flight are counter-intuitive on the surface (although once clearly explained, they then make sense), since we\u0027re so accustomed to the way things work at the bottom of a gravity well in an ocean of air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe short answer is pretty surprising.\u00A0 All that heating doesn\u0027t come from friction (presumably some of it does, but it is a minor source), but from adiabatic compression of air.\u00A0 The advantage of the blunt body is that the highest temperatures happen *away* from the blunt body.\u00A0 The energy is converted to heat, the air around the capsule is heated and then routed around the capsule.\u00A0 You still need a heat shield (in real life, sometimes you can get away with the built in heat shields of KSP), but in the end you only have to shield your capsule from a fraction of heat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is more \u0022learned thanks to playing KSP\u0022 rather than \u0022learned while playing\u0022.\u00A0 The actual mechanism doesn\u0027t come up in play, you just aim your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E at 30k of Kerbin or so and watch your capsule come home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaxwellsDemon","CreatedById":147660,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-01T16:19:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0027Zackly, and through the same route...
