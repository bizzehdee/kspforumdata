Well, im ordering a 6V 3.5 W 583 mAh solar panel. for the storage battery, im using 4 1.2V 1500mAh rechargeable batteries. so the total are 4.8 V 6000mAh storage. and as you can see, my solar panel voltage is 1.2 V greater than my batteries. the question is, anyone knows how to reduce my panel voltage ? i really need this problem solved \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"N_las","CreatedById":31280,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-08T12:12:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomething like this? \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_divider\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_divider\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FajarTriRamadhan","CreatedById":125488,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-08T12:27:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edon\u0027t know for sure, cause im sucks about this \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Albert VDS","CreatedById":74055,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-08T12:35:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr you could solder a voltage 4.8V voltage regulator in between the solar panel en the batteries.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-08T12:53:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShort answer: If they\u0027re NiCds, use a series resistor \u0026amp; basic ohms law.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELonger answer:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf they\u0027re NiCd or NiMH batteries, you don\u0027t really need to worry about the voltage, so long as it\u0027s greater than the charged voltage of the battteries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat matters is charge *current*, and not over-charging the cells.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnsure you stay below the maximum charge rate specification for the cells you are using, generally specified as a fraction of cell capacity in mAh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo charge NiCd \u0026amp; NiMH cells properly, you really need a delta-peak (voltage) or temperature sensor charging controller to detect when they\u0027re \u0027done\u0027.
