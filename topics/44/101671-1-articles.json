Does it just damage vision in low light or certain color ranges?\n\nThat\u0027s not how glasses work anyway. Sun damages cells required for vision (they can and often do regrow, but that depends); glasses (mostly) correct for deformations in the eyeball or lense that defocus your vision.\n\nAnd indeed, low light vision is one of the first things damaged by looking into too bright things for too long. If you only filter out the UV parts of light, most of the sun is not that likely to cause permanent damage (but still can, so I strongly recommend against trying): the damage by visible and infrared light often heals, but this can take several weeks.\n\nGetting back to glasses, people needing them are at significantly less risk for two reasons (but again: don\u0027t try either way):\n\na) Their focus when looking at the sun might be less exact due to their glasses not being perfect.\n\n![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) Some types of glass, e.g. the usual one for windows, filter most of UV.\n\nBut as I said, you still should not try looking directly onto the sun unless using very strong and high quality filters.
