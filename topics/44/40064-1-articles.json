This prevented them from re-entering upside down because the capsule could only be in one stable orientation (right side up) when the drag on the capsule was aligned with the centre of mass. The slight offset would also give the capsule a small angle of attack such that it would create a bit of lift during the re-entry. The lift to drag ratio wasn\u0027t very good (about 0.3), but it was enough to allow for some guidance. Depending on which way the re-entry vehicle was positioned about its roll axis, the re-entry trajectory could be steepened (higher g\u0027s, higher heat flux, shorter heat exposure) or flattened (lower g\u0027s, lower heat flux, longer heat exposure).

The thruster\u0027s primary function was to orient the entry vehicle heat shield first prior to entry, to stop the cruise phase spin and to orient the re-entry vehicle about its roll axis during atmospheric entry. Precise orientation of the aeroshell about its roll axis was important because it allowed the guidance computer to keep the lift force pointed somewhere useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe article says that two 75 kg ejectable tungsten ballast masses were jettisoned minutes before atmospheric entry. Presumably it was necessary for the C of G to be on the axis of symmetry during the launch and cruise phases of the mission, and offset from the axis of symmetry during the EDL phase. As I mentioned previously, the offset C of G makes the entry vehicle stable in the blunt-end-forward orientation and causes the aeroshell to maintain a lift generating angle of attack.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerekL1963","CreatedById":57091,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T19:40:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Xeldrak\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Xeldrak\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027d say reentry is a problem - a sphere would have to stable position while entering the atmosphere, it could start to rotate along any axis.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, re-entry is a problem, but not for the reason you think it is.
