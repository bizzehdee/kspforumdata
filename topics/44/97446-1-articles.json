Dawn has observed a series of curved gullies on the surface of Vesta which scientists think have been caused by short-lived water flows. The water was probably buried under the ground in the form of ice, maybe brought by collisions with comets. New collisions, however, heated up the ice, melting it and causing the water to flow out of the crater walls and into the crater, depositing a bunch of materials in an alluvial fan. The gullies observed have been formed in the last two million years or so, so relatively very recently, so these processes might still be happening today. Obviously, because the temperature and the surface pressure are so low, the water probably evaporated soon after.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESource: the JPL website isn\u0027t loading on my computer at the moment, but whenever it does I\u0027ll leave the link here.
