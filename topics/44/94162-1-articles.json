Regarding your question, I can only guess at an answer. Initially, I would think using retro-burn, even when on a collision course, is for a more accurate landing-spot-trajectory. So suppose the landing-spot chosen was X before the mission starts. Mission then starts in the mini series and when preparing for re-entry, \u0022the team\u0022 notices the trajectory is not matching X, thus using retro-burn to adjust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am only guessing of course.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skyler4856","CreatedById":76452,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T22:06:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pawelk198604\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pawelk198604\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut i wonder why Alan Shepard used retro engines his flight was already suborbital so what is the point of using breaking rockets if the spacecraft will return to Earth on it it\u0027s own?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably to pin-point his landing location...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redjoker","CreatedById":68444,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T22:08:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAccording to Wikipedia, they were testing them to be used in later flights.
