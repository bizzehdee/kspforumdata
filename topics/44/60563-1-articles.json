Accordingly, a great deal of effort has been spent trying to make this effect\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022go away.\u0022 It doesn\u0027t, at least when it\u0027s not supposed to. While a complete discussion of validation efforts would fill\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea paper many times the length of this, the topic deserves at least some mention. Some of the validations include:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B7 Running the devices with the capacitors shorted. In this case, the currents flowing within the device are the\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esame, the mechanical operation is the same, but there is no capacitance and no effect is present.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B7 To rule out non-linear responses of the weighing diaphragm (of which some are generated during testing), runs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewere made energizing only the PZT or only the capacitors (the capacitors introduce negligible vibration into the\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esystem). Thus the mechanical vibratory modes were duplicated (when running only the PZTs), but unless both\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPZTs and capacitors were properly energized, the effect was absent. Also, holding the mechanical vibratory\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emodes constant, the effect was noted to scale proportionally to the power applied to the capacitor, while nonlinearities\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eshould scale with the level of vibratory activity. Finally, it was found operation in a vacuum greatly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ereduced the oscillatory response, while the stationary effect either remained constant or increased. Were the\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eeffect generated by non-linearity of the spring diaphragm, it would scale with the oscillatory amplitude of the\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ediaphragm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B7 Duplicating the EM environment within the test cell by running a device with unconnected capacitors, and\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eenergizing capacitors immediately adjacent, but unconnected to the device, without effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B7 Running the device in both horizontal and vertical modes to rule out coupling with the local gravitational field.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thrust produced was the same in both orientations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B7 Observing the presence of the effect using several \u0022garden variety\u0022 capacitors. While thrust produced was very\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elow and partially masked by the noise induced by the electromechanical activity of the capacitors, it was still\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eclearly identifiable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B7 Verifying that the output scales proportionally to the power applied to the capacitors, as predicted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B7 Noting that peak force outputs correspond with the measured peak, absolute accelerations of the capacitors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B7 Shifting the phase relationship between the capacitors and PZTs over a sequence of runs.
