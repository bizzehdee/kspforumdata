Surface brightness- the amount of light per unit of angular area of an image of an \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eextended object\u003C/span\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003Edoes not increase with aperture\u003C/strong\u003E. If you\u0027ve matched your focal plane array pixel size to some some small multiplier (like 1.0) of the size of a point source on the image plane- which you do if you want to squeeze the maximum amount of resolving power out of your system- then surface brightness of extended objects does not increase. In other words, as long as you match the pixel size to the some fixed constant of the size of a point source, then when you look at an extended object- like a planet, a nebula, a galaxy, etc.- \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ethen the number of photons falling on each pixel is the same\u003C/span\u003E, regardless of whether you\u0027re hooked up to 20 mm telescope or a 2000 mm telescope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if you\u0027re willing to use pixels that are not fixed in size with regards to the angular resolution of the telescope, then you CAN increase the number of photons hitting each pixel by going with a short (small) f-ratio. This is what is meant by \u0022fast\u0022 telescopes- they have short focal lengths and have low power (for their aperture size). \u0022Fast\u0022 originated from the world of photography; you could take images of faint objects faster with \u0022fast\u0022, small f-ratio telescopes, because they concentrated more light per unit area on the film. HOWEVER, their resolution suffers because of this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, it is important to understand that how \u0022fast\u0022 an imaging system is has nothing to do with its aperture; it is \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Esolely\u003C/span\u003E dependent on the f-ratio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a similar situation as to what occurs in visual astronomy, which I\u0027ve been doing for over 20 years now. The pupil of the human eye cannot open wider than about 7 mm. This means that if the cone of light entering your eye is wider than 7 mm, you are wasting light from your telescope. The diameter of the light cone as it enters your eye is known as the \u0022exit pupil\u0022. To calculate it, you just need to divide the telescope\u0027s aperture by the magnification.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay I\u0027ve got a 200 mm telescope operating at a 7 mm exit pupil. That\u0027s 28.6X. Let\u0027s compare that to a 400 mm telescope operating at a 7 mm exit pupil- 57X. Let\u0027s say we\u0027re looking at the Orion nebula. The 400 mm telescope gathers 4X more light, but must be operated at TWICE the magnification. This means that the light that is gathered is spread over 4X more area. So, while the bigger telescope gathers more light, it spreads that light over proportionally more area. The surface brightness- \u003Cem\u003Ethe amount of light per unit area of the image\u003C/em\u003E- does not change. The Orion nebula appears larger and more detailed in the bigger telescope, because \u003Cem\u003Ethe larger a low surface brightness object is, the easier it is for a human eye to see it\u003C/em\u003E. Sometimes, this is perceived as the object being brighter, because in truth, the total brightness of the magnified object has increased by 4X because it\u0027s area is 4X larger. But the brightness per unit area has not changed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is actually a \u0022law\u0022 in optics- that optics cannot increase surface brightness- and I\u0027ve read about it elsewhere. I forgot the name of it though.
