For starters, the planet would need to be much colder than earth to retain its atmosphere. It takes 11km/s to escape earth but only 3.4km/s for Kerbin, this means that at earth temperatures a significant fraction of light molecules (Oxygen, nitrogen, water) would move faster than escape velocity due to thermal effects. Thus the atmosphere would bleed into interplanetary space within a few weeks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey simply made the planets 10 times smaller to reduce travel times and dV requirements.
