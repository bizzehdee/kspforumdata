I\u0027ve been thinking about this recently, and wanted you guys\u0027 opinion:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the advances in technology, we\u0027ve been able to run simulations (especially games), and they\u0027ve been getting more and more detailed recently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese simulations have varying degrees of detail, with KSP, for instance even\u00A0simulating physics on planetary scales. Other games, like FPS, can simulate ballistics and advanced movement (ArmA, for instance). Powder Toy can simulate chemistry/physics (I managed to build an ion engine there, was quite difficult), and neural networks can simulate small-scale evolution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis got me thinking, what if our \u0022reality\u0022 is actually a simulation run by much more advanced beings? Can they interfere with it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf that was the case, then what about our simulations? Could a player in a FPS game, for instance, be controlling an actual being from within the simulation without it knowing?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill considering the shooter game, that being would know nothing that\u0027s not in the simulation. It would not know nothing but that it had to shoot specific things, that it could move and do specific things, and should avoid being shot. It wouldn\u0027t be able to know anything not explicit in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThink of it like this. Imagine a sentient being that lived in a 2D universe for its entire life. It would only be able to think about going forwards, backwards, left and right. It wouldn\u0027t be able to know about up nor down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mind of the simulated being would be similiar: in the shooter game, it wouldn\u0027t be able to think about anything outside what the game can offer. It wouldn\u0027t be able to think about what\u0027s outside the game map. It wouldn\u0027t be able to think about doing something that\u0027s not possible in the game. All it would know is what is present in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat brings me to my next point, its senses: It would only have two senses, vision and hearing, since we\u0027re only able to simulate that (screens and speakers). In the shooter game, what it would see is only what\u0027s being rendered on the screen (HUD included), and what it would hear is only what goes through our speakers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, if our universe was a simulation: every sentient being would be controlled by a \u0022real\u0022 being\u0027s inputs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, there\u0027s a problem with the simulated universe theory, the resources needed to simulate every single subatomic particle,\u00A0and forces,\u00A0etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut what if only what\u00A0sentient beings are seeing is being simulated (rendered?)? As in, everything that we don\u0027t see is \u0022on rails\u0022, like a ship that you\u0027re not controlling in KSP (one interesting thing about this thought is the \u0022if a tree falls and there is nobody around to hear it, does it make a sound\u0022 question). Bacteria would only be \u0022actually\u0022 simulated when you use means to see them, for instance. That would reduce the need for resources immensely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout our senses and sentience: Our sentience is due to being controlled by a \u0022real\u0022 being, just like in\u00A0a singleplayer game,\u00A0the only character that can actually think is the one you\u0027re playing as (This tackles the concept of \u0022souls\u0022, but I really don\u0027t want to bring religion into this). Our senses is what the \u0022real\u0022 beings have managed to simulate, just like we have screens and speakers to simulate video and sound, they must have other devices to simulate smelling, tasting and touching, creating the possibility that we actually have less senses than them, and that our reality is simpler than theirs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, basically, in my mind: simulations, like games, create realities. Our reality might be one of those simulations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bad thing is that there\u0027s no evidence to support this, and I don\u0027t think it\u0027s possible to prove the existence or non-existence of our reality. So this might be more of a philosophical theory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d like to read what you guys think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-13T02:14:36Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2016 02:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Guest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vger","CreatedById":67603,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-13T02:24:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t have too much more to add to this, but there\u0027s a three-page thread on the topic from a while back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/70156-could-our-universe-just-be-a-experiment/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt amazes me just how much popularity the idea has been given lately though, including actual experiments being done to try and prove it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-13T02:26:00Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2016 02:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by vger\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Findthepin1","CreatedById":139989,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-13T12:26:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027d care about Kerbals a lot more if it turned out to be true.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-13T13:44:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222628525\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022141698\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221465783896\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022152223\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aperture Science\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 hours ago, Aperture Science said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mind of the simulated being would be similiar: in the shooter game, it wouldn\u0027t be able to think about anything outside what the game can offer.

Like the Matrix, if we found out the universe was a simulation, we could start looking for ways to hack it. Just one example, if this is a simulation, then matter can most certainly be created and destroyed. You could become the Neo of cheese and feed 5000 people with just two blocks of it. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u00A0 I feel like I vaguely remember a story or RPG from long before the Matrix, where our universe was simulated and people who learned how to break the rules were \u0022sorcerers,\u0022 and were responsible for a lot of legendary/mythological figures in history.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ve joked a few times that cold fusion was a hack, and patch notes the next day read, \u0022Fixed an exploit that allowed humans to get free energy.\u0022 Hopefully they don\u0027t do the same thing with the EMDrive. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course!
