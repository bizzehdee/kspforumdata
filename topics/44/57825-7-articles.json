The only reason so many astronauts died in Shuttle accidents is because it has a crew size that\u0027s more than 2 times the size of a Soyuz crew. This has been covered already in this thread, but I\u0027m guessing you didn\u0027t read that far back. That\u0027s akin to saying that 747\u0027s are vastly less reliable than single engine Cessna 172\u0027s because they\u0027ve killed more people, even though there are considerably more Cessna crashes per flight hour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, as has also been pointed out, the Challenger disaster wasn\u0027t so much a design flaw with the shuttle as it was a serious flaw with NASA\u0027s management. The temperature was extremely cold that day and the engineers responsible for designing and constructing the SRBs warned NASA management that the temperature was well outside the design specs for the SRBs and that they should postpone the launch until a warmer day. NASA management acknowledged these warnings and promptly launched anyway, which resulted in the overly brittle o-rings failing during ascent, as the engineers cautioned. Soyuz would likely fail as well if it was launched well outside of it\u0027s design specifications against the warnings of it\u0027s design engineers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yes.

As I\u0027ve previously pointed out, the Shuttle had a far more complex series of design requirements than the Soyuz, which resulted in a vastly more complex craft. Now in any engineering endeavor adding complexity is going to reduce reliability. It\u0027s a simple fact.

Yes, there was some concern that Columbia might have been damaged by a foam strike once it was in orbit, but by that point it was already too late to abort the launch (obviously). Sure, they might have sent up a rescue shuttle, but either way, unless that rescue shuttle was carrying EVA gear and orbital repair materials then the Columbia orbiter was doomed the instant that foam hit the wing. So while Challenger could have been averted simply by listening to the design engineers (or following the design specs) and aborting the launch, there was no quick fix for Columbia.

If you need to scale up to Shuttle\u0027s scale, just make 3 of them.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, yes, Soyuz is cheaper than a shuttle launch, and you might even be able to launch multiple Soyuz to achieve the same kind of crew transport capacity, but that doesn\u0027t change the fact that it\u0027s still JUST a crew ferry. It can\u0027t do anything else. It can\u0027t be used in the construction of space stations, the deployment or maintenance of satellites, or to conduct orbital science experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, keep in mind, the Shuttle costs around 450 million per launch, according to NASA. Meanwhile, in a recently signed contract, Soyuz costs NASA 70.7 million... per seat. Now, admittedly, the Shuttle cost doesn\u0027t appear to factor in the initial research and development costs, which are considerable, but Soyuz isn\u0027t as cheap as you think, which is why I think the Dragon Rider is going to provide pretty strong competition in the crew ferry market in the coming years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, why would you need to scale down the Shuttle? If you only need to ferry a few astronauts to something in orbit and then return them safely, then use a dedicated crew ferry like Soyuz or the upcoming Dragon Rider. As I have pointed out time and again to seemingly deaf ears, the two craft were designed for very different missions. The Soyuz is a capable crew ferry, absolutely. However, for larger crew capacities, heavy satellite launches, in orbit satellite servicing, orbital construction, or science missions, the Shuttle has got it beat, simply because none of those things were design requirements for Soyuz, while they were for the Shuttle.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-02T04:58:12Z\u0022 title=\u002201/02/2014 04:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Firov\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T09:59:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShuttle vs Soyuz is a pointless argument, since there isn\u0027t any question of choosing one or the other.

The Shuttle is supposed to do nearly everything, while the Soyuz is part of a larger fleet. The Russians can launch station modules on things like the Proton-K while the Soyuz is the crew ferry. The Shuttle is both the station launcher and the crew ferry. Very different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat can be discussed is conventional rockets vs. shuttles. In that discussion I\u0027d argue for the conventional rockets. They can do everything the Shuttle can, except for returning large quantities of cargo from orbit, but due to them being more versatile launchers (scalable stages and scalable payload sizes vs. a single design and limited cargo bay) I\u0027d choose them over the Shuttle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"koshelenkovv","CreatedById":53764,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T17:12:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Firov\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Firov\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso, keep in mind, the Shuttle costs around 450 million per launch, according to NASA.
