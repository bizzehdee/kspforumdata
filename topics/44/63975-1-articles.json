No, since the average separation between asteroids is approximately 16 times the distance between the Terra and Luna, ships in the asteroid belt might never even see an asteroid. The only place you\u0027ll find asteroids that densely spaced is in the rings of Saturn.\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real reason to use Saturn as the background for a game or novel is because combat in a dense asteroid field is really cool. But we can make additional justifications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe then goes on to elaborate lots of neat ideas on what could be mined (stuff like Helium3 or ice for terraforming Mars). But those are all good ideas for why humans would travel there, not why they would be fighting among the rings. So I was wondering... what if humans mining the rings for the ice there might cause the rings to deform, spread out, or even be permanently destroyed. I\u0027m guessing some mining techniques would be wasteful and spread some sort of dust and debris pollution all over the Saturnian system. If this was really possible it would be a valid concern to the local colonists, I can totally imagine the first-generation colonials crying out as the mega-corporations started setting up excessive sweep mining, ripping up large portions of the rings. It might bother them enough that rebellions and civil wars would spark between space stations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut... could we ever actually disrupt the rings like that, even with advanced future tech? Just how much ice and rocks are in the rings? How long have the rings existed anyway? If it\u0027s more than a billion years or so they must be inherently very very stable, despite the gravitational perturbations and impacts with stray asteroids they must regularly experience. I\u0027ve googled this and I can\u0027t find much clear info.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-22T17:59:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWiki article\u003C/a\u003E has some good information:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAggregate mass of rings: 3 x 10^19 kg or 3 billion billion metric tons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAge: Possibly as little as 100,000,000 years or as much as 4,000,000,000 years\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only way I can think of to significantly disrupt the rings is to introduce some massive body, maybe one of Saturn\u0027s larger moons, into an elliptical orbit that intersectsthe rings.
