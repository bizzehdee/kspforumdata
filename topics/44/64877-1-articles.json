That would require being able to gain about 2 km/s of speed from flapping (not to mention he would have to bring along a rocket motor to circularize at apoapsis). That requires the same kind of propulsive power as it would on Earth (gravity not important here).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for how long he could fly, the method they were analyzing in the article was with a wingsuit. These are gliders with very bad L/D ratios. They can\u0027t be flapped for extra velocity. I would imagine he could fly a few tens of meters, then run a few steps and jump again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat people are usually talking about when they say people could fly on Titan without engines is with a bird-like mechanical wing that they flap themselves with their arms. I imagine the calculation goes something like: \u0022how much power does a bird need to keep up airspeed by flapping? Scale this to the weight, required speed, and density of flying in Titan\u0027s atmosphere to get the power required by a person at Titan. How much power can a person supply for a sustained length of time using their chest and arm muscles?
