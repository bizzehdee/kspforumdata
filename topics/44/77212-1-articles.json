Instead of bringing your coolant to your fission fuel you bring the fuel to the coolant. This results is a higher operating temperature and thus better efficiency. These reactors can also be pretty small, so they\u0027re more suitable for aerospace applications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThF4 is the same idea as UF4, except it uses Thorium as a fuel. This has some benefits and some downsides. Most notably, thorium is much more abundant than Uranium and it can work at slightly higher operating temperatures, but thorium isn\u0027t fissile without some serious preparation, much more than Uranium.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EU2N3 is again a uranium salt, but I can\u0027t find much info on this. I presume it simply runs on a higher temperature. It also doesn\u0027t require fluor during its production, which is a horrible horrible substance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E-Actinide production and why is bad for your reactor?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActinides are created when the Uranium atoms in your fuel are hit with neutrons/protons/alpha particles and transmute into other metals.
