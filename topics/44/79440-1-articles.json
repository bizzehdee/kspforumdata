There rockets ranged from the Kayser 1 to the Kayser 128 ( the number being how many tons they could get in to a low stable orbit). They all weighed 100 tons heavier then their payload. The rocket used CRPUs (Common Rocket Propulsion Units) these CRPUs had thrust control ranging from 100%-40%, this was a liqui fuel design that could not be shut down. It also did not need fuel pumps and moved the fuel by pressure alone. The design of each rocket was Danny2462 on steroids in the 70\u0027s, having a cluster of rockets that used parallel staging (as in the outer layer would decouple and the next would activate, if a rocket needed to lift more than the literal solution was adding MOAR BOOSTARS. The CRPUs were cheap and required no fancy equipment or fuel, the outside of the rocket was made of steel (but could use aluminum if necessary), they were mass produced around 1000 CRPUs a year so they were cheap and had a burn time of 280 seconds . Finally, because of its simplicity and lack of complicated parts it had a low failing chance and if it failed it could be built faster and cheaper than if a space shuttle, Orion, etc. crashed, but alas the company had made some bad decisions made by Kayser the company was torn apart by political chaos and was ended around 1980.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.

And it works pretty dang well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my version, the KOTRAG Kayser 16. It can lift 15.4 tons into LKO (100km) with two stages. All thrust units are identical except of course the inside 4 don\u0027t have decouplers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stages seem very consistent. The first stage had a TWR of about 1.1, the second of about 1.2. The second stage had about 1/3rd of its fuel left at 100km orbit. So the math seems very sound.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe total cost is 102,000... whatever they spend on Kerbal. But it\u0027s 102,000 of them. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E That includes the payload. I\u0027m not sure how this compares to getting 16 tons into orbit with regular staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/d3GDUAd.png\u0022 alt=\u0022d3GDUAd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EEV7RMu.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EEV7RMu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing to try a 3-stage version later. The only real problem I\u0027ve encountered is that with all those rockets decoupling, the potential for disaster is high. However, some Sepratrons would fix that. Also, some struts are required, but not many, really only one per rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EETA: I created a non-OTRAG version of similar DV and it was only 51,800. So saving money doesn\u0027t seem to be in the cards. But it\u0027s a fun way to get to orbit. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E And you can do it almost from the very start of the game. The engines are all LV-T45\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EETAA: I\u0027ve been thinking about this wrong. I don\u0027t need a 3rd stage, I need a 3rd ring. The 2nd and 3rd ring will both be part of the 2nd stage... or maybe even part of the 2nd ring will be part of stage 1, and part will be stage 2.
