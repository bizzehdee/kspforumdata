Unfortunately it is also one of the trickiest when it comes to building any reliable foundation for which questions we\u0027d need to ask. The number of unknowns and the vastness of the unknown make it near impossible to know if we are asking the right questions.\n\nFor starters, we still have no definition of where the line between life and no life is, at least not one everybody can agree on. Even something as \u0022simple\u0022 as defining species is a task that is horribly difficult and one that keeps coming back, reminding us that nope, we still haven\u0027t figured out this species business, and that\u0027s just for life here on Earth.\n\nNext is, it seems that every new planet we discover outside our own solar system opens up a whole new package of questions on how planets are formed, and ultimately how many planets are there in the first place?\n\nThere is more but for starters it should be a reminder that there are only a few things we know:\n\n All our theories on Life, Universe and Everything are up for fundamental changes without warning, which can turn all our calculations into irrelevant scribblings we\u0027d be embarrassed to show anyone.\n\nWe have not seen any trace of alien civilisations and we are absolutely clueless as to the actual why. The theoretical whys we have a much better grasp on. We have theories. Some good, some not so good but no matter how good, they are still only theories and one weakness of theories is the uncertainty: Are we asking the right questions at all?\n\nThe Karadshev scale is purely hypothetical. It is based on what we do know and what we think we know and what we know until we learn we didn\u0027t know after all as well as speculations, guesswork and assumptions and the hope that we by a fantastic stroke of luck managed to ask the correct questions. Same for all models, scales and explanations. We can only hope we got it right.\n\nThat is... until we get hard evidence that there really are someone out there. The Question is intriguing but I\u0027m wondering if it\u0027s more a philosophical question than a scientific one, for the time being. It\u0027s very much like questions like \u0022is there a God?\u0022, \u0022are parallel Universes a physical reality?\u0022, \u0022is there something outside our Universe? Like more Universes?\u0022. Questions we can\u0027t find the answer to, scientifically. Intriguing, exciting but scientifically not really relevant.\n\nSo, should we stop looking? No, why should we? If there is something out there then the probability of us discovering it is not zero. Might be depressingly low but it is not zero.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T04:32:42Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 04:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LN400**"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T06:06:31Z","Content":"Just imagine a typical light bill in the Galaxy Capital, with its energy prices, and you see: there is no \u0022Fermi paradox\u0022.\n\nThere is just a \u0022saving every dime\u0022.

Granted, it\u0027s \u0022the only way to be sure\u0022, but...\n\nAs has been mentioned, the universe is a big place, and so is our home galaxy. But while individual star systems are tiny compared to galaxies, and planets tiny to star systems, they are still huge in an absolute sense. It\u0027s taken us tens of thousands of years to truly explore and settle our home planet, and it can conceivably take tens of thousands of years to truly explore and settle our home system. That should absorb most of our exploratory energies before embarking on a serious program to colonize nearby stars, let alone the entire galaxy. \n\nWhile there may be some groups that will want to go to the stars before that point, they will face a huge barrier: economics. Interstellar travel requires a huge investment in resources, and any interstellar adventurers or manifest-destiny groups would have to get those resources from whatever governments exist at the time. Chances are, these governments - and the societies represent - will only give enough resources to exploration that they think they can spare, which may not necessarily be enough to build even one starship. \n\nTo understand this, let\u0027s take a look at current world spending for space exploration. The best estimates I can find give global space exploration budgets in 2013 at approximately $72.1 billion. The Gross World Product for that same year, according to the World Bank, sits at $75.59 **trillion**. So, space exploration consumed roughly 0.095% of the GWP. Let\u0027s be generous and round it up to 0.1%. This is our baseline, and shows the general priority our species places on space exploration. Barring some fundamental shift in human thinking - which can neither be ruled out nor counted upon - we can safely say that this will be the level of funding compared to total economic strength for the lifetime of our civilization. As Gross World Product rises (and eventually becomes Gross System Product - the total GDP of an entire solar system), space funding will also increase - *but will still remain the same percentage of the GWP / GSP.*\n\nNow that 0.1% is not just one program, but many. Future explorers will find their interstellar dreams must compete with other programs - planetary colonization and development (including terraforming), continuing exploration of the home system, SETI, planetary monitoring, solar monitoring and space weather tracking, etc. So our starship-builders find they will have to content themselves with a smaller chunk of the very tiny piece of the GWP pie. We can safely say therefore, that, barring a sudden need to launch a starship Right. Freaking. Now!, a starship will only be built once the cost of building and launching one fits nicely inside that 0.1% either by the GWP climbing to a nicely wealthy level, or sudden science and technological breakthroughs lowering the needed cost, or both. \n\nBut let\u0027s say that happens. Say a thousand or two thousand years from now, the resources are available, the starship is launched, and a new colony is founded. Hooray! The colonists of a new system now have an entire solar system to explore and settle, and will likely go through the same cycle of local, in-system expansion consuming all their energies before they start looking to the stars again. Their exploration budget will likely be a larger percentage of their GWP at first, but will drop to that same 0.1% as the colony expands and matures and more people become interested in building lives for themselves where they are, than fulfilling some nebulous \u0022manifest destiny\u0022 to Conquer The Galaxy for Mankind. So, once again, those wanting to go to another star must go, cap in hand, to their governments and ask for the needed slice of resources of that 0.1% to build the starship. Once again, the governments will not yield that slice from other, more practical and urgent programs until and unless they can safely afford it, or until and unless a Pressing Need to build a starship presents itself. Lather, rinse, and repeat for every interstellar colony that is successfully seeded. \n\nThose few million years to colonize the galaxy is suddenly looking like it needs a lot more time to complete. Starships remain possible, but become much rarer, and hence less detectable. \n\nFor those who may despair at the thought of several thousands of years between starships, or argue \u0022but exploration is in our NATURE!\u0022, I would remind them that the civilizations launching those starships are still living full \u0022lives\u0022, and that exploration of a single star system by its inhabiting civilization (either native-grown or seeded) will provide a healthy sink for exploratory urges. We may dream of colonizing the stars today, but Mars, Europa, Titan, and other in-system worlds are much closer, and many more people dream of exploring and settling those worlds than do those of settling the stars. \n\nWe can expect similar attitudes among alien civilizations, even though the particulars will vary. Economics, like physics, is universal, and any alien civilization must deal with finite resources and decide how to best divide them to satisfy its needs and wants.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-09T02:30:11Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2015 02:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AndrewBCrisp**\n  \nRemoved a couple of phrases that were questionable in tone.

Still, we can\u0027t expect that ALL theoretically possible civilizations end the same way.

I know what the responses to this statement will be, but I do not imagine that any descendant of human civilization, no matter how numerous, will find use for the entire output of a star. Of course it looks to us like all roads lead upwards, that we will always be doing more with more. We haven\u0027t yet found that we just don\u0027t need more energy, and we\u0027re not even starting to level off. But we\u0027re at the beginning of our journey. The fact that our energy use continues to climb is not evidence that it will do so in the future, when only a few short generations ago, muscle power was the primary source of energy for manufacturing and agriculture. \n\nAs for interstellar travel, I... Well, I\u0027m a romantic. I like to imagine that we have a grand destiny among the stars. But will it ever really be to the personal benefit of enough people to spend the vast resources needed to confine themselves and their offspring to a box for a thousand years before they face an uncertain future on a marginally habitable world? What could we do to the earth to render it uninhabitable? We could turn it into an airless, arid, barren, lifeless wasteland. Compared to interstellar space it would be paradise. If you can survive for a thousand years in space, do you really need a planet?\n\nDoes that mean that our descendants may die here, prematurely, from a gamma ray burst, cursing their short-sighted forebears? Yes, perhaps it does. But I don\u0027t see us making the sacrifices necessary to get us to other star systems, and there are good reasons for us not to. What has always mystified me about the Fermi paradox is the assumption that of course a civilization would colonize the stars unless they died first. I don\u0027t know why they would try.\n\nProbably not a popular opinion here, and I don\u0027t like it much myself, but it\u0027s what I\u0027m left with after decades of thinking about this."},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T03:57:32Z","Content":"We are experiencing a great filter right now- getting to space is hard with no immediate or near future benifit. Who cares if the sun explodes in however many billion years?\n\nThere was an article about how planets might be even easier to create life on if they\u0027re different from earth... but some of those suggested changes (larger, ect) would make it even more difficult to reach space than it is to do so from earth. Earth is only marginably habitable, but it may actually be one of the easier life-giving worlds to escape from, and we have nearby near-habitable worlds that could hypothetically be colonized- our co-orbiting airless partner, a frozen desert, a hell-planet with a temperate upper atmosphere, even a frozen icemoon protected by it\u0027s parent planet. (that\u0027s Callisto, not Europa- Europa\u0027s in the radiation belt, Callisto is just outside)\n\nBut even with our advantages, we are more concerned with our own affairs than expansion, even though we are ineviably dooming our civilization. While we have individuaals striving to reach past this great filter (SpaceX\u0027s Mars Colonial Transpoirter, various moonbase ideas, venus cloud city concepts) naysayers constantly point out the challanges and impracticality of it. What\u0027s the point?\n\nIf technological life cannot even get off it\u0027s home planet, what chance does it have of seeding a galaxy? How many civilizations are out there who made the same choice, to ignore space and become cyber-utopias? What are the odds of a civilizations making that leap not once, to just the planets of their own system, but again to the stars?\n\nSpace isnt a sea, it\u0027s a desert. We are one of the first creatures to stick our heads out of the sea and flop arround on land, but we do not have the lungs to survive away from home.
