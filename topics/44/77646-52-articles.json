TL;DR: Not worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Our first satellite (Let\u0027s call it KerbSat-1 for the time being, that isn\u0027t an official name) will be taken to \u003Cstrong\u003ELEO\u003C/strong\u003E as a \u0022secondary payload\u0022 for another launch.

We\u0027ll test things like control algorythms, tracking, ground stations, thermal protection, etc. It will be used to test things and to show everyone that we can manage a spacecraft successfully. As a bonus, we\u0027ll put a biological experiment on it. The experiment will consist (roughly) of two chambers with moss in them. First, the satellite will use a counterweight to spin up to 0.16 Gs and then pour water into the first chamber, to see how well it can develop on lunar gravity. When that experiment is completed (at least a couple of weeks), it will accelerate to 0.4 Gs and pour water into the second chamber, simulating martian gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) The second satellite doesn\u0027t have a definitive destinity.
