Subsequently, the Department of Defense and Lockheed Martin agreed to forgo production of the A5H. Although the most capable version of the Atlas V is not designated a \u201Cheavy\u201D launcher, its lift capacity places it in the heavy-lift launch category as defined by the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\u003E \n\nI don\u0027t think there\u0027s much market for heavy EELV\u0027s (at least at ULA pricing), given that Delta IV Heavy launched only 9 times in the past 12 years. And none of them were commercial launches. As for USAF, they can\u0027t buy many more Atlas V\u0027s because of the RD-180 embargo.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-01T05:45:43Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2016 05:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by cryogen**"},{"CreatedByName":"DDE","CreatedById":146349,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-13T21:49:55Z","Content":"[@Bioman222](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/30364-bioman222/), I found another case of the RD-170 being a miracle worker.
