When I was younger when it deorbited I was like \u0022Oh man what a waste\u0022 but doing some further reading made me realize it\u0027s probably for the best. As they say that\u0027s the nature of space flight, As Kennedy said \u0022It\u0027s hard\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want people to think about the reality of money in this regard. Some people say we should spend $0 on space flight \u0027because we got problems on earth\u0027, I disagree with that logic for many reasons. However while I support human space flight, I used the \u0022Fix the American flag\u0022 as a extreme example to drive home a point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an American I would in fact like our bleached white american flag (I do wonder if the side facing the dirt would have any color, or would it be bleached too by general radiation exposure vs just UV exposure?) to not be laying in the dirt on the moon. However It would be an incredible waste of human life to do so. That\u0027s what people need to think about when they talk about recovering the ISS. Money is an abstraction of human labor or creativity\u00A0and the value we put on that. When Tax dollars go to space flight it\u0027s essentially either taking by threat of violence people\u0027s money, or more realistically asking peoples children, grandchildren, or yet unborn generations to pay for it at the threat of violence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo in general when I advocate human space flight, I always try to keep in mind just what a \u0022billion\u0022 dollars really means. People only live so long, they only pay so much taxes before they retired or die, that is money they don\u0027t get to spend on themselves. That represents a percentage of their precious life. If Elon musk said \u0022I want to spend my own money to recover the ISS intact! I\u0027m going to build a heatsheild 200m diameter and a parachute 100km across!\u0022, at least the manufacturer of that heat shield and parachute would be paying employees some good money to build it. But the point is, if he earned that money lawfully he has the right to blow it on a completely sentimental endeavor. If Senator So and So From Such and Such state wants to do the same, he\u0027s essentially asking everyone else to pay for it, against their will at no immediate risk to his own lifestyle.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope this isn\u0027t considered too \u0027political\u0027. I\u0027m just saying that besides the technological aspect of \u0022can we do it\u0022 you should also be asking if it\u0027s ethical to do it? The Moon landing may have been symbolic and a big \u0027waste of money\u0027 to some, but at least you can point at specific developments that came out of it. And also, I doubt you\u0027d have found many Americans alive during the Apollo 11 landing that would be mad at their tax burden in regards to an achievement such as that, but I can\u0027t cite a source so that\u0027s just my opinion. Contrast the achievement of sending a man to another world (no matter how close, how small, or how boring that world is) vs trying to bring back a man made object from LEO? We know it can be done, it\u0027s just very very very expensive, so what is the achievement in \u0022borrowing money to spend it to prove we can spend money\u0022?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if we did send a Moon lander back to the moon to set up a base, or as a dry run for mars, then that serves a purpose. And if along the way they fixed the American Flag, that\u0027s a bonus. But sending a mission just to fix the flag is theft and abuse of power. So would it be nice to have the most expensive human creation in the Smithsonian? YES. Would it be worth essentially squandering an unimaginaiable amount of human effort to pay for it? NOT IMHO. And that\u0027s the kicker, the ISS isn\u0027t expensive because it\u0027s particularly expensive because it\u0027s some amazing construct. The\u00A0Large Hadron Collider \u00A0aparently cost $13.25 Billion, I bet if you tried to build it in space it would cost $132.5 billion (pulled that number out of somewhere). So if the significance of the ISS is that it\u0027s an ordinary construct that exists in an extraordinarily expensive place to build things, and requires expensive Inspection and certification for safety reasons.... Well then we could build a log cabin in space, it would cost a few billion, and we could bring it back to earth for a few more billion, put it in the smithsonian and say \u0022This log cabin was in space\u0022 and nobody would be able to tell the difference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFun fact, the Wright flyer at the smithsonian isn\u0027t even the actual\u00A0working aircraft, they crated it up for the transport, and they lost some parts and probably mis-assembled some parts, and the result is the Wright flyer at the smithsonian is made of the parts of the Wright flyer, but isn\u0027t actually the wright flyer. So if we built a time machine, and it costs $500 billion to use the time machine, would it be worth $500 billion to go back in time, and recover the working wright flyer and put it in the smithsonian?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m so full of it, i\u0027m sorry, it\u0027s the coffee...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T13:58:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222471376\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022130021\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221458824168\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157768\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Buster Charlie\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n52 minutes ago, Buster Charlie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf Senator So and So From Such and Such state wants to do the same, he\u0027s essentially asking everyone else to pay for it, against their will at no immediate risk to his own lifestyle.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, sort of.
