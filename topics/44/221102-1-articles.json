Something more realistic than For All Mankind, while also trying to see what it would have been like had some of the never built projects I liked as a child come true.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, the concept was too interesting, but instead of doing the project over again, I just created this document where I could jot down random ideas and theorize on what such a world would be like, without the rigidity of a format and requirements on what details I come up with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what I have been trying to figure out is whether it ever would have been possible to have a rapidly reusable Space Shuttle as the mainstay of the Earth orbital launch fleet. I\u0027ve done some Googling and these are my findings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIdeally to fulfill the Integrated Program Plan (the main proposal to succeed Apollo that got watered down into the Space Shuttle) it would need to fly once a week.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne way to help do this would be to have multiple space shuttles, launchpads, and processing facilities, so that multiple shuttles could be prepared for flight at a time. If it takes one month to turn around a Space Shuttle, you just can have four space shuttles and four sets of processing and launch infrastructure, and then a Space Shuttle can launch every week.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRealistically there probably was not enough processing infrastructure to allow such a launch rate, and the maximum turn around time for the Space Shuttle was 54 days- almost two months. So how could this have been improved?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, for one thing, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E recovery and refurbishment took a lot of time. Under this scenario, there is a major movement from one political party to play up the narrative that the Vietnam War is costing the US men and money that would otherwise be used to improve society at home and abroad, combatting Soviet influence. Under this pressure, the President decides to act by ending the Vietnam War instead of escalating it, and use the freed up funding to put more money into the space program. So there is enough $$$ to build a fully reusable Space Shuttle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo this rules out my personal favorite never built Space Shuttle design, the Lockheed LS-200, and leaves us with either the \u0022Baseline\u0022 which as far as I can tell did not have any serious studies, or the North American DC-3. Both had a flyback booster, while the LS-200 and others had some portion of the vehicle expendable. Another option might be Chrysler\u0027s SERV/MURP, but it would have been even more technologically risky. But we\u0027ll get back to that later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow the only issue is getting a good turn around time with the orbiter. From what I\u0027ve read, here are some of the major issues:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSSME inspection involved taking the entire engine apart and putting it back together. This took a lot of time, to say the least.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTPS inspection and refurbishment also took a lot of time. Almost every piece of the Space Shuttle TPS was unique, and so it took lots of time to refurbish pieces of it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe Shuttle was originally planned to use \u0022field replaceable units\u0022 that were screwed on and would be simple to replace if something broke. Because of how heavy the TPS was, however, these had to be removed to save mass, resulting in numerous components becoming much more labor and time intensive to replace.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe use of hypergolics on the OMS/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E pods required all work on the rest of the orbiter to be stopped due to the toxic nature of the fuels.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow could these issues be alleviated?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe DC-3 and Baseline orbiter-booster configurations were still planned to use a \u0022silica based TPS\u0022 which presumably would have just been a variant of the IRL Space Shuttle TPS. It is very hard to solve the issue of hundreds or thousands of unique tiles with a spaceplane shape. Starship doesn\u0027t have this issue as much because it is more uniform in shape and is made of steel, which deals with heat better, making it a little safer for the tiles to have gaps in between them for heat expansion. The DC-3 was planned to be made out of aluminum and would not have this luxury: it would require a tight fitting TPS like the Shuttle. On the other hand, the DC-3 was much smaller in size compared to the real life Space Shuttle, and this might decrease the amount of time needed to inspect the TPS. But the booster required TPS inspections too, and it was massive, even larger than the IRL Space Shuttle. This would take an enormous amount of time, but due to the booster having jet engines and being capable of flight at greater distances than the orbiter, perhaps this could be carried out at facilities other than KCS, allowing more boosters to be build and improve turn around times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe funding issue is eliminated in my scenario, so FRUs should be workable on the Shuttle. This would greatly reduce turn around time to some degree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnlike the real life Space Shuttle, the DC-3 was planned to use RL-10s for its orbital maneuvering engines. These used cryogenic fuel and would not require operations to be stopped when something was done with the OMS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow improving the refurbishment process with those engines is what is really daunting. I want to look at what process SpaceX uses for the Merlin engines on F9, but apparently it is a corporate secret\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022;.;\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u00A0So I\u0027m not really sure how the refurbishment time might have been decreased. If anyone has any thoughts feel free to share.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAccording to a r/SpaceXLounge user, a couple of the main bottlenecks in Falcon 9\u0027s already impressive flight rate (fastest turn around is something like 21 days I think?) are A) production of second stages and B) the kerolox engines produce soot which needs to be cleaned out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStarship and the hypothetical Space Shuttle solve the issue of second stage availability. But what about the fuel issue? Starship solves this be using methalox, which burns cleaner. The XLR-129s on the DC-3 would use cryogenic fuel like the RS-25s of the IRL Shuttle, and thus might have a similar refurbishment process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thing that would go a long way in improving Shuttle flight rates would be flying more often and building more vehicles. Part of the reason why Falcon 9 has become so efficient is because of how often it flies. This allows more data to be gathered and iterations to be made.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe DC-3 might not have this luxury, because the necessity of having crew onboard would make each flight a high stakes affair. Inspections times would still be long.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the TPS being such an issue, it begs the question as to if it would be possible to have an alternative to the silica tile system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnter Chrysler\u0027s SERV/MURP. It was basically an upsized Apollo CM with aerospike engines. While it also had a modular TPS, it would have had a more uniform shape, perhaps simplifying refurbishment. But the development of an aerospike presents a whole new set of issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore, I have come to the conclusion the Space Shuttle was simply never going to have a high flight rate. It just wasn\u0027t possible with spaceplanes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thus think Big Gemini would have been the most viable option for a big, post-Apollo LEO transport. Big G came in at roughly 18 tons, and the Titan III cost 9.5 million dollars per ton to launch according to an early 90s GAO report: in other words, 171 million dollars per launch in early 1990s dollars, contrasting with a 900,000,000 dollar Space Shuttle launch cost (if the 2010 estimate of 1.5 billion per launch is put into an inflation calculator for 1990). Comparing Titan III to a Saturn IB, the latter costed about 55,000,000 dollars in 1972, while the Big G\u0027s booster cost converted to that year is roughly 54,000,000: similar price but far more capability, and Big G was partially reusable, helping to alleviate the cost of the spacecraft itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002259.44\u0022 width=\u0022673\u0022 alt=\u0022big-g-and-third-module.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://falsesteps.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/big-g-and-third-module.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus in my world, the American space program will probably become an area of high expenditure with a priority loosely akin to that of the military (although obviously with a far, far lower budget allocation when directly compared) until Elon Musk comes along, wanting to colonize Mars and builds Starship, reviving the long dead idea of a fully reusable spacecraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat are your thoughts? Could a fully reusable and economical spacecraft have been built in the 1970s? Or was it never going to happen until the 2020s?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"darthgently","CreatedById":204885,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-05T10:44:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI remember thinking back in the 80s upon reading about the shuttle tile refurb woes, \u0022if only there were a less expensive spray-on ablative or something\u0022.\u00A0 I think now with robotics removing burnt ablator and evenly spraying new layers could be done in an inexpensive way, but not back then as well as now.\u00A0 It was just a whistful passing thought with no real knowledge of the implications of the effectiveness of ablators, the mass of requisite ablator materials, or the aerodynamic implications of flying and landing a spaceplace with distorted, uneven, roasted ablator on it (probably shedding loose chunks of it across the Florida peninsula on return).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-05T10:56:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224344973\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022221102\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221701763556\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022206402\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SunlitZelkova\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, SunlitZelkova said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand then a Space Shuttle can launch every week.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter calculating the cost, the USA declares bankrupcy and joins the USSR.

I have emails archived on there from the late 1990s. The address is just first initial and last name, so I get people sending mail to it all the time. I get regular emails from a car dealership in Florida, all sorts of stuff connected to pediatric medicine around New York City, some girl\u0027s entire life up in Montreal. (Most of those I corrected.) I had some guy in New Jersey try to set up an eHarmony profile with it. I decided that was a level of drama I didn\u0027t need in my life.
