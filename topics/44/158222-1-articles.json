Its not like being off the the side is \u0022sorta ok\u0022, you still get vaporised.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm not even sure what happens to high explosive when you vaporise it faster than a detonation wave can travel through it. I guess it still explodes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither way, it is certain\u00A0the entire ship will be destroyed and only the first bomb will undergo a full yield detonation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-28T08:54:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223000127\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022158222\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221490687809\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002274091\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022p1t1o\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n56 minutes ago, p1t1o said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbut it will send a pulse of denser debris in one direction, possibly two.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21243.Project_Orion\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOrion\u0027s - in one\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
