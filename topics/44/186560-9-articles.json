That\u0027s it- landing rockets was done in the 1990s and the 2000s through the use of the DC-X rocket. An achievement that will soon fall to Blue Origin once they deploy commercial payloads with New Glenn.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSpaceX only has 1.5 actively functional vehicles (3 if you include the only other rocket they built that actually flew payloads, Falcon 1). Those rockets being Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy Core booster- the external two are regular Falcon 9s- so they aren\u0027t a new design. However the core is a modification of the Falcon 9 B5- which very much goes against your point of all plans being built which leads to Point 4-\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSpaceX has made many design promises they\u0027ve failed to meet- much like NASA.

If he makes promises, the public (ie the taxpayers) expect us to meet them. When reality kicks him off his high horse and suddenly we fail to go to Mars as he plans- it makes \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eeveryone\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E in the industry look back. Not just SpaceX. It paints us as \u0022too far behind\u0022 and \u0022not ready yet\u0022 which leads to cuts in budgets for organizations and agencies like NASA which in turns means they no longer have the funds to operate their own space programs or fund new developing companies- like SpaceX once was- which leads to point 6-\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSpaceX was literally built by NASA. Saying that SpaceX has made all of their achievements on their own through their successes is a massive inaccuracy. SpaceX has only flown because of NASA investments into the development of Falcon 9 reusable rockets. As NASA say the potential for a quick 24h turn-around rocket (which is as impossible as it was with the Shuttle) for cheap- but SpaceX has failed both points and specifically pointing out the flaw with cost leads to problem 7-\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSpaceX hasn\u0027t proven reusable rockets as economical, nor any more efficient than standard expendable rockets. Current pricing of launching on the F9 has not dropped and announcements that those prices are fixed. You could claim they\u0027re simply maximizing budget margins- but if that was the case, why would Musk be in such a hurry to develop \u003Cem\u003Eanother\u003C/em\u003E rocket system to replace the Falcon 9 rocket family (BFR isn\u0027t just for BEO flight- it\u0027s intended to completely antiquate the Falcon rocket family). Clearly the Falcon 9 is not cost-efficient and can\u0027t even meet a reasonable turn around time.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSpaceX does not have guarenteed funding by NASA. So any failures, mistakes or missteps in development means that the entire companies momentum is broken. Falling to entirely rely on the Falcon 9 which as we established isn\u0027t economical anyway. Which doesn\u0027t help them when (not if) the economy gets into another upset. Which- speaking of funding-\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSpaceX\u0027s founder- Elon Musk has proven that he has trouble keeping some of his ventures afloat with constant faults and issues with another company of his- Tesla.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSpaceX is a great company. Their fanboys are not. Constantly claiming on every NASA YouTube video and online thread posting how NASA is \u0022antiquated\u0022, \u0022too slow\u0022 and \u0022inefficient\u0022- basically stating that only SpaceX and Elon are the means to the future and by extension- destinations like the Moon and Mars. Despite many ignoring and overlooking point 6 and that NASA made SpaceX and SpaceX only gets contract money by doing what they need- and what they need is SpaceX in LEO- not BEO despite that being Musk\u0027s current ambition of the week.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s enough for now, I can make more if you want em.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-14T14:18:53Z\u0022 title=\u002208/14/2019 02:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 14, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by ZooNamedGames\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-14T15:32:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223650434\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022186560\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221565786547\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022185383\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Barzon Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Barzon Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou do realise, that FH, which is supposedly extremely simple, has taken 2 years longer than SLS will to get to its first flight.

A couple of points in reply. 1. Are you \u003Cem\u003Esure\u003C/em\u003E you want to start throwing shade at anyone\u0027s budgetary competence in an SLS/Orion thread?\u00A0 2.\u00A0 Personally, I would regard a start-up company that\u0027s been going for 17 years - and has managed to break into a very conservative market with very high barriers to entry - as a success.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.\u00A0 Ahh - the vapourware argument. Product X is totally going to be outclassed by Product Y, despite the fact that we know almost nothing about Product Y. Not convincing. Personal opinion - you\u0027re taking a very selective view of what constitutes an achievement here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCounterview. I look at SpaceX and I see a success for the reasons pointed out above. I see a company that\u0027s managed to turn a very conservative industry\u0027s opinions around on the topic of reusable launch vehicles. I see a company that\u0027s developed four distinct rocket engines of varying sizes and capability (Draco, SuperDraco, Kestrel and Merlin), three complete launch vehicles (F1, F9 and FH), and two spaceworthy capsules, plus all the support and manufacturing infrastructure that goes with them. Not to mention the fact that their workhorse launch vehicle has been through a steady program of continuous upgrades since inception, such that the current version has double the payload capacity to LEO of the first version. #\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGranted, rockets and capsules are not new. But just because they\u0027re a solved problem in many respects, that doesn\u0027t make them an easy problem.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.\u00A0 If you want to count them like that sure. But those 1.5 active vehicles are the end product of several generations of, now-deprecated, vehicles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4.\u00A0 Don\u0027t see your point here. Regardless of any arguments over what constitutes a promise, I don\u0027t see how you can use promise breaking as a criticism of one party whilst admitting that it\u0027s something the other party has done as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5.\u00A0 I\u0027m sorry but this is hysterical, irrational twaddle based on nothing more than a personal dislike.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6.\u00A0 No, it literally wasn\u0027t. No question that NASA took the risk in funding SpaceX and took another risk by awarding them the COTS contract (a risk that was mitigated to some extent by not being a cost-plus contract and being very milestone dependent). No question either that NASA have been a hugely significant and prestigious partner and customer for SpaceX.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut NASA did not found the company, grow the company,\u00A0 go out and find all the many other customers that SpaceX have served, design the hardware, build the hardware, deliver on NASA\u0027s milestones etc. A technology startup doesn\u0027t tend to get very far without investment but all the investment in the world won\u0027t make a blind bit of difference if that company can\u0027t deliver on its business model.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7.\u00A0 Well one reason is the one that \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119411-tater/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022119411\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119411-tater/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@tater\u003C/a\u003E pointed out. There is a real risk (so far as SpaceX are concerned) that sooner or later, Falcon 9 will face serious competition from the likes of New Glenn. So SpaceX could simply be responding to that perceived risk. The other reason is that SpaceX ain\u0027t going to Mars on a Falcon 9. Starship is a means to an end - but to make that means affordable, there has to be at least a somewhat possible business case for it. And the only reasonable business case is that it\u0027s going to be better than Falcon 9, for whatever definition of \u0027better\u0027 fits into their strategy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8.\u00A0 Well for openers we haven\u0027t established any such thing (about reusability) You believe it to be true but haven\u0027t produced any facts or figures to back up that belief. For seconds, SpaceX has made a number of missteps and has had a number of failures. Neither of which appear to have broken its momentum. Finally, even assuming that Starship is a complete fairy tale and never gets off the ground (commercially speaking), they (SpaceX) will have to compete using Falcon 9 which, on current form, is hardly a disaster. And if New Glenn starts flying, makes Falcon completely obsolete, and puts SpaceX out of business - well that\u0027s life for any company that can\u0027t rely on a steady infusion of tax dollars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n9.\u00A0 Until those other ventures cease to be afloat, this is a non argument. Newsflash - companies aren\u0027t guaranteed to be successful or stay successful. Business leaders aren\u0027t guaranteed to make perfect decisions either. Besides - Tesla and SpaceX are in completely different markets and an inability (real or otherwise) to make a success on one says very little about an ability to make a success of the other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n10.\u00A0 Agreed. To be honest I don\u0027t have much time for the idiots at either end of that argument, either the ones that you complain about, or the ones that continually play down SpaceX\u0027s achievements and insist that they\u0027d be nothing without NASA.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-14T18:50:18Z\u0022 title=\u002208/14/2019 06:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 14, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cheif Operations Director","CreatedById":183218,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-14T18:53:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223650548\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022186560\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221565805338\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129408\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerbiloid\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n56 minutes ago, kerbiloid said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022#\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/a\u003E \u003Cspan\u003EHide contents\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVon Braun\u0027s projects still remaining not implemented.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://live.staticflickr.com/8668/15268032573_43b3799ff4_b.jpg\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u002215268032573_43b3799ff4_b.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022115.32\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 width=\u0022666\u0022 src=\u0022https://live.staticflickr.com/8668/15268032573_43b3799ff4_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nseriously it is ridiculous how little\u00A0\u00A0funding space gets it should be about $40 Billion a year\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-14T19:01:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223650590\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022186560\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221565808517\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002261025\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KSK\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 minutes ago, KSK said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI see a company that\u0027s developed four distinct rocket engines of varying sizes and capability (Draco, SuperDraco, Kestrel and Merlin),\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCertainly 5 (Raptor),\u00A0 now, arguably 6 (Merlin 1D is well beyond a tweak from their first Merlin).\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe 7 if the vacuum Merlin counts, actually, I think it\u0027s pretty different at this point from the SL engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-14T19:22:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223650599\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022186560\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221565809297\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022119411\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tater\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 minutes ago, tater said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCertainly 5 (Raptor),\u00A0 now, arguably 6 (Merlin 1D is well beyond a tweak from their first Merlin).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe 7 if the vacuum Merlin counts, actually, I think it\u0027s pretty different at this point from the SL engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*facepalm* I forgot to include Raptor.

If nothing else, Merlin 1a was ablatively cooled if I recall rightly, which would set it apart from the regeneratively cooled 1c.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-14T19:36:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223650607\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022186560\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221565810563\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002261025\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KSK\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 minutes ago, KSK said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll not get into any disputes as to whether the first Starhopper hop counts as \u0027getting off the test stand\u0027 - I suspect reasonable opinions may differ there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbsolutely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSometimes you look at Hopper and think, \u0022Meh, it\u0027s just a flying test stand.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen you think, \u0022Wow, it\u0027s a \u003Cem\u003Eflying\u003C/em\u003E test stand!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn topic, what payloads dedicated for SLS are funded that are not Orion?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll wait.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Barzon","CreatedById":185383,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-14T19:50:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223650618\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022186560\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221565811378\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022119411\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tater\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 minutes ago, tater said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhat payloads dedicated for SLS are funded that are not Orion?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll US Gateway modules except PPE and MHM.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-14T19:51:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223650618\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022186560\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221565811378\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022119411\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tater\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 minutes ago, tater said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbsolutely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSometimes you look at Hopper and think, \u0022Meh, it\u0027s just a flying test stand.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen you think, \u0022Wow, it\u0027s a \u003Cem\u003Eflying\u003C/em\u003E test stand!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn topic, what payloads dedicated for SLS are funded that are not Orion?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll wait.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEuropa Clipper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Barzon","CreatedById":185383,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-14T19:53:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUn-named Europa LANDER, aswell.
