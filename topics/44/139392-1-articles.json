Walla 3-D space time, as if we didn\u0027t already know this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe study adds the caveot, that there is a certain energy threshold, but it lacks sophistication, IMO, because the only force that preceeds spacetime is putatively quantum gravity, that is to say when a quantum singularity stops being as such, it suddenly has a big problem communicating its state. So physicist believe that quantum gravity provides this but it operates somewhat less efficiently as it has to be transmitted. If we can imagine that the universe first divided, and those parts divided and divided once again we now have three dimensions, or so you might thing, but QM allows quantum superposition, and this does not allow the energy to subdivide in space. In order to get energy to flow things need to move away from each other in space-time. So that the pressure created by the energy suffices to overcome the unknown that held the singularity together. The essense of the problem is that no-one knows why a singularity (much like a black hole) would have so much energy that it would no longer be stable, that its quantum gravity could not bind it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wonder if this reason suffices to argue that there is another route of decay of a quantum singularity?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
