The problem with those is that you generally cannot refuel them in flight. A classic pulsed plasma thruster (PPT) for instance in pretty much a stick of teflon with the engine components assembled around it. It\u0027s as large as the stick of teflon is. If you want more impulse out of a PPT, you build a bigger PPT because the stick of teflon inside is bigger. And once it has burned out, that\u0027s it. The engine is dead. It cannot be refueled. You would have to design an entirely new kind of engine to be able to place different types of \u0022propellant ingots\u0022 into it at will during flight, and even then you\u0027d probably need an EVA mission to do it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd even when you solved all of these issues, and somehow made an engine that can accept astronaut waste as fuel, then it still isn\u0027t going to work all that well. The reason we\u0027re using ultra-rare and absurdly expensive stuff like xenon for electric engines is because its atomic properties are very favorable. It is easy to ionize, so the engine expends only small parts of its energy budget towards creating the plasma (or, it can produce more plasma at once). The largest part of its budget is devoted to accelerating the plasma, which is the part that actually creates thrust, and results in such high Isp. Also, as a noble gas, xenon doesn\u0027t react all that much with the engine even in an environment of massive latent energies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAstronaut waste, meanwhile, is going to be a much less favorable fuel. It\u0027ll be much more difficult to ionize, leaving less energy to do the thrusting, resulting in less thrust and less Isp. Additionally, the fuel is not homogenous - it\u0027s not just a pile of identical atoms, but rather a huge mess of fifty different chemical elements assembled into thousands of different molecules and compounds. That means it\u0027ll be a fluctuating, unstable burn. And because the stuff is all present in molecules (and even larger organic structures, like proteins), that means it\u0027s probably not going to fully dissociate into atoms even when ionized, resulting in comparatively giant particles in the exhaust. This not only utterly kills your Isp (even further), but also may mean that it\u0027ll damage your engine, if it relies on things like gridded electrodes. And while we\u0027re on the topic of engine damage: that chaotic mixture of elements is going to include super-aggressive stuff, like alkali metals, oxygen, and halogens - fluorine, for instance, is an essential element without which humans cannot survive, even though its pure form is one of the deadliest things known to us.

When we start talking about isps in the 100000 m/s range its feasible....the process is rather simple, chop the metal into small pieces, a bit tricky in space, roll them into a thin wire. As the noodle enters the back of the thruster its entering a vacuum, its zapped by high voltage, somewhere in the 100000v range a heats to 5000 degrees where the vacuum pressure and vacuum pull small bits of metal off which are accelerated.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course you are going to have bits of the metal stick all over the inside ofvthe device spoiling it,mbut in a long flight you could simply grind up the device. Actually the only real source of metal i see in such flights are gas containers, but i have basically come to the conclusion that for manned electric powered flight one needs to use hyperglolics or liquified lfox propellants, whereas these are refueled at stations, like l1 and l2 of target planets and these are carried by fusion electric or solar electric power and return to LEO to be refueled and serviced, in these schemes the only waste is close to LEO.
