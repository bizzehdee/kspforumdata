Additionally, 9 of the remaining 13 people had \u0022serious underlying conditions\u0022 that had an effect. If these 9 with such serious conditions were at risk of death from the vaccine. I think it likely that they were even at higher risk from contracting the disease themselves. So, without researching any further onto these 14 people that leaves us with 4 people, who you claim, died(likely from pneumonia or heart disease, as stated by your source) from the vaccine.
