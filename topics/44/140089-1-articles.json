You can make sense of these things until you go back in time, at which point if there is some preordained interaction from the early universe and go back into time, now that interaction would be split into 2 or 3 ways, this would become non-deterministic if it was initially deterministic. The problem is that we don\u0027t know enough about these . . .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn our universe we don\u0027t see:\u003Cbr\u003E\na negative temporal vector\u003Cbr\u003E\nnegative mass (which could be seen as a type of space-time energy vector)\u003Cbr\u003E\nnegative energy (same as above)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand of course without these you can\u0027t have FTL.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis observations makes relativistic observations of FTL, closed timelike loops, wormholes, etc improbable in a scale of spacetime, however there is a black swan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we look at the universe as being composed of an infinite number of quantum domains (placeholder domains that then exist for the purpose of populating normal space) that appear and disappear along a space-time timelines governed by comoving space, then we cannot really expect to see any of the three violations, but what if comoving space is very ill-defined, such as boundary between a supermassive blackhole and its very center (which we cannot see). It might get murky and quantum effects in relativistic space could be creepy and unexpected at the observable scale (which we cannot observe). Imagine and electron and positron traveling at each other so close to the speed of light close enough to interact but not close enough to annihilate, and that as they interact clusters of particles might appear to go back and forward in time ever so briefly, as if they were there but not there, because for those particular particles time has all but stopped and very very close to the speed of light quantum time would be something we could clock. Again it would still be limited by the probability that an accumulation of events, but instead of it happening so fast, it would be slow enough to observe, a brief moment before the interactions particles appear and disappear, the interaction occurs and later particles are observed flowing away.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I then take this analogy one step further, suppose in the early universe, before space-time exists, when a quantum singularity is giving way to quantum domains, its certainly plausible that you could have negative temporal vectors and negative energy. As energy pours into the Universe negative energy may pour into stable quantum domains (if energy did pour into the universe) and negative energy likewise. You could have a bubble flowing along the negative vector in a dynamic equilibrium with our universe that then collapses on every bit of energy in our universe at some future/past point reconstituting the quantum singularity. But this exception basically proves the point, that we would have to do something really weird to make backward time travel plausible on our time scale. Maybe the potential for time travel exists, but because of determinism in our universe we cannot access it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou see the basic reason that I have a negative opinion of warp drives, time travel, worm holes and to a lessor degree black hole drives. All of these things require a pattern of behavior that is inconsistent with the relativistic universe. More importantly many of the conservation laws that we have are likely a response to the big bang, and the interactions we observe like G are a part of energy conservation on the universal scale which means we must (should) have some means of conserving long range interactions even if we, to date, cannot observe them other than as scalar field theories.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-19T16:14:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222590876\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022140089\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221463673867\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107380\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 minutes ago, PB666 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt;snippity-snip\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntq:dr\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[too quantum:didn\u0027t read]\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJk, I\u0027ll try and read it later \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-19T16:22:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222590876\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022140089\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221463673867\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107380\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 minutes ago, PB666 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn our universe we don\u0027t see:\u003Cbr\u003E\na negative temporal vector\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t really know enough about this to comment with any authority, but I thought that our physical laws are all CPT invariant, which means that our \u0022temporal vector\u0022 has no special orientation: negative is a label for \u0022toward decreasing local entropy\u0022, which is just a convention, since entropy is a macroscopic phenomenon.

The better the view you have of the past, the more likely you are to critically interfere. Its quite an energetic adventure to reach the past, and the effort pays off with qualitative information, but the problem is that you may not exist in the future to transmit back the observations if you have interfered with the future timeline. A perfect observation scenario is you are on a meteor that naturally is about to exit our solar system, never to return, you monitor heat from the surface of that asteroid, avoiding observation of entangled photons. Consequently you have low quality data to report. Direct observation means you observed previously entangled photons, in situ observation means you are directly interfering with the massive particles, which means you have altered the timeline. IOW, you cannot use the laws of physics to observe, and then start negating the laws of physics so you won\u0027t irreversibly interfere. I\u0027m not saying all observations have a causality effect, but any really informative observations might.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course you could observe the Chixulub impact from interstellar space and note the exact date and time. A super powerful telescope might see the crater, and you might then direct future scientist how to study it. . . . .Such supermassive telescopes would still tweeking the orbit of other objects (oort cloud comets, the suns orbit about the galaxy). So you would need to observe, really good observations, but not have mass, not emit EM,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy interpretation is that such a non-interfering time traveler is invisible in the present because they have would have to have no mass or\u00A0 energy to not interfere in the past. They do not exist. The only alternative I could see is if you traveled at FTL to some point very far away and from that point you observed the past, then you returned to Earth, I think we would know that also, and the quality of your observations would be poor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
