They are developing this technology in order to build a fully ground-powered SSTO spaceplane.\n\nThere\u0027s now a lengthy interview with the CEO and CTO of Escape Dynamics on\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/jHBphhkO-1E?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n. It has not only talk, but also computer animations and real video from development prototypes doing fancy things, and is well worth watching IMHO if you\u0027re at all interested in this kind of technology. I know that it is dear to the hearts of the devs and players of the KSP Interstellar mod, at minimum ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n(The TMRO people been out of town and have not been doing shows for two weeks, so the space news segment at the start has a lot of catching up to do. If you don\u0027t care about that and just want the interview, jump straight to 18:30.)\n\nHere\u0027s some TL;DW info from said interview:\n\n- Vertical takeoff, horizontal landing reusable lifting-body SSTO spaceplane with a 70/30 fuel-mass-fraction\n\n- Initially aimed at 200 kg payload, then scaled up later to about 1000 kg\n\n- Driven by 200 MW beamed microwave power via a heat exchanger on the belly of the plane, which drives a thermal aerospike rocket\n\n- First thruster prototype already works at the 100 kilowatt level, next development milestone is a \u003E1 megawatt model\n\n- More than 500s sea level Isp with helium, more than 700s with hydrogen\n\n- Rapid reusability enabled by simplicity of propulsion system on the plane (literally just a tank, a heat exchanger, a nozzle and some plumbing)\n\n- The beam array will do some fancy precision targeting magic via phase-shifting the microwaves in specific patterns\n\n- Prototype movement-tracking microwave emitter antenna is also already built and working at low power levels\n\n- For LEO launches, just two array locations are required: one small one at the launch site, one large array 200 km downrange\n\n- Aiming for first flight around 2020; company realizes that they have a huge amount of work left, does not want to rush\n\n**Please note:** I\u0027m making this new thread now because the existing one on the topic, from February this year, has been locked by moderation.

You can get ISPs and thrust to weight ratios far in advance of anything you can carry on a rocket without using nuclear energy. It\u0027s straightforward present tech to build phased-array antenna for the microwave transmitter so you can focus it without mirrors and lenses. Microwaves are a longer wavelength, though. What kind of energy losses do you face between the ground and the rocket?\n\nI read the white paper. 55% energy loss at launch, 88% during the circularization burn.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-09T17:47:34Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2015 05:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SomeGuy12**"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T18:47:12Z","Content":"Honestly, energy is reasonably cheap. 200 megawatts sounds like a lot of *power*, but if you only need it for 10 minutes to execute an entire mission, that\u0027s a surmountable obstacle even with major losses because the total *energy* will not be that large. And it\u0027s a fun thought, but because how rockets work, the power loss probably doesn\u0027t even have to be compensated. After all, the vehicle loses mass as it rises. If the power level reaching it goes down, its thrust will suffer, but that only means that the TWR is kept roughly stable along the way. Which you want anyway.\n\nNo, I\u0027m wondering more how they plan to run the infrastructure. That\u0027s the one point that wasn\u0027t really addressed... they plan to have a whole square kilometer worth of microwave emitters. Land is cheap in New Mexico, but machines need maintenance. These are going to be very complex machines, and there will be a lot of them, and they\u0027ll have to finance the entire thing up front because they can\u0027t run with half an array.\n\nNow that they\u0027re actually building hardware that shows the basic premise works, the key factor in this business proposal, I reckon, will be whether or not they save enough on the launch vehicle to pay for the transmitter infrastructure... *and* do so while lowering prices. I think the guy was pretty smart noting that he\u0027s not planning to compete with large rockets that cost $4k per kg to orbit, but rather with the smallsat launchers where even the ambitious startups currently under development run around $25k per kg to orbit. For all the talk of lowering prices to three digits, I think that\u0027s pure marketing spin, and the company will rely on feeding on that huge gap between the smallsat launchers and the heavy lifters.\n\nAnd in a way, if they can manage to bring the price for smallsat launches down to almost paritywith heavy lifters, down to say $5k per kg to orbit, that\u0027s still an enormous gain for the market - an 80% price reduction would be a major enabler, one that companies like Rocket Labs or Firefly aren\u0027t going to manage. Or let it be $15k for the first generation vehicle, it would still be a big deal if it actually works.\n\nIf it works out for the same cost as other smallsat launchers, then well, I suppose it\u0027s still a really cool technology (I know I\u0027d love to see launch footage of such a craft at least once), and good for them to have a viable if unexciting business, but to really move something forward it needs to actually keep those promises and be more than just competitive with traditional chemical rockets.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-09T18:50:12Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2015 06:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"Lukaszenko","CreatedById":95776,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T09:26:59Z","Content":"200 megawatts is nothing, considering how the space shuttle used like 12x that.

The helium Isp is a total no-go. I wonder how much more than 700s they actually get?\n\nHelium is used for development because it\u0027s easier to handle. They showed a graph from a test run that had the Isp oscillate constantly between 500 and 600, averaging about 550. The \u0022over 700s with hydrogen\u0022 is extrapolated from the current prototype\u0027s performance with helium, but I can\u0027t say if it\u0027s a lower bound like the 500s is for helium, or an average. The \u002270/30\u0022 was a number the guy dropped while comparing their proposed plane to conventional rockets - and I\u0027ll mention that to my mild irritation, he kept talking about payload fraction and fuel-mass fraction as if they were the same thing ![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif) It\u0027s likely that that number isn\u0027t to be taken entirely seriously, but then again that depends on the development success of the engine. And an 80/20 setup with 750s Isp can get into orbit just fine while still beating out a two-stage chemical rocket, so it\u0027s not like single-staging useful payload is physically impossible with this sort of performance.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-10T13:42:43Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2015 01:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T13:41:08Z","Content":"Getting into orbit is easy.
