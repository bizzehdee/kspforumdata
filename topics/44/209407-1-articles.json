Orbital resonance is the cause of both stability and instability. On top of that, there are instabilities and perturbations from inside and outside. Even if seen as an \u0022adiabatic\u0022 system (without external interaction), will it fly apart sooner or later ? How long can this be stable ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am not sure if there is a clear answer at all or if there is a solution to the problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a text I found via stackexchange.
