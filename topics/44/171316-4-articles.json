So that gets factored in. BTW this is always the case, in carrying a capital inventory the alternative use of the money has to be factored in, even if you don\u0027t borrow. The good thing is the cost goes down as the fleet depreciates in value (value goes off the balance sheet and onto the P/L sheet), if you consign an aircraft to a depreciable life after say 15 years and thereafter has only salvage value, and you use your fleet for a long period of time then that cost will drop to a trivial level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what determines the vehicles lifespan, why doesn\u0027t an airline buy a new airframe after 15 years and consign the old air-frame to the desert or sell it to \u003Cem\u003EMiddle of Nowhere Airlines\u003C/em\u003E? The issue is competition, if the competition is fierce (i.e. the mean net profit per ticket is low), then to keep cost down you use the plane as long as you can, as long as your passengers will accept it, as long as the FAA will allow, and as long as your repair crew is not charging more to repair an older vehicle. IOW, the cost of your capital inventory is low and expensed cost is also low.\u00A0 SW defines competition in the medium distance commercial airline market, so they use a single type of plane, lowering cost and optimizing maintenance\u00A0 and use it repeatedly and force ticket prices down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the case of SpaceX,\u00A0 the longevity is more market driven, alternative prices per launch are several fold higher than what they are offering, the are trying to attract new customers (including their own sat. tele. business) which they see that in many aspects of space they can outcompete by reusing the same cores, boosters and fairings. But the price driver for their satellite communication will be in getting the cost of launch down and since they are the customer they can set their own QC (Hughes is certainly not looking amorously at their move). For the other market, as long as their competitors are selling at 3 to 10 times their price the same service, then its probably good for them to use that differential to replace their cores from time to time. Essentially they are building infrastructure that they need to keep going. They are not in exactly the same situation as SW, but it a nice selling point to offer \u00271000\u0027 reuses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe have to factor out one thing. If you have an old core, and you need to place a payload that is in the F9 expendable range, you can either offer the customer a ride on a F9, recover the core and boosters, or offer a used core to be expended. My guess that factoring in the rockets known depreciation they will probably offer and F9 expendable more cheaply than an FH reusable if the core is of a certain number of reuses. Again, part of your business is building cores, then you want to keep that operation going (otherwise your workers may be working for your competitors as their business dies).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn terms of the BFR, I am not sure how their product testing will play out. In order to stay on topic I just want to mention, its hard to compare something in the engineering/early construction phase, with the operating model for a 737 that has been in flying since 1968 or the F9 which has been recycling for the last couple of years. These handwaving arguments are often points where threads derail into off-topic never-land. I caution about making economic conclusions at this point, and I would remind everyone that SpaceX has yet to turn a profit in any of their their operations, they are just throwing more skin into the game, and frequently (as in the oil boom of 2014) this does not have a pretty outcome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-06T17:53:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223311642\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022171316\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221520354703\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022133850\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022wumpus\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n52 minutes ago, wumpus said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best data from Spacex seems to indicate that the cost of a booster is less than a third of the cost to launch a Falcon 9.\u00A0 The whole idea of getting it down to the pro-rata cost of the vehicle (assuming Musk\u0027s wild \u00221000 launches\u0022 scheme) is not going to happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom Southwest Airlines 2016 annual report (page 45): \u003Ca href=\u0022http://investors.southwest.com/~/media/Files/S/Southwest-IR/Annual%20Reports/2016_AnnualReport_LUV.PDF\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://investors.southwest.com/~/media/Files/S/Southwest-IR/Annual Reports/2016_AnnualReport_LUV.PDF\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPayroll : 40% of expenses\u003Cbr\u003E\nFuel : 22% of expenses (which is historically low: in 2003 it was 16% [listed twice under 20%] and in 2011 it was 37% [part of a 7 year run over 30%] see page 4)\u003Cbr\u003E\nVehicle pro-rata costs (rentals and depreciation): 8.6%\u003Cbr\u003E\nMaintenance and repairs: 6.2%\u003Cbr\u003E\nLanding fees (presumably whatever they pay the airports):\u00A0 7.3%\u003Cbr\u003E\nEverything else: 15%\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if you get the pro-rata vehicle costs down to the fuel costs (somewhere between 100-1000 flights) you can expect that the rest of the spacex payroll to be pretty steep (and when launch/landings become commonplace he won\u0027t be able to work geniuses like slaves, they will go elsewhere or expect more pay and more time off).\u00A0 Obviously an airline is more of a \u0022asymptotic goal\u0022 and won\u0027t match up all that well, but it is the best data we have for an ideal situation.\u00A0 There is a *long* way to go to get here, but certainly removing booster costs gets you 1/3 of the way there (or more likely 1/2, I\u0027d expect a lot of costs can\u0027t be avoided).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d assume that a post-BFR rocket would involve something other than chemical rockets (assuming fuel costs began to dominate) but would be designed on \u0022Elon time\u0022 taken to a whole new level (because there wouldn\u0027t be a hurry to replace the BFR).\u00A0 There are quite a few ways to get into orbit (or at least get enough delta-v to save a ton of fuel) but they require a lot of research that will take a very long time (and aren\u0027t getting the funding for much more than powerpoint slides).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheir payroll per flight is too high, this is due in part to launch delays working between a couple of sites, once the boca chica site is operational, if two sites are delayed they can still launch from the third.
