Cryogenic hydrogen is expensive and cumbersome, especially on flights beyond Earth orbit, such as those planned by SpaceX - and besides, the RS-68 is one of the least efficient LH2/LOX engines around, owing to the fact that it\u0027s focused on high thrust and that it\u0027s built on an open gas generator cycle. The most efficient engine the world has seen (measured in absolute Isp) is the space shuttle\u0027s RS-25, a closed cycle staged combustion engine with an insane chamber pressure and an Isp of 453 (compared to the RS-68\u0027s 410).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpaceX\u0027s current secret sauce receptable is called \u0022Raptor\u0022 and will be a liquid methane/LOX engine scheduled to hit the test stand sometime this or next year, with an Isp somewhere in the middle between kerosene and LH2. But likely closer to the former. The number 360 gets thrown around. The most interesting part about it is that it will use the so-called \u0022full flow\u0022 staged combustion cycle, which is even more advanced that what the RS-25 offers. While the Russians produced a working test stand prototype in the 1960\u0027s (RD-270), no such engine has ever been flown.

The UK got nothing. Even if the JET somehow achieves a net positive energy balance before 2020, which may not be possible considering the age of the reactor, that still doesn\u0027t make it a useful power provider. Just because the reactor is energy positive doesn\u0027t mean the entire facility is (there are more things drawing power than just the reactor containment field). And even if that is positive as well, it still isn\u0027t enough, because it has to start paying for itself. And for that you need to have a net positive of a dozen or more times the input, not just a few percent. And as for using it in a rocket engine... I hope you are aware that the JET facility is larger than entire rocket launchpads, heavier than the Saturn V, and of a reactor type that\u0027s completely unsuited for spacecraft propulsion in general? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah... your \u0022future SSTO\u0022 takes the \u0022future\u0022 part literally.

Full reusability can bring the price of a SSTO down a lot, but it can do the same for individual rocket stages that pull higher payload fractions. Since the company\u0027s stated goal is making space access affordable, that\u0027s the route they will be going with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven equal reusability, literally the only advantage a SSTO has over a multi-staged vehicle is the reduced complexity by eliminating the staging process. You lose too much in return to make it worthwhile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, a spaceplane concept can potentially overcome these difficulties, but only if it doesn\u0027t rely on classic chemical rocket engines. That technology peaked in the late 1970\u0027s; there\u0027s been no advances in Isp since then, not by a single second. Any prospective SSTO must exploit the higher Isp potential of air-breathing engines in order to push its payload fraction into regions that are economical to fly.

Including, and I kid you not, North Korea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in summary, the world\u0027s current focus at large is not anywhere near SSTOs. There have been enough canceled projects to outline the difficulties involved, both on the technical side (maximum dV for a single stage is hard limited by engine Isp, which in turn kills the payload fraction dead because chemical rockets are just not efficient enough) and the economic side (a two-stage rocket lifts more for less money). Skylon is the first vessel I\u0027ve seen that has a chance to succeed \u003Cem\u003Eon paper\u003C/em\u003E, but they\u0027re not even anywhere near the project stages in which unpredicted technical difficulties get discovered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead, we\u0027re seeing a focus on improving sea level Isp over kerosene through development of methane engines - NASA, ESA and possibly others are testing their own designs. This will improve the payload fraction while simultaneously reducing fuel costs (although fuel is already an extremely minor component unless we\u0027re talking LH2/LOX). NASA is also pushing to build the SLS completely out of existing hardware, resulting in something that\u0027s hopefully a lot cheaper to fly than the shuttle could ever hope to be. And then there\u0027s SpaceX aggressively pursuing reusability of individual rocket stages, trying to combine the advantages postulated for reusable spaceplanes with the much higher performance of staged booster rockets. Having to reserve fuel for the booster return means the Falcon 9\u0027s payload fraction isn\u0027t very good, but it\u0027s still higher than what SSTOs would post, and ultimately the kg-to-orbit price will still improve by significant margins if they can pull it off.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-05T08:21:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2014 08:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"How2FoldSoup","CreatedById":82003,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-05T08:32:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*snip*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.
