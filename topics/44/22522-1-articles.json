The mobile mouth is then taken to a planetary system 48000ly away at such a speed that the time taken appears to be about a year. If the people in the spaceship return through the wormhole, will they return a year after they launch, or will they return 48000 years after launch. Or will the universe blow up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027re assuming that the spaceship is able to accelerate to nearly c very quickly without killing anybody. A constant acceleration of 1000000 gees is survivable \u003Cem\u003Eso long as it acts on every atom in the person\u0027s body, like gravity in free fall\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
