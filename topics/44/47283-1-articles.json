The system is very similar to KSP; 2-body m\u0026lt;\u0026lt;M problems. I\u0027ve gotten elliptical and hyperbolic orbits to work, and I even have some display of it with interactivity. I can plot out an orbit, drop a maneuver, adjust velocity, etc. Currently I\u0027m working in 2d space and I think I\u0027ll probably keep it that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m just starting to get into orbital encounters with the SOI of another large body. The SOI is easy to compute, but I was curious if anyone has any material relating to computing when an elliptical and hyperbolic path collide with a circle moving in a hyperbolic or circular orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMichael\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"N_las","CreatedById":31280,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-03T19:09:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have your orbits:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVector-Position of Spacecraft as function of time: X_Spacecraft(t)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVector-Position of Planet as function of time: X_Planet(t)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou can calculate:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVector-Distance of Spacecraft to Planet as function of time: VectorDistance(t) = X_Spacecraft(t) - X_Planet(t)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThan you have to calculate the Magnitude of the Distance: Distance(t) = mag(VectorDistance(t))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you have a function of the distance between spacecraft and planet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDistance(t)=SOI_Radius \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esolve for t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf t=0 is the present, the smallest possible solution for \u0027t\u0027 ist the time of the next SOI-Encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-03T19:23:45Z\u0022 title=\u002210/03/2013 07:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by N_las\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
