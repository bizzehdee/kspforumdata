For spaceships with explorers? Not colonists. Just explorers. Meaning they will observe and report and take a limited supply of cargo (they have other places to visit/sample after all).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe\u00A0relevant ship capabilies: Constant acceleration at 7g max or below with regenerative refueling.\u00A0Can use it to land on planets. Plus an FTL jump drive that will put a ship however many light seconds away from the target planet multiplied by it\u0027s distance away in lightyears. So for a proxima centauri world, we would be jumped about 4 lightseconds from the target planet. Thus it pays to hop from system to system to reduce travel time, unless you do not mind longer in-system travel times. Just imagine. 100 lightyears means your vessel jumps\u00A0100 light seconds from your target when you get there! Time spent powering up\u00A0for\u00A0FTL jumps only takes 15 min. Yet the jump drive\u00A0cannot do interplanetary jumps inside systems. Only interstellar jumps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOpen deck plan: Decks are aligned with planet gravity but nonaligned with g-force via acceleration. A few big rooms cover the innards of the spaceship. Inside are modules that can be stacked in weightlessness to form a spine column along the center of engine thrust. This is so that before the ship lands, the crew can install/align the modules toward the planet. As otherwise all the modules would be sideways across. To make navigating in weightlessness easier, a rope mesh surrounds crew areas they can use to propel off to reach modules or\u00A0room entrances.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClosed deck plan: Decks are not aligned with the center of thrust, but that\u0027s what roller coaster standing chairs are for. At least landing/take off\u00A0is easy. And rooms resemble earth ones (hallways and rooms galore).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlignment with center of thrust: Like a tall office building the decks are aligned with the center of thrust. While great for space travel, it will make loading/unloading on a planet harder than it would be otherwise. There is a reason warehouses are\u00A0broad and flat vs tall and skinny.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo which do you think is optimal?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-07-07T00:16:00Z\u0022 title=\u002207/07/2019 12:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 7, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFTL.

So for a proxima centauri world, we would be jumped about 4 lightseconds from the target planet. Thus it pays to hop from system to system to reduce travel time, unless you do not mind longer in-system travel times. Just imagine. 100 lightyears means your vessel jumps\u00A0100 light seconds from your target when you get there! Time spent powering up\u00A0for\u00A0FTL jumps only takes 15 min.

With a torchship going around .1c, that means the destination will be reached in about 10 days. Doing 10 LY star to stars would require 10,000 jumps, so to compete with the simple single jump and then torchship drive, you\u0027d need to do 1000 jumps per day, which is 41.67 jumps per hour, which is nearly 1 per minute.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry, but if you\u0027re giving your sci fi setting a torchship drive, and an FTL drive, you\u0027ll need another contrived scenario to make the preferred way of travel to be system to system hops (as in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E online for example).

I tend to agree with you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow about this? A simple, less rules drive that is still quite powerful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGalaxy drive: You can jump however close or far you want to any point of light you see in space. Even if it is\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eold\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Estarlight. Know that you are jumping where the star\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ewas\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ewhen the light first was emitted that is hitting you at this second. So if the star is thousands of LY away, that is a thousands of\u00A0years old position in space. Try not to get lost... you can even jump to other galaxies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpon reaching your jump point, your speed and trajectory is shifted to match the target\u0027s, whatever it was.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImportant rule: To shift jump, your target must be a lightsecond or more away. So that rules out getting easy free speed tbrough missiles or railguns. Takes a while to cross a lightsecond with limited rockets and raiguns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo FTL sensors: Yet one could still detect relativistic starships movin in space if scanned from the side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll you need is starships on patrol in star systens that are known to have high speed celestial bodies or gravities. However controls those has all tje relativistic firepower they want... for free.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Actuallu this system makes relativistic attacks hard if not impossible. Every jump shifts your speed and trajectory to the current target, so you cannot simply stack on more and more speed at will.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurthermore the fact thay a target must be a lightsecond or more to shift-jump to means that stacking speed with missiles becomes kinda impractical for homeworld attacks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if your ship had constant acceleration for months on end it would have a difficult time utlizing such speed. For one, what are you gonna do? Shift to Pluto and just accelerate your way to Earth? A fleet can and would shift to you, intecepting you long before you arrived. The best you could do is shift above Earth and let loose some epic bombs and shift out again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat kind of thing would be hard to prevent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suspect either a planetary shield or a\u00A0truly awesome orbtial defense grid would be in order. Perhaps both.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: This drive does allow for hopping around systems as well as long jumps. For no other reason than to find your way. Kind of have to since old light jumps get more precise the closer you get.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-07-10T17:04:10Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2019 05:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
