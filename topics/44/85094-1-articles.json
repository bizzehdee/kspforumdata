Fighter pilots are trained to squeeze every last drop of performance out of their aircraft with the training to know where the limits are. Commercial aircraft aren\u0027t evading enemy missiles so you don\u0027t need it to pull 9 Gs. This is where Envelope Protection comes in. In a commercial aircraft, if you are pulling 9 Gs, something is seriously wrong and the computer can prevent a pilot from entering such a condition inadvertantly. A fighter aircraft on the other hand SHOULD be pulling 9Gs IF it is required. They design them to be tougher than the humans flying them in case they need to be punished to bring a pilot home in one piece. This is also why commercial aircraft have service lives of 75000-100000 hours while fighter aircraft have service lives of ~5000 hours. Overall, I have not seen any form of Envelope Protection for fighter pilots built into the Fly-By-wire/Autopilot systems. Envelope Protection is accomplished by training the pilot to recognize the situation and react accordingly. Just because a computer CAN do it, doesn\u0027t mean a computer DOES do it. With a missile on my tail, I don\u0027t want some computer limiting me to 9 Gs when I need 9.2 to not get shot out of the sky.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-23T22:41:07Z\u0022 title=\u002209/23/2014 10:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Meecrob\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpeach","CreatedById":34566,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-23T23:01:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cpt.
