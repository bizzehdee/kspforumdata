The context here has nothing to do with providing satisfactory scientific explanations, in which keeping only whatever you deem necessary would be a sound methodological approach. For the exact same scientific theory of the origin of the universe you can assume the universe has a final cause, and therefore anything and everything that exists within it is guided to that, or you can assume final causes don\u0027t really exist and the universe only exists as it is.

If you want to chose just one observer for the entire system and stick with it, then you may as well assume that collapse happens when that observer interacts with the observed sub-system. That\u0027s your Copenhagen Interpretation. If you want to consider system with multiple possible observers, you start to have to worry about what happens with measurements made by different observers at different places and different times. Naturally, some interesting phenomena must take place, but there are some physical limits to how significant they are. One way to restrict this is to consider decoherence. And most statistical or ensemble interpretations will take this into account. Here, like you said, you assume the system collapsed when decoherence has taken place. Finally, you can consider the whole QM problem as a whole, without simplifying it by collapse. Then you have no choice but to look at Many Worlds Interpretation or similar. The key here is that you have to consider a global wave function, it never collapses, and any observer is always a quantum sub-system in a super-position. It has limited practical value in describing experiments, but it\u0027s the interpretation where you can intuitively see resolutions to most counterintuitive features of quantum mechanics. In MWI, you can immediately see why EPR is not a paradox, why entanglement carries no information, but you can use it for Quantum Teleportation, and even Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser doesn\u0027t seem so weird.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the key thing to remember is that these interpretations are equivalent. There are some crazy ones out there that are almost nonsensical, but Copenhagen and MWI are equivalent on the level of theorems proving equivalence. Which is why I always recommend looking at anything \u0022weird\u0027 in QM from perspective of these two. It gives you two diametrically opposing views on the same thing, and anything that looks unintuitive from one end is clear from the other.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lodestar","CreatedById":101720,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-03T18:03:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Brotoro\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Brotoro\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENo. This is where you keep making your mistake.

I\u0027ll try to explain, in the context of this topic. Let\u0027s say we don\u0027t apprehend reality directly through our senses, we form mental concepts that correspond to the real objects. The purpose of the scientific method is then to strip those concepts of anything that can\u0027t be described mathematically, not to know the objects in themselves, beyond our mental concepts (that\u0027s the role of philosophy, by the way). For instance, when we conceptualize an electron as a subatomic particle with negative charge, that\u0027s not all the electron is in reality, that\u0027s just all we need to describe it mathematically to understand a particular phenomenon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, think of a soda can and a piece of curtain rod, both made of aluminum. They may be made of the same atoms, have the same mass, and many other properties, but there\u0027s one fundamental difference about them that doesn\u0027t actually have physical existence, their form. The ideal form of a soda can and a piece of curtain rod can exist in our minds independently of any matter. So, we could divide reality in things that can be fully described mathematically without a residue, and things that can\u0027t be described without their forms, or in other words, without a corresponding mental concept, what Descartes called res extensae and res cogitas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis premise of the cartesian ontology, called bifurcation by some, is one of the basic premises of modern science, although most scientists don\u0027t have the philosophical training to recognize it. For modern science, there\u0027s only the res extensae, only things that can be described mathematically without any residue, but obviously, on our day to day lives we don\u0027t even contemplate that notion. When we see a soda can or a piece or curtain rod, we don\u0027t think of them as a bunch of atoms of aluminum, we think of them as their forms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe whole point is that a subatomic particle exists without form, it exists only within the res extensae, and the state vector collapses not when it interacts with the mind, but when it interacts with something within the res cogitans, something that can\u0027t be completely described within the res extensae, like a bubble chamber or a double slit cover and wall. This something will determine what\u0027s the substantial form the subatomic particle will acquire when one of its many potential states is actualized, something Wolfgang Smith calls vertical causality, to distinguish it from horizontal causality, the physical chain of causality. Pretty much like two vectors, vertical causality can\u0027t effect horizontal causality, but it can effect an ontological change that will then effect physical causality. The quantum phenomena are pretty intuitive and clear when you put it under these premises, something Heisenberg himself recognized but nobody paid much attention. It puzzled physicists for decades because they are trying to explain it only within the res extensae, and that\u0027s doomed to fail, because quantum phenomena ultimately bridge the gap. In a sense, they are the empirical proof that Descartes was wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOK, taking \u0022potency\u0022 \u0022actualized\u0022 and \u0022substantial form\u0022 as terms defined by this sentence (happens all the time in Math.

Crash course in Aristotelian metaphysics. Potency is the potential for some change. For instance, a bunch of clay can be molded into a brick or a vase, it has the potency to that. Act is changing an object to one of its potencies, so when you mold the bunch of clay into a brick, you\u0027re actualizing it into a brick. Substantial form is simply how matter is organized when actualized, so the bunch of clay actualized into a brick now has the substantial form of a brick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, a particle in a state of superposition exists only as potency, without form. The state vector is collapsed when it interacts with the measurement instrument, which has form and transfer act. What stops the superposition from breaking down most of the time is precisely that most of the time it\u0027s not being actualized by something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAha.

When the ether was scrapped, taking with it simpler explanations for a plethora of electromagnetic phenomena, the main argument was that it was undetected or if it actually existed, it would mean Earth wasn\u0027t moving. OK, I could live with that. Years later, you have Dark Matter equally undetected, serving the exact opposite purpose of preserving the theory that solved the initial problem and scrapped the ether, and people act like it\u0027s no problem at all.

Well, correct me if I am wrong, but we have observed two in fully controlled experiments. Doppler effect due to relative movement and having the radiation source lower in a gravity well. It\u0027s not Doppler, you say. Which leaves a very, very odd matter distribution and gravity field (spherically symmetric would not cut it, there is no outbound gravity field of that symmetry, at least not with regular sources).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I understand your objection correctly, the problem is that you\u0027re not taking the whole package. I wouldn\u0027t say odd because that qualifier is merely cultural, but yes, that leaves you with a very small, dense, closed and young universe, but also with the Earth in the center and the universe spinning around. Your symmetrical outbound gravity field that keeps everything from falling apart is nothing but good old centrifugal force.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, even if you interpret redshifts to be Doppler, expansion of the space itself, compton effect, or any other interpretation that escapes the problem of having to put Earth in the center, you\u0027re still left with the problem of quasar redshift distribution, that persists no matter what interpretation you choose. Even if we stick with the standard model, you still have 23760 known quasars distributed in uniform concentric shells around the Earth, and currently there\u0027s no solution to that other than admitting Earth is in a privileged frame.
