Two, that crash was 2018, which is a huge amount of training data ago, and Tesla have not themselves released FSD as acceptable for unsupervised use, it\u0027s like cruise control, you are supposed to pay attention (I for one think they should use the interior camera to monitor driver attention to keep even autopilot on).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThree, and related to what I posted WRT police cars, I think that it IS ready for that given the current state of affairs with some modification for that specific task. I mean that autopilot and/or current FSD being on for a few seconds here and there is certainly better than NO self driving and NO driver attention, which is what happens when someone (a police officer in this case) is looking at a screen, and the vehicle is moving.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027m not saying we can have FSD police cars with no intervention by the driver (I think we agree here), but I am saying that the police are pretty much required to look at screens while driving more than the ZERO PERCENT OF THE TIME they \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E be looking at a screen (I NEVER take my phone out of my pocket while driving, and as far as I am concerned, touching a phone while driving should have your DL instantly revoked. The second time it happens, for life). So it would have to be a hybrid for of autopilot/FSD for police vehicles. Something where it turns on automatically if the driver glances at the computer, then turns off when his attention goes back to driving. My idea here is that during those moments of required inattention, the car has \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003E driving being done, vs \u003Cem\u003Eno\u003C/em\u003E driving being done, if that makes sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo cop needs to pull something up on the screen, and his Tesla patrol car sees his inattention (use existing selfie cam in car to see where driver gaze is), and the car maintains current route/lane keeping for him while he is paying attention to screen.

Theirs watches the driver, and even turns the thing off if it sees a cell phone in the frame (or the eyes not looking at the road). Autopilot properly used is basically like cruise control, but with lane-keeping. We tested it on a regular road for kicks and it still worked, but that\u0027s not what it\u0027s for, and it doesn\u0027t navigate, it just stays on the road, and stops for obstacles, etc. FSD on a Tesla?
