Electrifying semi trucks will likely lead to an increase in the use of semi trucks, and if the ultimate source of that energy is still fossil fuels (as it is likely to be) then total emissions are likely to still increase, potentially even faster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInterestingly Germany has been trying to develop their renewable industry - and the amount they\u0027ve spent likely could have been used to build a large nuclear industry for most of the country.
