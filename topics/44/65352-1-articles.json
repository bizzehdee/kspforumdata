First, it does emit/absorb the IR, but not equally well at all frequencies. You need to consider the absorption spectrum. Radiation spectrum will depend on that and the temperature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides radiation, heat also propagates through gases (or fluid) via advection (or convection) and heat flow. You can basically assume that boundary layer of gas (fluid) touching your solid object has the same temperature as object\u0027s surface. Through the solid, you only have to worry about heat flow, so you just need to know heat conductivity of the material. Then you can solve for temperature gradient and figure out how heat flows through the solid. In the gas, you\u0027ll have heat carried by both the movement of individual molecules, which is going to work like diffusion, meaning it follows the same laws as heat propagation in solids, but also carried by the gas flow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you know the flow rate, this is pretty straight forward to figure. Unfortunately, in a lot of cases, the flow depends on how much heat is carried away. Hot air balloon is a good example. As you\u0027ve pointed out, making skin of the balloon reflective minimizes IR losses. But heat will flow through the skin, heating up surrounding air. As the surrounding air heats up, it will rise, generating a convection current. That will carry away the heat and bring in fresh cold air. That means more heat will escape, and that means a stronger convection current. In order to figure out exactly how much heat you are going to be losing, you need to solve a complicated hydrodynamics problem along with the basic heat transfer problem for the balloon\u0027s skin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you are looking for a simple solution from perspective of theory, there is none. It might be possible to come up with an approximate analytical solution for a simple shape of the balloon, but for a general balloon, this would have to be simulated on the computer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere might be some empirical, very roughly approximate formulas out there. I am not familiar with anything like that, but it seems that for balloon sport, this might have been useful, and somebody would derive approximate formulas based on observation. Try searching the internet, or maybe find an air balloon forum if you need a formula specifically for that. If it\u0027s more general, like I said, it\u0027s going to be a very complicated computation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peadar1987","CreatedById":81207,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-10T09:08:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, it\u0027s not easy, but you can find rough correlations out there, I\u0027ll try and find an open-source one for you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-10T14:26:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks K2 and peadar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that is the reason why I can not find an intuitive or simple formule. Like you point the gas flow over the surface is also important. I saw in some formules that variable in m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe formules that I find are not easy to understand, I dont know how to calculate each of its variables, and even if I do, I am not sure if can be applied to my cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut you are right, find correlations numbers or models to hot air ballons it will be a good start. The problem that eventually I want this knowledge to calculate something a little more complicate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell I will post any advance in this matter, it\u0027s a shame that most engineering software are not free.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
