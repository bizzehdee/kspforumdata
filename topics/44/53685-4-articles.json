We can take this as a lower bound because there are numerous positive feedbacks we need to account for, increased water vapour concentration, methane from permafrost, rainforest loss, ice albedo effect while negative feedbacks are almost solely down to increased radiation with temperature via the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is obviously already taken into account in this model.
