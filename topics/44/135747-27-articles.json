The numbers just don\u0027t work out with kerosene fuel. For the Falcon 9, the 2nd stage could be made reusable but it would not be able to carry anything significant - not even a cargo Dragon to the ISS, which is the most lightweight/easy payload they\u0027re regularly sending up. (Recall: the Dragon missions were designed for the Falcon 9 v1.0 rocket, which was 40% less powerful than the current v1.1 iteration.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Falcon Heavy meanwhile could still launch Falcon 9 sized payloads even when fully reusable. But well, you still need to launch a Falcon Heavy for everything you can currently launch a Falcon 9, and the FH is simply that much more expensive. You run into the problem where you save money from the reusability, but at the same time, because you need to use oversized, overpriced launchers for the payload, you\u0027re not actually able to pass any cost/kg advantages on to the customers. Heck, while they\u0027re still practising right now, cost/kg would go \u003Cem\u003Eup\u003C/em\u003E if they started setting aside fuel for 2nd stage reusability. And that\u0027s assuming the stunt of returning a spent stage intact from orbit it even works, which has yet to be proven.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo all in all, it would be a whole lot of wasted effort, time and money to do that with the current generation of Falcon 9/Falcon Heavy, and because of that, you can consider it effectively scrapped. When the third generation of SpaceX\u0027s launch vehicles debuts around 2020, then you can ask again. For those will use a better fuel and a more efficient engine cycle, resulting in much higher Isp and thus less payload lost to reusability considerations... on the first stage too, which compounds into even more savings on the second.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ikaneko","CreatedById":109214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-08T21:38:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t wait for the DSCOVR mission!!

And even though at 570 kilograms, DSCOVR is a fraction of the weight of the heavily laden Dragon capsule, the necessity of hurling it to a solar orbit nearly a million miles from Earth, a task which will demand even more of the second stage, means that it will re-enter the atmosphere much more dynamically, and without the fuel margin for three separate burns. Instead it will make just two burns, depending on the hypersonic grid fins to adjust its trajectory and target the Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship (ASDS) waiting nearly 400 miles down range.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-08T22:12:44Z\u0022 title=\u002202/08/2015 10:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Airlock\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SuperFastJellyfish","CreatedById":57985,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-08T22:10:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GoSlash27\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GoSlash27\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI still don\u0027t understand why it ran out of hydraulic fluid the first time unless it had a leak.

The numbers just don\u0027t work out with kerosene fuel. For the Falcon 9, the 2nd stage could be made reusable but it would not be able to carry anything significant - not even a cargo Dragon to the ISS, which is the most lightweight/easy payload they\u0027re regularly sending up. (Recall: the Dragon missions were designed for the Falcon 9 v1.0 rocket, which was 40% less powerful than the current v1.1 iteration.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The Falcon Heavy meanwhile could still launch Falcon 9 sized payloads even when fully reusable. But well, you still need to launch a Falcon Heavy for everything you can currently launch a Falcon 9, and the FH is simply that much more expensive. You run into the problem where you save money from the reusability, but at the same time, because you need to use oversized, overpriced launchers for the payload, you\u0027re not actually able to pass any cost/kg advantages on to the customers. Heck, while they\u0027re still practising right now, cost/kg would go \u003Cem\u003Eup\u003C/em\u003E if they started setting aside fuel for 2nd stage reusability. And that\u0027s assuming the stunt of returning a spent stage intact from orbit it even works, which has yet to be proven.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So all in all, it would be a whole lot of wasted effort, time and money to do that with the current generation of Falcon 9/Falcon Heavy, and because of that, you can consider it effectively scrapped. When the third generation of SpaceX\u0027s launch vehicles debuts around 2020, then you can ask again. For those will use a better fuel and a more efficient engine cycle, resulting in much higher Isp and thus less payload lost to reusability considerations... on the first stage too, which compounds into even more savings on the second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really think that a single core, 9 Raptor engine rocket could make a far superior replacement for the Falcon heavy long term. With the Raptors current quoted stats it would produce the same thrust as the FH but with a much higher ISP. It could potentially allow full reusability compared to the FH partial reusability.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
