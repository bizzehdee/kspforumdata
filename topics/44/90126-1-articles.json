But realistically you\u0027ve got other things changing such as drag force, which depends on altitude (density) and velocity, which combine to give you dynamic pressure. This is a very real force and has a strong effect on your performance, so it\u0027s best not to treat it as a constant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of dynamic pressure, the max. height your first stage will carry you depends to a large extent on your throttle setting. Lower throttle may prevent you from going too fast (and wastefully) in the lower atmosphere, so your fuel is more efficiently used, and hence you go higher. On the other hand, with a very heavy upper stage and payload, you may need to be at full throttle so you minimize the time spent lifting the upper stage to altitude and staging velocity (because if you\u0027re going too slow, you\u0027re \u0022hovering\u0022 and burning fuel against the never-ending force of gravity. You have a rocket not a helicopter). Somewhere in between these extremes of too slow and too fast, there is an optimum point where you get the most out of your first stage. This point will (wet finger in the air) probably be something close to 200-300 m/s at burnout, and let\u0027s say 10,000 m altitude. YMMV, but if you\u0027re going much faster or slower than this at the 10,000 m point, then you\u0027re probably not at the optimum point for your stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA more exact way to get answers to your questions would be to solve the rocket state equations numerically...but you needn\u0027t look very far, because by gum, this is what you get just by flying your ship in KSP. So I\u0027d suggest trying out your design in sandbox mode so there\u0027s no penalty for flying the same ship multiple times as you tweak the design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could also try an add-on such as mechjeb, that can provide you with overall numbers for each stage, and somewhere inside mechjeb are calculations going on to ensure the right speed and trajectory to stay near the optimum for your rocket. Just watch mechjeb fly your ship, and you\u0027ll learn something about how it ought to be flown \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-12T21:17:18Z\u0022 title=\u002211/12/2014 09:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MajorThomas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starman4308","CreatedById":122674,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-12T22:07:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ulrikbm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ulrikbm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs there anyone who can help my with an explanation on how to find the distance for the rocket before it burn out of fuel. and what will the speed at burn-out time be.

There\u0027s several programs out there which help you do that: one of my favorites is called Kerbal Space Program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be helpful: what MajorThomas said. MechJeb will generally fly an okay gravity turn; you can probably optimize it, but it gives you a rough idea of what you should be doing (disclaimer: not valid for FAR/NEAR aerodynamics, which are much less forgiving of large pitch angles).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Using realistic aerodynamics, as opposed to the stock souposphere.

What you do in stock is gradually tip over eastwards. In the absence of atmosphere, you want the absolute minimum amount of vertical thrust necessary to avoid uncomfortable encounters with terrain: you want to start going horizontal as much as possible from the moment of liftoff. This practice minimizes gravity drag (loss of dV to gravity). In the presence of stock souposphere, though, sea-level atmosphere is going to kill your velocity quickly (aero drag). As such, you want to burn vertical to get out of the thickest of the soup before starting your eastwards turn. This is what MechJeb is calibrated for: a pitch profile designed to balance aero and gravity drag in a stock drag environment. It has nothing to do with aerodynamic stresses or AoA, because stock aerodynamics acts equally an all parts and does not model body lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA real gravity turn can only really be done in FAR/NEAR. In these mods, you wait until you\u0027re going ~60-100 m/s (depending on rocket TWR profile), tip over 2-5 degrees east, wait for your prograde marker to catch up, and then say \u0022Look Ma, no hands!\u0022. If CoL is properly behind CoM and your rocket is pointed reasonably close to prograde, aerodynamic stability will tend to keep your rocket pointed dead-prograde all the way through until you hit upper atmosphere. You need to do this (possibly plus or minus a few gentle control inputs), because any violent movements away from prograde will cause your rocket to flip from aerodynamic instability, and if you start your gravity turn too late, you will, A, run into difficulties trying to turn at high velocity, and B, waste lots of dV going upwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027ve passed max-Q (maximum aerodynamic stress) and are in upper atmosphere, you can start to have your own ideas about what the proper orientation is. I would suggest trying to keep tAp (time to apoapsis) around 10-20s, which will describe a gentle ascent which is mostly going horizontal, minimizing gravity drag while slowly getting you out of atmosphere. This often has the advantage of keeping you in a good orientation to take advantage of body lift*, though that is dependent on your current stage\u0027s TWR and how close you are to orbital velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Go fast enough, and even a giant tube of rocket fuel gets aerodynamic lift in FAR/real-world physics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
