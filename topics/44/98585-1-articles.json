When you\u0027re going nearer to c, you have to deal with the time dilation and aberration effects due to relativity. In a purely radial direction (directly toward or away from the observer), aberration isn\u0027t a consideration, and you have z=[(1\u002B\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B2)/(1-\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B2)]-1. For 0.1c, z=0.22 or more than twice as much wavelength shift as predicted by classical mechanics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: You\u0027d have to be going about 0.97c to shift yellow light up to X-rays. Keep in mind that if you could decelerate at 1000g\u0027s, it would take about 8 hours to decelerate enough to open up this large a speed gap between the vessels. Hopefully your vessels are more than 8 light-hours apart.
