The same thing happens in Indonesia, where almost all things are cultivated in Java with Sumatra practically used for palm plantations, Borneo as place for logging and coal mining and other islands either too dry or is still in wilderness. Food prices are higher on other island because of the transport required, but otherwise is cheap here. Blame it on staple food uniformity (rice, which before have been more diverse including wheat, corn, cassava, sago and tuber which all are more suitable for other islands) but still other things are distributed from Java to other island too.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-15T03:59:48Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2016 03:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by YNM\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stargate525","CreatedById":53585,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-15T03:56:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222514712\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022136469\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221460691152\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002298447\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022YNM\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 minutes ago, YNM said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe difference is, a cathedral\u0027s pillars only support the roof.
