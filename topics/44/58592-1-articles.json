Being middle aged means people are more mature, more likely to get along with other people in a confined space for a long time, and not lose their temper in a critical situation.

Very unlikely that a 20-something could do it, unless he\u0027s a pure genius that has both top mind and physical condition.

I\u0027ve worked in private companies for the last 25 years, and I\u0027ve met my share of slackers and pork there too. I\u0027ve also been close to some civil servants who were among the most dedicated and professional that I\u0027ve ever met. There are thousands of government employees who respond 24/7 to emergencies or don\u0027t count their time because they know that their service is essential. I happen to live in a country where public service still means something to them. My anecdotal evidence is just as valuable as yours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also happens that over the last 60 years of space exploration, 100% of it has been funded by governments and 0% by private enterprise. You can criticize bureaucracy and administration, but the truth is that if you want to see something done in space other than comsats, then taxpayer money is the only show in town. So until you can tell us what your magical vision for a space program is, I suggest that you refrain from criticism without preparing some material to back it up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T20:49:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe kerbal Space Program forums are not the place for insults and personal attacks, this thread ends here, and I recommend that similar comments are not taken to other threads.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
