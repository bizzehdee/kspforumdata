So here it is: why did SpaceX change the arrangement of the nine Merlin engines of the F9 first stage from a 3x3 grid to the \u0022octaweb\u0022? Wikipedia just says it increases efficiency, but I was wondering \u003Cem\u003Ehow\u003C/em\u003E it does it.

The Octaweb is a metal structure that supports eight engines surrounding a center engine at the base of the launch vehicle.
