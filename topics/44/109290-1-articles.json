It follows, then, that if you add two more apples to the pile, there\u0027s then 4 apples. Call it what you want, but adding 2 apples to a pile of 2 apples results in a pile of 4 apples. So it seems that math was discovered by people, and all we invented was a set of symbols and words to describe it.\n\nBut on the other hand, higher math, like calculus, is a lot harder to justify as \u0022fundamental.\u0022 A lot of laws of physics seem to fit nicely in with math, but is that because the universe is fundamentally mathematical, or because we humans invented math to explain the universe?\n\nIn my opinion, math was discovered, just like the laws of physics.

If not, then why would math be invented? Math is a compilation of theorems based in logic, many of which stem from earlier, and simpler, theorems. But the theorems are not invented, they are the product of thinking about an observation and coming to a logical conclusion. That observation may be of a previous theorem, or not.

Seeing two objects as no longer separate but as one. That is not invented, but it is observed.\n\nHowever, the numbers used to represented those quantities are invented constructs. They had to be invented for us to understand math, but they aren\u0027t math. One could just as much use letters as numbers in math, or any other symbol of your choosing.

This would be a necessary step before more advanced steps.\n\nIt would be very intriguing if they did discover 13.000 years old markings where someone carved \u0022Zorg killed III deer, Bam killed II deer and Zlob stole I deer from Zorg leaving Zorg with II deer before the two hunters decided to split the remaining deer between them and their 2 uncles so that each got I deer.\u0022\n\nThe interesting thing is, at one point in the evolution of concepts, that\u0027s in essence what happened.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T15:53:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 03:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LN400**"},{"CreatedByName":"-Velocity-","CreatedById":74097,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T16:47:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Actually, it goes even further back in time.

Notches are still in use today, as they are useful for slowly counting a small to medium number of objects when the total number is going to be unknown, especially on a substrate or with a medium that doesn\u0027t support erasing.

Our truly ancient languages and beliefs are long lost. The common, every-day need to express numbers makes me believe that it\u0027s a certainty that there were probably countless paleolithic cultures and language systems that found ways to express numbers- at least verbally and/or with body language- without resorting to a crude series of grunts.
