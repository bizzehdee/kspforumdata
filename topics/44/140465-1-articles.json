Everything in real world is thousands of times harder, more tedious and takes a massive amount of work. I don\u0027t know much about aerospace engineering, but I bet that every single nut and bolt has been thoroughly tested, there has been years of materials studies behind it and there\u0027s probably a company somewhere that employs a dozen people who primarily manufacture these bolts. Of course everything looks nice and efficient once it\u0027s done, but there\u0027s a huge amount of work done behind the scenes.

I do sometimes wonder whether a bit more attention to detail behind the scenes (and so hidden to the players) might give Squad a better, more coherent framework to work with when it comes to balancing parts and adding new parts, but on the other hand, that would also involve a large amount of work from a fairly small team for something that is going to be largely invisible to players. Probably not worth it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I do sometimes think that folks on this forum get a bit carried away with the fact that they\u0027re playing \u0027a game about rocket science\u0027 and on some threads I\u0027ve noticed a distinct whiff of elitism or smug self-satisfaction that they\u0027re playing a \u0027hard\u0027 game and that KSP players are somehow better or smarter than others because of that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEasy to do, and I have to admit that I got a bit carried away in my own head when I started playing KSP and finding that I \u0027could do orbital mechanics\u0027 (lol). However, I did also work out fairly quickly that I\u0027d be utterly sunk without the Map screen to help me. Then I started writing my KSP story and reading up a bit more on actual spaceflight to try and add a bit of authenticity to that story.

I do sometimes wonder whether a bit more attention to detail behind the scenes (and so hidden to the players) might give Squad a better, more coherent framework to work with when it comes to balancing parts and adding new parts, but on the other hand, that would also involve a large amount of work from a fairly small team for something that is going to be largely invisible to players.
