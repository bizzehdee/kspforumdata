As much as I can tell with how little I understand of this. I\u0027m assuming diamond is good for the higher density. But I\u0027m not sure what would be an ideal form of carbon. Diamond sounds more interesting though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, you store metallic hydrogen for density of hydrogen. You then store diamond potentially like a solid rocket booster or otherwise melt and drip into the engine feed(or whatever is needed.). You then collect air and liquefy it and then use the liquid nitrogen for cooling the ship hull and other parts of the ship and collect the oxygen as liquid oxygen to pump as an oxydizer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPotentially, the idea is you melt the diamond to and mix with the metallic hydrogen in order to make literal methane or liquid methane fuel. Then use as a normal Methalox combo. Other side stuff would be used or dumped as needed. No idea how effective this would be or how much electricity would be needed. Still slowly learning things. Edit: And if there is enough nitrogen and/or stored liquid oxygen with it use one or the other as mono propellants\u00A0 for maneuvering thruster at various parts of the ship if it\u0027s safe. Would that do anything interesting if they were combined in a nozzle and released somehow?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould this allow more effective density of fuel? Would this be more effective than theoretically pure metallic hydrogen? I\u0027m assuming you could both start with liquid oxygen and convert in flight potentially.
