not sure of the point.\u00A0 While lead-acid batteries were invented in the mid-19th century and presumably available in the early 20th (and needed for car starters toward the end of the period examined), I fail to see how they would be better for cars 1900-1925 (and especially past 1925).\u00A0 It isn\u0027t so much a missed opportunity as tech simply not being there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the one hand, you have the king of the 20th century, the ICE.\u00A0 It suffers from terrible emissions, tends to only be efficient at full power and uses a throttle to strangle the air \u00A0(O\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0and gasoline)\u00A0supply of the engine to reduce power.\u00A0 This makes sure the thing is badly inefficient, and the efficiency gets worse as the car gets more powerful (typically meaning \u0026gt;100hp in modern US [bloated] cars).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand in electric cars\u00A0you have lead acid batteries\u00A0running directly to brushed DC motors.\u00A0 I\u0027d be shocked silly if they were using vacuum tubes to create a switching power supply mechanism.\u00A0 Regulation would presumably involve a rheostat, and be unlikely to beat the efficiency of the throttled ICE.\u00A0 I\u0027m pretty sure effective chargers existed, but I doubt they would be so concerned with efficiency (you need a constant voltage, then just use a trickle charge).\u00A0 It doesn\u0027t look at all like a modern electric car, and such things weren\u0027t really possible until at least roughly the time of the EV-1 (1990s).\u00A0 I remember seeing a 1970s electric car (probably some sort of \u0022green\u0022 exhibit).\u00A0 I think it resembled a trabant in shape, size and power.\u00A0 But probably worse in all respects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd for most of the twentieth century, there would be little point of advocating \u0022green power\u0022, with the exception of the horror of southern Californian air (which was still scary when I was there in 1995).\u00A0 More likely, your best arguments for electric power would center around countries with plenty of resources to make electricity (*) but issues dealing with countries that had plenty of gasoline producing crude oil.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou need a lot of technologies that\u00A0 weren\u0027t available in 1925 to build an electric car, and Lithium-ion batteries are just the start.\u00A0 The next critical item is some sort of current switcher needed to produce electric motors with enough torque to move themselves (let alone the car) and also function at high rpm (for something resembling high speed driving).\u00A0 Not to mention you\u0027ll need similar switchers simply to quickly/efficiently charge the battery.\u00A0 I\u0027m guessing you could build an electric motor that would match a 1925 ICE with just those, but getting much more might require rare-earth magnets.\u00A0 I don\u0027t think they were a thing (i.e. mass produced) until at least the 1990s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(*) I\u0027m convinced that \u0022too cheap to meter\u0022 was the reason that nuclear power plants are so expensive to make.\u00A0 All the regulation and standard practices were set in stone when electricity was a regulated public utility and thus effectively \u0022cost plus\u0022.\u00A0 The power companies would happily agree to any regulation that [slowly, or better yet in the future] increased the cost of power generation as they could simply jack up the prices and thus increase the profits (the \u0022plus\u0022 in cost plus).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo summarize, when it is steam time, you get steam engines.\u00A0 You don\u0027t get electric cars in 1925.\u00A0 The infrastructure just won\u0027t support it.\u00A0 You might as well ask \u0022where is my hydrogen car\u0022?\u00A0 The infrastructure simply won\u0027t support it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-25T05:17:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022

In 1,000 grams one finds 96.5% water and about 2.66% sodium chloride; then small quantities of magnesium chloride, potassium chloride, magnesium bromide, sulfate of magnesia, calcium sulfate, and calcium carbonate. Hence you observe that sodium chloride is encountered there in significant proportions.

Mixed with mercury, it forms an amalgam that takes the place of zinc in Bunsen cells. The mercury is never depleted. Only the sodium is consumed, and the sea itself gives me that. Beyond this, I\u0027ll mention that sodium batteries have been found to generate the greater energy, and their electro\u2013motor strength is twice that of zinc batteries.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Captain, I fully understand the excellence of sodium under the conditions in which you\u0027re placed. The sea contains it. Fine. But it still has to be produced, in short, extracted. And how do you accomplish this? Obviously your batteries could do the extracting; but if I\u0027m not mistaken, the consumption of sodium needed by your electric equipment would be greater than the quantity you\u0027d extract.

For comparison one ubiquitous car here (MPV / small SUV) is the Toyota Kijang (now Kijang Innova). The earliest model that our family owned had a kerb weight range of 1 - 1.5 tonnes, so was the second model. It was produced from mid 80s to early 2000s. From then on they switched to the latter Innova model, technically not the same chassis. It started the same - at 1.5 tonnes (it had one body form, the previous ones had short to long) - but the latest model released in 2015 is already 1.7 - 1.9 tonnes. Sure yes we\u0027ve got more features, like airbags and a better 3rd seat row by default (the old models are either an option or only aftermarket), and it is longer, but if anything I\u0027d say that we were able to fit more stuff in the old one than the new one, partly because how the interior are shaped. So if you ask me, then yes ICE vehicles have gotten somewhat unnecessarily bulkier than they used to be.

electric motors (granted, they were AC ones, I\u0027m assuming you could\u00A0 do the same with DC) most of this time.\u00A0 This is roughly the power in the electric motor of a Prius.\u00A0 The infallible wiki lists a model-T at 20hp (early VW beetles produced a little more), a Chevy Bell Air\u00A0(pre-1955 I-6) at 95hp, and later (i.e. the classic \u0022\u002757 chevy\u0022 and similar models) V8 small block at 162hp (base).\u00A0 \u00A0The Prius has a \u0022combined hp\u0022 of 121, presumably meaning roughly 90hp in the ICE.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy guess is that a (modern style) hybrid would make sense for post-war production (depression-era production of high power wouldn\u0027t make sense, nor would building a hybrid out of a 20hp engine.\u00A0 The tech was there, the market was not).\u00A0 One big problem is that you would have to slowly charge the lead acid batteries or lose half your efficiency, and simply using them hard (the whole point of a hybrid) would also lose half your battery efficiency.\u00A0 They would probably work well (in the US) for light cars made in the 1970s and 1980s, with \u0026lt;100hp engines (like the prius).\u00A0 This should keep the ICE in the \u0022BSHP island**\u0022 and still have enough total hp to move the car.\u00A0 The combination could presumably work for the early Bell Air, but trying to convince 1950s America to stick with it in when \u0022they could have had a V-8\u0022 would be difficult.\u00A0 My understanding was that in equal dollars, 1950s gasoline was at least as expensive as in the typical OPEC era, so it might have been possible to sell a car with great mileage, but even then it would be a challenge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, the first car Ferdinand Porsche made was a serial hybrid: you have an ICE to run a generator, and an electric motor to move the wheels.\u00A0 Solves the problem of having a transmission, but once remotely good transmissions were available this system was scraped (at least for cars).\u00A0 A hybrid with large batteries might have made sense in a depression-era car (running the ICE exclusively in the \u0022BSHP island\u0022, but would require a huge battery to avoid the losses associated with fast charges or discharges.\u00A0 Also the whole system just sounds to complex for that era, especially in cost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* obviously you \u0022could build\u0022 a more powerful motor.\u00A0 But you\u0027d need a smaller (geared lower) motor to start it.\u00A0 The electric car motor might even need a lower first gear than the ICE to get started, but then could presumably switch to a higher second gear sooner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n** \u0022BSHP island\u0022: an ICE is most efficient at about half throttle*** at peak torque, so at roughly between 1/3 to 1/2 total power.\u00A0 Outside of that range, things fall rapidly.\u00A0 And\u00A0 regardless of how much horsepower a car needs to \u0022get out of its own way\u0022, producing more than 30hp for even relatively short periods can lead to excessive speeds.\u00A0 This is why the Prius (which can typically drive in that island) gets such good gas mileage, and why lightweight, low power cars (last seen in the US in the 1980s) could achieve similar numbers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*** the \u0027half throttle\u0027 may well be a function of engine compression and the need for modern engines to\u00A0go fuel rich at higher power levels to avoid knock.\u00A0 I suspect that the carbureted engines of the time had max efficiency\u00A0with wide open throttle .\u00A0 I\u0027m not that familiar with the specifics of engine design and even less familiar with this class of retro

electric motors (granted, they were AC ones, I\u0027m assuming you could\u00A0 do the same with DC) most of this time.\u00A0 This is roughly the power in the electric motor of a Prius.\u00A0 The infallible wiki lists a model-T at 20hp (early VW beetles produced a little more), a Chevy Bell Air\u00A0(pre-1955 I-6) at 95hp, and later (i.e. the classic \u0022\u002757 chevy\u0022 and similar models) V8 small block at 162hp (base).\u00A0 \u00A0The Prius has a \u0022combined hp\u0022 of 121, presumably meaning roughly 90hp in the ICE.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy guess is that a (modern style) hybrid would make sense for post-war production (depression-era production of high power wouldn\u0027t make sense, nor would building a hybrid out of a 20hp engine.\u00A0 The tech was there, the market was not).\u00A0 One big problem is that you would have to slowly charge the lead acid batteries or lose half your efficiency, and simply using them hard (the whole point of a hybrid) would also lose half your battery efficiency.\u00A0 They would probably work well (in the US) for light cars made in the 1970s and 1980s, with \u0026lt;100hp engines (like the prius).\u00A0 This should keep the ICE in the \u0022BSHP island**\u0022 and still have enough total hp to move the car.\u00A0 The combination could presumably work for the early Bell Air, but trying to convince 1950s America to stick with it in when \u0022they could have had a V-8\u0022 would be difficult.\u00A0 My understanding was that in equal dollars, 1950s gasoline was at least as expensive as in the typical OPEC era, so it might have been possible to sell a car with great mileage, but even then it would be a challenge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, the first car Ferdinand Porsche made was a serial hybrid: you have an ICE to run a generator, and an electric motor to move the wheels.\u00A0 Solves the problem of having a transmission, but once remotely good transmissions were available this system was scraped (at least for cars).\u00A0 A hybrid with large batteries might have made sense in a depression-era car (running the ICE exclusively in the \u0022BSHP island\u0022, but would require a huge battery to avoid the losses associated with fast charges or discharges.\u00A0 Also the whole system just sounds to complex for that era, especially in cost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* obviously you \u0022could build\u0022 a more powerful motor.\u00A0 But you\u0027d need a smaller (geared lower) motor to start it.\u00A0 The electric car motor might even need a lower first gear than the ICE to get started, but then could presumably switch to a higher second gear sooner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n** \u0022BSHP island\u0022: an ICE is most efficient at about half throttle*** at peak torque, so at roughly between 1/3 to 1/2 total power.\u00A0 Outside of that range, things fall rapidly.\u00A0 And\u00A0 regardless of how much horsepower a car needs to \u0022get out of its own way\u0022, producing more than 30hp for even relatively short periods can lead to excessive speeds.\u00A0 This is why the Prius (which can typically drive in that island) gets such good gas mileage, and why lightweight, low power cars (last seen in the US in the 1980s) could achieve similar numbers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*** the \u0027half throttle\u0027 may well be a function of engine compression and the need for modern engines to\u00A0go fuel rich at higher power levels to avoid knock.\u00A0 I suspect that the carbureted engines of the time had max efficiency\u00A0with wide open throttle .\u00A0 I\u0027m not that familiar with the specifics of engine design and even less familiar with this class of retro tech.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes powerful AC motors is pretty easy, remember an pre ww2 motor who don\u0027t look that different from more modern ones.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt was used on an potato sorting machine who was very fun to watch as an kid, earlier it was used for lots of stuff like saws cutting firewood but as we got better tools the motor ended up sorting potatoes at our neighbors farm.\u00A0It was 3 phase who has the benefit of having an higher power wiring for starting them.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut as you say you can not charge an lead acid battery fast enough to absorb the breaking energy.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou has\u00A0diesel electric locomotives and train sets but this was direct drive, having to transmit so much power to lots of wheels was not practical using transmission.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis was also tried for some steam turbine warships before WW2.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nToday they tries it again because you use an mix of diesel and gas turbines, but you also need much more electricity for radars and lasers and railguns in the future.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIC engines has also not stand still modern ones are incredible compared to 50 years ago, both in power, reliability and emissions.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nRemember how dirty the snow next to the roads was 30 years ago, Today the dirt is worn out asphalt mixed with snow cleaned from the road.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs hybrid engines become more common I assume IC will focus more on efficiency at optimum rpm with an kickdown high performance mode.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nIgnore all other modes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-26T04:22:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022
