It seems like this could be a feasible real world technology to me, and a way to reduce launch costs dramatically thanks to jet engine fuel efficiency. Jet engines could also be ditched (in a solid ring with parachutes maybe?) and recovered (like in the video) since they would stop working well before orbital speed is achieved. They main thing I think KSP doesn\u0027t address is the need for cooling jet engines during VTOL. I know Harriers have to carry a large amount of water in order to use their VTOL ability, and are still limited to less than 90 seconds of hovering before they run out of water (sorry True Lies, that thing would have crashed like three times over). This could be solved (it seems to me) by a ditchable water tank or SRBs used to get the ship up to speed so it can be aircooled. Does anyone know if this combination has been explored at all? Anyone else see any problems with this idea?\u003Cp\u003EHere is another one by \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/86000-ihmawrtl\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eihmawrtl\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1286.photobucket.com/albums/a604/ryanjede/2013-09-30_00015_zpsef018e3b.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u00222013-09-30_00015_zpsef018e3b.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rpayne88","CreatedById":58336,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-08T23:02:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr use high bypass engines.

Jet engines in real life lose thrust as a function of velocity, making it extremely difficult to use them at either high speeds or high altitudes. Engines that do work in those conditions (RAM, SCRAM) often have certain minimum velocities before they even start working. Which means that you need another set of engines to start the whole thing moving.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing that\u0027s OP about KSP\u0027s jet engine model is the TWR. In real life you need a very strong engine to become VTOL worthy. This puts some nasty penalties on your weight, and thus payload capacity. Engines are also mechanically complex, and thus expensive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s an awful lot of drawbacks for an engine that\u0027s only usable for the first minute of your launch.
