That\u0027s a lot closer to the way they are portrayed in the game.

Rocket engines and their nozzles are designed for a given flowrate, pressure and expansion ratio etc... so increasing temperature will likely reduce ISP is flow is overexpanded, no?\n\nAlso, you question about rocket engines exhausting into a vacuum at supersonic/hypersonic speeds i think is a good one. For detached shocks, the Mach number is actually below 1 on the craft side of the shockwave, so the flow could feasibly get around to the rear. For oblique shock waves, i think you have to look at tables, since flow can be sub sonic or supersonic on the craft side of the shockwave. Theoretically, pressure should be significantly reduced behind a blunt object. However, you need a velocity of ~411 m/s to pull a vacuum at sea level assuming Cp = -1.\n\nIn reality though, i am sure the flow field is more complicated if you are exhausting hot gas, since you have a mass source on the rear of your craft which can prevent detached flow from occurring, which should further reduce pressure drag....\n\nThus, it seems like **drag itself** should be reduced when thrust is applied (since pressure on the rear of the craft is not negative); though i suppose, this might be two ways of looking at the same thing..."},{"CreatedByName":"karolus10","CreatedById":17876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T22:08:23Z","Content":"I don\u0027t like the idea of engines overheating at all, most of them use fuel flowing trough them to cool the engine (especially NERVA\u0027s also they exhaust temperature would be lower than normal chemical rockets) or they designed to work at 100% capacity and not melt or malfunction for certain duration.\n\nI would like to see starting/restarting(with cool-down to arm again) of the engines with it\u0027s different capabilities to do so for different types of engines (from smaller orbital engines that are as easy to control as RCS up to massive behemoths(size 3 ones ?) that you can start just once unless it\u0027s their special feature) and fuels (RCS-like hypergolics vs cryo fuels).\n\nIf anyone would add some balancing factor to NERVA it would be adding more gradual start/shut-down of the \u0022nuke\u0022 engines as instant ON/OFF shut-down means stopping the coolant as well.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-26T22:12:29Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2015 10:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by karolus10**"}]}
