The first stage (called Drakkar), powered by 4 Viking engines (each 700-800 kN, powered by N2O4/UDMH) was to replace the Blue Streak stage and a new large second stage powered by an LH2/LOX engine was to replace the two upper stages.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Viking engine is the descendant of the Vexin engines used on the first stage of the Diamant rocket and the second stage of the Europa I rocket.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Europa programme failed and was reborn through the Ariane programme.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAriane I is a three-stage rocket.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe first stage, Drakkar, is retained. To reduce development risks, the new LH2/LOX engine is retained only for the third stage because it requires a smaller engine (HM7 60 kN). And the second stage consists of a single vacuum variant of the Viking engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLater, to increase the payload of the rocket, the third stage was lengthened.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo compensate for the lower initial T/W ratio of the first stage, in addition to the gradual increase in power of both engines (hydrazine is now added to UDMH to better stabilise the combustion), strap-on boosters were added.\u00A0This is Ariane III.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAriane II is only an Ariane III without boosters intended for a lighter payload and was to be launched with partially empty tanks even at full load if I am not mistaken.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAriane IV is an Ariane III with an extended first stage and larger boosters (combination of solid and liquid fuel). The combinations are 40, 42P, 44P, 42L, 44LP, 44L (0: no boosters, P for powder, L for liquid).\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe liquid fuel booster uses the same Viking engine as the first stage.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Ariane 44L variant is powered by 4\u002B4\u002B1 Viking engines and 1 HM7B engine and can send 4.9 t in GTO compared to 1.8 t with Ariane 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAriane V is a different architecture with a main LH2/LOX engine (1300 kN Vulcain)and two large solid boosters. In the later evolution, ECA, the HM7B engine is used in the upper stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAriane VI is similar to Ariane V with the Vulcain as the main engine. The solid boosters are common with the first stage of the Vega C rocket.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut the upper stage is composed of a new, larger LH2/LOX engine (Vinci 180 kN) that can be restarted.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis engine was initially intended to equip the upper stage of Ariane V for its mid-life evolution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
