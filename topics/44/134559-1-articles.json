Cost a fortune to build and develop, it\u0027d be cheaper to get the extra Delta-V via advanced 5.5m RP-1/Lox boosters, which were proposed for SLS (shunned for ASRBs), and allow for up to 150 T to LEO depending on the engine cycle. If that\u0027s not enough, add 1-2 more SSMEs to the core, and replace the upper stage with a J-2X powered upper stage- the engine was 90% complete, and you could have up to 3 J2-X upper stage engines.

It could probably be single stage, tough, the dV budget is not that bad.... what is it, a bit more than 5km/s to go to\u00A0 the surface from EML1/2 and back? Let\u0027s actually throw some numbers:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn storables (Isp ~320s, the only thing that has actually been used in space after and extended in-orbit period), that would be a Mass Ratio of around 5, or 20% payload (engine weight and tankage are counted as payload, BTW, so final usable payload will be more like 10%). With two stages, however, you get Mass ratio of 2.2 on each, which works out to ~4.9 when you square it. Yeah, just about the breaking point, the two-stage vehicle will be only slightly smaller for the same payload, or have about the same payload fraction, to within one percent or so. But, use the landing stage with a payload on top like a habitat, and you are looking at 45% of the lander weight being useful payload on the ground, for the price of not building the upper stage for that flight (basically, you build a surface payload the same size as the upper stage). Seems convenient, but as I said, you are looking at very similar vehicles down to the thrust level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn both cases, refueling the vehicles saves you building a new one, mostly, since whichever way you cut it the empty weight of the lander is pretty much trivial, because you still have to push 90% of its weight to EML1/2 every time you want to pull of a mission, and you add complexity to its design and the mission architecture. And frankly, the cost of the lander will be mostly R\u0026amp;D, making it reusable will save you very little. Maybe when we are launching to the moon monthly, but you are not going to get anywhere close to such a mission cadence with SLS, so better to save some money and keep things simple.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlus, if you don\u0027t make the lander reusable, you can do the rendezvous in LLO, which has its own advantages. Mainly, it offers the possibility of free return trajectories to it and a smaller dV budget for the lander (which actually is awesome for the storable single stage case, drops mass ratio to around 4), but it also allows an orbit that lets you do science from, and you can also get global access by inserting the lander for each mission into a different orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdvanced fuel for the lander means advanced headaches, of course. Those might be worth it if you have a ready source of fuel nearby, but unless and until we build the fabled polar fuel refineries (and then the lander would be based on the ground, not EML1/2), and/or put a water-rich carbonaceous chondrite in orbit around it (and actually develop the tech to mine it), most of what you are doing is wasting your Isp advantage in the form of boiloff between missions and extra tankage mass. All of it, of course, at the cost of extra R\u0026amp;D money for the lander, which is something that doesn\u0027t exist in the first place, of course...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA lunar lander is one thing that has a (slim) chance to get funded by the next administration.

It could probably be single stage, tough, the dV budget is not that bad.... what is it, a bit more than 5km/s to go to\u00A0 the surface from EML1/2 and back? Let\u0027s actually throw some numbers:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn storables (Isp ~320s, the only thing that has actually been used in space after and extended in-orbit period), that would be a Mass Ratio of around 5, or 20% payload (engine weight and tankage are counted as payload, BTW, so final usable payload will be more like 10%). With two stages, however, you get Mass ratio of 2.2 on each, which works out to ~4.9 when you square it. Yeah, just about the breaking point, the two-stage vehicle will be only slightly smaller for the same payload, or have about the same payload fraction, to within one percent or so. But, use the landing stage with a payload on top like a habitat, and you are looking at 45% of the lander weight being useful payload on the ground, for the price of not building the upper stage for that flight (basically, you build a surface payload the same size as the upper stage). Seems convenient, but as I said, you are looking at very similar vehicles down to the thrust level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn both cases, refueling the vehicles saves you building a new one, mostly, since whichever way you cut it the empty weight of the lander is pretty much trivial, because you still have to push 90% of its weight to EML1/2 every time you want to pull of a mission, and you add complexity to its design and the mission architecture. And frankly, the cost of the lander will be mostly R\u0026amp;D, making it reusable will save you very little. Maybe when we are launching to the moon monthly, but you are not going to get anywhere close to such a mission cadence with SLS, so better to save some money and keep things simple.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlus, if you don\u0027t make the lander reusable, you can do the rendezvous in LLO, which has its own advantages. Mainly, it offers the possibility of free return trajectories to it and a smaller dV budget for the lander (which actually is awesome for the storable single stage case, drops mass ratio to around 4), but it also allows an orbit that lets you do science from, and you can also get global access by inserting the lander for each mission into a different orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdvanced fuel for the lander means advanced headaches, of course. Those might be worth it if you have a ready source of fuel nearby, but unless and until we build the fabled polar fuel refineries (and then the lander would be based on the ground, not EML1/2), and/or put a water-rich carbonaceous chondrite in orbit around it (and actually develop the tech to mine it), most of what you are doing is wasting your Isp advantage in the form of boiloff between missions and extra tankage mass.
