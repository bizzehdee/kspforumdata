The US takes over the world. They force everyone to change to imperial. In 3 countries (Lebanon Myanmar, and Liberia), they are okay, seeing as they use imperial. The rest of the world, not so much. You are in one of the metric countries, and you have to pay huge taxes just to convert. You have to learn imperial, buy a fixed car, drive on roads with imperial signs. There would be civil wars and rebellions all over. This will happen in the US if we convert.

My car had mph speedometer and all roads have miles, not km. My frustration was even more when I had to remember that there were actually two kinds of miles - one ~1.6 km and another nautical one ~1.8 km. I always used the wrong one when I had to estimate the distances. Having been used to kilometers my mind simply accepted the sign 220 as 220 km, not 220 miles.\n\nGas stations were easier since they have displays with price so I didn\u0027t bother just how many litres a gallon was. And rulers and tapes with no cm scale! When I first saw it my first impulse was to call up for a crusade to convert the heretics, by the sword and fire if necessary. I had to manually multiply everything by 2.54... And this was long before internet was readily available in your smartphone. In fact I didn\u0027t even have a cell phone at that time and every conversion I had to do in my head.
