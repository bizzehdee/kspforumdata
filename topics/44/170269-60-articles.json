Gasoline is meant to be used soon after production, and has a usable shelf life of about 3-5 months. With fuel stabilizer, you can get a few more months out of it, but no matter what you add or how you store it, storing it for more than a year is out of the question.

If you have even a cursory knowledge of airports and how commercial airliners works, the entire plot will fall flat on its face. It relies on the whole cast not knowing that all of those airliners flying around without a working runway can just fly to another airport. The movie tries to explain this by saying that the nearest other airport is shut down because of the snowstorm, but if those airliners are carrying enough fuel to circle the sky for\u00A0two hours, they can just fly to an airport further away. For reference, the film takes place in Washington, D.C., which has two nearby airports that are actually mentioned in the film: Dulles International (the target of the terrorist plot) and Reagan National (the one that\u0027s shut down). With the Mid-Atlantic United States being the most densely-populated region in the country, there are at least a\u00A0dozen\u00A0major airports within 300 miles of DC that an airplane can reach in two hours with fuel to spare (Baltimore International, for instance, which isn\u0027t that much further away from Dulles than Reagan), not counting the various military airbases that would gladly receive commercial airliners\u0027 request to land in the event of an emergency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n2. There\u0027s a scene where the hero claims that the criminals were carrying \u0022Glock 7\u0022 handguns that are invisible to airport scanners because they are made of porcelain rather than metal. Even accepting this ludicrous premise (a real Glock is about 87% steel in reality and cannot get through an X-ray or metal detector, and the action of firing a bullet creates too much pressure for the barrel or chamber, even of a handgun, to be made of anything\u00A0but\u00A0metal), anyone would know that bullets are\u00A0also\u00A0made of metals such as lead, and would thus set off metal detectors regardless of what the gun carrying them is made of. This is also ignoring that airport scanners don\u0027t\u00A0just\u00A0look for metal, but\u00A0shape\u00A0as well. A non-metallic gun will still show up, and though it won\u0027t be as bright as a metallic one, anything gun-shaped will raise eyebrows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n3. The climactic scene of the hero lighting a trail of aviation fuel to blow up the plane also contains three particularly bad science about how the aviation fuel behaves: One, aviation kerosene is very difficult to ignite unless first vaporized (such as in the fuel injectors of a jet engine, or in a plane crash). A pool of aviation kerosene lying on a tarmac runway is unlikely to ignite under cold and windy conditions depicted in the film. Two, even a trail of gasoline which is far more flammable still burns at such a slow rate that you could overtake it at a brisk walk, making it impossible for a trail of fire to catch up with a plane which is accelerating to take-off speed.And three, even if the burning fuel did catch up to the taxiing plane and the flame reached the open fuel tank, it is almost impossible for that to cause an explosion of the fuel as depicted in the movie since there would not be the required fuel-to-air mixture for explosive combustion (and the rapid air flow would probably blow the flame out anyway).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAlso, Dulles International Airport is constantly referred to as being in Washington, D.C. when it is actually in Virginia, dozens of miles away.
