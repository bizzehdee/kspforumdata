It would be pretty hard to actually lose contact with Mission Control though. Comms go through redundant channels, including the TDRS satellites and ground stations around the world. Each country has independant communication channels and mission control centers. The USOS and global systems are controlled from Houston, but the international modules have their own Mission Control centers in Russia, Europe, and Japan.
