All of human technology occurs within 100,000 years, but a space faring civilization would have a huge jump start. So lets say 10,000 years maximum to get from entry to go somewhere else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond Earth could send a ship to Centuari-Proxima but also 10 or so other worlds (say all 10 stars within 10 light years), maximally it would take 10,000 years to get to each. So that means we quintruple number of worlds in say 10,000 years once we reach say 100,000 years from now. So that means doubling time is once every 30,000 years. In 100,000,000 we easily have occupied every single star that can be bridged by say 100 ly travel in the entire galaxy, though I am sure some stars would not be reached because of hazards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot only this, but our solar system would have been colonized many time by different routes here from that same single starting system and it would be currently occupied by a number of colony ships floating around in the sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo either we are really clueless about sentient life in our system, they are very stealthy, interstellar travel is really really hard or impossible, or we are the first in an evolution that will populate the galaxy. If that is the case we may never see life in other galaxies because the space-time frame only allows us to look backwards in intergalactic time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLets talk about risks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould we be the first life form in the universe to define the universe (something beyond the scope of the visible universe that contains all energy and matter). Not impossible as one sentient had to have been first, but in comoving space-time, the question becomes meaningless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould we be the first life form in the galaxy to reach this level of sentiency. Improbable, but not impossible. The premise is that our galaxy evolved from gas and has been progressing with the evolution of more complex matter (more heavier elements), in the progression there are points were life is impossible, then becomes very rare, then more common place, then tolerant of sentient life, then probable that sentient life will appear. A half-life for first sentient life. During that progression one life has to be the first sentient and we could be that life form. Space-time is also tolerant of multiple first, this is because \u0022age\u0022 is a measure of the progression of time and is dependent on speed and proximity to the galactic center where things age less quickly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now, we have an 100,000 year interstellar ship, it reaches destination and it collects comets and asteroids, and builds colonies (easily less than 1000 years for each colony) after accumulating a certain number of 1000 colony ships each with its own specialized factories it then begins build the next interstellar travel ship, no need to landing on habitable planets, but habitable planets would be terriformed and colonized at convenience. For example planets around red stars that have finally exited the flare stage might have material from the oort belt brought in to make atmosphere, filtering the elements to add just th right amount of oxygen and hydrogen and nitrogen, then adding the right seeds (like cyanobacterium and other organisms to slowly build up life. Once you have \u0027bread crumb\u0027 colonies between Earth and \u0027terriform\u0027 planet you could transfer complex ecosystem inhabitants by cryogenic storage (egg or spores) that are then implanted into mechanized \u0027maternobots\u0027 that specifically provide the needs for each organism and bring species back to life on the new world. The sentients could build specialized command and control, invention centers etc on these worlds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-10T17:22:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA perhaps more likely scenario is AI.

Literally, until virtually every comet, every asteroid, every moon, every planet where some exotic form of primitive life might have clung to existence would need to be looked at closely, very closely, and thoroughly, and there ain\u0027t a telescope one can dream of that can replace people or our robots scraping the surface and looking at it under a microscope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this sense, the idea that \u0022life might be abundant\u0022 or \u0022common\u0022 or whatever, sure maybe.

This is why I say 10,000 to 100,000 years. In that time frame, I reckon we\u0027ll have operations going all over the Sol system, and possibly in several adjoining systems as well, and by then billions of tons of rock and ice and gas will have been processed, looked at, and/or analyzed and thus, IF there are any stray microbes living anywhere besides Earth that time frame seems about long enough for our species to extend its \u0022touch\u0022 to a significant enough section of our galactic neighborhood that we must might stumble on it. If microbial life turns out to be fairly common, then it might come much earlier. But that seems unlikely at this stage: still no signs of anything on Mars as far as I know and certainly nothing from any of the other bodies we have some scrappings from so far.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then we have \u0022life\u0022 in the sense of what most people think of: at least multi-cellular, if not photosynthetic = produces oxygen and progressively reshapes the right type of planets so that they can eventually host the sorts of life we think of as characterizing Earth (though in truth the bacteria are the real \u0022rulers\u0022 of the planet, still to this day . . . ). Bodies that have experienced these types of processes might well stick out like a sore thumb, just detecting oxygen in an exoplanets atmophere would be pretty telling as far as I understand it. But so we find a planet that is \u0022roughly\u0022 Earth like in every other respect (inferred gravity, goldilocks zone, etc.) AND we discover it has an appreciable Oxygen content in its atmosphere, then what? Given the closest possible one is what? 50 light years away? Its not like it is going to make a damn bit of difference to humanity, though it is of course fascinating and I encourage them in their studies all the way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut again, we come back to my 10,000 to 100,000 number . . . by then, MAYBE we will have the propulsion technology to make a journey of 50 light years tenable in something less than the time it has taken humanity to go from Homo erectus to modern humans?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI played around with some numbers several years ago, and (just from memory) best I could figure, closest star system to ours, Alpha Centauri, which is what 2.6 light years? no, 4.37 light years . . . at the best speeds we can currently achieve (leaving aside things that are theoretically possible but have yet to be proven like Orion nuclear pulse stuff . . .) that is like a 45,000 year journey!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t get me wrong, I find the whole exoplanet revolution to be absolutely stunning and wondrous.

Anyway, things need their time to develop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cloud out of which the solar system formed contained a lot of metals (anything else than H and He), since these are bread in stars and supernovae other stars must have formed before, exploded in supernovae, formed a protoplanetary disc, out of which solar systems evolved and so on. If these stars were larger than the sun than these processes were much faster.

Probably evaporated several times because of impacts / volcanism and rained out again. I see the first microbes a little older (not much) than you describe, formed before 4 billion years. The rest is browsing through the archives :-)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut as you say, in order to tell whether microbes formed on other bodies in the solar system it would not suffice to turn a stone and there they are. We\u0027d have to understand how the dynamics of these bodies work to be able to find the places were the beasties might have been / are. Imagine somebody 4.1 billion years ago, landing on earth in a quiet moment, looking for life. Would he(kirk)/she(janeway) have the idea to go to the bottom of the ocean and look around volcanic vents ?

Not to mention the fact that, after 30 years, there may well have been some \u0022revolutions\u0022 in thinking in the Earth sciences . . . surprisingly there seems to have been a major discovery that Earth\u0027s past climates were always pure, chaste and pleasing until nasty industrialists starting belching forth carbon in the past few years, which really throws a monkey-wrench into the fundamental points of my whole training, i.e., that Earth\u0027s climate has more or less ALWAYS fluctuated, and more erratically at some times (particularly the last 2.5 million years . . . but I digress . . .) . . . isn\u0027t it thought that the \u0022water\u0022 got brought here by bolides?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as the \u0022oldest\u0022 microbes, etc.,: again not my area of expertise, and even if it had been, a mere 3 year departure from the latest literature can lead to effectively 95% ignorance, so I satisfice myself with whatever claims manage to become \u0022consensus\u0022 on Wiki at this stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI view scientific thought sort of like a bell-curve: on the far-left, the cutting edge, are new and \u0022dangerous\u0022 ideas which are the stuff of frantic scribblings and late-night cappuccino binges by their respective stewards into human consciousness. This stuff only tends to get passing mention, if any mention at all in sources like Wiki, and oft times the wiki history will reveal an ongoing struggle of the grad students and geek-groupies who are supporters/posers/wanabes of the respective rival conceptual factions . . . If the author of one of these \u0022wild ideas\u0022 manages to get tenure and continue to gain traction/reputation/fame/patents over a few years or decades by constructing evidentiary support for the idea (meaning no one else can see how to tear down their sand castle) then it will eventually become \u0022prevailing wisdom\u0022 and merge into the center of the bell-curve and wind up as \u0022front page\u0022 news on Wiki, and at which point, we might consider it to be \u0022what science thinks.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then a few years pass, the original source of the idea is found to have made errors, or worse to have made stuff up, and the carcass of their work gets exhumed and dissected with glee. New ideas are formed, nomenclatures adjusted, terminology combobulated, 3-stage models replaced with 5-stage models, and everyone pats the \u0022revisionist\u0022 on the back for having \u0022fixed it\u0022 and at this stage, the idea that had originally been on the far left of the bell-curve, and lived comfortably in the middle for a good while, has now found \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe conveyor belt of science doesn\u0027t just shut off\u003C/a\u003E, and has slide over into the nether land of the \u0022diminishing right-leg\u0022 of the curve.
