And how moving magnets can create electrical currents? Now put them together and you have blood that is constantly giving you electric shocks throughout your body- probably inducing massive seizures and cardiac arrest as the magnetic blood disrupted your brain function and heart rhythm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust having the blood flowing around your body would be bad enough, but in areas with high flow like the aorta and vena cava (flowing out of and into the heart respectively) there could be enough of a charge difference to make the magnetic stuff clump together, potentially ripping one or both of those massive blood vessels open and resulting in catastrophic internal bleeding and rapid death. Or maybe it\u2019ll happen more in small vessels with thinner walls, so you get death by a thousand cuts but from within the body.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThrow in an external magnetic field and things would only get worse, especially if you happened to move around in said field as humans are prone to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, and on top of that, you\u2019ll get heat produced by all this magnetism too which could really mess with your homeostatic mechanisms and even cook you alive if you happened to walk into a strong enough magnetic field.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll in all, it\u2019s a no from me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
