Those manoeuvers are going to be very expensive in propellant due to the mass of the cycler. And the propellant for those manoeuvers is going to have to come on a supply ship, which in turn is going to need more propellant to carry that propellant.\u003Cp\u003ESo basically, unless the cost in propellant to adjust the cycler\u0027s orbit on each pass is lower than the cost in propellant to simply add a proper hab module to your supply ship, it\u0027s not worth it. I suspect it isn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENibb31, I don\u0027t say this to be mean or brash, but clearly you don\u0027t understand how a Cycler Ship works at all. I suggest you read the material I linked to in the OP (I\u0027ll try and add a better explanation later on what a Cycler actually is to avoid issues where people don\u0027t bother reading it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Cycler Ship (such as an Aldrin Cycler) is set on an orbit that intercepts two planets (such as Earth and Mars) regularly. \u003Cstrong\u003EVirtually no velocity-change is required to adjust the orbit at either end\u003C/strong\u003E. This is comparable to how a free-return trajectory to the Moon only requires a one-way burn, except instead of getting a free return from the Moon, you\u0027re getting a free return from Mars- and back again and again and again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is for a \u0022full-cycler\u0022. There are also \u0022semi-cycler\u0022 designs which depart from LEO or Low Mars Orbit, and enter into a trajectory that will EVENTUALLY (slowly) take them back to Earth or Mars for free. In these designs, like with the full cycler, the crew only rides the cycler one way because the return-voyage is extremely slow. The advantage of a semi-cycler is that it\u0027s MUCH easier to intercept with an \u0022interceptor\u0022 vessel as the velocity-difference is much smaller.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith either version of cycler (full or semi), there are two possible variants of the orbit- one that travels from Earth to Mars quickly (5-6 months), but takes a long time (15\u002B months) to return, and one that travels from Mars to Earth quickly (5-6 months), but takes a long time to return to Mars (15\u002B months). Thus, with any manned round-trip mission, you would normally want at least two cyclers in operation- so the crew takes the short leg of a journey each way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, with a Aldrin Cycler or other design of Cycler Ship, you only need to accelerate the Hab Module (which can include rotational/centrifugal \u0022artificial gravity\u0022), Life Support Systems (which can include heavy things like greenhouses), heavy radiation shielding, and solar panels or nuclear reactor to the cycle-trajectory ONCE. It costs less than twice as much Delta-V as sending these directly to Mars for a full-cycler, yet doesn\u0027t require any fuel for a return-voyage, and can be re-used an unlimited number of times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe components you re-use are some of the heaviest components for a Mars-Mission\u003C/strong\u003E (especially the radiation shielding), \u003Cstrong\u003Eand don\u0027t have to be accelerated quickly.\u003C/strong\u003E In fact, if you were patient enough you could literally launch the cycler ship to LEO and accelerate it to the cycle-trajectory using ion engines or however many square kilometers of solar sail over the course of several YEARS (you would only launch crew to it later, on its next cycle around). These same ion engines/ solar sails could be re-used for the minor course corrections (only a few dozen m/s or so every couple years!) necessary to maintain the cycle orbit against the solar wind and repeated Mars/Earth gravity-assists (to minimize these, the taxi/lander would detach while the Cycler Ship was still a few days out from Earth/Mars, and move onto a closer approach trajectory- whereas the Cycler Ship would just skirt the edge of the Sphere of Influence), \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith solar sails, ZERO propellant would be required for course-corrections (all course-corrections would be made by constantly trimming the solar sails during the entire voyage). With ion engines, only a VERY small amount of propellant would have to be carried to Cycler Ship on each interceptor ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, of course, if you equipped the Cycler Ship with a heavy nuclear reactor and a laser or gyrotron to beam that power as microwaves, you could use that nuclear reactor to accelerate the Cycler to its cycle trajectory in the first place via nuclear-electric propulsion, and then re-use that same reactor an unlimited number of times to accelerate interceptor ships via Microwave Thermal Rocketry (the higher TWR of thermal rocketry vs. electric propulsion would be necessary for the interceptor ships) to meet up with the Cycler Ship, and landers/crew capsules to reach the surface of Earth/Mars...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMicrowave Thermal Rocketry has around a 1/4th efficiency at these large distances (1/3rd efficiency when beaming power *through the atmosphere* to a craft ascending to LEO)- meaning if you placed a 800 MW reactor on the Cycler Ship, the tiny interceptor-ship would have around 200 MW of beamed-power available, which would allow for a MASSIVE TWR (in fact, with a reactor this powerful, and a typically tiny interceptor ship, maybe you would want to use a high-powered microwave-electric propulsion scheme just so you didn\u0027t kill your crew with g-forces... Or, you could just use a much smaller nuclear reactor and take longer to accelerate the Cycler Ship in the first place...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-10T00:51:05Z\u0022 title=\u002212/10/2014 12:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m4rt14n","CreatedById":101179,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T01:33:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy not then make multiple cyclers going both ways like trains.
