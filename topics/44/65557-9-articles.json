Hang the frame that holds the device using four parallel wires from the corners of the frame. Place the device inside the frame so the center of mass is in the center of the frame (when the machine is not on). And, as I mentioned before, you\u0027ll want to mount laser pointers on the frame that shoot their beams forward and backward so you can use those points to check that the frame is not tilting during operation. And that doesn\u0027t mean you need lots of laser pointers -- you can use one laser pointer and move it to the different locations for multiple runs (but monitoring multiple pointer spots during the same run would be best).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-24T10:01:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EM Drive, you should also introduce some form of measurement to your experiments.

This might be slightly above undergraduate level, but for a graduate student in Physics, this should be peanuts. In fact, I think I\u0027ve seen something similar on a candidacy exam one year. Anyways, let me write up some equations, and I\u0027ll post a general solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Actually, that\u0027s way simpler than I was even thinking about. So long as the surface really is frictionless, and we can ignore the mass of the arm connecting gyro to base, you don\u0027t need anything complicated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay you have gyro of mass m, carrying angular momentum L. (L ~ \u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0mr\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2/2 for a solid disk gyro, and L ~ \u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0mr\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 for a ring with spokes gyro). If the arm has length d, then the equation for rate of change of angular momentum is trivially dL/dt = mgd. Therefore, precession angular frequency is \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00A9 = mgd/L. And, of course, center of rotation, given base of mass M, is going to be located dm/(M\u002Bm) from the center of the base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn video, the gyro goes through half rotation in 10.5 frames at 15FPS. So that\u0027s 21/15 seconds per turn, or \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00A9 = mgd/L = 4.5s\u003Csup\u003E-1\u003C/sup\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s harder to judge the sizes, but if the gyro is about 5cm across, then the arm is about 20cm long. Since this is just a very rough estimate, lets go with that. I\u0027ll also take gyro to be a solid steel disk, about 1cm thick. It\u0027s probably a bit off, but again, we just want to get an idea for what\u0027s going on. At typical steel density of about 9g/cm\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B3, that gets me about 175g of gyro, which would be dead in the middle of the range you\u0027ve suggested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe can use that to get L = mgd/\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00A9 = 0.076 kg m\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2/s. And that lets us estimate \u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0 = 2L/(mr\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2) = 1,390s\u003Csup\u003E-1\u003C/sup\u003E or something like 13,300 RPM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a bit on the high side, so some of these size estimates are probably a little off. One possibility is that the gyro is actually a bit larger and has a ring shape, rather than solid cylinder, which at the same mass, would bring the above down by about a half. Still, this can definitely be ballpark.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we take the base to also be a steel disk, 1cm thick, and I\u0027d say it\u0027s about same diameter as the arm, so about 20cm, we get 2.8kg. That\u0027s actually \u003Cem\u003Etoo heavy\u003C/em\u003E. It might also be an aluminum alloy. Duralumin has density of 2.8g/cm\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B3, which would put the mass of the disk at 880g. If that is the case, center of rotation is going to be 3.3cm from the center of the base. That\u0027s definitely about consistent with the video.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there is absolutely no reason to say that something weird is going on.
