What reasons are there to not use asparagus staging in real life, or is it even technically feasible?

Then again, it took over 65 years for propellant crossfeed to make it into a heavy lift vehicle (first envisioned in 1947, and the Falcon Heavy is the first to really use it that way), so saying that it\u0027s not used currently in real life isn\u0027t a sure bet that it will never be used in real life, though there are issues and less benefits to it, as discussed in the other threads.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jokurr","CreatedById":57496,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-27T18:53:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile not asparagus style staging as we know it in KSP, the N1 rocket had 30 rocket engines in its first stage, and it was a tremendous difficulty to get all 30 engines working together properly. From a reliability standpoint, it is much better to reduce the number of moving parts on any type of rocket design, which the N1 failed to do when compared to the Saturn V. Any slight variations in fuel fed to each of the engines can be catastrophic. Having such a complex system to feed all 30 engines of the N1 was part of the reason why it was ultimately a failure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
