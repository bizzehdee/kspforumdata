Or we could make it rotate (very hard i guess) so it stays in its position (just an idea again).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I am writing this, it came to my mind that it would be probably easier to build a ring the size of minmus (or maybe gilly i guess its even smaller) in kerbin orbit and then fly it over to minmus with its COM directly pointed at minmus COM and as soon as minmus is moving \u0022through\u0022 the ring we decallerate to have their COMs aligned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think of it, i mean i dont think it would be easy to build it, and I\u0027m not sure if i would even try to.

You are probably also going to be limited in inclinations you can use if you are building it near a planet.
