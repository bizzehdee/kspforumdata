When something goes wrong, the most important thing is to find a scapegoat, who may or may not be guilty. Then we can have our revenge on the scapegoat, regardless of whether it helps to avoid similar problems in the future or not. After all, nobody really cares if the problems recur or not, as long as we can satisfy our bloodlust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dkmdlb","CreatedById":70275,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T18:59:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m confused by your comment because it doesn\u0027t seem to at all reflect what is happening in this case.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T19:36:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dkmdlb\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dkmdlb\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m confused by your comment because it doesn\u0027t seem to at all reflect what is happening in this case.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI assume that you replied to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn air crash investigations (which are quite similar to this case), the investigators are usually interested in finding the cause of the accident and preventing future accidents.

We all make mistakes. It\u0027s impossible to do things consistently by the book. We\u0027re humans, not machines. When the investigation is about assigning blame, everyone\u0027s primary incentive is to cover their backs. People avoid telling telling the whole truth, and they often choose to lie. Evidence gets destroyed. Instead of actively trying to solve the problem, people just wait passively until the inconvenient investigation ends.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn every kind of investigation, you ultimately have to choose whether it\u0027s more important to punish the guilty or to avoid future incidents.
