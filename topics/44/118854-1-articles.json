The precise answer is that the Time to the big-bang is not the same for everything but it would be pretty close if inflation had a relatively constant effect. I contend that this is not the case, the to a degree inflation had a larger impact on thing furter from the original center of expansion, in either case the direction of in versus outbound is unknown. This because relative to everything elses everythings speed to everythig else is a function of distance, however there is a shift between close stuff and stuff 5 billion ly from us. There are apparently really big galaxies beyond 5 billion light years and I speculate these might point in the direction of the center. If we could travel several hundred times the speed of light we might find much older universe in their time frame when we stopped. The problem is that things that are 7 billion ly light travel, they a 10s of lightyears away now and traveling away form us close to the speed of light. There is a theoretically estimated size of the universe of 92 billion years, this is based on how big the quantum singularity of infinity density and energy might have been. Its based on several fundemental constants and makes alot of assumptions. It could be way wrong, and we may be in a non-interesting part of the universe where inflation was all but constant. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen of course, hypotheticalities fall apart with relativity, since you cannot travel faster than the speed of lihgt, there is no absolute or universal time, and the real dimension of time is space-time and space appears to be expanding relative to other space way faster than the speed of light. So then no-ones going to waste alot of bandwidth studying something so elusive, but rather come up with practical solutions, like a inertial wrist watch that automatically reports your age and the reference frame time of the beings where you are currently passing by.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T19:36:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aethon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Aethon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf I lived on a neutron star, or (even stranger) if I were closely orbiting a black hole at some incredible velocity, would I (rightfully) declare the universe to be a mere 4 billion years old and see it as it was 9.8 billion years ago, from Earth\u0027s perspective\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne way to measure the age of the Universe is by measuring the distance of distant stars (standard candles, for example).

Theoretically, beyond this, we would find a layer of neutrinos, which would theoretically have moved faster at the beginning, due to being able to \u0022slip\u0022 through any other matter with little to no friction. But is it even possible to observe a neutrino in the depths of space? If so, that could theoretically be used (somehow) to get a truly accurate age of the universe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would (theoretically) be similar to when a star goes supernova: the neutrinos and light are released at the same time, though the former are able to move through the star at constant speed due to their nearly non-existant mass. Light waves (or particles, or whatever they really are) get bounced around by the other matter, effectively slowing them down, and causing them to not appear until after the neutrinos have already jumped ship. Once the light is outside the influence of the star, however, it\u0027s free to move at the speed of light towards wherever it may be headed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so, the nuetrino field is basically a shell around the universe, essentially marking the outer limits. The light sphere is basically the \u0022mantle\u0022 of the universe, in that is sits between the observable universe (all the stars, planets, etc we can see) . Unlike the matter sphere, the light sphere is (in a weird sense of the word) solid, in that there is a constant stream of new light being issued. Regular matter just clumps together and forms planets and stars and such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI propose that it would be impossible to observe the Big Bang, unless we are at the very edge of the universe (which I theorize is impossible to reach, being unable to pass the speed of light and all). Inside the universe, the light from that time would have already passed us, and continued racing outwards. No matter how far we look, we could never truly see the beginning: only the ghost of it\u0027s existance, only the light that had been generated long enough ago that it only just now had time to reach us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless, somehow, we could travel beyond the current limits of the universe, which would involve wormholes or FTL travel.

My question is : Does the mass of the Earth have an appreciable, cumulative effect on how old we view the universe to be? Is the age of the universe 13.8 B years, but only from Earth\u0027s perspective? If I lived on a neutron star, or (even stranger) if I were closely orbiting a black hole at some incredible velocity, would I (rightfully) declare the universe to be a mere 4 billion years old and see it as it was 9.8 billion years ago, from Earth\u0027s perspective? Or If I had been sequestered from most of the mass in the universe since shortly after the big bang, would I (rightly) believe the universe was say, 16 billion years old?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I didn\u0027t stop at Tau Ceti, my watch is never going to sync up with my twins watch. It\u0027s only going going to get further out of sync as I continue accelerating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"}]}
