The problem with that is that CO2 hangs around in the atmosphere for a long time, so any sort of decrease is really delayed.

And the 3 billion people who live in abject poverty are not going to accept staying at that level just so we can keep living our way.\u003Cp\u003ESwitching to renewables is tremendously expensive. First, you have to consider electricity is roughly 1/3 of the energy in a developed country, electricity being quite expensive for things like heating and several industrial processes (smelting iron from ore for example). Then you have to take into account that renewables are expensive, not just the PV panels themselves, but the massive restructuring of the distribution network, the need for storage and for backup power plants. Because renewables are not reliable, you have to move electricity from place to place, the pattern changing regularly, and you need gas and coal plants everywhere for those days where there is not wind nor sun anywhere, so basically a complete production capability that is not used a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at Germany, they went from 6% in 2000 to 25% renewable today.

And that means not killing off half the population, or instituting harsh economic controls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and there\u0027s not going to be any apocalyptic global warming scenario. We\u0027re more likely to create apocalyptic scenarios by trying to prevent it (murdering half the population? Seriously?? Even draconian economic and CO2 controls would create apocalyptic economic conditions... you think 2007-2008 was bad? Or 1931? You ain\u0027t seen nothing yet, if you try some of the ideas suggested in this thread).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, the models that predict apocalyptic warming are flat wrong. From 1998-2014 (16 years), there\u0027s been absolutely no trend in global temperatures, up or down. Our best models say, however, temps should be continuing to increase. They\u0027re not. Temps are now well below the confidence intervals of the models, i.e. the models are wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis doesn\u0027t necessarily mean global warming won\u0027t, or isn\u0027t happening. It does mean the rate and scale of the warming is almost certainly overrated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe science is simple: Doubling of CO2 from pre-industrial levels yields a \u002B0.6C forcing. The models depend on positive feedbacks to amplify that forcing into catastrophic temps. The reality is, the actual temp gain observed is less than the forcing from CO2, which strongly indicates the feedbacks are negative (really, most natural systems have negative feedbacks, or they wouldn\u0027t exist for long). Ergo.... stop freaking yourselves out, grab a beer, enjoy life, and stop worrying about global warming. If you want something to worry about, there\u0027s plenty of threats out there that will kill us long before CO2 induced warming will.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-19T01:34:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe thing with global warming is that it\u0027s a long-term process. There were big climate changes in the last few years, this year\u0027s winter was an example. While global warming panic is more devastating than the warming, we should probably move away from hydrocarbon fuels. Nuclear, and later fusion, are the only power sources that could keep up with increasing energy demands. As such, it makes sense to invest in them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027ve got a great idea that would both reduce population and global warming. Execute all anti-nuclear activists, take all their money, sell their stuff and build nuclear power plants for it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Really, that\u0027s all it\u0027d take. If people weren\u0027t so afraid of atomic power, we\u0027d have decommissioned all hydrocarbon-based plants and replaced them with nuclear ones a long time ago.

Humanity first, then we can think about the rest. When you put it that way, going nuclear is the best way to go. There are literally no drawbacks to this idea, spent nuclear fuel can easily be disposed of, contrary to what people say, or it could be recycled. Since it\u0027s pretty radioactive, you could also get some mileage out of it by gathering it in a pile and using it to heat something.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-19T01:39:13Z\u0022 title=\u002204/19/2014 01:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Guest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hector","CreatedById":89207,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-19T01:44:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIndeed.
