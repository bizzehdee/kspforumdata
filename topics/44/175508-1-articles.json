And small tribes and such may place it in high regard. And, for example, the Himalayas hold a lot of cultural value to people believing in four major religions in the area (Hindu, Buddhist, Islamic, and Animist), so defacing, and mining them is something we can\u0027t do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if we colonize Mars, and decide we like its mountains, and some people start placing cultural significance to it?
