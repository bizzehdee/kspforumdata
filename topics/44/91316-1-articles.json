If you can easily fix it and it\u0027s failure won\u0027t certainly kill you, that requirement is removed. Of course, you will always have parts whose failure will kill you. The solution is simple: continue to engineer those parts not to fail.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SciMan","CreatedById":12748,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T12:07:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETBH I think the best use of a 3D printer on a space station is to allow them to print out mounting brackets for holding non-critical things in places that other non-critical things were designed to go.
