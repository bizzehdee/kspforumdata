A magnet close enoguht to the Earth can be pulled around like the magnet on a compass, to orient and stabilize the vehicle. This provides no thrust, of course, but it is vaugley on the same lines."},{"CreatedByName":"architeuthis","CreatedById":57137,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T22:24:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E No. To propell, they would need to repel something.\n\nYou can use the magnetic field to repel charged particles from the sun (or if you have a really powerful static particle accelerator you can point that at the magnetic field to accelerate the spacecraft). I believe this concept is called a magsail, and is the basis of a delightful hard-SF novel, \u0027Permanence\u0027, by Karl Schroeder.

Obviously you need something to push against. \n\nWhat if you threw out some sort of pusher plate and repelled against that? Hmm... The force would drop off quite quickly, wouldn\u0027t justify the mass.\n\nOkay, maybe you don\u0027t just use one pusher plate, you can keep dropping them after you when the force from the previous one has diminished. This is looking a little better.\n\nNow how about we miniaturise the pusher plates as much as we can, until they\u0027re basically just charged partic... Oh wait, I\u0027ve just spent the last ten minutes reinventing an ion drive with a magnetic nozzle. \\*facepalm\\*"},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T01:18:02Z","Content":"What you\u0027re thinking of is called a Magnetic Sail, or an Electrodynamic Tether."},{"CreatedByName":"shynung","CreatedById":101096,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T10:51:13Z","Content":"This is an [electrodynamic tether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrodynamic_tether).\n\n![658px-Satellite_tether_system.svg.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Satellite_tether_system.svg/658px-Satellite_tether_system.svg.png)\n\nIt pushes off a planetary/stellar magnetic field, and consumes only electricity."}]}
