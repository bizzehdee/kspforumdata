I was thinking if they could develop some method of obtaining and refining the required chemicals for a rocket it would make having a Mars base capable of return much easier, assuming reusable spacecraft. It would probably be a lot easier to make an SSTO ascent/decent crew ship on Mars due to the gravity, so fuel would be all you\u0027d need to go back and forth as often as you like and also to resupply an orbiting craft for returning to Earth orbit when needed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZedNova","CreatedById":57175,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T15:22:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI heard that they were going to use some sort of witchcraft to make methane on mars to use as fuel.

Just pump in CO2, pump out oxygen, and use organic material algae generate to make ethanol. No complicated chemical processing required. No energy other than solar required. The downside is that this would have to be built over significant area, and keeping it pressurized might be tricky. (Pressure needs high enough for water not to boil at room temperature.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sof","CreatedById":65663,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T23:03:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was under the impression that there were places on Mars where methane was being produced from unknown sources. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI heard they were detecting it in the atmosphere when it should decompose rather quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T23:25:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s being produced in quantities best measured in parts per billion, even close to the sources.
