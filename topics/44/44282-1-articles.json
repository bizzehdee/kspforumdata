Its \u003Cstrong\u003E$30-billion development\u003C/strong\u003E cost would then need to be divided among the few actual launches, not over all the years of the 28-year period, and would be about $4.3 billion per launch. This share of the launch cost represents money that could have been spend on payloads in years past. The per-launch cost of the rocket now jumps from $5 billion \u003Cstrong\u003Eup to about $9 billion.\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.thespacereview.com/archive/2330a.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222330a.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E So the full-sized payload version of the SLS is slightly cheaper that the shuttle at one launch per year, due to the roughly five-fold increase in actual payload compared to the shuttle when it was used as a payload delivery system. This means that the SLS launched once a year will be six times as expensive as a Falcon 9 expendable launch and 15 times as expensive as a Falcon Heavy expendable launch.\u003Cp\u003EThe upshot is that the situation described by my previous assessment (and those of many others) remains accurate and in some respects is worse:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. \u003Cstrong\u003ENo hardware to be launched by the SLS other than the crew capsule can be developed until the SLS is developed.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.
