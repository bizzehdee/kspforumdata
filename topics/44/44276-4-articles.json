Now, if nothing were to exist what could we prove? The only thing that can both exist and be non existent that we really know about is zero. It can be taken from zero to mean nothing, and any statement through and by this premise must therefore be correct. But this defines everything as nothing (bar the contradiction there, as it\u0027s a concept not clearly defined in any language) and so nothing OF NOTHING must therefore be a valid statement drawn from the premise. But here it gets interesting, for nothing OF nothing implies the existence of SOMETHING. In other words: if nothing is possible, then nothing being possible is impossible and so something is possible.

We don\u0027t need to understand why universe happened. There is no \u0022happening\u0022 in the grand scheme of things. Universe just exists as a 4-dimensional object. And from our perspective of time it always existed and always will exist, because there is no time outside of the universe. Nor is there an outside. And some people ask what was before the Big Bang, and by all symmetries, I\u0027d have to say, most likely, the other side of the Big Bang. (Picture our expanding universe as a bunch of shells, each shell corresponding to a moment of time, together making up the hyper-sphere of the universe. If you go back in time, towards the center, as you pass the center, you just end up going forward again on the other side. Now, topology doesn\u0027t have to be spherical, but the point remains.

The universe exists- at least this is what I feel- for one of a couple of reasons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first is simply because it is. The universe exists because it always had. With the Big Bang, galaxies were created. Relationships between dark matter, gravity, dark energy, and other things cause collections of dust and gas to coalesce, form nebulas, stars, individual galaxie. And these are constantly moving out, spreading across the universe due to those forces. Until one day, they are spread to far. Either galaxies no longer hold together, or the hypothesized collapse of the universe occurs, and everything begins to \u0022fall back\u0022 into the singularity it was before. And then, once more, expansion. The Big Bang, not for the second time, but for the hundredth, thousandth time. The repetition of an event which knows no end. Because it is all eternal, the same and different each time. The reason for its existence is one science can never accept: it exists because it is, or it exists to allow humanity to learn. Because that\u0027s our purpose, isn\u0027t it? To learn and gain knowledge, so we may pass it on to future generations to build and expand upon?
