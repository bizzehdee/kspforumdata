I thought they were more in the market to replace old, old Citations, Lear Jets and turbocharged piston and turbo prop designs.

Though we are only talking about a certified M0.93, the testing regime has to involve going up to Mach 1, so they have to do increase their know how. They already talked about plans for a quiet supersonic jet last year, though I\u0027m not sure what came of it. They have the money and are the only big manufacturer specialised on large business jets, so they have an incentive to stand out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut to be honest, most of the business jet market seems to be about the interiors, and the companies are notoriously shy of developing completely new airframes. Bombardier essentially milked all their jet aircraft out the original Challenger fuselage. Same with Gulfstream. I would hope for an outsider to shake up the market, but the clients are mostly very conservative, too. A lot of the volume is not personal jets but charter and company flight departments (and fractional ownership for smaller types), I think.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-18T04:27:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magnemoe\u0022 data-cite=\u0022magnemoe\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMain issue with supersonic passenger flights is the cost. \u003Cp\u003EToo few are willing to pay 5000$ to save four hours from Paris to New York.
