They are both 800).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlmaz\u0027s docking port clearance was a bit wider, to let the 850 mm film capsule pass through, but it has absolutely different design, not in use now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen Apollo-Soyuz required a universal docking adaptor, they created APAS-75 as a Soyuz 800 m wide docking port with external ring with petals tilted outwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen Buran required a docking port to dock with Mir and to receive a rescue ship Zarya, they took the APAS-75 and inverted it, swapping the HCS (hard-capture sys.) and SCS (soft-capture sys.) rings.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, no the ring with petal appeared to be inside the pressurized volume, and the petals were tilted inwards, and called it APAS-89.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would make the passage narrower, but they made the hull and the HCS ring wider, so the clearance between the petals stayed same 800 mm.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe soft-capture ring with petals was thin (like in IDSS Rev.E), the petals were fixed.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHypothetically they presumed future ability to totally unmount the soft-capture system from inside the docking tunnel, getting a fully clean tunnel 1250 mm wide.\u00A0\u00A0But not to be then-currently implemented.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen Shuttle began wanting to fly to Mir, they updated APAS-89 to APAS-95, bringing minor changes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen Shuttle began wanting to build ISS and fly to it, they took APAS-95 as a de-facto standard for both.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI.e. pressurized 1250 mm wide tunnel, with an extendable\u00A0soft-capture mechanism inside, with thin wide ring with three fixed petals with 800\u00A0\u00A0mm clearance between the petal tips, with mechanical contact strikers (thin pins on this thin ring).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAPAS-95 became a de-facto standard prototype of what de-jure IDSS standard is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen they began wanting to implement a standard wide\u00A0berthing port to perth station modules and trusses, and wide-mouthed cargo ships.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, they made CBM (Common Berthing Mechanism) which holds together the ISS non-Russian modules\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nand receives the non-Russian cargo ships (except ATV), such as. HTV, Cygnus, Cargo Dragon.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n(ATV were equipped with Russian docking adaptors and not refer to IDSS or CBM).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe CBM consists of two parts: active and passive.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll mechanics is contained in the active part which is installed on the station side (like in Gemini project, unlike in Soyuz/Apollo ones).\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe passive part of CBM is a simple cheap ring with latch holes to receive the latch from the active parts. (Like in Gemini, partially like in Almaz).\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo when a an expendable cargo burns, just an aluminium rings burns. When (Cargo Dragon lands, they can use it as hoola-hoop).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs originally they planned to move cargo boxes through both IDSS and CBM, the CBM presumes a squared opening of 1270 mm\u00A0wide behind.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis matches the IDSS theoretical possibility to unmount the soft-capture and turn IDSS in an empty wide tunnel. Then any cargo of 1250 mm can pass through coaxial IDSS and CBM ports.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince Shuttles the ISS was equipped with Canadarm with zero-impact end effector which strangles a grappling fixture stick under chin with three wires, so the\u00A0mechanical contact doesn\u0027t push a drifting object away.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis allows to effectively catch a cargo ship\u00A0drifting\u00A0around with manipulator and not equip it with a real docking node like IDSS, just with this passive CBM ring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheoretically, CBM cargo ships should have 1250 mm wide square doors. Actually, the square is much smaller, closer to the old 800 mm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, Shuttle made things worse.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile Buran was equipped with extendable docking port, Shuttle had it fixed, deep inside the cargo bay (because no other Shuttle would dock to Shuttle).\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso the cargo bay should stay clear from anything above.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo they made those ugly curved PMA adaptors, to let the Shuttle dock to ISS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ugky PMA adaptor of course doesn\u0027t have a straight passage from IDSS to CBM on its ends, and even a 800 mm wide passage is a problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis made the implemented CBM/IDSS passage compatibility almost fictious.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nNo cargo ships are/will-ever-be\u00A0equipped with IDSS.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNo available IDSS \u0026amp; CBM couples have a straight passage way.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNo need in large cargo delivery with IDSS-compatible\u00A0passenger ships since all large cargos are berthed to the CBM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, all coming spaceships are capsules with\u00A0docking adaptors, typically IDSS-compatible.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe IDSS adaptor is more expensive, so it should be reusable. So, it should be placed on top of the capsule.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the top of the capsule is narrow, twice as narrow as the bottom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd it should also contain chutes, antennas, sensors, etc. The room is expensive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, they wanted a narrower docking adaptor to save as much room on top as possible.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis could be achieved by decreasing the permanent docking passage way clearance from 800 mm to 684 mm. Enough for rescue suits and postal bags.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis became the early IDSS\u00A0standard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the same time they wanted to keep the existing 800 mm clearance as an option.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, the early IDSS standard made the petals removabl/foldable to quickly make the passage 800 mm wide if needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso they wanted a softer dokcing contact system.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAPAS-95 uses mechanical strikers. They wanted magnetic strikers to get in sensoric contact before the mechanical one, to adjust the petal rings before actual touching, and make the contact softer.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe magnetic strikers appeared to be rather big. (Twice three circles every 60\u00B0 on the scheme).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe removable/foldable petals and the big magnetic strikers made to make the soft capture ring twice thicker.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, the external, hard-capture ring stayed same, with 1250 full clearance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso they probably wanted to keep it compatible with APAS-95, and were pleasantly forced by the thicker inner ring to do this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally they called this iLIDS\u00A0\u00A0(low-impact docking system, because the magnets do not impact, and the rings would match each other\u0027s position before contact).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a result, the total width of the docking adaptor stayed same, nothing was gained for the capsule top free room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a result, the whole iLIDS / IDSS Rev B efforts resulted into a\u00A0docking adaptor standard incompatible with previous APAS-95, but same wide, with more complicated petals system, just with magnetic strikers never really tested, unlike more archaic but tested many times by Shuttles mechanical strikers of APAS-95.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis looked strange, \u0022they\u0022 became unhappy with that and ordered Boeing a research on \u0022how should we optimise the IDSS thing?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reseatch was made under conditions of \u0022no proprietary things or processes should be used, everything should be available for everybody being downloaded from internet known\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoeing named this study SIMAC.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nSIMAC is not an actual hardware for sale, it\u0027s a study resulted into a hardware prototype.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a result, they stated that:\u003Cbr\u003E\nMagnetic strikers are big and not tested, (un)screw them.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMechanized petals are complicated and not tested, (un)screw them.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe hull width stayed same, so no need to decrease the passage way, ... guess what?... yes, screw this, too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, almost all significant improvements have been (un)screwed, the final SIMAC thing was smiling and mocking \u0022I\u0027m APAS-95!

Let\u0027s just use upgraded APAS-95.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a result, the IDSS Rev C was adopted, with current thin ring, fixed petals, permanent 800 mm wide passage way, and hypothetically presumed but who-needs-it-now future possibility of making it 1250 wide by unmounting the soft-capture.\u00A0All major improvements have been hearthlessly flushed.\u003Cbr\u003E\nCurrently it evolved into IDSS Rev E without significant changes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs unlikely anybody will ever care of this unmountable soft-capture mechanism, the current ring is solid, with fixed petals, thin pins of mechanical strikers, and the 1250 mm compatibility with CBM means actually nothing anymore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, this makes the CBM dimensions being caused by obsolete reasons, but who cares.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, the modified APAS-95 was put on the IDA adaptors which are installed used\u00A0\u00A0on both ugly curved PMA of ISS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother funny/sad thing is about the androgyny of these androgynous docking ports.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAccording to the IDSS standard, an IDSS port should have a centerline docking target inside the docking tunnel for visual and finally automatic docking, and four reflective targets around the hull.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, there\u0027s no room for the latter on the capsule top, so at least Crew Dragon, but probably CST-100 and Orion as well, do not have these targets.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, first of all this makes unlikely possible an automatic ship-to-ship approaching and docking. Only manual and mostly visual.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut no problem, real spacemen like the manual dockings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheoretically, the IDSS adaptors are androgynous, and any adaptor\u00A0should dock to another adaptor,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPractically, there is no need to have an extendable soft-capture ring on the station side, as the station never docks to something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, the originally active-passive androgynous adaptor receives a purely passive version without telescopiv trusses and\u00A0extendable ring.

It can hold up to 350 tonnes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut actually large things are attached by CBM ports, and the IDSS payloads are not greater than 30 tonnes.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, old adaptors of Mir or Almaz or Apollo look still enough strong for this purpose. Nobody actually docks now even a 100-t Shuttle with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, the real IDSS-based\u00A0\u0022androgynous\u0022 docking ports now and in future are not more androgynous than the old probe-drogue adaptors of Soyuz and Apollo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of them are \u0022active\u0022 and \u0022passive\u0022, no bimodal really are or probably ever be, until tens km/s delta-V propulsion systems making free orbital maneuvers possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, now it looks like the IDSS and the androgynous ports became useless once the Shuttles disappeared.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, the 1970s-1980s adaptors in addition to CBM should be used instead, to receive all kinds of spaceships except the CBM-berthable ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso they are narrower, and that was required by the capsule developers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo , the only reason why they keep using IDSS pseudo-androgynous adaptors is \u0022it\u0027s already in production and it\u0027s hard to change.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpd.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat \u0022IBDM\u0022 design (International Berthing-Docking Mechanism), which can be found in several places of the internet, is an old an totally obsolete European study of pre-IDSS Rev.C epoch, that\u0027s why it uses a thick soft-capture ring wth 684 mm clearance.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt has been totally replaced with IDA, it was an early study of IDA.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-02-18T12:46:14Z\u0022 title=\u002202/18/2021 12:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 18, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by kerbiloid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
