Basically, put up a platform and structure at high altitude and hold it up with balloons, then tether that thing. Depending on how high you\u0027re able to get it, you could get into orbit relatively easily. You could launch small rocket-borne payloads up to one to two hundred kilograms in small reusable rockets. With this, the transit time could be pretty low and require somewhat less fuel. The only downside I can think of is that the payload limitation being so small would require everything to be built in orbit of much smaller parts. However, this could be offset somewhat by having vehicles that never need to reenter... like a shuttle that just hangs out up there. If you need to get back, use the reentry pods that were launched unmanned from the floating launchpad in the sky. If you need to get up there, just ride up the elevator, hope on a small rocket and rv with the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peadar1987","CreatedById":81207,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T07:51:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMost of the delta-V expenditure for getting into orbit isn\u0027t getting up high, it\u0027s getting up to speed. The reason a space elevator works isn\u0027t primarily because the tip is high up per se, it\u0027s because it\u0027s a very long arm that magnifies the speed of rotation of the earth. You\u0027d save a bit of delta-V launching from a balloon, for sure, but not a huge amount.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T12:45:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ve got mountains higher than 8 km, so we could launch from their tops. Thing is - expenses (money\u002Benergy) to haul the stuff up there is much higher than just stick boosters for getting out of troposphere.
