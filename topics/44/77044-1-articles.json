Lasers hit at the speed of light, so you might think even 300 000 kilometers (a.k.a. one light second) is not too much. But even coherent beams disperse - the farther out, the \u0022dot\u0022 is bigger - delivering less energy per square centimeter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC)...No idea.

There are a lot of reasons for that. Besides these Scotius mentions, it\u0027s very hard to reflect hard X-Ray or higher frequency. And it will punch through the armor, depositing energy, potentially, meters into the ship. These are all nice qualities for weapon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, these are also the reasons why it\u0027s very difficult to build an X-Ray or gamma laser. For a good X-Ray beam, you need a particle accelerator. For gamma, at least a nuke and a very large superstructure for focusing the beam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E Take diameter of your emitter squared, and divide it by the wavelength. That will give you maximum range at which you can deliver almost 100% of the power. Past that, the beam will suffer roughly the inverse square law. So, for example, if you take an emitter 10cm across and 100keV X-Ray beam, the effective range will be 10\u003Csup\u003E10\u003C/sup\u003E meters, or about 30 times distance from Earth to the Moon. Which is huge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, that\u0027s a theoretical limit. If you don\u0027t manage to get the beam perfectly collimated, you\u0027ll suffer range penalties. But in either case, your main problem will be with aiming, not making the beam have sufficient range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC) Given time and sufficient power input, anything. The rate at which it will burn through armor will depend on material composition, what means of cooling are available to the target, and energy density of your beam. It\u0027s hard to estimate all of these without knowing specifics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Idobox","CreatedById":80299,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-09T11:09:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EX-ray or Gamma are good for anti-personnel, but for sheer destructive power, you want longer wavelengths and pulsed laser.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs said, with X-ray, you penetrate deeper in the material, which means you heat things more evenly, and a ship will have significant heat radiation, and will take a massive amount of energy to destroy that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith longer wavelengths, ie UV, all the energy is deposited in a shallow layer of material, and with pulsed operation, the heat doesn\u0027t even have the time to be conducted.
