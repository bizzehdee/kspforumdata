I was hiking and saw an orange light, and thought it was a plane at first. Then, I realized that it was going much too fast to be a plane, and after it started making a long orange flame, I realized that it was a rocket launch and started freaking out. I watched as it got higher and higher, and saw a bright flash and a piece fall off when it presumably staged. I kept watching as it got high enough for the exhaust to be lit by the sun, when it made a massive white plume that took up the entire sky. It then made a shockwave as the second stage possibly separated and the third stage ignited and continued on, still making the plume. I took a (bad) picture of it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/txtnuIbh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022txtnuIbh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d never even anticipated seeing anything like this at all, ever.
