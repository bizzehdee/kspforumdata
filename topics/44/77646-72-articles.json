Provided that we take care that there isn\u0027t any loose bits floating around where the gears are, this should be perfectly fine. We COULD have redundancy in that the cameras also spin to face new moss. But the basic issue is that we either provide every bit of moss with its own camera, or we have a moving system where the moss/camera(s) have to rotate to provide a new view. with the ring system, you have a main ring (think of the Halo, but tiny and not lethal) with the plant capsules facing in. The outside has a gear tooth pattern on it. To keep it in place you have three gears in an equilateral triangle pattern around it. These gears would have little flanges on top and bottom so that the ring cannot slide up or down (more than say a millimeter or so, just for the sake of giving it some wiggle room). Two of these are just idlers that rotate freely, one is connected to a servo.

In the end we decided that we could probably get it set up, but if it was nudged even slightly in its fixed frame, all the images would be off. Unless we want to have a servo or two to adjust its position...in which case we might as well go with something easier. Keep in mind, we\u0027d have to get some fairly small (and probably specialized) optics in order to fit more than like 4 moss capsules into an image, and even then we\u0027d probably have to up the image resolution so that each quarter/image was useful. Which ends up meaning that most of the vastly increased amount data we end up sending back is wasted because of the blank (or distorted) space. Whereas if we can take multiple low-res images that are almost entirely devoted to the plant in question, we can pick up the macro features that we need to determine things. It would be nice if we could occasionally take a semi-high res image because apparently with low range microscopes its actually fairly easy to make out the internal structure of the moss.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of Luis!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI sent him an email on Friday telling him about our progress and asking him a few questions. Namely, if it would cause a problem for us to occasionally flash visible light so we don\u0027t have to go with IR, what wavelengths might be best for this if necessary, and how often we need to take an image. Chances are he is going to say that less images over a longer period of time are fine mostly because the moss in question tends to work a little like building a lego plant. You put a few pieces on every few hours, and for the most part the old pieces never change. So if we miss 2 mm of growth happening in between shots, we can still see what happened.

For one, we will be pushing off of the rest of the vehicle, using it as reaction mass. We will thus need to hold it back from spinning by some other means. Additionally, the equilateral triangle design and the servo will, unless we get some way to disconnect, have a continual friction, imparting force to the main body, and slowing itself down. That will mean that much of the time we will need to have the servo running, just to prevent the centrifuge from stopping its motion. That will risk problems of heat dispersion, as we don not want baked moss and computers. So we need an exceptional servo, that can run for the duration of the primary mission with few if any pauses, and that puts out extremely little heat. Plus we will need to have an outer body control system that can deal with that force at all times, lest the satellite spin out of control, loosing radio contact and sunlight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETaking a photograph from a non-rotating camera of such a fast rotating target also seems to be of concern. If we are rotating at 100RPM, and taking a 1/300second exposure, the target will have spun 2 degrees before the shutter closes. That is pretty unacceptable, I think.
