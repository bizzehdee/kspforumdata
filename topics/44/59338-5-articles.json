These devices will then use chemicals to synthesize human DNA (stored in memory banks) then inject it into some cells that were in cryogenic storage, to grow humans the ship would raise, and train in survival and life skills, as well as human history and culture. The probe would be massive, perhaps 30 feet in radius and 100 feet long, to store all this complex equipment and resources, as well as machines the soon-to-be colonists will use. It would also have automated child-raising equipment and videos, as well as a massive database of humanity\u0027s knowledge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurely these probes would be cheaper than sending what, billions of tons into space? These ships I am suggesting would be mass-produced, taking a variety of human DNA samples, to be stored in electronic form. It is also possible that, instead of synthesizing the DNA, that single-celled human zygotes be produced and cryogenically frozen. For those of you who don\u0027t know, cryogenic freezing is a process that involves replacing your blood with cryogenic fluids, then freezing you, the cryogenic fluids not containing water, as to prevent your cells from bursting when frozen. This process has not been tested on humans, but a dog was successfully frozen, then brought back to life, undamaged, some time ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, hundreds or perhaps thousands of these probes would be sent out to various planets, each containing information stating where the others are headed, and what fate befell their home planet.
