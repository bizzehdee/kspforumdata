Solar systems are unstable many body systems during extreme long periods. They may converge to quite stable orbits but for example nearby stars can disturb systems. Also beginning may be chaotic. Some simulations show that outer planets have moved significantly, maybe even changed their order, and\u00A0 one gas or ice giant may have been kicked out of the system. It seems to be quite common that gas giants drift near their stars (and destroy smaller planets in migration) and as far as I know it is not known why it has not been happened in our solar system. Such many body motion can shrink or expand orbits or even cause collisions or kick planets out from their system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond most important is slow drifting outwards because stars loose their mass during life. Stable stars like Sun lose negligible amounts during main sequence period but after that they begin to loose. Larger stars can loose significant part of teheir mass during main sequence period (which is very short due the extreme radiation power).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think drag or radiation pressure are not noticeable for planet sized objects, except if they are completely swallowed in red giants.

Something simply flying through a dragless void would not be a perpetual motion machine in the usual sense, because it violates no rules of physics. It has no change in entropy at all, nor would it be expected to have any. It also can do no work, so describing it as a \u0022machine\u0022 is quite questionable, even if it is perpetually in motion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it is defined as one type of a perpetual motion, the third kind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-11T18:31:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224292210\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022217529\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221686487867\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002279159\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lajoswinkler\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, lajoswinkler said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it is defined as one type of a perpetual motion, the third kind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a definition that I disagree with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Terwin","CreatedById":139655,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-12T14:25:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224292210\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022217529\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221686487867\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002279159\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lajoswinkler\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 6/11/2023 at 7:51 AM, lajoswinkler said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it is defined as one type of a perpetual motion, the third kind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould not the solar wind cause a trivial amount of drag on planetary bodies casing them to be continuously slowing down by amounts too small to measure?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat sounds like a long duration, but not perpetual scenario.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure how that balances with the loss of mass from the star due to both fusion and expelled mass(solar wind), but even if that keeps the system balanced, it is still not a \u0027perpetual\u0027 state, as it depends on the star converting mass to energy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-12T14:41:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224292488\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022217529\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221686579940\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022139655\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Terwin\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 minutes ago, Terwin said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould not the solar wind cause a trivial amount of drag on planetary bodies casing them to be continuously slowing down by amounts too small to measure?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat sounds like a long duration, but not perpetual scenario.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure how that balances with the loss of mass from the star due to both fusion and expelled mass(solar wind), but even if that keeps the system balanced, it is still not a \u0027perpetual\u0027 state, as it depends on the star converting mass to energy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure, there is no such thing as perpetual machine of the third kind, but some things are close to it, considering our ephemeral experience with the universe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven a rotating body in intergalactic space isn\u0027t perfectly spherical and gives off gravitational waves.
