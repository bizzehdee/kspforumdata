They described the containment system as a \u0022High Beta\u0022 concept, using intense magnetic fields to isolate the plasma in a much smaller size than Tokamaks. The also cite the smaller scale of the reactor as an important factor to shorten development cycles (smaller reactors can be built and revised more quickly than large ones).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I\u0027m not clear on why other labs haven\u0027t tried to reduce the scale of the reactors in this same way if it\u0027s so effective. Personally, I\u0027ve always thought the future of fusion was going to be in IEC reactors, and actually thought these reactors were scaled up IECs. Ends up I was wrong, and they definitely use magnetism to control plasma.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are the community\u0027s thoughts on this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xenomorph555","CreatedById":103080,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-10T22:27:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo be honest their hyping up something which, for one will not be ready in 10 years and two is not some holy fire technique that will save everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-10T22:37:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LethalDose\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LethalDose\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat are the community\u0027s thoughts on this?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t speak for the community but you could have a look at this link: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96902-Lockheed-claims-breakthrough-on-fusion-energy-project\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96902-Lockheed-claims-breakthrough-on-fusion-energy-project\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
