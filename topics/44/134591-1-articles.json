After electroplating the side of the disc will have to be trimmed back before attachment removing all 65-CU enriched copper from the side. One could as a precautionary measure electroplate the entire device other than the bottom plate with 63-Cu.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the vacuum chamber there could be sensors or electrodes (-) embedded in microcavities to absorb any positive charges produced while power is applied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince copper is extremely susceptible to oxidation, post electroplating the copper plate should be handled in helium consequently the device should be assembled in an isolation chamber and the cutting and turning process should also be handled in a pressured (helium) isolation chamber.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing this scheme, the application of power to the device under vacuum either will or will not release \u003Csup\u003E65\u003C/sup\u003ECu, since it is difficult for the device to generate backward\u00A0 force from the sides, from ablation of the end-plate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
