Chucking the useless bits out as a means to propel the craft actually makes sense. In a way we do that in KSP all the time, rather than haul kilotons of fuel out to capture that E-class, we just use the asteroid for fuel. And besides, if the rock was ground into a reasonably fine dust, using it as RCS wouldn\u0027t be immediately dangerous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pjschurr","CreatedById":49025,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-07T16:07:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can see that, sort of.
