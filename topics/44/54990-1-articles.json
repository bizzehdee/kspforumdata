If we are still talking about a triangular mesh (or pure simplical 2-complex as a topologist might call it) then roughly speaking, it is equivalent to a sphere if you can drag all of its vertices and re-position them, without overlapping, to make something resembling a sphere. So a 3D model of a sofa is probably going to be equivalent to a sphere. While a common example of a surface equivalent to a torus is a surface of a coffee cup. A torus has Euler Characteristic of 0, so it can be built out of all vertices having exactly 6 neighbors. But more realistically, since you\u0027ll encounter positive and negative curvature, you\u0027ll be looking at vertices with 5 and 7 neighbors, but there has to be the same amount of both.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, if anyone has interest in geometry or 3D modeling, I would recommend reading up on Euler Characteristic. Wikipedia article is pretty easy to follow, and it can be useful in many situations. I\u0027ve made great use of the concept in some simple simulations of deforming objects. If an Euler Characteristic has changed, it likely signals that the body you are simulating has fragmented. Made for some good optimization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ZetaX: For some reason, I never thought about it in terms of conserved total curvature. That\u0027s a good way to look at it.

Euler Characteristic for a hemisphere is same as that of a disk, 1. Which means you can build a hemisphere out of triangles with every interior vertex having 6 neighbors, so long as on the boundary, for example, most vertices have 4 neighbors, with exactly 6 vertices having 3 neighbors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, lets generalize this a little bit. Consider an interior vertex with n neighbors. It accounts for n/2 edges and n/3 faces. So its contribution to Euler Characteristic is 1 - n/2 \u002B n/3 = 1 - n/6. So for n = 6, this is exactly 0. For n = 5, this is \u002B1/6. So in order to get \u002B2 of the sphere, where all vertices are going to be interior vertices, you need to have 12 vertices with 5 neighbors, each adding 1/6 to Euler Characteristic giving you total of \u002B2. If you have a vertex with 7 neighbors, it contributes -1/6, so you must balance it with another 5-neighbor vertex.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample: Consider an octahedron. It is built out of 8 triangles having 6 vertices. At each vertex you have 4 triangles, so each vertex has 4 neighbors and. Therefore, each one contributes 1 - 4/6 = \u002B1/3 to Euler Characteristic. That gives you a total of \u002B2, which is same as for a sphere. And indeed, all regular polyhedra are topologically equivalent to spheres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the boundary, however, each vertex is going to have 1 more edge than face. So if it has n neighbors, it contributes 1 - n/2 \u002B (n-1)/3 = 2/3 - n/6 to Euler Characteristic. So now, you get 0 contribution with n = 4. While n = 3 neighbored vertices are going to add \u002B1/6. So if all of the interior vertices have 6 neighbors, for a total Euler Characteristic of 0, then on the edge you need to accumulate \u002B1 of the disk, which can be done with 6 vertices of 3 neighbors each.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample: Consider a regular pentagon broken up into 5 triangles. The interior vertex has five neighbors, so it contributes \u002B1/6 to the total. There are 5 vertices on the boundary having 3 neighbors each, providing \u002B1/6 each for a total of \u002B5/6. The total for this object is \u002B1, which is equivalent to that of the disk.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
