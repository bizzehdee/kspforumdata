Do not underestimate how important these kinds of things are.\n\nAny detail will help the investigation along a lot. Even if the circumstances are exactly as you say, it will tell us a huge amount of things that before were just iffy speculation. Even in cases where a flight recorder either recorded no problems at all (suddenly cut out) or was turned off, those circumstances and facts actually helped paint the picture for the investigators.\n\nEvery detail is valuable, especially since currently there are so very few details.

If the location is significantly south of the current seabed search area then it would disprove the detour claimed around Sumatra.\n\nIf there were significant separation of the wings from fuselage \u0026 relative lack of crush damage to wings that would imply mid-air break up before impact with the sea.\n\n[http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2015/08/21/2162976-mh-370-a-balma-l-enquete-technique-est-bouclee.html](http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2015/08/21/2162976-mh-370-a-balma-l-enquete-technique-est-bouclee.html)\n\nSome details have started to leak out of Toulouse. The barnacle variety is consistent with South Indian Ocean (SIO) however the flaperon would have to have been semi-submerged beneath the surface for at least 3 months. This implies a couple of things. \n\n1) It implies the flaperon remained attached to rest of wing until June 2014. \n\n2) Given the extensive air searches along 7th Arc one whole 27m long wing drifted past searchers unnoticed. \n\n3) The flaperon separated from the wing due to wave action \n\n4) Somehow the wing impacted the sea without crushing the flaperon????"},{"CreatedByName":"Tazjet","CreatedById":150134,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T13:59:29Z","Content":"Whilst I am not unbiased about MH370 debate, if the evidence from France suggests the flaperon remained attached to a floating wing for three months there were really only two candidate wings sized objects sighted, both ignored by Australia at Malaysia\u0027s insistence.\n\nSighted by satellite 16 March 2014\n\n![24m%20object%20shrunken%200.50_zpstb4akmcw.jpg](http://i257.photobucket.com/albums/hh212/727Kiwi/MH370/24m%20object%20shrunken%200.50_zpstb4akmcw.jpg)\n\nand this object sighted two days later about 63km away:\n\n![22.5m%20Chinese%20debris%20sighting_zpsubyafnj4.jpg](http://i257.photobucket.com/albums/hh212/727Kiwi/22.5m%20Chinese%20debris%20sighting_zpsubyafnj4.jpg)\n\nBoth of which were a long way south of the seabed search area\n\n![China%20impact%20context3_zpsybfybhhg.jpg](http://i257.photobucket.com/albums/hh212/727Kiwi/MH370/China%20impact%20context3_zpsybfybhhg.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-20T20:18:52Z","Content":"[http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36086251](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36086251)"}]}
