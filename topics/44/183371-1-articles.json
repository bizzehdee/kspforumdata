Obviously the pins need a solid surface(or about a mm or so of non newtonian surface to sit on.). Could it become a sport?! might want to go with the small hole option for the balls though. Or is it safer it you get stuck so it doesn\u0027t go flying. Accidents will happen more often. maybe it should be done in a closed chamber or with non Newtonian wall protectors?!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust make sure not to loose the kiddies in the goop!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had a child once.

If not can you control the substance so it\u0027s think enough that it can take the rolling. You might be able to adjust the liquid to different levels of play. What about heavier(or lighter) balls than normal so the rolling creates more impact. Or oversized balls and really big pins?

Hence the bowling ball can experiacne minimal resistance and the NNL Is still part of floor\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
