Ever wondered why it\u0027s called \u0022Lorentz Factor\u0022 and \u0022Lorentz Transformation\u0022 if Einstein was the one who came up with Special Relativity? Most of the ideas behind Special Relativity were already floating around in scientific community. Einstein\u0027s contribution was primarily in organizing it all, and in building a self-consistent set of axioms from which SR follows. No easy task, and quite a creative one in places, but it was not a leap of logic by any means. When Special Relativity got published, it was instantly accepted specifically because it was not a leap of logic. Note, by the way, that it was work of Poincare and Minkowski that lead to formulation of SR in terms of unusual transformations of space-time, which is how we know it today. Einstein\u0027s original work read more along the lines of, \u0022If we postulate that speed of light is the same in every frame of reference, as Maxwell\u0027s equations and Michelson-Morley experiment suggests, we get transformation laws for coordinates that are consistent with what we know from electrodynamics.\u0022 There was nothing revolutionary about the suggestion. Revolution came from what followed logically from that. The fact that Lorentz Transform is just a hyper-rotation in space-time. This gives you Poincare symmetry of space-time. This leads to stress-energy tensor being the conserved charge by Noether\u0027s Theorem. And this launches us straight into General Relativity. Of course, the final pieces only fell into places by the late 50\u0027s, early 60\u0027s. Yang and Mills came up with the way to build a field theory from the Lie group symmetries in Lagrangian. That lead to formulation of General Relativity as a Yang-Mills theory on Poincare group, which finally closed the gap between General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory and opened the road towards the Grand Unified.

You are confusing things that are logical in hindsight with things that are logical when working towards new solutions. Those are two very different things. Any good theory is logical once you get it hammered out, so in hindsight everything seems to be all neatly ordered and logical.

You do not understand how the theory is built, so you assume that neither did people who built it until they did, in fact, build it. That\u0027s not how science works. I\u0027m telling you that as a person who is actually involved in modern research, and I\u0027m entirely prepared to discuss this on a case-by case basis. But even when I do that, all you get to dig into is your false conjectures without absolutely a shred of support for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are making stuff up and arguing from ignorance rather than try and listen to somebody who knows what he\u0027s talking about. Again, I\u0027m entirely happy to spend time clarifying any particular point, but you just keep repeating your conjecture over and over without any room for discussion.
