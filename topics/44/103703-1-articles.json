Not little dinky ones like Microsoft Flight Simulator with a joystick either. These are Full Flight Simulators, built and programmed to such quality that an hour flying one of these counts as an hour of actual flight time in a real aircraft (I\u0027ve gotten at least 20 hours in the last few weeks ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)). I put a picture of one at the end of this post.\n\nHowever, someone I know recently claimed that these devices would soon be obsolete.

The Rift and comparable devices do have a couple advantages :\n\n1. True stereoscopic display with no ghosting (bleed from left to right, which you get with every other method for 3d)\n\n2. Perfect head tracking. This is important because one of the reasons those flight simulators require many computers to drive them is that you have to render every perspective from every window on the aircraft. If you know what the user is actually looking at, you only have to update what the user can actually see.\n\nWe could develop a form of virtual desktop that would work the same way. Instead of hiding windows behind other windows the way we do it now, you would have everything visible, all the time, in a 360 degree virtual space around the user. In the event that a user has so many tabs and windows open that there isn\u0027t enough room to show them all, you would make the less important tabs smaller. You only update the windows inside the field of view of the VR headset user.\n\nBut, if you\u0027re wearing a headset, how do you see your hands and the switches?\n\nThe way to make this work is a headset that projects the image [right onto your retina](http://venturebeat.com/2014/10/21/heres-what-we-know-about-magic-leap-the-google-backed-company-that-just-grabbed-542m/), overlaid on the real world. As you move your head around, there would be black construction paper or something in the cockpit windows, and the headset would display the stereoscopic image of what is visible outside the cockpit beamed right onto your retina. You would track the user\u0027s head position with fixed cameras inside the cockpit aimed at the trainees, that would be looking at marker LEDs on the outside of the headset.\n\nThe actual Rift could be used for the monitoring stations - the instructors who watch the pilots would wear rifts which would display the feed from cameras inside the cockpit (so you can see what the trainee hands are doing) and the stereoscopic view of the outside world."},{"CreatedByName":"DaMichel","CreatedById":93697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T22:23:52Z","Content":"This is very impressive, and as a passenger i would prefer that pilots train under the most realistic conditions ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nThe Occulus Rift has a pretty bad display last time i heard about it.
