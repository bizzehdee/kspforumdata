Nor have I said the standard model needs to be thrown out or summarily replaced, this seldomly happens in science, but old ideas are modified to fit new understandings. That summarily requires scientist, however, to be open to new understandings. It is perfectly rational to question the stringency of held scientific beliefs, particularly the way they explain things at extremes. You\u0027re argument is that once a consensus has determined a particular thing to be true, then it cannot be refuted. This in science is called cementing a theory into a dogma. You can chose that path on your own, but don\u0027t insist that others, particularly those who have spent decades observing science and who have studied the history of scientific fields, to follow your lead. Truth lies at the intersection of valid perspectives, the more perspectives you have on the truth (that is a well defined reality) the more limited the confidence interval is. The Cannae drive creates a perspective on momentum but the validity of the perspective is in question, not falsified. Thus the perspective itself needs to be defined, and that cannot be done by repeating the same experiment ad-nauseum. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ZetaX\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ZetaX\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E It is a simply analogy for why you should apologize for making the \u0022argument\u0022 above\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E \u0026lt;----- where is the moderator?\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ZetaX\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ZetaX\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E it comes down to the very same dishonest reasons.

Its just one of many examples where publicly scientist are dubious about something. Another example, dark matter interactions, its matter therefore it has inertia, it must have gained inertia somehow, and yet it does not interact. How exactly do we know that dark matter cannot interact, how can we be sure that for the briefest moment that the Cannae drive transferred inertia to dark matter and then the dark matter quickly transferred inertia elsewhere. This is not a situation where I am trying to create a scenario and say \u0027look it can be true\u0027, but the fact of the matter is that 1000s of scenarios might explain how it works, including scenarios that fall into standard explanation.

The only point I am making is that if you repeat the same experiment over and over again and get the same result - -future repetition is not science. Science is that which expands on the boundaries of science. As I defined clearly in the philosophical section, the self-defining statistical parameters will come from testing under a range of conditions, potentially extreme conditions that not only can find the happy center but also define distributions and ranges.

But you won\u0027t get anywhere if you keep insisting that type II errors do no exist in science, or denying that science has a problem in general of dealing with these types of errors. In the long term these problems are inevitably solved, you probably not get any pre-20th century scientist to accept quantum mechanics based on their observations of the Universe (cept maybe the occasional alchemist who work with mercury too long), even though there were tiny hints out there that it existed. If you look at the evolution of science you see easily a process of acceptance and then a questioning of what has been accepted creating a new acceptance/questioning cycle. Newtonian physics was not destroyed, it was modified into a new form, and that new form was modified again, and that form may be modified again in the future. Each form has created layers of consistency with the past form, but added to the explanations at the boundaries. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI look at it like this, to get out of a scientific rut often takes a new mind willing to take risk that the previous generation of thinkers are unwilling to take. These are the same minds that took on creationism and eventually brought it down. If you take a look at Hubble data, Hubble starts out a cripple, but then it was repaired by adding some new optics that allowed it to correct for the aberrations created by the primary reflector. However when we look deeply into space, the hardest task Hubble had to do, how much of what we are seeing is from the corrections and how much are that of the light itself and distortions of space-time. So even the acceleration universe model may not be correct or to the degree (or maybe to a greater degree) that is currently proposed (or for that matter the timing). But the fact that we have dark matter as something that does not require Hubble to justify and the possibility that the universe has changed its outward acceleration, means that we must face the prospect that known physics is not dogma. The same can be true with popular explanation of quantum entanglement. Does the standard model explain why the universe, with no obvious change in energetic in any other way (for example a transition of one form of energy to dark energy) suddenly change its acceleration, nope. IOW there is a interrogative dance going on between all kinds of dynamics, and Cannae has now fallen into that dance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t believe there is any point of conversing with you on the matter, you seem to be driven toward dogma, and you like to use ad-hominems to emphasize your point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZetaX","CreatedById":60692,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T16:23:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like how you try to silence my critique by calling for a moderator, ignoring everything I say, or putting it out of context, while calling me dogmatic.

Have you ever heard the phrase \u0022the Chicago Pile moment\u0022? For the longest time, proponents of nuclear power insisted it was possible to harness the atom in order to produce useful energy. But everybody was terribly skeptical and funding to investigate this was immensely difficult to come by. The largest source of it ended up being funds from the Manhattan Project. The Chicago Pile-1 was the first manmade nuclear reactor built in 1942, first chain reaction on December 2nd of that year. It demonstrated what many of the brightest minds considered impossible, that man could intentionally produce, and control to some degree or another, an artificial fissile nuclear reaction. The time in between this event and the worlds first commercial nuclear power plant? The Shippingport Atomic Power Station began construction on September 6th, 1954, producing power on May 26th, 1958. 12 years. Twelve years to go from something that was \u0022obviously impossible and/or impractical\u0022 to a completed design and construction underway.

By the late 30s, nuclear reactions were fairly well understood. There were still a lot of questions about the source of the binding energy, but certain isotopes becoming unstable on neutron capture was well known phenomenon, and various relevant cross-sections have been experimentally measured. We had all the math and science to explain how a reactor would work. And nobody was skeptical that it can work in principle.
