As SLS passes peak expenditure, payloads will come into their own so long as congress doesn\u0027t slash and burn. The upgrade path for SLS is planned in two stages: after the initial Block 1 tests, the Block 1b will enlarge the second stage with 4 RL10s and fuel capacity to match. Later would come the Block 2 which would have a J2X upper stage and replace the 5-segment SRBs with new boosters that have yet to be designed. Dynetics and ATK are competing for this opportunity, with the F1B and new SRB chemistry respectively. It\u0027s reasonable to doubt whether the Block 2 will come to fruition, as it implies putting very heavy things near Earth, which is not a prominent idea in mission planning right now. The lower Isp of the J2X causes Block 2 to reach a breakeven point with Block 1B\u0027s cargo capacity somewhere between a direct Mars and direct Jupiter flight. The \u0022flexible path\u0022 concept means maximizing overlap between moon and mars hardware, so we can dance to whatever tune congress directs.
