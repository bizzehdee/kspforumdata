The delta-v for GTO is about 2.4 km/s from LEO, lunar transfer is about 3.2 km/s, Mars transfer (with inclination change) is about 3.6-4 km/s. With the usual hydrolox upper stage you can usually get about 1/2 of your LEO payload to GTO, 1/2.5 of your LEO payload to TLI, and 1/3 of your LEO payload to TMI.
