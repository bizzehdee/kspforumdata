If we\u0027re going to use Star Trek in this discussion, I\u0027d recommend the 2nd season TNG episode \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/10/star-trek-the-next-generation-rewatch-pen-pals\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u0022Pen Pals\u0022\u003C/a\u003E as a counterpoint - it was perhaps a much better treatment of the Prime Directive and the ethical baggage it carries IMHO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, the Prime Directive as imagined in Star Trek was bungled by writers more often than not, and I personally suspect the amount of thought that went into it was along the lines of \u0022How can we throw some big legal obstacle in the way of Our Heroes?\u0022 than on any serious attempt to consider how we should deal with alien cultures ethically. It makes too many assumptions along the lines of human-alien contact, including: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ethat we\u0027d be able to understand the alien culture to the point that we can recognize a problem,\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ethat we are more advanced than the alien culture in question (or: should we worry about our effect on the Organians or the Q?), \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eand that our Superior Advancement is only a few centuries or millenia ahead of the alien culture in question.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I suspect the chances of a \u0022Prime-Directive-Problem\u0022 ever arising in our future is so small as to be not worth considering. Given the vastness of space, the large numbers of planets, and the likelihood that our ventures will be slower than light rather than faster, the chances of us running into a civilization \u0022sufficiently less advanced\u0022 than ours is remote. A more likely scenario - and a better foundation for a Prime Directive kind of law - would be finding a planet that bears life, but not sentience. Do we settle and develop the planet, or leave it alone? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESettling a life-bearing planet would certainly create a new human culture and give us an extra bulwark against extinction, but could also mean we would preempt the development of a native sentient species. If interstellar travel becomes commonplace - and that\u0027s a big \u0022if\u0022 - there\u0027s also the concern of cross-contamination. While humans might not pick up alien diseases, the chances of an alien lifeform finding a niche on Earth (or other settled human worlds) is higher. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModern space exploration already has \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_protection\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eplanetary protection protocols\u003C/a\u003E to prevent accidental cross-contamination within this system, and I\u0027d expect we would expand them as we venture to other stars. Ultimately, the best ethical development might be to leave life-bearing planets (and the systems they occupy) alone, save for dedicated scientific colonies designed to remain isolate and easy to remove if necessary. There should be plenty of lifeless planets we can terraform or asteroids we can convert into habitats, that this should not be a problem for our descendants. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only time I\u0027d imagine a need for a Cultural Prime Directive would be if and when we encounter another starfaring culture. However, it\u0027s likely said culture might be more advanced than we, and so the concern would be over how they would affect us, rather than the other way around.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T02:47:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Einvasion first, policy second.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pawelk198604","CreatedById":35539,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T10:39:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI found cool video about Prime Directive, especially second part\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lewNeQ0qu_M\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lewNeQ0qu_M\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T11:30:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe already have a sort of Prime Directive working right now - here on Earth.
