Once you know the transfer time, all you need is the period of the target orbit angle its angular velocity its going to cross 360 per period. Since you know the transfer time, you can calculate the number of degrees the target orbit sweeps in the transfer time. Since the ship transfers 180 degrees the target sweeps x degrees. There for the targets positions relative to the transfer ship should be 180-x degrees, in front of the ship if it is positive and behind the ship if it is negative.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_mechanics\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_mechanics\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany of the equations are here in the link above.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe are other pages that link to this page.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nu (greek mu) = celestials gravitation constant = universal gravitational constant * central bodies mass\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(for a small satellite)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the game the semi-major axis (a) is equal half the major axis,\u00A0which is sum of the altitudes of the periapsis, apoapsis and central bodies diameter.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ne is the difference of the Apo and Pe divided by the major axis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-13T11:59:50Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2016 11:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFixed typo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-13T11:12:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222511300\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022136836\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221460535645\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022112866\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bertibott\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, bertibott said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...
