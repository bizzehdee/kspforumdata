We can\u0027t just scale up smaller boosters to larger ones because of the square-cube law. Smaller boosters will always be more efficient than larger ones. \u003Cp\u003EHow is ISS an example? There is no booster that could lift it in one piece, nor is it a shape that could be made aerodynamic at all. There is no way that it could be lifted into space in one piece, certainly not at anywhere near the cost of lifting individual modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sorry, but with respect, do you honestly believe Shuttle was an economic way of putting a 500 tone station into LEO piece by piece ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure we could have used the $100 billion it cost to have developed a genuine super heavy lift booster and a non modular station and had an awful lot of spare change left over\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing a man rated launch system to simply put hardware into LEO is economically crazy\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-16T21:58:38Z\u0022 title=\u002202/16/2014 09:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Simon Ross\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
