But in the spirit of the Apollo Applications Project, and Russian incremental improvements on reliable hardware to sustain a near constant human presence in space, this post is meant to propose a few incremental improvements to make on Orion-System hardware for a constant American presence in space for decades to come!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first thought was to make a little more room, with an orbital module so if you\u0027re flying with 6 crew on LEO they don\u0027t get crowded up. The best (and most obvious) choice is basing it off Cygnus hardware, only with the propulsion bit chopped off, and replaced with whatever docking thing Orion uses. Surprisingly, standard Cygnus is only 1.5mt dry, but it almost \u003Cem\u003Etriples\u003C/em\u003E the habitable volume of Orion! For 1.8mt enhanced Cygnus, you could almost quadruple the volume, but that is probably overkill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other improvement you can make to optimize for LEO activities is to empty those tanks! Orion has ~1.3km/s delta-vee full, and if we dump most of the fuel, you can cut the service module mass to around 5.337mt. Plus the capsule\u0027s 8.913mt, and the orbital module\u0027s 1.5mt is 15.75mt. That\u0027s under 20 metric tons! About twice the mass of Soyuz, for twice the crew capacity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut System is too overpowered just to launch Orion onto LEO. My original thought was that you could make Slick System by removing the big Shuttle boosters and the Delta upper stage, and adding some Atlas SRMs (or Delta GEMs if they could easily be man-rated). But that still ends up being extremely overpowered. (admirably so, Slick System with 8 Atlas solids can launch 60 whole metric tons to LEO if you offload 29mt of the propellant!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I realized 15.75mt was within the payload capacity of the (apparently man-rated) Atlas V rocket family. A likely option is Atlas V 541, which has plenty of margin in payload capacity (17.443mt) to carry the LAS some of the way. Plus, with the 5m diameter fairing, it just \u003Cem\u003Ewants \u003C/em\u003Eto launch Orion! There would be an adapter to fit Orion on the top of the fairing, and then they would do Apollo-style transposition, docking, and extraction with the Cygnus OM, which would be sitting attached to Centaur.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a bad Photoshop I made of Orion plus Cygnus OM on orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.ezimba.com/work/141218C/ezimba11596881072600.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ezimba11596881072600.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s a bad Photoshop I made of Orion on Atlas V 541:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.ezimba.com/work/141218C/ezimba11596890292400.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ezimba11596890292400.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-18T03:20:49Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2014 03:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Kibble\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo in essential mass figure\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xenomorph555","CreatedById":103080,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T16:25:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWait what\u0027s the point of putting Orion into LEO?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kibble","CreatedById":131042,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T16:35:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022xenomorph555\u0022 data-cite=\u0022xenomorph555\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWait what\u0027s the point of putting Orion into LEO?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh just flying astronauts and stuff, anything where you just need to get people onto orbit.

It seems like you are starting with the hardware and then trying to find something to do with it. What you need is a mission, and then figure out a way to use what you have, or design what you need, to do that mission.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point is to have a flexible set of in-production hardware that you could use for a variety of missions. Like a Cygnus OM could evolve into a LM ascent stage, which could evolve into a FlexCraft-like thing or something. Because you can have a great spacecraft on a Powerpoint, but the spacecraft that will fly, is the one already flying. With Orion flying, it should be a priority to find stuff to do with it, and incremental ways to improve it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022xenomorph555\u0022 data-cite=\u0022xenomorph555\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana;\u0022\u003EActually strangely a Dragon trunk could store an LK lander. \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana;\u0022\u003EThat\u0027s super awesome! :3\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana;\u0022\u003EIf only that configuration could fly someday...\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-17T18:24:19Z\u0022 title=\u002212/17/2014 06:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Kibble\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eincorrect quoting\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xenomorph555","CreatedById":103080,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T18:53:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kibble\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kibble\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou mean like one Orion vehicle costs 500 million, but an entire \u003Cem\u003Eflight\u003C/em\u003E of CST-100 or Dragon V2 only costs 200 million?
