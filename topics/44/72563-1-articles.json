I understand what that means and it fit my understanding at first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut one thing is odd about that formula: It implies that the gravitational pull for m1 towards m2 is \u003Cem\u003Ethe same\u003C/em\u003E as the one for m2 towards m1, \u003Cem\u003Eregardless\u003C/em\u003E of their mass ratio. That would mean that a very heavy m1 would move the same distance towards m2 as a very light m2 would move towards m1 in the same timeframe due to the gravitational pull? I\u0027m almost 100% sure that\u0027s a misinterpretation on my part but the formula certainly hints that way. By the way the image with F1 = F2 = ... is more explicit if my example is hard to understand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone point out why my interpretation of that formula is wrong and keep my view of the world of physics intact?

Though the forces acting on both objects are the same, the accelerations they experience are very different. As an example, let\u0027s calculate the accelerations experienced by the Earth and a 100 kg mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EF = (-6.67e-11*5.97e24*100)/6371000^2 = 0981.04 N\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we have the Earth and the 100kg mass exerting a 981.04 N force on one another. Now let\u0027s calculate the accelerations. (NOTE: I omit the negative sign from the force in the calculations as it serves only to indicate direction of motion.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EF/m_100kg = 981.03N/100kg = 9.81 m/s^2 (which is what we expect,the acceleration due to gravity at Earth\u0027s surface.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EF/m_Earth = 981.04N/5.97e24 kg = 1.64e-22 m/s^2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis second number is why they would not move the same distance in the same time. The 100kg mass\u0027s velocity will increase by 9.81 m/s every second it falls while the Earth\u0027s velocity increases by a very, very small amount, 1.64e-22 m/s every second.

The difference one will see is on acceleration of the respective mass, as F = m.a, so the larger mass accelerates slower. And if it\u0027s going to collide, the larger mass will move shorther than the smaller mass (due to the smaller acceleration it has).

What we call the gravitational mass is a property of objects than makes them attract one another according to gravitational law (GMm/r\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2). On the other hand, the inertial mass is the tendency to an object to rest as it is, meaning keeping a linear movement with constant speed. We have tested and measured the values of these two different masses and, as far as we know, there are just the same. Thus, the acceleration of an object of mass m subject to the gravity of an object of mass M is GM/r^2, which does not depends on the mass of the former (ignoring air drag, all objects fall at the same speed; the Earth is barely moved by the gravity pull of a falling object).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrOnak","CreatedById":104432,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-17T09:09:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETurns out a couple of hours of sleep is all I needed.

The more massive object is harder to move, and so needs a stronger force to move the same distance. So while it is true that the force acting on both of the objects is the same, you would need more than that to move the more massive object the same distance. So the smaller one covers the distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, if both objects had the exact same mass, then both objects would cover the same amount of distance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
