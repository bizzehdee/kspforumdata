Coleman is it?): very sexy to me personally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I should have clarified is: not sexy in a broad mass appeal standpoint . . . or at least that is the HYPOTHESIS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously though, I do think King Arthur was hitting on _something_ here and I\u0027ll explain to you why. I am a bona fide sci fi geek from way back into the 1970s. In recent decades my \u0027involvement\u0027 with the space/sci-fi worlds has declined a bit, and as I\u0027ve pointed out in some other threads, I haven\u0027t really watched TV or otherwise partaken in regular doses of mass media since the late 1980s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENonetheless, I could not escape exposure to Hubble and its amazing mindblowing images. Even before I bought this game and underwent a crash refresher course in Sci Fi Geek certification I was fully aware of what Hubble had shown us, the fact that it required a repair, and how clearly smitten humanity has been with what it has revealed about the Universe with astounding clarity. Not to say everyone understands what it all means, but images like that pique the imagination and anyone is likely to inquire \u0027what is that\u0027 and at least learn a bit. In sum, Hubble has been a smashing PR success; I think that must be abundantly clear. I think the same must be true with Curiousity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn contrast, and sticking with my personal experience as a simple guide, I was basically only vaguely aware of an \u0022International Space Station.\u0022 Until a couple weeks ago, I did not know for sure when it was launched, whether it had already been decommissioned and burntup in the atmosphere, let alone that it has been up there pretty much continuously occupied with science teams for 12 years! You can chide me for being a malfeasant Sci Fi nerd that I didn\u0027t even know that ISS \u0027existed\u0027 until I got into KSP and looked it up on wiki. But what this suggests is that: if someone like me didn\u0027t even know it was still up there and had been continuously in operation for so long, most people in the world probably don\u0027t even know it exists. Everyone on the planet knows about Star Wars, Darth Vader, and the Hubble Deep Field.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoreover, I think it is probably humanly impossible to look at most of the hubble images and not feel a stiring of curiousity and wonder. Looking at an astronaut, or worse a space station that looks more like deep freezer or the inside of a storage tank (the Russia part) or even worse, reading the esoteric details of some strange experiment they are doing on ISS is not likely to stir the same sort of universal wonder; at least not without substantial \u0027re-branding\u0027 and/or marketing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-22T16:53:38Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2013 04:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Diche Bach\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moon Goddess","CreatedById":57446,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-22T17:09:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Diche Bach\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Diche Bach\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMe personally?
