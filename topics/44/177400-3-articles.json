His senior project? A compiler.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou have three choices to achieve your goal of controlling a rocket electronically:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. Use an off-the-shelf language to write a control program\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Use an off-the-shelf language to write an interpreter or compiler for your custom language, and \u003Cem\u003Ethen\u003C/em\u003E write the control program in your custom language\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. Write your control program in assembly code\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second involves the most effort and yields results either about the same as the first but less efficiently (if interpreted), or about the same as the third (if compiled). If you choose to compile, you\u0027ll essentially have to do all the work of 1 (that fancy language has to interface with the rocket somehow), 3 (you need to make it run on the hardware somehow), \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E learn how to write a compiler. If you choose to interpret, you\u0027ll need to do all the work of 1 and learn how to write an interpreter. In the end, a well-structured implementation of option 1 is probably your best bet at minimal effort.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, if you\u0027re dead-set on making your own language, your first step is to construct a language specification. This means describing your language in enough detail that a five-year-old banging on a calculator could execute it. This is necessary so that you can remember it when you write an interpreter or compiler for it, when you write the control program itself, and when you show it to your mates. After that, you need to make some way of turning a text file into a collection of commands for the processor. This might include writing a program (with code!) to do so, which is known as either an interpreter or a compiler, depending on whether it reads the input at the same time as it executes it, or it might involve many long hours translating the text into assembly code based on your reference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the end of this, you might actually have a nice way of representing control programs! Also, you\u0027ll have learned how to code, and maybe that means you won\u0027t hate it so much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the note of not hating coding so much: I find it\u0027s good practice to get some foundational knowledge in the language you\u0027ve picked, and then find problems to solve. Programming just to program isn\u0027t really fun, at least for me. But programming because there\u0027s a problem you need to solve? Well, once you\u0027ve finished, you have a solved problem! And, if you\u0027ve done it right, your solution will work for other, similar problems. There are few things more satisfying than seeing your ungainly heap of code rear up, devour a complicated math problem, and then spit out the answer. Just pick a problem you know how to solve and a documentation site you trust, and you\u0027ll have a solution in no time. Don\u0027t get frustrated by always forgetting semicolons or other apparently-trivial details\u2014with practice you\u0027ll remember them, at least most of the time.
