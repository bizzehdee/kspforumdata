Or we go the self-driving car route and have the operator responsible merely for entering destinations. The flight computer would then be responsible for contacting ATC, filing flight plan, and following it safely to destination. There is very little reason not to go all the way here. There are no pedestrians in the air, nor terrain hazards. Most aircraft fly with transponders already. The few that don\u0027t are small, slow general aviation aircraft that tend to stay low and aren\u0027t too hard to avoid.
