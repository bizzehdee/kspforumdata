I have serious doubts about its utility. An accepted range is 2-7 RPM, with rotation bellow 2 RPM believed to be suitable for pretty much everyone, and that above 7 being bad for almost everyone. Since we don\u0027t know how long it will take for problems to develop, a long term mission would probably be limited to 4-5 RPM. So that\u0027s 10-20% of Earth\u0027s gravity that we can count on. I suppose, it\u0027s better than none, albeit, at a price of some discomfort. But is that going to be enough to make a difference in a long term mission? It just seems like long term risks outweigh benefits here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, a lot of this is conjecture, and the rest is based chiefly on Earth-bound studies. So it might be possible to select a crew that will adjust to a higher RPM and get it to a high enough fraction of Earth\u0027s gravity to have significant utility. But we really won\u0027t know until we try it out on ISS.
