However, since all the planets are likely have inclinations similar to the system\u2019s debris disk, they are unlikely to transit and would be much more massive. That doesn\u2019t mean Tau Ceti e and f aren\u2019t rocky. Lower metallicity stars are expected to have a harder time forming Mini-Neptunes and other gas planets because, due to the lack of heavier elements, it would take too long for planetary cores to form and get large enough to accumulate hydrogen atmospheres before the gas disk is blown away. That would explain why scientists were only able to find Super-Earths around Tau Ceti and no gas giants, even with years worth of data. I expect Tau Ceti e and f to be about 80-95% silicates and metals by mass with a water envelope, either as steam, liquid, or ice.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019ll get to those updates, eventually. Also, K2-72f may be confirmed soon, thanks to the work done by Ethan Kruse and his team, who have used processed EVEREST data to find 371 new planet candidates in K2 Campaigns 0 through 8. I sent him an email asking about his results for EPIC 220221272, K2-149, and K2-72, since his survey likely came across those systems. While it doesn\u2019t seem like any of those 371 candidates are being confirmed just yet, his survey should provide valuable insight to not just K2-72f, but also many other systems and habitable zone worlds found on Exoplanet Explorers.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-15T16:56:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore importantly, when do the Lizards\u00A0show up?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ILoveStars","CreatedById":191669,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-16T10:55:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhat?
