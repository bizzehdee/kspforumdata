I somewhat doubt that I\u0027ll accomplish much but I am willing to at least try and give it my all. I\u0027m pretty much looking for some simple engine that can do what I need (also that is free or not overpriced or something? no clue what the scoop is, totally new to all of this stuff). Also note that I am not insanely good but not absolutely terrible at coding, but I am willing to learn a heck of a lot to figure this stuff out. Here is the bare concept of what I want to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Think of the game as realistic space chess. I pretty much want to make a basic 2D solar system with planets, stars, and moons as the base battle field (I might even want to make it so it generates randomly at some point). I don\u0027t need to have gravity assists in but I would at least like to be able to make it so crafts can be captured by other bodies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- For the spacecraft you are basically commanding a small fleet and can spend X starting currency on constructing it (Might and ways to make money). I want the craft to be able to rotate and to be able to change which side is facing where as well as to be able to make it so different sections of a hull may have different thicknesses. I pretty much want to be able to give a vessel a command to move to location X following a specific route if need be to avoid fire as well as manage different aspects of the vessel like weapon targeting and firing as well as cargo and reactor usage. (I might also want to mess with things mounted on the hull of the vessel at some point as well)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo clue if any of this will yield anything as I might just end up totally confused and shove this in a corner full of tears and crushed dreams but I have some free time so I want to give this a shot. Initially I probually just want to get some kind of derpy 1970\u0027s arcade game like thing working as most of what I\u0027ve mentioned is probually going to be VERY long term. Idk, what do you think? Should I even bother?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-24T23:38:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s some heavyweight free game engines out there, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.godotengine.org/wp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGodot\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E comes to mind, but I think you may want to start a bit simpler than that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.pygame.org/news.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPygame\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E lets you make simple (and complex) games with python, an easy to learn language that can be used for many things \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-25T03:24:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere a reason Unity won\u0027t work?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-25T04:09:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022parameciumkid\u0022 data-cite=\u0022parameciumkid\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere a reason Unity won\u0027t work?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t think of any.

No reason to waste time with anything else for a project like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and Unity is very portable.

The learning curve with something like Unity is only slightly steeper (it\u0027s very user-friendly, and there are tons of tutorials), but what you get out of it is so much more. Your first game will probably be equally buggy and iffy-looking with Game Maker or Unity. But the experience you\u0027ll get from Unity is far more valuable. As I\u0027ve pointed out, many real game developers use Unity. And it\u0027s not just indy studios, like our favorite Squad, but even the giants such as Blizzard. Hearthstone is a Unity game. It has a lot of flourish and custom libraries to make it work, but underneath it all, it\u0027s just a lot of polish on the same engine you can use at home to make your own game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geneborg","CreatedById":124360,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-25T09:28:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHm, didn\u0027t the new Engines like Cryengine/Unreal4 open up their licensing model?
