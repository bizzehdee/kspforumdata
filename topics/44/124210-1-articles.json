Most of our new telescopes are infrared, the science in the link represents a good reason for keeping hubble alive. JWST might find that really nice planet, but you might also want to look at its shortwave length spectrum.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-01T12:22:59Z\u0022 title=\u002211/01/2015 12:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
