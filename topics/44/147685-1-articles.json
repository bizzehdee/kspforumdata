The value of a number is independent from whichever symbols we choose. A base number is there for no other reason than to allow a consistent system of notation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA2: If the physicists are correct then there is a system. By that I mean there are laws of nature that are the same wherever you go. That\u0027s system right there. The maths in science is not about describing some kind of absolute reality but to allow us to predict future events when the initial conditions are known. They create models of the real world, models with a limited field of applications.\u00A0So far, physics have shown some staggering promise and many mathematicians and physicists are themselves amazed at how well maths can be used to describe and predict. This speaks for a systematic universe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0A3: 1 and 2 are not special in base 2. 0 and 1 are. There are 2 symbols for a very good reason. If you think of them not as numbers but 2 different \u00A0logical statements, then you have here the minimum number of logical statements that still allows conveying of information. Everything can be expressed using 2 and only 2 symbols, the complete work of Shakespeare can be written in 0s and 1s. Less than 2 statementss and it is impossible to convey information. 2 is therefor the lowest number of digits one can construct a consistent number system from. It doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s more natural or easier to use though,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA4: To look at integers, one need to look at 2 other values first: The Unit and no units. An integer is nothing more than a value constructed entirely of units. If pi is your base, then pi/pi becomes the unit and since that is constructed of units, then it is an integer and 5 isn\u0027t. Pi/pi can then be written using the symbol 1 but 5 would be a symbol for an irrational number just like pi is in base 10.\u00A0Integers aren\u0027t more special than that but once you have a set of integers, then they will share some properties not shared by any onther, non-integer number.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thing is, we have created a universe of mathematics based on how we percieve the world. We see 1 apple, 34 sheep. We count units because that\u0027s how our brains and sensory organs are wired. It allows us to function in a society. We understand that 1 sheep is not 2 sheep, we understand that if we have some\u00A0sheep and lose a few then we will have fewer sheep than before. We count units and we created systems that allow us to note down on clay or paper how much of this and that we have. One such system is the base 10 system we use, with symbols slowly getting acceptance before being agreed on they work for our purposes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, just my take on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-15T05:41:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause apples have clear borders.
