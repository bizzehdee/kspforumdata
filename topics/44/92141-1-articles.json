Each has some water ice (more at the poles) and also surface or near surface deposits of material which could be processed and used for building materials and possibly for energy. The dust and regolith could be used for crop growing studies. Both have lower gravity than Earth. The advantage of a lunar base is largely economical in terms of cost and time scales.
