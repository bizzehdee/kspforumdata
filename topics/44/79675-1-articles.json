I didn\u0027t really know which forum I should ask about this in, though it has some bearing on the real world so I figured it might get some discussion in here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what are your thoughts on landing spacecraft horizontally (perhaps with aid of an aircraftcarrier style arrestor system) on the moon (or other atmosphereless body)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry may be a bit confusing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeres where the question comes from though, might shed some light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast night, playing some kerbals, I was messing around with putting a network of satellites around minmus (I have KSP interstellar, RemoteTech, TAC LifeSupport, and Kethane, among a few other mods). For my comm satellite network I was using a SSTO I threw together previously for placing some in KSO (refueled it in space a bit, made for minmus) Arriving at minmus and completing most of the mission I came to the realization that, oh snap, I don\u0027t have fuel to get back to kerbin, OR enough to make a proper landing. (The craft has VTOL rockets and retros cause it should land normally, but well, we all waste fuel from time to time)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I was struck with an idea. Right on the surface of one of the frozen lake sits the largest kethane refinery I have. So for my landing approach, I lined up my orbit ahead of the lakebed so I would be landing on a very smooth surface. And I burned retrograde until my orbit would have brought me ~50m above the surface of minmus, however at still quite high velocity, if I had let the craft go on it would have either smashed into the mountains, or just flown back off into orbit a few 100 km and came back around. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter biding time, and spending a little more fuel lifting myself up to not smash a hill. I get just above the lakebed, burned retro for a few seconds so I\u0027d just touch the surface, and then when about to touch I killed the vertical I had down to ~5m/s. Note I was still way over 300m/s horizontal. From there, I just applied brakes and after a time, I came to a stop, with about 70 delta-V of fuel left. (some downward thrust was used from RCS to help keep the craft on the ground, but precious little delta-V was used during the actual landing. I made a few different attempts, mixing in the retro rockets to help slow down, but on the 4th attempt I managed it without any liquid fuel past the part for the orbital maneuver.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrought a rover with some more fuel in it over (long trip), then vtol hopped over to the base and fully fueled the craft, went and put the rest of the satellites in orbit and all was good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, how unreasonable would it be to do this kind of procedure in the real world? In many chats talking about lunar bases in particular, the problem comes of it takes fuel to get down, and fuel to get back up (then some banter of ALOX rockets, and other things). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I was able to bring a craft down on minmus in this manner, when I certainly wouldn\u0027t have had the fuel to land it by killing all horizontal, and then suicide burning before hitting the ground (I know, because I tried it with quicksaves about a half dozen times before being stupid, even my horizontal landing didn\u0027t work a couple times due to minmus\u0027s low gravity, the craft would bounce off the ground and head back out into orbit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried to do it on the Mun, but I can\u0027t find an area suitably flat to do it. IRL that could be solved, lunar crust could be smoothed into a form of landing strip like I used the lakebed for. And perhaps some form of arrestor cable setup could be included. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing to experiment later with a more, focused craft design (including some upwards facing rockets, the little rockomax ones, trim the throttle just enough to stay on the ground. And a few extra sets of wheels so more braking potential.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just want to know if any other players have any thoughts on this type of landing. If I was able to save some fuel, I could probably save a hell of a lot more with more practice (going to try it out later but, work trips, my laptop can\u0027t play KSP). And if perfected, for example. IRL a craft could say, ferry stuff into lunar orbit with less fuel need (less fuel being brought up for the eventual landing means it can bring more materials too). The craft also doesnt need to land with a thrust to weight ratio greater than 1 (if the ferry was picking things up in orbit then bringing them down. Though this would probably never be done that close, they\u0027d always keep a greater thrust to weight, incase of accidents)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peadar1987","CreatedById":81207,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-27T00:06:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour problem is that you\u0027re going to be coming in at pretty much orbital speed.

For a wheel of a given diameter, the \u0022centrifugal force\u0022 experienced at the outer edge is proportional to the square of the speed. For a 1 m radius wheel with a tip speed of 1000 m/s, the centripetal acceleration is approximately 100,000 gs!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, consider an aircraft landing on Earth. From the plane\u0027s perspective, the wheels start out stationary, with the runway flashing by at over 50 m/s (for a large airliner). When the wheels come into contact with the runway, they are spun up very quickly, but not instantaneously, and skid until their tip speed equalizes with that of the aircraft - this is what all the tire marks on runways come from. This doesn\u0027t contribute much to slowing the plane down, but is a major source of wear on the tires and stresses the rest of the aircraft as well. That\u0027s at normal aircraft landing speeds. Now imagine that process with the vehicle going as fast as a high-powered rifle round. I can\u0027t imagine any conventional wheel surviving that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere have been proposals to \u0022pre-spin\u0022 aircraft wheels before touchdown to mitigate this: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.google.com/patents/US20040104305\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.google.com/patents/US20040104305\u003C/a\u003E. However, these generally take the form of a pinwheel-type device that wouldn\u0027t work in a vacuum. Instead, you would need to use electric motors or tip-rockets, both of which would add considerable weight and complexity to the landing gear. Also, the weight of the vehicle might actually prevent the wheels disintegrating. Here\u0027s a video showing what happens when RC truck wheels are spun at full speed without the ground pressing against them:\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/78GroWSpSTw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, 1000 m/s wheels ain\u0027t happening.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, there is a potential role for \u0022horizontal landings\u0022 in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea of a wheel-shaped space station spinning to produce artificial gravity is very common, but there are major issues with docking to a rotating station. One approaching is putting the docking ports right at the center and having the spacecraft match its angular velocity with the station, but this would only allow the station to have two docking ports. The other approach is to have the spacecraft fly in circles around the station. However, controlling the ship during the maneuver would be difficult, and dV requirements would be large.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, with a station large enough that the mass of a docking spacecraft would be negligible, a third method would be possible: place maglev or wheel-based rails on the outside or inside surface of the wheel\u0027s \u0022rim\u0022, or a runway on the inside surface. The spacecraft would be able to float freely in and line itself up prior to landing since it would be stationary relative the the wheel\u0027s center of mass. The velocities involved would be relatively manageable (ranging from 100 m/s for a 1 km diameter wheel to 1000 m/s for an enormous 100 km diameter wheel, assuming a 1g acceleration at the tip), and if they did get too high for wheels to be feasible, the mentioned precision maneuvering ability would allow magnetic suspension to be used. Linear motors onboard the station would accelerate the visiting spacecraft up to the station\u0027s speed, at which point it could be shunted off to a docking area. They could also be used in reverse to launch the spacecraft up to the wheel\u0027s tip speed, but in the other direction, at which point it could simply disengage from the rails and push itself away using RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pellinor","CreatedById":85299,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-27T08:14:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor an arrestor hook you could try dragging a KAS anchor over the surface.
