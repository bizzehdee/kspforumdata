NASA has tons of projects going on at multiple research stations across the country. Thousands of scientists at JPL, Goddard, Ames, and others are working on solving real scientific problems. There seems to be this prevailing myth that NASA needs to be single mindedly focused on something, but in reality it\u0027s a very large funding agency devoted to all kinds of projects. Occasionally they have bigger plans that take a few mroe resources, but it\u0027s like saying the national science foundation has no focus because they\u0027re not building the US\u0027s version of the LHC. Or the national institutes of health have no focus because they\u0027re not doing the human genome project. Lack of a big all consuming project means NASA can try and tackle more at once. SpaceX is doing so much better because they don\u0027t have to worry about having parts built in fifty congressional districts or appealing to people who think we should have kept going to the moon, but in terms of scientific discovery it\u0027s not even close.

Without popularity gained through his online marketing achievements he wouldn\u0027t be the head of SpaceX. To be more specific, without his paypal emporium I don\u0027t think he woud have gained the contacts to share his management skills and his enthusiasm for spaceflight. I\u0027ve heard him say in a interview that he never had academic worthy knowledge about each and every piece of hardware he tries to manage. He said, I learned from my co-workers and each subsequent day brings me additional knowledge and arguably craftmanship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn terms of his ideas he has about reusable rocketry he always seems very up in the clouds regarding his ideas. And the fact he could manage a company, sell his ideas, and seems wise and citrical enough to appoint the right kind of people had thus far led to a succesfull 1st stage Falcon 9 recovery. Even if the whole concept turns out to be impossible, we have learned from it and achieved something nonetheless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn many other ways, like his management skills hes simply pretty darn down to earth.\u003Cbr\u003E\nPeople scholared in engineering and science academics know all proven data and work towards the prototypes of tommorow. Very down to earth kind of people.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nElon musk is both looking down and looking up. The reason we have so little advances and lack of new Einsteins is because academics does not allow scholarship in creativity, especially in science because it seems everybody is so afraid that creativity in science leads to failures.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhy there is lack of the valuable old proverb : \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EOur greatest glory is not in never failing, but in rising up every time we fail.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAcademics is so absent in guiding students to both think \u003Cu\u003Elogic\u003C/u\u003E and \u003Cu\u003Ecreative\u003C/u\u003E and has giant focus on the former. You can have studied for 30 years and have a similar intelligence quotient as Albert Einstein but without creativity that IQ will be used to patent the same old products every time.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI always hear the clich\u00E9 \u003Cem\u003E\u0022During the 50s, 60s and 70s we dreamt, and after that we stopped dreaming\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhich is true! And a very valid explanation to this is the lack of funding and loss of public interest.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLack of interest and money after the early 70\u0027s is a valid explanation for the demise of the good ol space program.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut what is the core message here? It\u0027s not that we should be specifically talking about the reasons that once motivated the good old endeavours which is money and interest. It is the lack of a universal existence and stimulance of creative growth that should be part of academics or scholarship in general whenever and whomever does the teaching.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith that the lack of a program and the degredation of a old intuitive generation would never have been lost and copied over to the generations of the 80s, 90s up to the present.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn any case, I think sharing pessimism about the guy in question and his program is not going to help SpaceX, and it\u0027s definitely not going to be a contribution to the recovery of a creative atmosphere vital for these projects to see eventual success.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not saying that we shouldn\u0027t be critical about SpaceX.
