It would help in figuring out how far you can OC. If it doesn\u0027t have a \u0022K\u0022 at the end of it\u0027s name, it can\u0027t be overclocked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) In the BIOS, You increase the turbo multiplier by one (\u0022x31\u0022 in your case), then go the desktop verify that your chip is overclocked with CPUZ. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2)Run any program that will stress out your CPU and keep an eye on temps. When i say stress it out, i mean the program uses nearly 100% of each core for an extended period of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) If you don\u0027t crash after this, increase the multiplier by one again and repeat. (The bluescreen message will usually be something like \u0022A clock interrupt was not received on a secondary processor\u0022.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Once you receive a bluescreen message, go back to the bios and lower the multiplier by one, and do a much longer stress test on the CPU to verify that the overclock is Stable.

A highly recommended cheap cooler is the hyper 212 evo for $30, but if you are using prebuilt case it may not fit. Also do not use prime 95 for stress testing your overclock.
