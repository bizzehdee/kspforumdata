(That might be uncommon attitude for some physicists, but I\u0027m a physical chemist - our rule is considering bonds/forces first and calculate energy later.) The point is that here the amount of energy and change of mass are determined by nuclear forces, not opposite.\u003Cp\u003EOf course, matter\u002Bantimatter is a bit different story - it\u0027s direct matter-energy conversion.

There are initial and final states with their energy levels (masses), structures and bonds. There is some kind of rearrangement process (even though at nuclear level it\u0027s mostly about tunneling between the states) and its activation energy (energetic barrier) that determines the reaction rates (like half-life of the radioisotopes, also efficient cross-section is depending on it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, that\u0027s the smallest level when this works - if you go into elementary particles transformations it really gets into clear considerations about energy and quantum numbers.

If you are describing quarks in a particle, it\u0027s really no use to talk about particles and interactions when the resulting mass is so much different, not to mention even heavier interaction carriers that appear and disappear all the time.

When gravity pulls down on the gyro, the torque at the arm/tower pivot acting on the gyro gets deflected 90 degrees, applying a torque at the gyro along a vertical axis. But given that the CoM of the arm is out towards the gyro, and the base\u002Btower appears to be symmetrical, the axis of rotation of the whole thing is off the center of the base - at the center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is nothing anomalous going on here, and there are plenty of videos and information linked on that site that demonstrates the behavior of gyroscopes - all of which precisely follow established laws of motion.
