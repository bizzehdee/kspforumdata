But apparently (I can\u0027t find the exact source, other than the Apogee Space video which mentioned it), with the Commercial LEO Destinations program NASA is running to fund a successor to the ISS, one of the \u0027stretch goals\u0027 for contractors is adding artificial gravity. Now, I don\u0027t know if any are actually planning that (aside from outside companies like Vast Space), but I\u0027ve been thinking over the last couple days, what they\u0027ll need if they do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome of the biggest concerns of weightlessness is bone density loss and muscle atrophy, so to counter it, Astronuats either need to exercise regularly, and missions can\u0027t last more than a year, or they need artificial gravity. We don\u0027t know how low is acceptable yet, or can at least mitigate health issues, but in either case, are there studies or plans on how to interface between a rotating and non rotating section? Not academic, but a Fn\u002BF search on Atomic Rocket\u0027s section for artificial gravity didn\u0027t turn up anything either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m also looking at it from the view of adding comfort and convenience for the Astronauts. It\u0027s not hard to imagine, that beyond crew quarters, a gym, rec area, and a low gravity research lab, there may\u00A0 also be a kitchen/cafeteria, bathrooms, and showers. But then the question becomes, what happens to the gray/waste water? And how do you pump clean water back in? Rigid pipes are obviously out of the question, but would collection areas around the circumference of the non-rotating module work, funneling to several different pipes? After that though, how do you make sure the sealant is good enough to prevent cross contaimination? How do you access it for maintainence//cleaning/repair?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould it be \u0027easier\u0027 to just use tanks that can be replaced every time they get full/emptied, carried in and out by Astronauts? Or don\u0027t bother with plumbing at all, and continue using zero-g toilets, showers, and kitchens?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-01-27T02:33:26Z\u0022 title=\u002201/27/2024 02:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jan 27\u0022\u003EJanuary 27\u003C/time\u003E by Spaceception\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-26T18:40:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure some adaptations would be needed for space, but here\u0027s one way it\u0027s been done on Earth:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gisdyTBMNyQ?start=256\u0026amp;feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022I thought this rotating house was impossible.\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-26T19:12:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe video sample rotates in the plane, perpendicular to the gravity axis.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey don\u0027t need to move their wastes up to the zero-g level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCWR - centrifugal waste remover.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEveryone opens a hatch in the floor, and the wastes fly away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe interesting part is the rotating part \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E balance, when they are walking around, or flushing the toilet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-26T20:12:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps the simplest, most foolproof way is to simply have the entire unit rotate, so no seals between moving parts are required.
