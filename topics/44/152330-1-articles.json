Dawn carries three NSTAR thrusters, but only runs one at a time. They are even \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.nasa.gov/images/content/682857main_dawn20120830-full.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eangled in different directions\u003C/a\u003E, and while they all gimbal, I doubt that more than two could realistically fire together anyways, even if the power was there (out in the asteroid belt, it isn\u0027t). Dawn was built in part to push endurance limits, so the designers thought it prudent to include redundancy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlmost all electric engines suffer from electrode erosion. Gridded thrusters like the NSTAR for example constantly see the acceleration grids get hit by the very ions they accelerate, which damages them over time. When Dawn was built no one could predict with a small enough confidence interval how long exactly a single thruster grid might survive. Another bonus in the VASIMR\u0027s book: that one\u0027s an \u003Cem\u003Eelectrodeless\u003C/em\u003E thruster and therefore doesn\u0027t suffer this erosion issue. Electrodeless plasma thrusters are the hip thing nowadays and Ad Astra aren\u0027t the only people designing one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIncidentally, it was wise foresight to include multiple engines, because it turned out that Dawn needed them. It had to switch engines twice. Amusingly, neither of these events was because of a burned-out grid... those seem to have survived much better than expected. But, in 2014 while enroute to Ceres, Dawn lost an engine controller to a cosmic ray strike. I\u0027m not sure if it was recovered later, but Dawn continued onwards with a different engine anyways. Then, in 2015 while lowering its orbit around Ceres, that engine\u0027s mechanical gimbal system developed a problem, and they switched to the third engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-21T22:22:46Z\u0022 title=\u002211/21/2016 10:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-22T00:39:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222858864\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022152330\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221479723002\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002298962\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 hours ago, Streetwind said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut just Isp alone doesn\u0027t make a better engine.
