Just out of curiosity...How would that work? I mean, that\u0027s a pretty big plate to fill. There\u0027s lightning, volcanoes, tsunamis, tornados, and hurricanes. How would we be able to stop/cause natural disasters at will?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OtherDalfite","CreatedById":8317,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T07:23:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThings like volcanoes, tsunamis, and earthquakes, we probably wouldn\u0027t be able to stop. Earth makes those, and it uses a LOT of energy to do so. Hurricanes and other storms, we might be able to control, but that is pretty far in the future. We already sort of control it, but not entirely. Certain planes can be used to entice clouds to rain down. This is called \u0022cloud seeding\u0022. Small particles are left behind a aircraft flying through a cloud. Water droplets form on these dust particles and it begins raining. It\u0027s only used when there is a severe drought though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T11:37:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewe\u0027re already controlling the weather, to a degree, by seeding clouds, and inadvertently by placing cities, wind farms, and solar farms that cause wind and precipitation patterns to change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thought of direct weather control on a precise and large scale is exceedingly scary, as it would lead to major wars in which it can easily be used as a very powerful weapon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it became possible for example to create hurricanes and direct them, you could easily wipe out the coastal regions of another nation and there\u0027d be nothing to point to you as the cause.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd just imagine the fighting between tourist industry and farmers, the former wanting bright sunny weather, preferably hot, to draw more tourists and sell loads of icecream and cold drinks when the latter want more rain and cooler temperatures so their crops can grow better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
