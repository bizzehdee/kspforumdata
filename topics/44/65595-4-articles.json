They can also self-report damage through pain receptors and severed control nerve endings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe downsides come from needing to carry nutrient paste and life support systems, along with waste disposal systems, to keeps the legs from getting sick and/or dieing.

Units would need special considerations in food, fuel, and power supply logistics because now your combat armor can starve, and if the fuel goes out their legs die.
