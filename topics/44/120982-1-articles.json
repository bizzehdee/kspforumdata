There is often absorption below 215 nm that is non informative. The best spectral range is in the IR part of the spectrum, essentially wobble spectrum. Carbon-oxygen bonds and C-n bonds of various types absorb in this range. The KBr is transparent in this range. Crush your sample in a KBr powder and compress it into a disk which can be read between KBr disk. Process has been replaced by FITR, but dried solid translucent samples must stll be used.
