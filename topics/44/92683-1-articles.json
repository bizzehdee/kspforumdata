If this was not implemented, one side of the rocket would heat up very quickly because of its facing the sun; the other side would become very cold as it gradually radiated its heat into the ionosphere. This could cause problems in the long run, including having the rocket fail due to misalignments caused by one side expanding a little as it heats, and the other side contracting a little as it cools. Keeping the spacecraft at the same temperature by rolling it (like a piece of meat on a rotisserie) prevents these problems from cropping up, and thus is a good idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, not sure if this is the case.
