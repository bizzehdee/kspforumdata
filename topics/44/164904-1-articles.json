I have a physics degree and a masters in aerospace engineering and I haven\u0027t memorised these tables. What is a far better idea is to come up with a system that you can use to work out the answers to multiplication questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, when I come across a mental multiplication I need to do, I usually start by multiplying by either 5 or 10 (which I know instantly, since 10 times a number is easy and 5 times a number is just half of 10 times) and then adding or subtracting numbers from there. An example:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6 x 8? I could do this in two ways:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) 5 x 8 = 40 (that is the bit I can do easily, since 5 x 8 is just 10 x 8 (=80) /2), then I\u00A0add 8 to get 48.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) 6 x 10 = 60 (again, this is the easy bit), then subtract two lots of 6, (so\u00A012) to get 48.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Bare in mind that there are other methods for mental arithmetic that may work better for other people, this is just what works well for me.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis (or any other another method that works for you) also gives the ability to work out multiplications that are not included on the tables. For example, most grade school multiplication tables go up to 12 x 12 =144. So what happens if you want to do 13 x 16 and you have only memorised up to 12 x 12? For me I just add 10 x 13 (130) and 5 x 13\u00A0(65, 130 \u002B 65 = 195) and then add another 13\u00A0to get 208.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-30T09:11:47Z\u0022 title=\u002208/30/2017 09:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 30, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Steel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-30T10:05:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI remember learning the tables but echo what \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/49317-steel/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002249317\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/49317-steel/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Steel\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0said, memorising them isnt worth much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had a terrible time at university studying chemistry, approximately half the syllabus was understanding concepts (this part I could do), the other half was wrote memorisation. Many lectures consisted of nothing but copying down what was on the board for the full 50 mins, to be fully memorised.\u00A0So in exams, which would consist of say 5 questions for 20 marks each, I would get high (18-19-20) marks for some of\u00A0the questions and low (3-4-5) marks for those that relied on memorisation, giving me a very mixed bag of results. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dont have any tricks to combat the wrote memorisation, just that its a ubiquitous problem. People with good memory\u0027s have a great advantage. On the other hand, if you can understand the underlying concepts of a problem, you can figure out answers regardless of what you remember - not only that but you can make real headway even against problems that you havnt been taught a memorisable answer to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample: For biochemistry exams, we had to learn by heart the Krebs cycle - you literally didnt have to know \u00A0a thing about it, if you could reproduce the cycle diagram, you could score 18-19-20 out of 20 for that exam question. But if you understood some the chemistry, not only can you reproduce the cycle without memorising it 100%, but you also understand what is going on on a much deeper level, making concepts peripheral to this much easier to grasp as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere were a lot of people in my year who were not particularly good at chemistry, but were great at memorising things.

That\u0027s not what maths is about. Maths is more about pattern recognition, finding systems in apparent chaos, logical reasoning. Memorizing tables and algorithms is great if one wants to be a drone or a parrot but it is not key to get a grasp on maths. More important is to understand why an algorithm works. There are chemistry professors who can\u0027t remember Avogadro\u0027s number if their life depended on it but they are still great chemistry professors. You don\u0027t have to remember pi to the 20th decimal\u0027s place, you dont have to remember what 7x8 is. What you do need is the knowledge that is \u0022what is pi anyway and where can I look it up?\u0022, \u0022what is multiplication anyway?\u0022 and so on.

First step is to recognize that multiplication is nothing more than addition where all numbers you add up are the same number over and over. 3\u00A0x 5 = 5 \u002B 5 \u002B 5, all 5\u0027s, alternatively 3 \u002B 3 \u002B 3 \u002B 3 \u002B 3 which add\u00A0up to the exact same value of 15. Then recognize the value of a cumbersome value like for instance 19 as the easier to work with 20 minus 1, then recognize that if you add say 7 20\u0027s you will get 140 which means adding 7 19\u0027s instead lands you 1 short of 140 for every 19 you add. Since the number of 19\u0027s is 7, then you will end up 7 1\u0027s or 7\u00A0short of 140, or in other words 133.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-30T12:26:33Z\u0022 title=\u002208/30/2017 12:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 30, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by LN400\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-30T12:26:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould you count things in groups ?

I sat down with a stopwatch, pen, and paper, tested precisely how each of those things behaved in every possible situation, wrote everything down, and reverse-engineered entire game systems from that. I had forgotten nearly all I learned in school about algebra, convinced I would never again need it in my life - and suddenly I found myself in need of being able to build polynomial functions out of points of data, just because I was playing a videogame that excited me. So I went on the internet and re-learned a whole bunch of stuff.

That\u0027s not what maths is about. Maths is more about pattern recognition, finding systems in apparent chaos, logical reasoning. Memorizing tables and algorithms is great if one wants to be a drone or a parrot but it is not key to get a grasp on maths. More important is to understand why an algorithm works. There are chemistry professors who can\u0027t remember Avogadro\u0027s number if their life depended on it but they are still great chemistry professors. You don\u0027t have to remember pi to the 20th decimal\u0027s place, you dont have to remember what 7x8 is. What you do need is the knowledge that is \u0022what is pi anyway and where can I look it up?\u0022, \u0022what is multiplication anyway?\u0022 and so on. Learn what all the words, terms and symbols mean and let go of the tables.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for tips: Say for instance you want to become better at mental arithmetics and you would like to practice multiplication. First step is to recognize that multiplication is nothing more than addition where all numbers you add up are the same number over and over. 3\u00A0x 5 = 5 \u002B 5 \u002B 5, all 5\u0027s, alternatively 3 \u002B 3 \u002B 3 \u002B 3 \u002B 3 which add\u00A0up to the exact same value of 15. Then recognize the value of a cumbersome value like for instance 19 as the easier to work with 20 minus 1, then recognize that if you add say 7 20\u0027s you will get 140 which means adding 7 19\u0027s instead lands you 1 short of 140 for every 19 you add. Since the number of 19\u0027s is 7, then you will end up 7 1\u0027s or 7\u00A0short of 140, or in other words 133.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing to remember is that mathematically speaking, constants are boring.\u00A0 You can simply replace them with a variable name and proceed to do whatever math you like with them (plus divide without fear that it is a zero [because you wouldn\u0027t write down a zero, you\u0027d just remove it]).\u00A0 Once you\u0027ve finished any algebra and higher math on the equation, then you can either plug your constants into a calculator or do any simple tricks that would speed things up (and since you should have a bunch of constants piled up, there should be more opportunities for tricks).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis might be a weird way to learn math, but if it works for you go for it.\u00A0 I remember in my engineering studies, plenty of my classmates had the opposite problem: stick a variable in the equations such that they couldn\u0027t mindlessly plug it in a calculator (it was a long time ago) and they panicked.\u00A0 This is a much deeper problem than anything you have.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd comments about the mathematical unimportance of constants shouldn\u0027t be ignored.\u00A0 Mathematicians are said to have three numbers: \u0022zero, one, many\u0022 (no idea if they are the basis for Pterry\u0027s Trolls) and smbc has plenty of jokes about physicists rounding constants off to the nearest 10 (\u00225 is good enough for pi\u0022).\u00A0 This isn\u0027t to say that it isn\u0027t important to get the constants *right*, but plenty of STEM students get by with letting a calculator handle the all the constants (whether they learned their tables or not).\u00A0 But you certainly need to keep a placekeeper (one that looks and acts like a variable) in your equations, and you have to have your algebra (and to a lesser extent the rest of \u0022calculating math\u0022) cold to do so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pawelk198604","CreatedById":35539,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-31T14:37:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223161473\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022164904\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221504185260\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002298962\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Streetwind said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you\u0027re suffering from \u0022all the cool kids claim math is hard\u0022 syndrome, not any actual disability with numbers.

Math, that\u0027s what a player is to do. I sat down with a stopwatch, pen, and paper, tested precisely how each of those things behaved in every possible situation, wrote everything down, and reverse-engineered entire game systems from that. I had forgotten nearly all I learned in school about algebra, convinced I would never again need it in my life - and suddenly I found myself in need of being able to build polynomial functions out of points of data, just because I was playing a videogame that excited me. So I went on the internet and re-learned a whole bunch of stuff.
