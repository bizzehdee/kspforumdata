On older planes, decision to make them nose-heavy was down to stability. Nose-heavy aircraft will naturally dive if speed is too low, or pitch up if speed is too high. So once you\u0027re trimmed, any changes in thrust will simply result in a climb or descent. In contrast, a tail-heavy aircraft is inherently unstable. It has tendency to dive or stall, and the pilot has to constantly fight the controls. On a fly-by-wire jet, this fighting can be shifted over to the computer. The aircraft is \u003Cem\u003Edesigned\u003C/em\u003E to be completely unstable and uncontrolable without the computer doing constant fine adjustments to all the control surfaces. This has an entire host of benefits. First, the tail on such an aircraft is lifting, not dragging. So the net drag is lower for the same lift. Maneuverability is higher, since aircraft has natural tendency to pitch over. And finally, for the same reason, the response time between pilot\u0027s input and plane actually turning is reduced. You get performance, precision, and maneuverability, all at the cost of needing a computer between the stick and the surfaces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yeah, canards exist essentially for the same reason, but it was basically just an attempt to get the same performance gains without needing a computer. On modern fighters, however, they serve a completely different purpose. While general aviation canards generate positive lift, fighter canards are designed to generate negative lift, just like a tail of a conventional aircraft. The purpose of this, again, is to make fighter less stable. This actually sacrifices performance for maneuverability, so it\u0027s mostly limited to experimental aircraft and a handful of European fighters. And its absence on US fighters is not due to stealth. F-15 is a perfect example of a pre-stealth aircraft that\u0027s designed to fly by wire. It is inherently unstable and tail-heavy. Both its wings and tail generate positive lift.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SomeGuy123","CreatedById":154263,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-01T08:15:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, ok, on the \u0022drone vs manned\u0022 fighters argument : it\u0027s kind of like the classic \u0022John Henry\u0022 story. \u00A0Right now, today, an apples to apples fight with a manned vs unmanned version of the\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Esame aircraft,\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0the manned fighter is probably better. \u00A0Partly this is because the aircraft aren\u0027t designed to take advantage of the things an unmanned fighter is capable of like high G turns. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the relatively near future, you could have hybrid systems. \u00A0Those fancy air combat maneuvering turns and other extreme maneuvers that we consider an essential part of \u0022dogfighting\u0022? \u00A0The drone could have cameras facing every direction, both infrared and visual light, and it would track the rough position of the enemy fighter it is dueling. \u00A0Humans would essentially pick from a menu which fancy maneuver to perform next, (\u0022do a barrel roll!\u0022), with the drone software using the exact position of the enemy aircraft, relative velocity, taking into account engine thrust, air pressure, air temperature, and automatically adjusting throttle/activating afterburner to perform the maneuver optimally. \u00A0 Basically just like how an aimbot that corrects for enemy position, movement, weapon spread, and bullet drop is a lot better than aiming manually in an FPS game. \u00A0So much better it\u0027s considered cheating...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHuman programmers and ace fighter pilots would work together to program these \u0022combat scripts\u0022. \u00A0It\u0027s not an AI, it\u0027s the drone executing a pre-planned maneuver, correcting for present conditions, flawlessly every time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other factor here is that since a pilot isn\u0027t onboard, you can manufacture the drone aircraft to shoddier standards. \u00A0A small increase in the probability of failure for each mission can be accompanied by a large reduction in manufacturing costs. \u00A0Another idea is that you\u0027d have 2 lines of aircraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou would have \u0022training\u0022 drones, manufactured to be maintainable and made of gold plated components. \u00A0These aircraft would be the ones you practice with when not using the simulator. \u00A0The other line would be the \u0022war\u0022 drones. \u00A0They would be sealed in packing cannisters, ready to go, sealed away from air and moisture and sunlight and everything else. \u00A0After about 10-20 years they would be considered \u0022expired\u0022 and you\u0027d unpack the drones and fly them, both to test the packing process, and then you\u0027d load them with live munitions and have them fight each other for real at somewhere like Fort Hood, so drone pilots can get practice with live weaponry. \u00A0The war drones would intentionally be expected to be an expendable weapon, capable of only 100 or so hours of operation or so, made to a cheap standard and you\u0027d consider a 10 or 20% post-storage failure rate to be fine. \u00A0You\u0027d plan on sometimes using the war drones on kamikaze missions where you would not bother to refuel them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-01T08:17:24Z\u0022 title=\u002212/01/2015 08:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SomeGuy123\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shynung","CreatedById":101096,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-01T08:47:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222302480\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022126676\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221448944641\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022127797\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bill Phil\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, Bill Phil said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thing is, the drone would send a request to do something to a nearby control center, which could be mobile.

All else being the same, F-16 has a number of advantages over Su-35 in pure air-to-air combat which while do not guarantee outcome will statistically weigh heavily in favor of F-16. A group of modernized F-15s will wipe out similar group of modern Su-35s almost certainly without losses.

If you want to bring up Syria here, would you please recall what Putin\u0027s response to downing of the Su-24 was? Did he order some Su-35s to protect Russian bombers? No, because that\u0027d be useless. He has ordered S-400 AA systems delivered to Syria. This was part of the Soviet doctrine as well.

I\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nagree that the US and Russia\u0027s use of aviation differ greatly. But claiming that one of the most modern jets on what is probably the world\u0027s 2nd or 3rd largest air force\u00A0\u00A0cannot destroy a single one of its (older) counterparts is quite ridiculous. If that were true, why would they even bother having anti-air missiles on Sukhois? And while an F-15 might prevail due to the advanced avionics, etc., it is simply not possible that it would be completely untouchable. Hell, it\u0027s not even stealth! And anyway, when has using aircraft by themselves without troops on the ground ever proved useful? Sure, it can\u00A0\u0022contain\u0022 or stop the advance of an enemy, but air strikes alone won\u0027t defeat an enemy (unless you carpet bomb or use nukes, but that is extremely unlikely to happen in any modern conflict).\u00A0This is also why every one bombing in Syria has some allies on the ground: Rebels for the US and Syrian Troops for Russia. Otherwise, airstrikes would just be a waste of money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-02T18:51:38Z\u0022 title=\u002212/02/2015 06:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by A35K\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-02T19:11:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApologies to the moderators, but I can see this thread going nowhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApply\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory\u003C/a\u003E to war.
