In fact, there are serious problems when two are even similar. \u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00A9\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 results in positive displacement, which just counters centrifugal force as gyro slowly precesses. However, the case where \u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 \u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00A9\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 is also entirely valid. Here, center of mass stays relatively put near the center, as the suspension point rapidly spins around. That\u0027s a case of a weak gyro, one which Momentus doesn\u0027t seem to even consider. But it is also a valid solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne should be able to guess that when \u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 ~ \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00A9\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2, the z and r are not colinear. That is a serious problem. As I\u0027ve mentioned near the start, we are ignoring torque on the gyro. That\u0027s perfectly fine so long as z and r have the same direction. There really is no torque. Gyro stays horizontal and continues to precess at a constant rate. But if orientation of z and r do not match, which is going to be the case for near-resonance or for a bad choice of parameters a and b, this assumption falls apart. worst part is that this torque will cause gyro to turn towards vertical. As that happens, center of mass lowers or rises, changing potential energy stored in gyro. As a result, you have energy exchange between pendulum and gyro. As I\u0027ve mentioned, it\u0027s similar to interaction in a double-pendulum and is chaotic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo general solution, for general starting conditions or general relation between \u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0 and \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00A9, is not available. But provided for a far-from-resonance condition and initial condition with minimal energy (\u0022no push\u0022), we do have an exact solution which does give us a fixed displacement provided here and in earlier posts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most important part to take from all of this is that it is \u003Cstrong\u003Eimpossible\u003C/strong\u003E to have oscillations with two different \u0022orbits\u0022. This is not a simple pendulum. There is \u003Cstrong\u003Eone\u003C/strong\u003E solution with a = b = 0. And any significant deviation from that, because \u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0 and \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00A9 do not match, result in a significant angle between z and r, causing gyro to do weird things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo again, there is \u003Cstrong\u003Eonly one\u003C/strong\u003E solution of the type Momentus wants to talk about, giving \u003Cstrong\u003Eunique\u003C/strong\u003E displacement, which he\u0027d be able to confirm if he actually bothered to do the experiment rather than be an annoying troll.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-30T12:30:42Z\u0022 title=\u002203/30/2014 12:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by K^2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Momentus","CreatedById":106081,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-30T13:52:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYet you refuse to do the experiment.

In fact, there are serious problems when two are even similar. \u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00A9\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 results in positive displacement, which just counters centrifugal force as gyro slowly precesses. However, the case where \u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 \u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00A9\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 is also entirely valid. Here, center of mass stays relatively put near the center, as the suspension point rapidly spins around. That\u0027s a case of a weak gyro, one which Momentus doesn\u0027t seem to even consider. But it is also a valid solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne should be able to guess that when \u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 ~ \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00A9\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2, the z and r are not colinear. That is a serious problem. As I\u0027ve mentioned near the start, we are ignoring torque on the gyro. That\u0027s perfectly fine so long as z and r have the same direction. There really is no torque. Gyro stays horizontal and continues to precess at a constant rate. But if orientation of z and r do not match, which is going to be the case for near-resonance or for a bad choice of parameters a and b, this assumption falls apart. worst part is that this torque will cause gyro to turn towards vertical. As that happens, center of mass lowers or rises, changing potential energy stored in gyro. As a result, you have energy exchange between pendulum and gyro. As I\u0027ve mentioned, it\u0027s similar to interaction in a double-pendulum and is chaotic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo general solution, for general starting conditions or general relation between \u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0 and \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00A9, is not available. But provided for a far-from-resonance condition and initial condition with minimal energy (\u0022no push\u0022), we do have an exact solution which does give us a fixed displacement provided here and in earlier posts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most important part to take from all of this is that it is \u003Cstrong\u003Eimpossible\u003C/strong\u003E to have oscillations with two different \u0022orbits\u0022. This is not a simple pendulum. There is \u003Cstrong\u003Eone\u003C/strong\u003E solution with a = b = 0. And any significant deviation from that, because \u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0 and \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00A9 do not match, result in a significant angle between z and r, causing gyro to do weird things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo again, there is \u003Cstrong\u003Eonly one\u003C/strong\u003E solution of the type Momentus wants to talk about, giving \u003Cstrong\u003Eunique\u003C/strong\u003E displacement, which he\u0027d be able to confirm if he actually bothered to do the experiment rather than be an annoying troll.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is an excellent analysis. Your conclusion that the Rotation of the gyro about its own centre of mass which is precession whilst moving with orbital motion of a pendulum means that in any situation, the behaviour must be chaotic - with the exception being when as you say \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00A9\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2=\u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2. - this gives the locked behaviour as when the moon orbits the earth. This is a complex interaction, difficult to explain, you did a good job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut and there has to be one I\u0027m sorry to say this not the way a gyro behaves.

When suspended on a string, it behaves as calculated within the wide limits of observational accuracy. Its slowest precession is about one revolution in two seconds, that\u0027s slow enough to be slower than the oscillation given the 40-50 cm rope length I used. Unfortunately, the bearings are crap and it drops down to resonant precession within about ten seconds, \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E swinging damps out then moves smoothly. Troll the internet, Google gyro pictures, there are no examples of the chaotic behaviour that should be there. No sarcasm. Your analysis is spot on, the behaviour should be chaotic. But it is not. I was trying to make that point when I said that taking a gyro that is in a stable orbit and shorten the string should result in change.\u003Cp\u003EMy insistence that the gyro is not pushed, is to ensure that no external force is applied to set the gyro in orbit. Under those conditions, the gyro should remain in the same position rotating (precessing) about its own C of G until some external force is transmitted along the string. For pure precession there is no conflict between the two modes because the C of G cannot move.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYet again this is not how a gyro behaves. No matter how carefully it is released the offset supported gyro will not simply precess about the C of G.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour careful and I hasten to say correct analysis of gyro behaviour is not the real world behaviour.

This has been dismissed as being due to a misunderstanding of the purpose of the experiment resulting in the heavy object being exchanged for the light one. Having done the experiment myself I know that this is not so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Gyroscope pendulum is another example where the analysis which is correct by the current paradigm does not predict the actual outcome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo start right at the beginning with a spinning gyro suspended from two strings. One string is burnt through leaving the gyro suspended, point of suspension directly above the point of attachment, distance from there to the Centre of mass d. The gyro couple transfers the reaction to support the weight and the gyro remains horizontal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe gyro precesses, which means that it turns about its own centre of gravity. It cannot displace itself. There must be an external force applied in direction of the displacement to accelerate the mass from rest. As the gyro is attached externally by the string, the displacing force must be provided by the string.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the string to provide a horizontal component of force, it must deviate from vertical. This should be visible, initially the gyro stays still then gradually accelerates as the subtended angle increases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is only after the string has provided this acceleration that the gyro can move in an orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a way to demonstrate this conclusively. At some point the ratio of d to L will be such that the horizontal force will be too small to displace the mass and the gyro will remain in position with the string circling around it. So, if L then is reduced, would the point of rotation move away from the Gyro?. Would it be a gradual process? Can L be fixed at a length such that the point of rotation would be at d/2? When does K^2\u0027s prediction become valid and z become determinate?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of those questions are theoretical. The problem is that it does not happen that way, there is no significant deviation from vertical and the gyro mass moves immediately, it is not accelerated by the string.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome thoughts rather than abuse would be different. Maybe make an effort to understand rather than chant the mantra, Momentus is stupid to think that known science could just possibly be wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMomentus .\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
