My chief complaint is that it is because ever sinse beginning folks have though of a SSTO as using one single chemical rocket burn from start to finish and this simple is not very effiecnt at all. My idea is with the SSME like 25 years ago SSTO started to be feasable when you look at most effient three dimensional solution I am presently suggesting. I have done the figures and came up with a one million GLOW rocket seven percent empty bit\u00A0over three percent useable payload thrust weight ratio 1.5/1 and nearly 10 kilometer/second burn out velocity too.

As far as I know, nobody is building or planning to build one of these, exactly because they are not efficient. What they are doing though, with the Skylon, is an SSTO that uses air-breathing engines for the first part of its flight until hypersonic\u00A0speeds, which means its rocket will need to provide much less d-V and fight against much less gravity and drag than in conventional rockets, where a rocket is used throughout the whole flight. As a result (I think) it will be able to use much less fuel per launch than a normal rocket. That\u0027s where its usefulness lies at, not to mention it is completely reusable, so unlike the Space Shuttle which dropped its main fuel tank, and then needed to be refitted, with the Skylon, technically all you have to do is refuel and do some checks and you\u0027re ready to go, like a normal airplane. This will result in much more frequent launch capabilities.

From moon we started SSTO. The higher Isp is why companies as Skylon and Escapedynamics think, they can build efficient SSTO.

As far as I know, nobody is building or planning to build one of these, exactly because they are not efficient. What they are doing though, with the Skylon, is an SSTO that uses air-breathing engines for the first part of its flight until hypersonic\u00A0speeds, which means its rocket will need to provide much less d-V and fight against much less gravity and drag than in conventional rockets, where a rocket is used throughout the whole flight. As a result (I think) it will be able to use much less fuel per launch than a normal rocket. That\u0027s where its usefulness lies at, not to mention it is completely reusable, so unlike the Space Shuttle which dropped its main fuel tank, and then needed to be refitted, with the Skylon, technically all you have to do is refuel and do some checks and you\u0027re ready to go, like a normal airplane. This will result in much more frequent launch capabilities. I\u0027m not sure, but I think another advantage may be that when it returns, it could use its airbreathing engines to actually fly, (but I\u0027m not sure if it will have enough fuel left).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s kind of two stages anyway, an air-breathing stage and a rocket stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-12T13:16:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222356137\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022129588\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221452459159\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022110849\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kaos\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 1/10/2016 at 0:52 PM, Kaos said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the technologies are far enough developed, the disadvantages of multistage would be bigger.
