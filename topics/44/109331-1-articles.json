The only time you won\u0027t get correct result is if I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E changes during flight.\n\nGravity in that equation is always 9.81. It\u0027s actually Earth\u0027s gravity, and comes from the fact that US Engineers were using pounds for both the weight and mass of the fuel. Because pounds of mass are always defined with respect to Earth\u0027s gravity, you always get that 9.81 factor in the I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E formula, rather than anything relating to local gravity. It\u0027s purely a units conversion factor and nothing more.\n\nSoviet engineers defined their specific impulse per mass of the fuel, so they don\u0027t have that 9.81 hanging around. Instead, if you read translations of any Soviet rocketry texts, you\u0027ll see I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E defined in m/s instead of s, and it is equal to effective exhaust velocity.

First, the correct way to write the rocket equation:\n\ndV = ln(Mstart / Mend) x V\u003Csub\u003Eex\u003C/sub\u003E.\n\nWhere V\u003Csub\u003Eex\u003C/sub\u003E is the rocket exhaust\u0027s velocity. If you throw rocks, actual velocity, if not the average of the gases that make up the exhaust. The thing is I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E, which is arbitrarily defined in seconds from the impulse equation... don\u0027t sweat it, just understand that it is a bogus unit kludged together for engineering purposes, and would be perfectly fine defined as I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E=V\u003Csub\u003Eex\u003C/sub\u003E/9,81.\n\nWhich means that equation will work always, everywhere, and that has still nothing to do with Earth\u0027s surface gravity.\n\nRune.

That way you retain the concept of mass flow, which **is** relevant everywhere, and doesn\u0027t depend upon the local properties of one particular planet, and at the same time lets European and American engineers understand each other. When he hears Isp = 250, the European multiplies by 9.8 to get the exhaust velocity in meters per second, while the American does the same with 32.2 and comes out with feet per second. (**When** will the U.S. ever change over to MKS?!)\n\nProbably if the US had metricized, we\u0027d be using exhaust velocity (thankfully, we abandoned the WW2 German convention of \u0022specific propellant consumption\u0022, the reciprocal of specific impulse). But that hasn\u0027t happened, and now we\u0027re probably stuck with Isp for historical reasons even if we do go metric."},{"CreatedByName":"Agate","CreatedById":26773,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T02:36:13Z","Content":"The fact that \u0022seconds\u0022 is the only unit metric and American units have in common is not a good reason to use Isp.
