It just needs to move at a good pace.\u003Cp\u003E2.) No, the legs are armored as well, and the \u0022arms\u0022 are really just extra turrets. Now, the leg support structure is built into the armor for the most part, but has enough support from the skeleton to at least keep it from getting knocked over instantly (however the extra hole might just actually add stability, as if it\u0027s not a HE round, it will either get blocked, because it\u0027s small, or it just goes through, now I know this means it is susceptible to HE rounds, but so are a lot of other vehicles)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) I know, I\u0027m just saying you\u0027re comparing a geared human-powered vehicle to a human. And by better I mean use better comparisons, such as a tanks drivetrain compared to the mech\u0027s hydraulics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.) I said that area just as an example. And because no one has actually built the proper system for moving the mech or the mech yet, than it is reasonable to assume that it might be decent enough to do the same as the tank. BTW Abrams can only go about 40 kph to 67 kph. 67 on road. Pretty slow as well, compared to other vehicles. 40 kph is off road, very slow, and even a small legged vehicle (Boston Dynamic\u0027s \u0022cheetah\u0022) has gone faster/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.) I never said a C64 is controlling the legs, I said it is akin to a C64, in that a simple computer (compared to today\u0027s standards, which goes to my point that it is not \u0022in the far off future\u0022) can compute a trajectory to the moon easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. It will be slower than the equivalent tank, so easier to hit and more vulnerable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. So we\u0027re back to armored legs and the mech having less armor to protect its vitals, and the heavier armored legs are harder to move so the mech is even slower. OK.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I\u0027m open to what you think a better comparison would be, especially as you feel my comparison of biologically powered legs to biologically powered wheels is somehow not analagous to mechanically powered legs and wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. I don\u0027t think the cheetah can do 40kph offroad, and an equivalent, unarmored wheeled vehicle like an ATV will be significantly faster over all but the most difficult terrain. Bipedal motion is just inefficient, there\u0027s no way to handwave that away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.

The hits in the \u0022empty\u0022 space are analogous to hits to the limbs of the mech, which even if mostly empty will suffer damage to the structure (monocoques like you describe rely on the skin continuity for strength) as well as the control mechanisms for those limbs. This will seriously impede the mechs ability to continue battle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Hits to the non-critical areas of the mech are complete misses against the tank, which can only be an advantage for the tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I could fold my paper over itself to a greater thickness since I\u0027m covering less area, so the paper has a better chance of stopping any hit to the critical area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Even if 3 above wasn\u0027t true, the critical areas of both objects is equal, but the mech has all that other area where, deny it as you might, hits will affect it. Thus the mech is more vulnerable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Your example doesn\u0027t take into account that the critical area on the tank is low to the ground and more easily hidden behind cover (cover that protects a mech\u0027s legs leaving its torso exposed will protect the everything but the turret of a tank, with no compromise to the tanks ability to maneuver as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KASASpace","CreatedById":71352,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-22T02:53:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E3.
