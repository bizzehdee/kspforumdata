The pair of fixed air augmentation ducts should increase the specific impulse enough to effectively zero out gravity drag and aerodynamic drag and give the Merlin 1Ds an average specific impulse equal to the Merlin 1D vacuum specific impulse. Kerolox is fairly dense so the craft is small, but heavy at 128 tonnes in only a 22-meter-long ship. HTOL requires pretty heavy landing gear, which increases dry mass, but thanks to the small overall size the payload fraction remains close to 1:1 with a total mass to LEO of 6 tonnes. Use VTOL with lighter landing gear and the payload mass jumps, but you lose the ability to take off and land from any large runway. You want to keep that in case you use this as an antipodal hypersonic suborbital transport.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRolling takeoff is to gain airflow through the augmentation ducts, not build up speed for aerodynamic lift.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPayload looks like it should be just about enough for a 7-crew ISS ferry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"todofwar","CreatedById":160465,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-27T16:47:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat about coming back?

Now with a 100000kg vehicle that results in only 4000kg to play around in between payload and structure which really isn\u0027t feasible for most systems where you might be able to maintain a 500-1000kg payload. For a hydrolox system which may have an average of 4200m/s or so effective velocity which would allow you 10%-11% non-propellant fraction. However, for a hydrolox system about 10% of your vehicle will be structural mass. The Aquarius launch vehicle was proposed for SSTO using hydrolox and would have had a wet mass of 130000kg, a dry mass of 10000kg and only maintained a payload of 1000kg. Of course you can use techniques to\u00A0try to reduce the structural mass which would allow a higher payload mass like higher density propellant or composite materials, but there are many circumstances where that may not be available such as with the cryosystems used on many launch vehicles. You can of course try to increase the specific impulse which air augmentation like you are describing may be able to or through other means but ultimately you are limited. The large ducts for air augmentation are also quite heavy which will further ear into your payload fraction. At this point, your idea needs more development and numbers associated with it before any analysis of the system can really be done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Exoscientist","CreatedById":27117,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-29T08:53:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222543619\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138268\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461774359\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157695\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sevenperforce\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn April 27, 2016 at 0:25 PM, sevenperforce said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpecific impulse isn\u0027t nearly as important for SSTO designs as impulse density is...you can pretty much send the impulse density as high as you want as long as your engine T/W ratio is good enough.

The pair of fixed air augmentation ducts should increase the specific impulse enough to effectively zero out gravity drag and aerodynamic drag and give the Merlin 1Ds an average specific impulse equal to the Merlin 1D vacuum specific impulse. Kerolox is fairly dense so the craft is small, but heavy at 128 tonnes in only a 22-meter-long ship. HTOL requires pretty heavy landing gear, which increases dry mass, but thanks to the small overall size the payload fraction remains close to 1:1 with a total mass to LEO of 6 tonnes. Use VTOL with lighter landing gear and the payload mass jumps, but you lose the ability to take off and land from any large runway.

The net exhaust velocity drops, but the thrust increases because you are using the same kinetic energy with a greater mass flow. Most importantly, this new mass flow doesn\u0027t have to be carried by the rocket, so the thrust-specific fuel consumption drops, causing specific impulse to skyrocket. Even with just a simple tapering cylindrical stainless steel shroud, static thrust goes up by 15% and thrust at speed goes up by 50%, without requiring any additional fuel.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222551791\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138268\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462059300\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022133850\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022wumpus\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 hours ago, wumpus said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll it needs are 2km/s (of actual speed provided by the first stage)\u00A0and vacuum and it handles the rest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d be worried about all the extraneous size. \u00A0I doubt that this entire structure could be anywhere near F9\u0027s second stage dry mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could probably streamline it a little better; integrate the ducting into the body a bit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I think I would cut landing gear down considerably since there really is no need for horizontal takeoff.
