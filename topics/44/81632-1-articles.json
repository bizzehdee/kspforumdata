I ve been looking a bit into the idea and it sounds quite amazing, stephen wolfram does an awesome job of explaining it in my opinion, but I wanted to know what you guys thought of it as it would reject both randomness and a continuous time.Thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mardlamock","CreatedById":38972,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-14T03:25:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo one? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-14T03:37:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried to get into this topic before, but it always ends up with me going like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4LGpnDE.gif\u0022 alt=\u00224LGpnDE.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think there have been some threads about this before.

And everything observable is just \u0022froth\u0022 on top, that cannot go to a lower level because it\u0027s already full (exceptions are matter-antimatter annihilations). That fundamental BEC then is the substrate by which metrics express the universal constants, and through which EM propagates, very much like the good ol\u0027 Ether stuff from the past, but is also the cause of inertia and gravity by inducing resistance to acceleration proportional to mass.
