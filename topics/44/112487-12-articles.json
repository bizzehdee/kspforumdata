So what does this mean\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BF Well, in layman\u0027s terms, you need on average less symbols to express the same thing.\n\nUnderstanding why needs a bit of explanation:\n\nThere is something called scale-invariance which is true for (almost) all sizes (significantly above quantum and below relativity). It amounts to the fact that for any fixed c\u003E1 (c=10 is standard, but any other like c=2 or c=pi work equally well), things of size x and size cx are equally likely. A bit more mathematically: probability is equally distributed on a logarithmic scale. The reason from physics is the scale-invariance of its laws.\n\nThis has some paradoxical effects: a majority of sizes, lengths, areas, volumes you encounter will start with a 1, 2 or 3 (in base 10); already around 48% start with 1 or 2. This is true regardless of the units used, as long as you use the very same unit each time, be it meter, yard or miles.\n\nCall such unit u. So if we let c be the square root of 10, then something of size in [u,cu] happens as often as something of size in [cu,c\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2u] = [cu,10u]. Thus for numbers between u and 10u, being below cu is as likely as being above it. But c is roughly 3.16 and surely lower than 4. So a majority of numbers is between u and 4u, in othe words start with 1, 2 or 3.\n\nIf you want to know more details look at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law).\n\nIn the end, this implies that a system of several units (..., \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B5m, mm, m, km, Mm, ... versus ..., foot, yard, mile, ...) works best if they are equally spaced apart. This is true for metric, and also for the digital prefixes, but not for imperial.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E A kilometer is not a unit. It\u0027s short for One Thousand Meters. The unit is meters, with a prefix telling you how many.\n\u003E I could say kilo yards, and people who know what kilo and yard mean will probably understand it. That\u0027s a thousand yards.\n\u003E \n\u003E There just happens to also be many other units of distance in imperial, and that\u0027s where complication starts.\n\nAnd that\u0027s exactly where metric is better: Occam\u0027s Razor (extended to other things than hypotheses/theories). It uses a smaller amount of basic units (but not minimal, e.g. there are litres and cubic metres; the former is thus quite redundant) and then simply adds the prefixes (that also exist in other systems) to it."},{"CreatedByName":"SuperFastJellyfish","CreatedById":57985,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T21:53:08Z","Content":"\u0022We choose to use imperial measurements not because they are easy, but because they are hard.\u0022\n\n-JFK"},{"CreatedByName":"linkxsc","CreatedById":67350,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T23:38:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s a pretty big way that it\u0027s more base ten though! 12 inches to a foot, 3 feet to a yard, 1700-odd yards to a mile.

(Guess it wasnt units tracking though, more of prefixes)\n\nAlso this thread is about should the US switch. Not about the differences between the systems.\n\nThe thread is derailed though from the initial point though into a contest of \u0022our system is better\u0022 because officially, we are metric already. \n\nThe changeover is already happening and has been gradually going for years.\n\nWonder how long itll be till the world stops using 40ftx8ft shipping containers though, filled with 4ftx4ft palates (which on the note of that barrel thing. You can fit 4 of on a palate for shipping)"},{"CreatedByName":"peadar1987","CreatedById":81207,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T09:22:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Excuse me while I sit and contemplate why I would ever need to know the inches in 463 miles. Or converting tons/sq foot to sq in. \n\u003E Ps its 2 ton/in sq took all of about a 3rd of a second to get. And FYI you rarely ever judge things like that. More realistically would be lbs per inch on a beam (figuring the moments and shear along a beam)\n\u003E \n\u003E Honestly I can throw any number of useless groupings of numbers out there to have you try and judge how easy math is.\n\u003E \n\u003E And all of these problems you all keep doing are easy round numbers.\n\u003E \n\u003E Try this on for size. Whats the volume of a cylinder 880mm tall, and 610mm in diameter?\n\nAre you an engineer? Strange unit conversions crop up all the time. Especially forces over areas, which are just stresses.\n\nYour cylinder question is pretty irrelevant. PI\\*r\\*r\\*h is a formula that will be nice, or horrible, depending on the specific numbers you plug into it, regardless of how many inches are in a cubit. Where it starts to be a problem is when you need to know how many cubic inches are in a gallon, which is the sort of problem that would come up if you were trying to fill a large volume using containers of a smaller volume (a very common situation).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Aha but see heres what im trying to get across. You arent going to be calculating the volume of that cylinder in your head now are you. You\u0027re gonna break out a calculator, hash it out on paper. Or innately know that 610/880 is actually 24in/35in, and is a regular 55gallon(208l) drum.\n\nAnd if you have to convert cubic inches to gallons after working out the volume of the cylinder, it adds an extra layer of complexity over just shifting a decimal point. Adding in standard imperial drum sizes to remember only complicates things further. How many cubic feet to fill the 55 gallon drum? How many 55-gallon drums to fill a 40 cubic yard tank?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You didnt even pick up on that I answered the weight over area question wrong either. And then you make it better with your 2000/144. 288 tons per sq inch into lbs/sq ft is 288x144x2000= some big number in the ballpark of 80million lbs per ft. \n\u003E \n\u003E And even someone else figured it wrong at a glance.\n\nThe fact that it wasn\u0027t immediately obvious that your answer was wrong doesn\u0027t really support your point mate!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Whats the Hectograms per square Decimeter, of 980 kilopascals. (2 si prefexes that are about as arbitrary as furlongs per fortnight if you ask me, also the 980 is specific for tripping you up)\n\n980,000 N/m^2.\n\nDivide by 9.8 to get a mass: 100,000 kgf/m^2\n\nMultiply by (10\\*10) to get per decimetre: 1,000,000,000 kgf/dm^2\n\nDivide by 10 to convert kilograms to hectograms: 100,000,000 hgf/dm^2\n\nEasy. The 9.8 conversion factor from a force to a mass is the only time you don\u0027t just have to move a decimal point, and even then you can get to within 2% by doing so.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E But at no point in this will you be doing stuff in your head. And rarely (if ever) are you going to need this easy mental unit conversion.\n\u003E \n\u003E Any time any of this actually matters, is when doing any kind of serious math. And in the real world this isnt done in peoples heads. Because wether Im going from miles to feet, or kilometers to centemeters, its going to be done on paper, or a calculator. Because its just as easy to misplace a factor of 10 in mental math as it is a factor of 12, 5280, or a 2.54\n\nAnd even on paper, it\u0027s easier to just hop a few places with your pencil to signify a factor of 10 conversion than it is to do a full long multiplication, or even to plug a value into your calculator."}]}
