People have been looking into it for a while. The net energy is still positive. It\u0027s a bit like having a bubble in a glass of water. The bubble behaves as if it has negative weight, but it doesn\u0027t make the glass lighter. But there appear to be ways to make it work for the warp drive. A lot of this is still in the air, because math for anything beyond the basic Alcubierre Drive is very hairy. But there is also a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of progress being made. When Alcubierre\u0027s paper was published, the estimates for the energy were greater than mass of observable universe. With some improvements, people shaved it down to a large planet. Latest research manages to use oscillating field to drop this estimates to less than a ton, and that\u0027s a quantity of energy we can comprehend. It\u0027s still more than we can produce in a controlled fashion, but we\u0027re getting there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe math, though... It\u0027s honestly not that bad, but it requires a lot of background. I mean, the fundamental equation is just ADM metric with some parameters. Once you know the metric, it\u0027s just algebra to compute required energy densities. And relationship between parametrization of the metric and trajectory of the ship has already been worked out for you. So it\u0027s just plugging numbers into the equations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding why all of that works, or being able to derive variations on the drive, requires thorough understanding of General Relativity. Without getting into specifics, what allows it to work is the fact that speed of light is a local limit. Two things close to each other cannot move faster than c with respect to each other. But once you have sufficient separation, this is no longer true. You can absorb superluminal motion into coordinate system choice, and this gives you space-time curvature with specific energy density distributions as a consequence. In other words, by achieving this specific energy distribution, you force the desired metric, and then your ship can go as fast as you like relative to remote objects. Understanding Yang-Mills and Noether\u0027s Theorem helps to see why these things are related in such a way, but not, strictly speaking, necessary. You can understand almost all of GR from perspective of differential geometry without diving into underlying field theory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to learn the actual math and understand how all of this works, you should start with Linear Algebra, learn Calculus, some Analysis would help, Differential Equations, Topology, and just the basics of Differential Geometry.

Unfortunately, when we try to predict how much, we end up with a value that is in disagreement with cosmological models by many orders of magnitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. Actually, the more puzzling question is why we \u003Cem\u003Edon\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E observe negative energy. The only requirement from field theory is that the stress-energy tensor is a conserved current. In non-relativistic limit, that means energy, momentum, and angular momentum are conserved. But it places no restrictions on the sign. In fact, we have no trouble giving momentum or angular momentum any direction we wish. It\u0027s only the energy component, which is associated with time-direction, that insists on being positive definite for some reason. A blind stab in the dark is that it is related to direction of time flow, but that only makes the whole thing more convoluted.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-11T09:36:22Z\u0022 title=\u002212/11/2013 09:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by K^2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OrtwinS","CreatedById":19144,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-11T10:23:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMap time matches ship\u0027s proper time under warp.

Moreover, from a good popular description they\u0027d be able to workout almost all of it for themselves. They wouldn\u0027t be able to build one, but they\u0027d know how it works. Theoretical physics is way, way ahead of technology. Yes, if we start talking about what\u0027s possible and not, we\u0027ll probably be trying to figure out how to fire a rocket out of a cannon.

The conceptual framework for that stuff only came around in the 20th century. Sometimes the engineering follows pretty hard on the heels of the theory, sometimes it takes centuries.
