Think about it as running in a train that\u0027s stationary vs running in a train that\u0027s moving. In both cases you move the same speed relative to the train but you move faster relative to the ground in the latter case. Same thing goes for the Oberth effect, it\u0027ll work better when you try to do an escape burn from a body at periapsis because you benefit more from the solar oberth effect at that point. But in practice you don\u0027t have to worry too much about this. It is a miniscule effect for planets as in KSP or Real Life with their almost circular orbits. Unless you try to escape an orbit around a comet I wouldn\u0027t worry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-24T19:23:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EObereth effect is a 2-body phenomenon, so n-body effects have to be accounted for separetely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, ship\u0027s total energy is conserved in barycentric coordinates.

You\u0027ll have most energy if you perform the burn at periapsis around the planet, while the planet is at its own periapsis.

I don\u0027t know exact reason for Oberth effect, but I would guess energy conservation. The lower you are, the faster you go, the more kinetic energy you will get by spending the same dV (because kinetic energy is proportional to velocity squared), and the more of it may be converted into potential energy, giving you the increase in AP height.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UH60guy","CreatedById":77959,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-26T18:19:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Wikipedia page has two paragraphs that sum it up quite nicely:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[snip]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERocket engines produce the same force regardless of their velocity. A rocket acting on a fixed object, as in a static firing, does no useful work at all; the rocket\u0027s stored energy is entirely expended on accelerating its propellant to hypersonic speed. But when the rocket moves, its thrust acts through the distance it moves. Force acting through a distance is the definition of mechanical energy or work. So the farther the rocket and payload move during the burn, (i.e. the faster they move), the greater the kinetic energy imparted to the rocket and its payload and the less to its exhaust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may seem that the rocket is getting energy for free, which would violate conservation of energy. However, any gain to the rocket\u0027s energy is balanced by an equal decrease in the energy the exhaust is left with. When expended lower in the gravitational field, even if the exhaust is left with more kinetic energy, it is left with less total energy. The effect would be even stronger if the exhaust speed could be made equal to the speed of the rocket, then the exhaust would be left without kinetic energy, so the total energy of the exhaust would be as low as its potential energy. Contrast this to the situation of static firing: as the speed of the engine is zero its specific energy does not increase at all, with all chemical energy of the fuel being converted to the exhaust\u0027s kinetic energy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chickstick","CreatedById":98419,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T19:04:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TonboIV\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TonboIV\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EActually no.

Look at it this way: Your 5 tonne spacecraft orbits Kerbin at 2500m/s at 77km altitude. (numbers out my arse, for example only) If you want to dock a 3 ton spacecraft with it, you\u0027ll need to bring it up to 77km altitude as well, and match velocity with the target at 2500m/s.
