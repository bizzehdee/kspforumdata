The format would be a reality show where a bunch of people sit around inside some Dragon capsules doing not very much. People would get bored of watching that pretty quickly IMO, even if there was the occasional EVA. Once people got used to seeing people walk around in what is essentially a big red carpark interest would nosedive. Only a hardcore geek minority (the kind who religiously follow the activities of the current rovers on Mars) would bother watching, and that\u0027s not an audience big enough to fund resupply missions. Even if it was a popular as Big Brother it wouldn\u0027t cut it, as audiences for actual Big Brother have dropped off sharply after a few years, and that\u0027s with them being able to refresh the format occasionally.
