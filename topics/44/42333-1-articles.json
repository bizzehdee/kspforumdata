And that is if the valve to open was large enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen a tank of two component liquid fuel get a catastrophic leak, if it is not pressurised, the result depends on wether or not both fuel and oxidizer leaks, or just one. Where it is, if the leak is enlarging or not, if there are any hot or birning surfaces nearby, etc. Etc. Opening valves to release more fuel/oxidizer into the environment might not be such a good idea. The longer a catastrophic disassembly can be staved off, the further away a crewed capsule can get before the remaining fuel goes kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
