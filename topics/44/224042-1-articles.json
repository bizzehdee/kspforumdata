A similar magnetohydrodynamic dynamo process produces even more intense transient fields during coalescence of pairs of neutron stars.[17] But another theory is that they simply result from the collapse of stars with unusually strong magnetic fields.[18]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuestions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Has anyone tried to generate a magnetic field by rotating molten iron?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Do you think we could develop uber magnetic fields with magnetohydrodynamics, or is it simply a matter of mass, meaning more mass applied allows for stronger fields etc as in the case of magnetars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInterestingly in pulse pure fusion detonation research, uber magnetic fields have been created, albeit only momentarily. So it seems you either need a ton of mass or a lot of energy, because mass and energy are two sides of the same coin and are interchangeable and convertible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RCgothic","CreatedById":132560,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-03-10T08:30:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy 4th year project at university was research on the subject of generating ultra-high strength magnetic field with electromagnets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirstly, it needs a lot of windings. The more loops for a particular current, the higher the magnetic field. It doesn\u0027t seem to me that molten iron is especially condusive to compact windings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecondly, resistance tends to go with temperature, and specifically drops to zero in certain materials at ultra-low temperatures.There\u0027s a reason super-high power magnets are generally cooled with liquid gasses. Molten iron, again, is not condusive to a low conductive resistance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThirdly, the hoop-stress in the material is key factor. Magnets want to disassemble themselves and fly apart under extreme tension. Molten iron contributes nothing to the tensile strength of the material. The research found hoop stress was related to the thickness of the coil. Nesting multiple small coils could potentially keep the stress down. Again, Molten iron a pretty poor choice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EFinally, the reason planets can generate enormous magnetic fields is because they themselves are enormous. Just having rotating iron isn\u0027t sufficient, you\u0027d need to seed the iron with charge and/or a starting magnetic field somehow, and see above for all the reasons solid cold materials are a better choice for that.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EFor all the power of planetary magnetic fields, they\u0027re pretty inefficient for the masses involved. The right combination of eddy currents and movements eventually create a self-sustaining feedback loop that generates steady magnetic fields. But even sunspots are only ~3000 Gauss (Jupiter is about 4 Gauss). MRI machines regularly generate 70,000 Gauss, and we can create 450,000 Gauss steady state magnets in labs.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-03-10T08:32:59Z\u0022 title=\u002203/10/2024 08:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Mar 10\u0022\u003EMarch 10\u003C/time\u003E by RCgothic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-03-10T12:52:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA poorly cooled electromagnet becomes molten iron on its own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"farmerben","CreatedById":190194,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-03-10T12:59:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rAYW9n8i-C4?start=269\u0026amp;feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022Spinning Sphere of Molten Sodium\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AckSed","CreatedById":224249,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-03-10T14:28:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224371501\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224042\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221710075548\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022190194\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022farmerben\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, farmerben said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rAYW9n8i-C4?start=269\u0026amp;feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022Spinning Sphere of Molten Sodium\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImportant science to be sure, but...
