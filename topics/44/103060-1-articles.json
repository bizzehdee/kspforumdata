Obviously we want to eventually conquer the whole solar system, but how long will it be in-between the first landing on Mars to the first expeditions to other planets?\n\nLats say we get o Mars by 2030, as SpaceX hopes. I would suggest focusing all of our efforts on establishing a colony for at least ten years since Mars is the only place in the near-term where we could actually colonize. I would see the next planets visited by 2045-2050. We have several options:\n\nVenus, closer/easier to reach than other planets but there isn\u0027t much you can do there (high pressure/temperature and stuff).\n\nCeres, a little farther than Venus, probably not the best place to colonize due to low gravity.\n\nJupiter/Saturn, Could investigate Europa/Titan to see if life exists, but not as easy by far as Venus or Ceres.\n\nUranus/Neptune/Pluto, Not much there, really, but we should go there eventually.\n\nInterstellar, whoa, lets not get ahead of ourselves.\n\n(These are all listed in the order that I think we should do them, but that\u0027s just my opinion.)\n\nWhat do you think? How long should we focus on Mars before expanding further, and where should we go next?"},{"CreatedByName":"Reddragon","CreatedById":66937,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T19:44:34Z","Content":"I don\u0027t see too much potential in Venus.

However, I guess we could speculate on *where* we will go after Mars. To me, the most obvious choice would be Jupiter\u0027s moons, however they\u0027d be an incredible feat (DeltaV-wise, radiation-wise etc).\n\nOn *when* we will explore Jupiter\u0027s moons (but as I said it\u0027s impossible to say, really), I\u0027d say at least a century.

Its clouds, the place more similar to earth in the solar system.\n\nBut even landing on the surface of venus is much easier than mars, you dont even need parachutes, the atmosphere is so dense than a probe survive the landing with without parachute deploy due a malfunction.
