In retrospect, it makes sense that what should remain constant is the potential difference which accelerates the ions; the current required to sustain that difference should, of course, vary with the feed rate. I withdraw the question.\n\n-TC"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T23:14:21Z","Content":"To accelerate ions, you need first to create ions.

The ion engine orbits I\u0027ve seen are this crazy patchwork of turning the engines on and off.\n\nSpecifically, your exhaust velocity, thus Isp, depends on your grid voltage. Power is limited to what your solar panels can make - grid voltage times exhaust current (it\u0027s a charged flow) can\u0027t exceed this limit. So at max power, you trade off Isp for thrust. All ion engines can do this, which makes VASIMR less impressive.\n\nAlso, you tune your power plant size for the mission. There\u0027s no point in saving fuel if you end up needing a greater mass of solar panels to do so. Specific power (watts per kilogram) is what limits ion engine Isp.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-24T13:24:48Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2015 01:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by beabop**"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T14:50:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Any idea why it has to be very very expensive Xenon?\n\u003E Cheap stuff not good enough?\n\nXenon is a giant element, and a noble gas to boot. You can store and handle it super-conveniently at all sorts of temperatures, it comes into the engine as single atoms, and because of the sheer number of electrons it carries, stealing one in order to ionize it requires very little energy. And then, the heavy atom gives a (relatively) big \u0027push\u0027 when it is accelerated out the back.\n\nThese advantages, combined with the fact that you need only very small amounts because ion drives are so efficient, outweighs the disadvantage of high price in many cases. However, there are also electric engines in development that aim to run on other, cheaper noble gases, like Krypton. The VASIMR is such an engine."},{"CreatedByName":"T.C.","CreatedById":111697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T18:07:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Specifically, your exhaust velocity, thus Isp, depends on your grid voltage.

That seemed reasonable to me, because I assumed it would always be desirable to maximize Isp. And if you\u0027re keeping the voltage tuned for optimal Isp, then it may be technically correct, but nevertheless seems odd to say that you\u0027re adjusting the electrical level to throttle the engine. Thus, my initial question.\n\nIn reply, Beabop confirmed that Isp depends on the grid voltage, but also explained that ion engines intentionally trade off Isp for thrust. Therefore, there are two aspects to engine performance -- thrust and Isp -- and it makes sense that there must be two inputs -- feed rate and voltage -- to control the performance. It no longer seems odd to say that the electrical level can be adjusted to throttle the engine.\n\n-TC"},{"CreatedByName":"SomeGuy12","CreatedById":103022,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T15:35:17Z","Content":"Do you need either nobel gas?
