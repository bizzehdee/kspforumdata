So the whole thing becomes Sqrt(2 * G * M / a) = Sqrt(2 * 6.67x10^-11 * 2.5x10^30 / 2x10^5) = Sqrt(6.67*2.5x10^14) and that\u0027s roughly Sqrt(16x10^14) = 4x10^7.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t over-rely on calculators.

It\u0027s pretty obvious to anyone who does orbital mechanics regularly. The moment I saw your post about two spheres I knew what was going on. Maybe whoever made the key just didn\u0027t think of it as something requiring explanation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yeah, I can see how this can be confusing if you aren\u0027t used to it. When you have just two objects, -GmM/R is the TOTAL gravitational energy. You don\u0027t get -GmM/R per object, but rather for the whole system. There is a way to derive that, of course, but it requires a bit of algebra. So GMM/a - GMM/b is the amount of energy that will be shared between the two neutron stars in this problem right before impact. That means the kinetic energy of each object in CoM frame is going to be M(GM/a - GM/b)/2, and this gives velocity as sqrt(GM/a - GM/b). The factor of two goes away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should also keep in mind the fact that the equations you are using are from classical mechanics. The answer you get is almost a tenth of the speed of light. That should be a warning sign that classical equations are probably going to be wrong. And indeed, when computing velocities for collision with neutron star, especially if the thing colliding into it is another neutron star, you have to use equations from General Relativity. To be honest, I\u0027m not sure I\u0027d know where to start on solving this problem correct. I know how to solve for a small object, like an asteroid, striking a neutron star, and I know the equations I\u0027d use would alredy give me a different answer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
