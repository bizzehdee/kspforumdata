I just finished watching their video-presentation on the turbopump they are building for their TM65 engine, and it seems, well... large, heavy, and cumbersome. It then occurred to me that quite a few modern cars use a form of turbopump in their engines (a turbocharger) and I began to wonder if it would be possible to modify one of those for use in a rocket. People occasionally build jet engines out of them, so it doesn\u0027t seem *too* crazy of an idea. Frankly, I\u0027m surprised that I can\u0027t find anything online about doing such a thing. In the Suborbitals\u0027 video, their engine designer states that their turbopump can move 18-20 liters of propellant per second, increasing its pressure to 18 bars. If one attached a high pressure steam source to the turbo\u0027s exhaust inlet and the air inlet of the cold side to the outlet of a propellant tank, would it be possible to achieve performance anywhere close to that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe video I\u0027m referencing:\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/p6BC1QfA0Ug?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-18T06:30:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA turbocharger is designed to force and compress an airflow. Turbopump pumps liquid fuel. The pump and the charger are going to be very different, because they are designed around very different densities. Now, the turbine stage of the turbocharger you might be able to reuse for a turbopump. It\u0027s going to be a matter of torque and RPMs you need for both, but you could probably find a pump that will work with what you have on the turbocharger\u0027s turbine output. Fortunately, finding a centrifugal pump that would work is much easier than finding a turbine. There are a number of centrifugal water pumps used for irrigation and what not designed to be driven directly by an electric motor. That means high RPM and low torque, which is what you have from the turbine. I\u0027d check gardening and home improvement stores, then compare the specs you have on the turbocharger to these of the pump and try to find the best match.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt won\u0027t make a great turbopump, but as far as building something at home, that\u0027s probably your best bet. Of course, there\u0027s still the issue of driving the turbine, but that\u0027s a separate problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, for an early project, a turbopump is way overkill. If you don\u0027t have rocket-building experience, this is several levels of over your head. Start simple. I would recommend getting basics of solid fuel rocketry first. It\u0027s the sort of stuff that will explode but probably won\u0027t injure you unless you do something really stupid. Failures there will teach you how likely failures are and how to protect yourself from them. If and when you are ready to graduate to liquid fuels, again, start way simple. Build a pulse jet. Then try biprop rocket, but still just pressure-feeding the fuel and ox. Trust me, there are a lot of challenges just getting to such a stage. When you feel that you need more thrust than you can get with pressure-fed system, your first pump should be electric. Way, way safer and easier to scale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, if you really can\u0027t wait to make use of the turbines, you can try building a very basic turbojet out of a turbocharger using skills you learned building a pulse jet. Even here, I must stress, this shouldn\u0027t be your first project in propulsion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully, this gives you some sort of idea of just how much you\u0027re jumping the gun here by trying to figure out turbopump first.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-18T06:33:11Z\u0022 title=\u002202/18/2014 06:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by K^2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aghanim","CreatedById":76587,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-18T11:53:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to do a pulsejet, I suggest you go to this page: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.pulse-jets.com/valveless/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.pulse-jets.com/valveless/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd choose your valveless design.

Use a solid rocket motor (sugar and KNO3 is a good gas generator) to power your car turbocharger.
