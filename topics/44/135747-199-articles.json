Of the 82 in 2015, 21 were Chinese. Zero of those stop being Chinese. 3 or 4 were Japan... ditto. 24 were Russian launches of Russian payloads (I\u0027m counting ISS resupply, but not crew, since commercial crew will reduce those. I\u0027m not counting any launches with non-russian payloads included, we\u0027ll put those out for bid). 11 more are clearly nationalistic launches (Iran, etc) not up for grabs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo of 82 launches in 2015, 60 are completely off the table for SpaceX to have launched.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat leaves 12 launches up for grabs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-20T18:45:45Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2016 06:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by tater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-20T18:46:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what\u0027s the lower bound- Assuming fixed costs like employee salaries, facility upkeep and so on remain constant (and Elon just overworks the people he already has), and they\u00A0 spend literally nothing on inspections\u00A0 and checks over 80 launched cores (8 cores reused 10 times each- 20 FH launches and 20 F9), how much does SpaceX have to make per launch (on average)to break even?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-20T19:00:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps this is worth mentioning: I remember reading an article about Bigelow not too long ago (the guys who built the BEAM module that was just put on the station), they say their biggest stumbling block to further expansion at the moment is simple lack of manned launches.
