They have no welfare or social programs, and almost it\u0027s entire GDP is directed into a few hands. North Korea also happens to be amongst the largest black markets and the worlds biggest exporter of illegal drugs, which helps them get money. And then there is the foreign aid - although small and minimal due to them having bad relations with those sending the aid in the first place, it helps the country keep itself together and not collapse into famine and rebellion. Such an collapse would flood its neighbors with refugees and cause trouble, and the powers of the world don\u0027t want that. So for now, they somehow remain in power, or until it is more beneficial to their neighbors to let them just collapse than to keep them standing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll guess the North Korean Government spends up to around 20-35% of its GDP on the space program.

The United States, on the other hand, has to spread funding out amongst hundreds of agencies and programs, which divvies up the funds.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
