There is always interference from the test setup, despite how carefully designed it may be. It takes a lot of time and money do design out flaws, and even then we can only account for known sources of error. The only way to truely eliminate error due to the test setup, it to put the Cannae drive in space. Yes, if it breaks we may never know exactly why, but if it produces the same amount of thrust in space, we will finally know it\u0027s not test error.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-14T02:45:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://hackaday.com/2016/04/11/flying-the-infinite-improbability-drive/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://hackaday.com/2016/04/11/flying-the-infinite-improbability-drive/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso someone is making a tiny em drive that can fit in a cube sat. except this one is running at around 24 ghz instead of 2.4 ghz, which means the device can be much smaller and looks like its running some kind of solid state rf supply. it probibly wont work but a cube sat is approachable with a crowd funding campaign.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-14T02:57:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I ran across someone using Higgs particles to try and explain what is being \u0022pushed off of\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But the idea that there\u2019s a universal medium that light propagates in?

The transfer of momentum across empty space with a field other than light, which produces thrust at 300MW/N defined by the speed of light, such as the movement of electrons between orbits occurs through virtual particles, but up until now these transfer can only occur at distances of less than 10 hydrogen nuclei. At one nano meter this is certainly much greater than Planks length\u00A0and suggest that quantum distances can be skewed or chained to allow virtual transfers of non light propreties at much greater distances, possibly via the higgs mechanism.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe live in a sea of virtual particles, even empty space, without these we would not exist, rhings like bioluminescense, emmision spectrum would not exist. So I don\u0027t think we have to have cannae to justify these. But if Cannae was in a chamber and its ende pieces were a meter from the nearest mass and was able to push off of a wall of the chamber then it would be transferring momentum 9 magnitudes further than current quantum mechanics would allow. \u00A0This is concievably\u00A0possible if the pure theoretical diastance is 1.35E-35 and the observed limit is 1E-9, 9 additional magnitudes\u00A0is concievable, but there has to be a special context, this is not happening everywhere\u00A0or physics would be a mess. The drive does not seem to be especially interesting in what it does, the resonance wave\u00A0is enclosed in a copper bell. Are the electrons being forced by the drive to swing out the distance of the chamber and push off electrons in the metal?

But it is impossible to sort this out since we cannot removed\u00A0 electromagnetism, or even the influences of local space-time itself. Space is never truely empty at the level we can observe, and the level we could observe empty space is too small for our best instruments to observe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother way of treating the problem is to look at it like this. Once upon a time . . . . . . How do we get to our current state from a starting state based on a singularity.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe universe appears to have been bounded in a singularity where the quantum forces of that universe bound it, if such is true then space-time did not exist in any intelligible form, maybe not at all.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo now we have space-time, comoving reference frames, black holes, etc. Without space time there is no way to have gravity, thus quantum gravity is the only theoretical force (known force) that can possible bind the singularity together in an unfathomable energetic form.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut its now less bound, and has fathomable energy in the form of mass and EM, potential energy.\u00A0 This is an issue some have considered that other things need to be added to the standard model to be allowed to be unbound but have gravity communicate across the distances of the universe, quantum gravity maybe still with us, but the force it transmits is much smaller (or much less frequent). Its not the only problem\u003Cbr\u003E\nThus you need some means, other explanations are things like string theory and 11,13, etc dimensional space. I think what they are trying to argue is that the universe is still strung together, but less cohesively, and it may have been made less cohesive by the pouring of energy into the universe at the end of inflation and subsequently as dark energy. There is an argument that the Higgs and other particles that are similar in action are the reaction of quantum space fracturing into space-time, that the universe had to convert some of its unfathomable energy to Higgs once it fractured as a sort of residual binding or interaction medium. This goes hand in hand with an inflation, which could be thought as quantum space expanding and ultimately failing to remain a quantum state. If this were true then quantum length is quite stretchable with the right kind of energy/state, maybe creation of these Higgs/unknowns allows this. Presumably this is a very low probability event. Which is why I argue that a true reaction-less non-photon emitting drive should loose thrust as it moves away from push off mass.\u00A0 Theoretically it should do this at the distance of 1 atom, but we now see that these quantum fluctuations allow communication across distances a magnitude further away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe universe is still strung together, some aspects like wires (gravity communication), other aspects like local fibers in a viscous fluid (quantum shifts in electron potential about atoms) that is completely transparent to us, but it is much less cohesive than the singularity. We observe things like quantum entanglement (what Einstein euphemistically called spooky interaction at a distance), there is a postulate that quantum gravity may operate in a similar way. So here in lies the problem, if there is a complex fabric to space, then it is unlikely composed of one thing, and all the things would have non-zero energy rest state, because if you tug on them the right way, they will resist. For example, Higgs prevents mass from ever reaching the speed of light and gives mass inertia. The problem with this energy going into the ground state is it does not have to come in packets of 124 GeV, it could be anything, dark energy pouring into our universe, it could be causing rarely quantum fluctuations that are far more extreme than expected. There was another theory reported last year that some of these vacuum space fields might integrate present state (relative comoving velocity, age, etc) that would be like a universal GPS signal but is only randomly accessible through quantum states (sort of like a stretch tensor). Again many hypotheses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know the answer to the question, the problem with theory, as noted with string theory, is that you can ignore Occams razor an come up with really complicated scenarios, but without empirical evidence its pretty much that. I can give you a reasons why other force communicators might exist but proving they have the effect we want to explain a result, thats completely different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I will note that in or observation process we start with the earth being the center of the universe, In every generation there are people who are sure they got the theory right and say that naysayers are just grasping at artifacts. Kepler and Newton and contemporaries go onto to prove that we clearly are not, Newton replaces with his laws of thermodynamics. But Einstein replaces gravity with space-time and puts in a mass energy conversion, he thoroughly rips omnipotent reference frames and replaces them with relative reference frames. Then this all lasts about a decade and eventually is mostly explained with a quantum mechanical explanation in which relativity breaks down at the small levels (lately have been increasing in size). There is no great reason to believe that this is this is the end of the story, what we have done is created a consistency down to a level of observation much larger than our theory suggests the universe truly functions at, the quantum scale, which for the most part we can interpret effects, and hypothesize consistence behaviors.\u00A0 There are thousands of connotations to quantum mechanics we still have to work through, as a part of that process we might be avoiding inconsistencies for the sake of expediency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are many more hypotheses that never panned out than there are theories that actually held up to the test of time. The empirical test surprisingly come in strange forms, like the Cannae drive. Yes its pretty much true that things like this are generally the consequence of some overlooked artifact, but on rare occasion (like the double slit experiment) they are not. And so you have to keep testing these things until overlooked artifacts can or cannot explain them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-21T11:14:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA new theoretical explanation for the working of the Emdrive has been proposed\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601299/the-curious-link-between-the-fly-by-anomaly-and-the-impossible-emdrive-thruster/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.technologyreview.com/s/601299/the-curious-link-between-the-fly-by-anomaly-and-the-impossible-emdrive-thruster/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-21T11:49:45Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2016 11:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-21T12:16:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222527550\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002288197\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461237282\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022117389\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FreeThinker\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n50 minutes ago, FreeThinker said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA new theoretical explanation for the working of the Emdrive has been proposed\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601299/the-curious-link-between-the-fly-by-anomaly-and-the-impossible-emdrive-thruster/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.technologyreview.com/s/601299/the-curious-link-between-the-fly-by-anomaly-and-the-impossible-emdrive-thruster/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have come up with my own theory, The RF radiation creates a series of electron clouds inside the neck of the device.

Now obviously, don\u0027t expect hardcore physics discussions on a show that is just aiming to introduce the concept and potential impact of a propellantless drive to people who might not be familiar with it, but it was a decent overview of the topic. And it was very interesting to hear Dave talk about how he does his testing and what results he\u0027s been getting.
