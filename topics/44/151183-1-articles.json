Conversely, rockets using liquid hydrogen always have insulation, both because it boils off much more rapidly and because it creates much higher volumes of gas as it does. There have been cases of hydrolox stages rupturing after insulation issues, despite having pressure relief valves; the boil-off is so rapid it overwhelms the valve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starman4308","CreatedById":122674,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-30T22:19:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe external insulation thing isn\u0027t a huge deal; it\u0027s much cheaper and easier just to top the rocket off just before launch and retract the fuel pumps at the last possible moment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuring flight, well, some cryogenics can last through a flight with trivial boiloff without much insulation, but as others have mentioned: try to fly with liquid hydrogen and no insulation, and your rocket will swiftly have neither insulation nor liquid hydrogen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phineas Freak","CreatedById":146521,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-31T08:33:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor liquid Oxygen you do not need insulation, the ice formed on the surface of the tank is adequate.
