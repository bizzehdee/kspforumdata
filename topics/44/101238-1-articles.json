He gave some some information on T-2 which I will go over quickly;\n\nCurrently on target.\n\nLaunching in May or June 2016.\n\nIt will launch after the first LM-7 launch in April 2016 which will carry a mockup Tianzhou.\n\nIt will be followed by Shenzhou-11 most likely in July.\n\nIt contains a smaller version of T-3\u0027s life support system, this is much more regenerative and closed then T-1\u0027s and will mean that S-11 could stay for up to a month.\n\nS-12/13 will stay for longer, possibly up to 2-3 months.\n\nWill carry a new two-way docking port.\n\nHowever the most important thing he mentioned was that T-2 will carry a small prototype, biological closed cycle life support system based of the Yuegong-1 system, now it should be noted that the system is small and won\u0027t support the crew. It is merely an experiment for a larger life support system for T-3 or T-4. It is made up of only plants (no insects yet) and is hoped in the future it will be able to generate oxygen, remove CO2 and generate food.\n\nOverall progress is good, I do hope for success with the Closed cycle system though."},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T19:29:03Z","Content":"Very interesting.
