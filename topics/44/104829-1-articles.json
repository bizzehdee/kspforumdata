I was just bored and needed something to listen to, but down the line, I found myself looking up more paradoxes rather than doing what I was doing before. So it got me thinking, which as you all know, can be a dangerous thing. Why did I divert all my attention to this topic? As a matter of fact, why is anyone?\n\nCutting to the chase, why are we attracted to paradoxes? It\u0027s so counterintuitive. I mean, we wish to find answers to our questions. Why ask question that we can\u0027t get an answer to?\n\nIt\u0027s hard to really ask this, so here\u0027s an example: Temporal causality.\n\nIgnoring the fact that this isn\u0027t how time actually works, we get into that infinite loop of doom. The causality paradox states that, if you went back in time to kill yourself, you could never go back in time to kill yourself, as you would be dead. Seems like a simple conclusion, right? Alright, answer found. We can go home... guys?\n\nEven after reaching a reasonable conclusion, we still stay back to look at it. But... why? The answer is there... right? This is a bit of a paradox in itself.\n\nParadoxes that have no real answer are understandably interesting, but even so. Why do we pursue interest in a question that we know doesn\u0027t have a real answer? Endlessly pondering the question, and never getting closer to another side. Do we just enjoy the satisfaction of thinking about a question? Do we enjoy it because it asks for your opinion?\n\nSpeaking of which, I\u0027d like to hear your opinion. This is a bit of a paradox in itself.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-04T11:01:08Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2015 11:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xannari Ferrows**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T12:36:06Z","Content":"I think people like paradoxes so much because of the huuuuge scope of interpretation they can use. \n\nIf you have a wooden ship, and over time you replace one piece at a time with new parts, eventually you will have a collection of pieces of the original ship. Say you build another ship out of those pieces. Which is the original ship?\n\nI think paradoxes are interesting, again because of the interpretation. It\u0027s an infinite loop, which means there should thusly be an infinite number of ways to look at it. Sure, the ship made out of original parts is the original ship. But wait... It was the original ship you were replacing parts on.... So THAT one\u0027s the original ship!\n\nIt\u0027s just mind-boggling, and in fact I think that boggling quality is what gives paradoxes their appeal."},{"CreatedByName":"ZetaX","CreatedById":60692,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T12:53:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Cutting to the chase, why are we attracted to paradoxes?

Remember, that in the real world, everything just works together in some seemingly seamless way that leaves us wondering, and the only way we can refer to it is using language. Language cannot possibly describe reality to completeness, so it goes to the next best thing, which is approximation. Your thoughts are also a language to describe the world. So are mathematics. So in all, paradoxes exist only in our heads. They are interesting because they are a problem to solve, and where in reality we can use Action to create Consequence, in our heads, it\u0027s all pretty much fair game as to what follows what.

It might also have something to with the kind of brain activity it produces - I assume the brain is used to dealing with situations which have some kind of an end, so to speak, at which point it can turn off and move on to the next problem. Instead, you get caught in a loop for a little bit, which I imagine is quite stimulating for the brain, as then you have to look slightly outside the loop to get an understanding of what\u0027s actually happening.

Basically, there\u0027s psychology that points to avenues of human behaviour, and there is psychology that tries to create an algorithm of human behaviour. \u0022Traditional Wisdom\u0022 is passed down from person to person, but is ultimately flawed as it can be proven false.\n\nWe have all kinds of people trying to explain why people do what they do and no \u0022formula\u0022 ever describes us completely. We can point to what we are likely to do, but what about the why? TV will give us utterly flat characters and give them a basic motive. I killed my wife because she cheated on me. But....In season 2, the lead detective cheated on her husband; and her husband found out... why didn\u0027t he kill her? After all, we established \u0022cheating on wife = husband kills wife!\u0022\n\nSo the wife cheating on him wasn\u0027t the actual motive was it? Did the guy always want to kill his wife and the cheating was just an excuse? Did the guy suffer an incident in the past that resurfaced once he found out his wife was cheating...\n\nHumans are COMPLEX, you can never predict how someone is going to react. We can point at trends, show inconsistencies, but can never really come up with a fail proof way of saying if x then y.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-25T00:18:24Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2015 12:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fel**"},{"CreatedByName":"GluttonyReaper","CreatedById":59429,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T21:47:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Do you still have the whole \u0022if future cooper never warned past cooper\u0022 aspect?
