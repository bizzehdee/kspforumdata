Something around 1/3rd of your total mass on a Moon mission is JUST fuel to land safely and take off from the Moon again.

Of course, one big issue is people on Earth would be quite worried about the possibility of the accelerator being used to lob tons of metal like giant bullets at the Earth, so it is possible this could become legally infeasable (ex: An international law is put into place limiting the delta-V offered by a linear accelerator cannon to something that can never threaten Earth.
