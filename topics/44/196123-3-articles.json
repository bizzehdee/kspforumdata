for was supporting \u0022magical impacts\u0022.\u00A0\u00A0 Secondly, one of the links you provided was merely a question with some random answers, not a paper backing your hypothesis.\u00A0 These don\u0027t invalidate the hypothesis, but they do bring it under heavy scrutiny.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe method listed in your one paper is for creating fertilizer from sulfuric acid, which required a source of pure water.\u00A0\u00A0 This involves using N\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E gas to form the cold plasma, interacting with a sulfuric acid solution , resulting in the 2N binding with the freed 6H from the reaction to form 2NH\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003E, ammonia.\u00A0\u00A0 The ammonia would then be used to make fertilizer.\u00A0 Extra O\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E from this reaction appeared to be a byproduct and was off gassed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yes, if the paper can be trusted and the system fleshed out, this method is a more efficient method of electrolysis for separating Hydrogen and Oxygen from water, for the creation of ammonia used in fertilizer production.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe method requires a sulfuric acid solution.\u00A0\u00A0 This means any ship trying to employ this method would require the mechanisms to create sulfuric acid, since we are using sea water in our hypothesis.\u00A0\u00A0 This means more machinery, more energy, and a source of the sulfur, all of which takes up valuable cargo space.\u00A0\u00A0 Then you need pure water.\u00A0 Sea water is \u003Cem\u003Edirty\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Ships already have a method of desalinating water, but only for human consumption and the various machinery that requires it.\u00A0 The electrolysis you are trying to achieve would require a desalination plant on an industrial scale, again taking up more energy and valuable cargo space. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen we have the resulting Ammonia to deal with.\u00A0 Since the method requires using N\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E to form the plasma, we are forced to deal with the resulting ammonia.\u00A0 So now we need a method to again break up the NH\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003E into N and 3H.\u00A0 Again, more energy and valuable storage space.\u00A0 Dealing with the waste N\u003Csub\u003E2 \u003C/sub\u003Eis easy, we can recycle it back into the system.\u00A0 But we need a source to start with, and assuming it\u0027s not 100% efficient, a way to produce more.\u00A0 Drawing N2 from the atmosphere would require more machinery, which takes up more energy and valuable cargo space.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe electrolysis system itself requires platinum electrodes.\u00A0\u00A0 Having worked in the platinum electrode business for a while, I can tell you first hand that those electrodes are expensive.\u00A0 Just a rough guess at the cost of the electrodes, based on a guess of the volume of gas produced, would run ~$100,000 a year.\u00A0\u00A0 Most electrolysis cells like this are setup to be run in batches, where you might have 20 cells in a system, but 2 of them are not in use as the electrodes are getting replaced at any given time.\u00A0 This would require more staff and provisions, taking up valuable cargo space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, even assuming we are energy neutral, which is not possible given all the extra machinery required to make this system function, but even assuming we are energy neutral, the loss of cargo space on a cargo ship and increased operating costs would not even come close to being offsett in fuel savings. \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is no way any shipping company would consider this a smart investment.\u00A0\u00A0 They would be far better off installing hard sails, roto-sails, and solar panels on their ships.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bottom line is though, this electrolysis method requires a third gas to form the plasma, which will inevitably bind with either the Oxygen or Hydrogen, which then requires another system to separate that, making the whole thing not energy efficient.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset
