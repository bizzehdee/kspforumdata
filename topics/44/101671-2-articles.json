Your eye is a lense too and though the surface area is limited, when focussed it is enough to hurt whatever lies beyond. That is why looking at the sun hurts - to prevent you from doing it too often or long. Your eyes are sensitive instruments and the sun is a ball of blazing fury."},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T19:03:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Just wondering here, how dangerous is it to look at the sun during an eclipse?\n\u003E People always say don\u0027t look at the sun, but let\u0027s be honest, you can for a few seconds before the brightness is to much.\n\u003E \n\u003E Is watching an eclipse the same as this?

Unless you know exactly for how long the totality lasts at your place (down to a second), you can\u0027t be sure for how long you can watch it. What if you don\u0027t know, and suddenly the Sun starts peeking from Moon\u0027s limb? I\u0027d do it if I was absolutely sure what I was doing, otherwise not.\n\nThe reward could be this.\n\n![chormosphere_prominence.jpg](http://theojanssen.ca/documents/Janssen/Pierre,%20Jules%20Janssen/chormosphere_prominence.jpg)\n\nCorona, chromosphere and prominences aren\u0027t shiny. In fact they are very dim. I think even full Moon has greater magnitude.\n\n**diamond ring** - glancing using naked eyes is ok, staring is absolutely not. Using a telescope - absolutely not unless shielded, just like any other phase of eclipse. Photosphere is visible.\n\n![60-03_diamond_ring.jpg](http://www.astro.gla.ac.uk/users/martin/powersof60/images/60-03_diamond_ring.jpg)\n\n**Baily\u0027s beads** - I wouldn\u0027t even glance. Glancing with squinting, yes, but it\u0027s also playing with luck, as the photosphere is becoming increasingly visible. It\u0027s like diamond ring, but several of them therefore more danger. It\u0027s like looking at arc welding. It doesn\u0027t hurt because the overall retina exposure is low, but it will cause damage because tiny parts of retina get bombarded with Sun\u0027s fury. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n![T06-1089-2w.JPG](http://www.mreclipse.com/SEphoto/TSE2006/image/T06-1089-2w.JPG)\n\n**other phases** - not even squinting and glancing.

This post seems to specify not looking at it through various damaging lenses and stuff\n\nYes. The sun is much more dangerous during an eclipse, because its possible to look at it directly with dilated pupils, and then totality ends and your eyes are damaged before they can look away. Under normal circumstances, looking close to the sun hurts and your pupils are contracted, so while its still not a good idea its much harder to do permanent damage. Of course, this isn\u0027t a total eclipse for most of us, but it may still be dim enough to give the impression the sun is safe to look at."},{"CreatedByName":"MircoMars","CreatedById":61811,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T07:13:30Z","Content":"hi, how does the media cope with this astronomical phenomenon in your country?
