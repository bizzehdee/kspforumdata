The performance of a chemical rocket is tied to how energetic the reaction between the propellants are. If you can find a better propellant, you can push the specific impulse a little more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent chemical launch vehicles run on either LH2/LOX, Kerosene/LOX, N2H4/N2O4, Aluminium/Ammonium Perchlorate (used in solid rockets), or any combination of them. If the agencies/companies were a little more adventurous (foolish!), they\u0027d probably switch the aluminium fuel in solids with powdered beryllium, which is more energetic. Liquid-fuel rockets can improve their specific impulse by switching to more energetic oxidizers, like liquid fluorine, or better (worse?) yet, chlorine trifluoride. Liquid hydrogen is already tops in being a high-performance fuel in the mix, but the density is rather dismal, so you can replace some of it with a higher-density fuel that is at least as energetic, or possibly more, like liquid mercury or lithium.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if you know a bit about chemistry, you may wince at my choice of propellants, and consider anyone even planning to use these propellants quite a bit nuts. And you\u0027d be right; these chemicals are either highly toxic, corrosive, explosive, or (more likely) any combination of these delightful properties; some of this stuff, like liquid fluorine, has killed people before.
