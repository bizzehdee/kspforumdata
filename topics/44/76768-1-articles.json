The answer appears to be yes. Rationale:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. We know that locally, the horizon is nothing special. No infinite tidal forces appear to a local observer. So the object will not be torn apart there. For large holes, that is true even for regular materials.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. We know that anything going inside (or past) the horizon can\u0027t come back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the part \u0022dipping in\u0022 can\u0027t come back and the object will not be torn apart, it follows that the whole object is swallowed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it doesn\u0027t matter how large the object is. What pulls the bits far outside the horizon in is not the (supposedly) infinite force from the bits inside the horizon, that force does not exist (the bits inside cannot have a causal effect on the bits outside), it\u0027s the infinite force from the bits very close to the horizon on the outside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you need to understand here is that the horizon is not a surface like a wall in your house; it is \u0027lightlike\u0027. Locally, as you cross it, the horizon swoops over you at the speed of light. Therefore, to get away from it once you gotten too close, you essentially have to run away from something moving at the speed of light. Which is possible with finite acceleration. Even in flat space, you can run away from a wall of light chasing you by applying finite acceleration for the rest of your life, and in the black hole case, the curvature of space allows you to get away completely after a bit. But: The closer you are to the horizon, the more total delta-v you need, and it diverges to infinity as you approach.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-08T07:56:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s correct. The only thing I can add is that if you try and pull on the part of the object that\u0027s outside, the black hole will always pull harder. So it will either pull the object in or, if you apply enough force trying to \u0022rescue\u0022 that object, rip it apart.
