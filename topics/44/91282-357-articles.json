Aircraft descend in a nose down pitch attitude. During the landing itself, the pilot is looking down the runway instead of at it, before the aircraft is pitched nose up just before the touchdown. Any other time during the flight, it is much more important to see what is ahead and above you than it is to see what\u2019s below you (at an appropriate altitude).\u00A0\u003Cspan\u003EWhere seeing under the fuselage would be useful in some situation, it does not give any significant benefit for the pilot to worth the hassle\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background:rgb(23,23,23);color:rgb(40,40,41);font-size:15px;padding:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EWW2 era bombers need glass nose for both navigator and gunner.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background:rgb(23,23,23);color:rgb(40,40,41);font-size:15px;\u0022\u003EBombing in WW2 was highly dependent upon visual references due to the lack of GPS guidance. For navigators, bombers need to find navigation references during the run up to what the USAAF termed the \u201Cinitial point\u201D or the start of the bomb run proper. As anyone who has looked for a ground reference from the air knows, just finding the initial point alone could be challenging. The high visibility offered by the large glass nose was necessary - even if the navigation was accurate (even more so during night bombing). For nose gunners, when defending against head-on pass the gunners could only shoot back during very brief interval when the target is in range. This is both terrifying and difficult, hence why the extensive view of the nose turret is important to spot the enemy planes earlier before they come in range. Once radar technology and GPS for navigation has improved, and defense turrets no longer relevant in modern era, the glass nose becomes obsolete, replaced by much more capable radar and avionics instead of mk1 eyeball\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background:rgb(23,23,23);color:rgb(40,40,41);font-size:15px;padding:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThink of it like driving a car. Like an airplane, your car on the highway is moving forward at a great rate of speed. Having a view of what is below the car would allow you to see the pothole you are running over as you are running over it. That view is not very useful compare to the ability to see the pothole well down the road before you ever reach it. That is why cars don\u2019t need transparent floors.

In many sci-fi works, whether it\u0027s cyberpunk, futuristic or post-apocalyptic setting, we often see robotic combatants, from small humanoid-sized ones holding infantry-grade firearms (ex: B1 battle droid (Star Wars)) to gigantic ones using upscaled arsenal (ex: Titans (Titanfall)).

For example, some B2 Super Battle Droids had rocket launcher arms instead of the standard dual hand/blaster, of course at the cost of an arm. So you build a few droids with that arm like the CIS did, and then larger numbers of \u201Chanded\u201D droids that are multipurpose, allowing the streamlining of production. More designs and more parts cost more $$$, so it would be better to have one droid for piloting capital ships, standard infantry, tanks (AATs), security, low level commanders, and so on. They even had a firefighting role onboard the Malevolence. Sounds economic and useful to me, and in Legends/EU apparently Sidious actually had to hold back battle droid production because the CIS could have won if they hadn\u2019t been handicapped by him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for what would be best for a big mech?

Yes, it was exacerbated by some poor design choices. But even with the plant as it was designed, if the operators had been properly trained, if they had not been ignoring the relief valve leakage, if they had quickly recognized and responded to the loss of coolant accident, then the accident would never have happened. Manual position indicators on the primary relief valves would have made that easier for them, but that wasn\u0027t impossible technology, that was just a design choice. I can\u0027t think of a shiny new technology that can prevent operator error, aside from robotic operators.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScreenwriter\u0027s answer: If they\u0027re going to say, \u0022We invented a new technology that prevented Three Mile Island from happening,\u0022 it\u0027s an anachronism, which is crappy writing in that sort of genre. Because if Three Mile Island never happened, then nobody is going around saying, \u0022We prevented Three Mile Island from happening.\u0022 Because it never happened. There have been lots of \u0022almost\u0022 nuclear accidents. You\u0027ve never heard of any of them. They aren\u0027t household words.

The control room operators didn\u0027t even notice because the indicators were covered (in one case possibly by an overly fat belly!). \u003Cem\u003EThis was a major breach of the operating license.\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0The reactor should not have been operating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen an improvised filter-cleaning procedure caused water to get into an instrument line and spuriously turn off the main feedwater pumps leading to a turbine trip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the turbines are tripped, they no longer remove heat from the secondary loop, causing the temp and pressure in the secondary loop to rise. This is usually corrected by dumping steam and back-filling with feedwater. Except all the main and aux secondary loop feedwater pumps are all effectively inoperable and the operators don\u0027t know. In fact they can see the aux pumps running, but don\u0027t know they\u0027re doing nothing due to their stop valves being closed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the secondary loop is getting hotter and depressurised by steam dumping without replacement. The operators don\u0027t understand the situation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe primary circuit is affected by the secondary loop, as the amount of heat that can be removed in the steam generators is greatly reduced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EA brief aside on pressure control in the primary circuit:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a pressuriser in the primary coolant loop that contains a steam bubble. Pressure can be increased by turning on heaters in the steam bubble to increase its pressure. Pressure can be also reduced by spraying cold water into the steam bubble to reduce its temperature, or by a solenoid operated pressure relief valve. The level of water in the pressuriser can simultaneously be adjusted by adding or removing water to the primary loop. Generally in the absence of coolant addition/subtraction an increasing pressuriser water level indicates increasing primary loop temperature (and due to expansion compressing the steam bubble - pressure).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EBack to the accident:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo with heat not being removed from the primary loop, the primary loop gets hotter, and the coolant expands. It pushes into the pressuriser, compressing the steam and increasing the primary loop pressure. This is when the pressure relief valve is commanded open and sticks open. But it\u0027s not enough to keep the pressure down with the reactor at full power, so the reactor is tripped and the control rods inserted, reducing reactor power to ~6% resulting from decay heat which is still substantial.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the pressuriser level continues to rise even as the primary loop pressure is falling. The operators haven\u0027t been trained for these parameters disagreeing. The pressure is falling due to the steam bubble getting vented through the stuck valve, and the level is rising due to the decreased pressuriser bubble and another steam bubble forming invisibly to the operators in the reactor pressure vessel (due to boiling in the low pressure) then displacing coolant into the pressuriser. There is basically already a minor loss of coolant accident in progress, but the operators take far too long to work this out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s exacerbated by bad instrumentation - the control panel doesn\u0027t show the valve\u0027s actual position, what it reports as valve position is just the solenoid power status, and as the valve is stuck this is incorrect. There was a temperature sensor downstream from the pressure relief valve that could have helped indicate coolant was passing the valve, but as it was not considered safety critical its display was located on a panel that the operators weren\u0027t\u00A0 likely to notice in the heat of crisis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPressuriser level rising uncontrollably is normally bad - if the steam bubble disappears the primary loop effectively \u0022goes solid\u0022, and therefore could be subject to large pressure excursions as the \u0022incompressible\u0022 coolant fights its pressure vessel. The operators have been trained never to allow this as it can cause a loss of coolant accident. So they turn off the primary coolant feed to try and lower the pressuriser level. \u003Cem\u003EThis is *exactly* the wrong thing to do during an actual loss of coolant accident\u003C/em\u003E! It stops the falling coolant level in the RPV getting topped up, and stops cold coolant being introduced to keep the temperature down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time the operators work out their mistake enough coolant has boiled off that the fuel has overheated and melted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EHow to fix the TMI reactor design:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBetter operator training. Interlocks to prevent reactor operation with safety critical systems locked off for maintenance. Better control panel layouts. Revised, more reliable pressure relief valve. Safety critical valves to have indicator switches to report their actual position, not merely their solenoid power status.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe actual reactor design was a good and safe design. Despite the accident and radiation release there\u0027s no direct evidence of harm to anybody off-site.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EReactors for lunar bases:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main challenge for reactors in space is heat rejection. Earth-based thermal power plants (not just nuclear) generally need to reject heat to the environment, and the best way of doing that is by releasing steam or using bodies of water as heat sinks. Neither of those is especially possible in space, and radiators are very much less effective at heat dissipation so they\u0027d need a lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWater for the primary coolant loop is also very heavy, which could be prohibitive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps a space-based reactor would be better off using a high temperature gas-cooled or liquid-metal cooled design rather than a conventional PWR using water and steam cycles. Gas is a lighter coolant than water, and liquid metal would allow a denser, more compact and therefore potentially less massive reactor as a result, and both could have higher temperature exhausts which would make their radiators more effective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt could also be better to use much higher military/weapons grade fuel enrichments as the mass of fuel to be transported would be a lot lower, and again they\u0027d have higher power densities allowing smaller less massive reactors as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m speculating a bit though.

A streamlined AP bomb made of steel and TNT has a much higher terminal velocity than, say, a feather, or a human being. So in order to reach that terminal velocity the bomb would have to be dropped from a very high altitude in order to allow gravity to accelerate it for the required amount of time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuring WWII, bombs were aimed by optical sights, or (in the case of high altitude bombing) by electro-mechanical aiming computers such as the Norden bomb sight. These were not sophisticated aiming devices by today\u0027s standards. In high-altitude bombing their CEPs were hundreds of yards. So, in general, dropping your precision AP bomb from extremely high altitudes wasn\u0027t really an option. This is why most naval bombers during the era were dive bombers: they were much more accurate, and used a power dive of the aircraft to accelerate the bomb towards the target to increase its penetrating power.\u00A0 So, precision bombing during WWII was much more limited by the ability of the bomber to hit its target than it was by the penetrating power of the bomb itself. If someone would have suggested dropping a bomb on a battleship from 20,000 feet to increase its penetrating power, the counterargument would have been, \u0022Yes, but we\u0027ll never hit the damn thing.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeSchmuckatelli","CreatedById":154477,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-02-13T19:30:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224366279\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002291282\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221707837961\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022168061\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ARS\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, ARS said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\noes that means bombing from higher altitude than that does no increase in penetration capability?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPretty much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGravity bombs do have some kinetic penetration ability - but the main weapon is the chemical energy charge inside.\u00A0 What changes is how the fuse works; a point detonating fuse doesn\u0027t exactly go off at the moment of impact - but it\u0027s close enough.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHit something hard and you get very little penetration before the chemical explosive is triggered and most of the explosion is at or near the surface.\u00A0 Put a delayed fuse on there and you allow the kinetic property of the bomb to (hopefully) penetrate the surface before detonating - and you get the damage \u003Cem\u003Einside \u003C/em\u003Ethe target (presuming a hit).\u00A0 This is with simple HE.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a myriad of ways to design bombs and shells.\u00A0 The big, air dropped ones like MOAB or MOP are going to use their weight differently.\u00A0 MOAB gives you a LOT of chemical energy.\u00A0 MOP gives you a LOT of penetration.\u00A0 Simple gravity bomb design is going to take into account the type of effect desired and change things like the fuse timing, material of the body/nose, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can compare with tank ammo; the SABOT is pure KE where the other variations of HE, HEDP, HEAT (etc. ad nauseum) are all designed in varying ways to mix the KE and CE properties of the round to one degree or another.\u00A0 With the first - speed is necessary.\u00A0 With the latter?\u00A0 Depends.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne difference vis altitude is the hyperkinetic weapons under development - where they\u0027re going for extreme streamlining to maximize KE.\u00A0 There are a lot of ways to get the weapon up high and moving fast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut for the simple / improved gravity bomb?\u00A0 Weight, material, streamlining, etc all go into the \u0027what do you want to do\u0027 answer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
