Well, they have interstellar flight.  And they must have used anti-matter pion propulsion to do it.  (or maybe a black hole engine).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So there\u0027s actually one big advantage we\u0027d have on Earth.  Warning time.  Their ship would take decades to decelerate, and leave a flare of gamma rays as it does so.  Both engine types emit much of their exhaust energy in the form of gamma rays.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Ok, what else do the aliens have?  They probably have molecular nanotechnology, and they probably can copy themselves very rapidly given the needed resources.  But their starship itself is probably very small and light at the end of an interstellar voyage, having burned off most of it\u0027s mass during the trip as propellant and expended stages.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If that\u0027s true - again, I\u0027m assuming *plausible* limitations based on *current* scientific knowledge - then it\u0027s not hopeless.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Basically you have to assume that the alien ship is higher quality than anything we can make on earth.  It can probably reconfigure itself and repair damage very rapidly.  So you need at least 100 : 1 odds.  If the alien ship weighs 1000 tons of payload\\*, you need to send 100 kilotons of warships to intercept it.  And you have to reach it before it can dock with an oort cloud object and grow rapidly into an unstoppable fleet.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E What would the warships be?  Orion nuclear pulse battleships, armed with lasers and nuclear howitzer rounds.  Obviously.  There\u0027s no stealth in space so you just have to get into range.  Realistically you\u0027d probably want to try to ram the alien ship.  You\u0027ve got to assume that long before you get into range, the alien ship would probably reconfigure itself into a gamma ray laser with incredible range or something.  Maybe 100 : 1 odds isn\u0027t enough...\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \\* you calculate the payload mass of the alien ship with spectroscopy to analyze their engine flare, then you look at how fast it is decelerating.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It certainly sounds like an interesting scenario.\n\u003E \n\nIn the sci-fi book which I\u0027m currently reading (Robert Ibatullin, \u0022Rose and worm\u0022) (I\u0027m spoilering it because anyway yet haven\u0027t found if it\u0027s translated into English, otherwise just would give a link).  \n\nSpoiler\n\nThe alien fleet was accelerated by homeworld (star-powered?) laser and sails (so, this IR radiation gave them up to humans when they already were in half way to the Earth), with no signals.\n\nThen they began braking with magnetoplasmatic chutes/retroengines powered by the interstellar ionized gas flow (their speed was 0.5 c, so they could)..This caused a synchrotron radiation which gave up to humans that they are braking and not trying to communicate. So, they were correctly treated as an invasion fleet with estimated time of arrival T\u002B200years.\n\nHumans built a near-Sun fleet of (sun-powered?) lasers and a fleet of missiles equipped with sails, going to intercept them in Kuiper Belt when they arrive.  \n\nBut soon realized that sneaky aliens, before begin braking, released 100-kg kinetic shells made of carbon, moving to the Earth with 0.5 c. So, a century before the alien fleet arrival, the Earth was eliminated with kinetic bombardment, only occasional spacebases and .tribes survived.\n\nWhen the alien fleet speed dropped down and the ion flow had gotten weak, they disabled the magnetochutes and continued braking with what you\u0027ve described: either Annie or Hollie engines.  \n\nIn such manner they happily arrived to the Kuiper Belt.\n\nBut human survivors engaged the laser transmitters and launched laser/sail shells in two waves. Shells were invisible to aliens due to the alienships torch radiation.  \n\nFirst wave was homing into the alien engines, but missed. Alien realized that they\u0027re under attack and disengaged engines getting invisible for the second wave.  \n\nBut the first wave measured and transmitted to the second wave their exact coordinates, so the second range successfully hit the alienships with kiloton-range direct kinetical hits.\n\nBut sneaky aliens were sneaky, and later the humans realized that they not just disengaged engines, but decoupled the ships (or maybe emergency capsules) themselves from the engine modules.  \n\nSo, the missiles hit the engines, but aliens were not destroyed.  \n\nThey colonized near-Jupiter asteroids and began producing invasion bots mining the asteroid matter. But this was giveb up to humans by thin comet tails appearing due to gas wastes.\n\nThe book describes how it then was going in this setting.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-21T05:29:17Z\u0022 title=\u002209/21/2016 05:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by kerbiloid**"},{"CreatedByName":"SomeGuy123","CreatedById":154263,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-21T16:48:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 11 hours ago, kerbiloid said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E In the sci-fi book which I\u0027m currently reading (Robert Ibatullin, \u0022Rose and worm\u0022) (I\u0027m spoilering it because anyway yet haven\u0027t found if it\u0027s translated into English, otherwise just would give a link).\n\u003E \n\nI like it.  It\u0027s a very grim and depressing setting - but it also would make an awesome setting for a video game.  Maybe right after the primary fighting has stopped.  The reason is that video games need a setting where the amount of total art and assets needed is feasible for a studio of a practical size.  That\u0027s why the whole Earth, undamaged, with all the people and all the cities can\u0027t be in a feasible game - it would take too long and too much money just to model all that stuff statically.  Much less try to predict how geopolitical politics would go once the game starts.\n\nWhat *is* feasible is if the earth has been pounded into a smoking crater oozing magma.  A few successful alien attacks have eliminated all the mega-group of survivors, leaving tiny outposts with a few hundred people in each scattered throughout the asteroid belt.  Something you could actually practically model, about the size of Diamond City in FO4.  \n\nIt would be a derivative of KSP - you\u0027d start out somewhere and have access to various scrap parts and have to device a spacecraft to get around in the asteroid belt.  Instead of science to unlock stuff you\u0027d go find wrecked equipment leftover from the fighting and have to scavenge for components...\n\nNaturally in the plot of the game there\u0027s a surviving group of aliens, and they are willing to talk, and your character gets a choice to either wipe them out or work with them.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-21T16:49:55Z\u0022 title=\u002209/21/2016 04:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by SomeGuy123**"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-21T16:57:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 9 minutes ago, SomeGuy123 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I like it.
