On a similar note, I\u0027d love to know how many ounces/pounds/tons of gold are on orbit. You see the foil everywhere, and I know its hair thin, but then there\u0027s all of the electronics on top of that... Given the density of gold compared to other \u0027spacey\u0027 materials like titanium, aluminum and.. velcro, it could add up fast...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shynung","CreatedById":101096,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T15:16:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EConsidering that astronauts had some velcro patch inside their helmet just to scratch their nose, I\u0027d say a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T17:05:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWasn\u0027t velcro labeled as a great fire hazard after the Apollo one incident?
