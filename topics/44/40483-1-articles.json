The falcon 9 has ice on it because it uses liquid oxygen as an oxidizer, which is very cold (about minus 180 degrees Celsius), cold enough to form ice on the outside of the liquid oxygen tanks. This ice is falls off during liftoff because of the vibration and movement of the rocket. There is no ice on the kerosene tank as the kerosene is at ambient temperature. This ice only forms on rockets with cryogenic (very cold) propellants. The proton rocket doesent have ice on it because it uses dinitrogen tetroxide, not liquid oxygen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, not all rockets using cryogenic propellants have ice on them at liftoff. Rockets with liquid hydrogen don\u0027t usually have ice forming on the outside of the tanks, because they are usually well insulated. Liquid hydrogen tanks have to be well insulated because it is cold enough to liquify, even freeze the oxygen in the air. Having frozen oxygen on the outside of your tanks is much more dangerous than just frozen water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake a look at the space shuttle external tank, you don\u0027t see ice falling off that at liftoff. That is because it has that orange/brown foam insulation around it. Having ice falling off that tank would be VERY dangerous as it could hit the shuttle orbiter. For other rockets that don\u0027t have their payload latched on to the side, but on top, like the Falcon 9 or Saturn V, It\u0027s ok to let the ice fall off.
