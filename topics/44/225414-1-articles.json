Sundial-like gigaton nukes, or relativistic kinetic impactors, or a focused beam from the nearest neutron star magnetosphere.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd instead of the eagles and falcons they can use some

enormous interstellar distances, making it hard to remotely control the other star dwellers in real time.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut as their aim would not be having a family chat, but expansion of their unified mind network, it would be enough for them to take under control some part of the aimed civilisation, impregnate its mind, turning them into faithful servants, and using them as a breakthrough
