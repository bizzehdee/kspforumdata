Remember that sound is a compression wave, it requires a medium to travel. I\u0027m not a real physicist (yet) so I couldn\u0027t tell you how loud it would be.

There is also INTENSE wind from the heat. I remember also hearing something like the poles rotate faster than the equator because the Sun is all gas. But other than the wind, I\u0027m not sure fusion has a sound. I know that atomic bombs use an uncontrolled fission reaction to make fusion occur to detonate, so I\u0027d think it\u0027s comparable to a metric truck ton of Tsar Bombas going off at once, for the next couple billion years.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zaeo","CreatedById":52597,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-06T06:46:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Sun does in fact have an \u0022Atmosphere\u0022 but not in the sense that we know it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne part is called the Corona, It is hotter than the surface of the sun itself, and is extremely turbulant. it also extends out significantly further then the star itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETechnically speaking, almost the entirity of the sun is atmosphere.

The gas is simply too thin to exibit compression waves at the frequencies we hear. Particles are so spread out that they rarely collide. There might be weak sound waves of extremely low frequency, like 0.001 Hz, simply because in a wide area such as the Sun surface, we can account for some particle collisions, but I\u0027m actually overstretching the possibilities.
