It will be the first satellite to use a new propellant developed by the Air Force\u0027s Research Laboratory called AF-M315E and based on hydroxylammonium nitrate (NH3OHNO3). While common hydrazine is both toxic and corrosive, AF-M315E is neither of those. In fact, it is also more efficient and 40% denser, giving a 50% increase in maneauverability for a given tank volume. Also, the fact that it is neither toxic nor corrosive means it can be stored, handled and used much more easily and quickly, possibly reducing launch processing times and costs. Finally, its freezing point is much lower than that of hydrazine, meaning that it doesn\u0027t have to be heated as much to remain liquid while in space. The only major problems that I see is that it has a higher combustion temperature, which requires stronger metals, and obviously that it hasn\u0027t been tested a lot yet, but I hope that will change soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new propellant was developed by the US Air Force, but GPIM\u0027s propulsion system, featuring 5 x 1 N thrusters, has already been fully built by Aerojet Rocketdyne and given to Ball Aerospace, which will build and assemble the satellite and all subsystems (including 3 scientific instruments) for NASA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d put a few links if they weren\u0027t all giving 404s right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you guys think of this \u0022eco-friendly\u0022 propellant?
