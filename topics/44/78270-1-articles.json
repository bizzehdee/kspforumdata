So we\u0027re talking about establishing a long term goal with many launches, the heavier we can make each launch the better. Less pieces = less assembly = less to go wrong in LEO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s say right now we launch from southernmost Texas at 26\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 latitude, at only 2.5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 above the Tropic of Cancer, only 2.5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 of adjustment in the orbital inclination would be required to enter the equatorial plane. But, we\u0027re at sea level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s increase the altitude, which for staying inside the continental USA, requires us to move north. At about ~31.5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and ~10,000ft/2900m we have Miller Peak in far southern Arizona. If a peak is too much, there are flatter areas in the Big Bend of Texas that average 4,000ft/1200m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen disregarding geopolitics, shipping costs and the challenges of launching from a peak/volcano, there is the ultimate advantage, picking a peak in the tropics (no inclination adjustment) like Pico de Orizaba outside of Mexico City at ~18490ft/5636m, or Mauna Kea at 13795ft/4205m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess now that I\u0027ve said all that what I\u0027m really looking for is the math to make a comparison chart of \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0V saved per altitude increase and \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0V required per degree of inclination adjustment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sgt_flyer","CreatedById":57690,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T18:33:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou will face other problems launching from high altitudes for not much gains.
