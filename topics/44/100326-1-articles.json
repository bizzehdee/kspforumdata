The docking ports, called International Docking Adapters, will be delivered to the station later this year on SpaceX Dragon cargo vehicles for attachment to Pressurized Mating Adapters 2 and 3. The spacewalk was the 185th in support of space station assembly and maintenance, the second in Wilmore\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s career and the first for Virts. The two astronauts will venture outside the Quest airlock again on Feb. 25 and March 1 to continue the routing of cables for the new docking ports and to install communications gear for the new commercial crew vehicles.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-21T23:23:05Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2015 11:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Airlock**"},{"CreatedByName":"Albert VDS","CreatedById":74055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T16:45:35Z","Content":"Thanks for posting, I haven\u0027t seen a live spacewalk yet. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T17:03:29Z","Content":"My stream is so laggy.
