For many astronomical phenomena you have to travel to exactly the right place over the entire surface of Earth, but Iridium flares happen once or twice a night, usually, in pretty much any place. Even if you don\u0027t use a tracker, you can see some combination of satellites, flares, and tumbling space debris just by lying on your back on a clear night and watching. Kessler syndrome is pretty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
