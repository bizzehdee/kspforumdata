Java is supposedly easy because it comes with compiler that will scream at you if you do anything that in opinion of people who designed it you should not do.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPython can easily be installed and run on windows, but it definitely feels better in *nix. Java makes all archs feel same.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nJava has some honking great IDEs that make coding a lot easier, especially if you are not familar with all the APIs\u00A0(and there are a lot of those in java libraries\u2026). Python is supposedly simple enought to feel comfortable with any editor that can tell space from tab. But it\u0027s telling that one of best python IDEs is coded in Java.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPython have WAY better standard library, but it\u0027s messy at places. Java standard library feels like product of design comitee - it\u0027s pleasing to look at and easy get grasp on, but sometimes not very nice to use.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nApart from standard library, Java have whole ecosystem of other tools whose depth beats\u2026 well, everything. Python is easy (for certain values of easy) to extend beyond it\u0027s own ecosystem, some of most used python libraries are just binding to powerfull C libs (numpy, PyQt, pygame\u2026)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nJava code is nothing\u00A0like C\u002B\u002B code, but the \u0022compiler mentality\u0022 is similar while still providing some of advatages of interpreted code. It certainly teach you some things (scoping, strong types) that may come in handy if you start tinkering with proper compiled languages like C.\u00A0 Python have incredible expresiveness, but it\u0027s only tangentialy transferable to compiled languages.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nJava is used heavily in Big Business.

I\u0027d say that python is definitely better if you want to learn stuff while playing with code, but if you ever go into serious coding, you will sooner or later learn both.

I used Python a little bit for scripting some time back: it was fairly decent, but the lack of strong typing really bugged me coming from a Java background.
