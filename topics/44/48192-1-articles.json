I think that when they refer to skipping away, what they really meant was a dip into the atmosphere that would be too shallow to slow down the CM enough to bring the apogee of the orbit into the atmosphere. What would happen is that they would go through the atmosphere in a straight line and come out on the other side for another orbit. Depending on the severity of the error, the next orbit could take from several hours to several days (potentially travelling back to the Moon\u0027s orbital distance). This would have been catastrophic, because once the SM was dumped, the CM had very limited batteries and life support, a couple of hours max.

To do direct re-entry, you have to figure out how long an efficient moon-to-earth transit will take, then quicksave and time accelerate to that time. Then you have to rotate the earth (by time accelerating) until your desired entry spot on the Earth is directly opposite the moon and note that time. Then you quickload and adjust your TEI so that your transit takes that long (you burn more radially so that the orbit is \u0022rounder\u0022 and takes longer.) That way when you reach perigee, you\u0027ll be directly above your desired entry spot. I imagine you could do something similar in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027ve reached the entry interface in Orbiter, fire up Aerobrake MFD. It gives you all the info you need to fly a deadstick landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that re-entry latitude is tricky. Perigee from a lunar return is a fixed spot on the Earth\u0027s surface; all of the orbits that encircle both the moon and the Earth have perigee at the same spot. But, the Earth\u0027s axial tilt means that the latitude of perigee will vary throughout the month, so you can choose your re-entry latitude (within a ~ \u002B/-20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 band) by varying your departure time throughout the month. To reach Kennedy, though, you usually have to rely on your spacecraft\u0027s crossrange capability. In KSP, since Kerbin\u0027s ecliptic and equatorial plane are the same, the Mun orbits on that plane, and KSC is on the equator, this wouldn\u0027t be a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T17:30:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kerbart\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kerbart\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe off-center COM was used to allow a stable position without the axis of the capsule aligning with the axis of flight; hence generating lift.

Kerbin\u0027s atmospheric temperature profile was modelled based on the Earth\u0027s and, despite the fact that Kerbin\u0027s atmospheric properties aren\u0027t consistent with the ideal gas law, you can use Kerbin\u0027s atmospheric properties and elementary aerothermodynamics to approximate realistic re-entry effects in KSP. Indeed this is what my old re-entry heating mod did. When the mod\u0027s \u0022hardcore\u0022 mode was turned on, it would even approximate lift effects on the command pod. Players could use that lift effect to cause a slight skip, steepen their re-entry (at the risk of structural failure), or apply some cross-track trajectory adjustments. The plot below illustrates the re-entry corridor from my old mod (with the mod\u0027s \u0022hardcore\u0022 mode lift effects turned off):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/olrs4na.png\u0022 alt=\u0022olrs4na.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trouble is that the triggers for the visual re-entry effects aren\u0027t currently implemented very well in the game and they should really be fixed.

The same was true for the Space Shuttle. In the game, we don\u0027t see the plasma effects that should coincide with peak heating until the re-entry is almost over. Even so, it wouldn\u0027t be hard for Squad to tweak the game\u0027s visual re-entry effects for consistency with real-world physics and then incorporate some basic re-entry heating and structural stress effects. If I could do it in a mod, then it is certainly possible.
