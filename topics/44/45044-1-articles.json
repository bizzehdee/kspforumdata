As there are no \u0027intelligent\u0027 arthropods on Earth (including all of the eusocial insects) it is a bit difficult to imagine how intelligence and civilization could evolve among such creatures.

For the overwhelming majority of mammals, you only need a few thousand individuals to maintain genetic diversity, because all individuals are capable of reproduction and random genetic mixing (whether they want to is another matter - giant pandas, for example). But if your species is reliant on a certain \u0022caste\u0022 to do all the reproducing, you may have lowered that threshold significantly - imagine that half the species is reproducers, and half is workers, and only the reproducers can produce more reproducers. What happens if a large number of your reproducers suddenly die, as though by disease? The net result is that there aren\u0027t enough reproducers to keep the number of workers high, which eventually means the species hits a negative feedback loop (less workers = less food = less reproducers = less workers, repeat until extinction). The same problem occurs if the number of workers suddenly decreases, though it\u0027s a bit more immediate - you don\u0027t have to wait for the current generation of workers to die off. The end result either way is that the species is in for extinction within a few dozen generations, and likely less (depending on the severity of the die-off). And this is, naturally, an optimistic example - the ratio of workers to reproducers is usually well over 10:1, and (especially with insects), more like 1000:1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI imagine that naked mole rats are actually the \u0022tail end\u0022 of the mammal-eusociality evolutionary experiment - a species around long after any of its evolutionary \u0022cousins\u0022 have died off, and so hyperadapted to its environment that any change in it might as well be a sentence to extinction.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-06T02:09:51Z\u0022 title=\u002209/06/2013 02:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by NGTOne\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diche Bach","CreatedById":76097,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T22:01:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think we can be confident that a \u0027civilized\u0027 alien life will exhibit the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Tool-making: many animals make and use tools, and there are even plenty who teach tool use to one another.

By this I mean, that humans have for a very long time, created a seemingly useless \u0027tool\u0027 (or one with very limited utility) as a way to create a second tool, as a way to create third, etc. Modern industry takes this principle to the extreme, but it is arguably at the heart of \u0027modern\u0027 human tool use (although interestingly it may have been present in incipient stages for a long time before we were fully modern).

Of course even the lack of an oxygen atmosphere does not exclude the possibility of anaerobic life, but what we are really hoping for (and the dream that researchers are trying to \u0027sell\u0027 when the talk about 100 million Earth like exoplanets) are planets which could harbor biologies similar to Earths, be homes to intelligent life and/or viable targets for us to colonize.
