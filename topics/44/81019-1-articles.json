But that actually is not much of a problem. EMP is not a concern unless the detonation is larger than one megaton or so, Orion propulsion charges are only a few kilotons (one one-thousandth of a megaton). Ben Pearson did an analysis and concluded that Orion charges would only have EMP effects within a radius of 276 kilometers (the International Space Station has an orbital height of about 370 kilometers). So just be sure your launch site is in a remote location, which you probably would have done anyway.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-08T07:37:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022crazyewok\u0022 data-cite=\u0022crazyewok\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI beg to differ.\u003Cp\u003EA scientific barrier due to the laws of physics means you cant do something full stop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA political barrier is a human imposed barrier that can be changed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, good luck with that.
