It works by timing the passage of Eve across Kerbol\u0027s disk from two locations on Kerbin. A bit of trigonometry is then all that\u0027s required to calculate the Kerbal AU. I found the image below to illustrate how it works:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.stack.imgur.com/GjDe9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GjDe9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe difficult part is accurately determining the lengths of the transits. As shown in the images that I posted above, Eve transits Kerbol starting late in the day on UT = 162 days. I never bothered to figure out how often it transits, because I only needed one transit for my experiment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will dig up my calculations and post them, but it might take a few days.

There aren\u0027t much in the way of comments in the calculations because they weren\u0027t meant to be presentable. The result of 19.6 million km is about 40% bigger than the actual value. The calculation depends on an accurate measurement of the transit time at the northern and southern observatory, as well as on an accurate measurement of the diameter of the angular size of Kerbol\u0027s disk as seen from Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne encouraging thing about the calculations is that they predict that Eve crosses Kerbol\u0027s disk at an angle of 5 degrees. That is consistent with measurements. It also predicts that Eve transits about 40% of the way between the centre of Kerbol\u0027s disk and the edge. That too is consistent with measurements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere may well be a mistake in the calculations, so feel free to point it out if you find one.
