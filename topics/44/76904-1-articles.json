(Closest approach 12,640 km -- well within Charon\u0027s orbit -- at a relative velocity of 13.8 km/s on July 14, 2015.) It got me wondering what it would take to design an Eris fly-by mission. It\u0027s currently near aphelion and somewhat below the plane of the ecliptic. It\u0027s hard to find information, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027ll cross the ecliptic until the mid 2100\u0027s. To get there sooner, I wondered if a Jupiter flyby could throw a spacecraft down toward Eris; Jupiter should be in position at around 2023. If we could accelerate a spacecraft to speeds similar to New Horizons (23.3 km/s sun-relative leaving Jupiter) it might be possible to get to Eris from there in 23 years, flying by in 2046 or so. It would be interesting to try to figure out what a mission like that would take.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-07T19:00:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWho knows - maybe by 2040 we will have VASIMR engines powerful enough to fly such mission in less time?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-07T20:42:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome internet searching reveals that the Orbiter community has already stepped up to this plate.
