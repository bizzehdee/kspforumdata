Each new model of aircraft flies a large number of times before ever being allowed to carry passengers, with the individual airframes likely flown several times before carrying passengers to boot. Commercial airflight has been pushed to the point where it is reasonable to forgo abort modes that do not rely on survival of the airframe.

The Concorde essentially had no abort system once airspeed reached 180 m/s it was committed to fly. But more specifically to your point there were a bunch of very popular aircraft that crashed just after takeoff because of combinations of bad weather and bad engines or other problems, and it was realized that there was no way to safely take-off if more than two issues are a problem, one being the weather. So sensors were placed around airports to detect windsheer. Your car doesn\u0027t have an abort system either, if you are driving down the road and a patch of Ice is on a bridge,\u00A0 you go to fast,\u00A0 . . . . . . .there are no ejector seats in cars. Your motor boat does not have an abort mode, that is really something about reading the conditions (seamanship), if there is a huge log in front of your boat and you don\u0027t see it, that\u0027s it, over the bow you go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of these have one thing in common, don\u0027t launch a mission when conditions are bad. Around here they have a call \u0027shelter in place\u0027 and that means if you are not in immediate danger, stay where you are at, its safer than traveling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe issue with challenger was just that. But in the case of Columbia that abort mode really would have not helped them, because they had to know the shuttle was critically damaged to abort. They did not. I think we should worry less about abort modes and focus on under what circumstances abort mode would be more important than other safety issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-18T21:08:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223270645\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022169590\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221516218190\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257091\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DerekL1963\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 1/17/2018 at 11:43 AM, DerekL1963 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe key safety problem with the Shuttle wasn\u0027t it\u0027s design, low margin high performance vehicles are always risky.\u00A0 It wasn\u0027t directly people, engineers or management.\u00A0 It was a culture that encouraged myopia and the belief that since they\u0027d gotten away with it so far, they would continue to do so into the future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Ca href=\u0022https://spaceflight.nasa.gov/outreach/SignificantIncidents/assets/rogers_commission_report.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERogers Commission Report\u003C/a\u003E touches on this in several places (obviously), but a couple of those are worth highlighting:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn page 156 of the report, where they discuss their reliability program and how that was supposed to be monitoring trend data, they note that process problems were emerging with the SRBs as the shuttle program matured:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA series of changes to Solid Rocket Booster processing procedures at Kennedy may be significant: on-site O-ring inspections were discontinued; O-ring leak check stabilization pressure on the field joint was increased to 200 pound per square inch from 100, sometimes blowing holes through the protective putty; the patterns for positioning the putty were changed; the putty type was changed; re-use of motor segment casings increased; and a new government contractor began management of Solid Rocket Booster assembly.

If the vehicle caught fire on the pad, the crew would die. If anything substantial came loose and fell off... well, the crew might not die, but they were certainly at grave risk of dying.
