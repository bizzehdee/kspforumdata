Personally I think that the first step to friendly discussion would be to define the technologies people are putting forward, identify their TRL equivalent, and agree what TRL should be the minimum for consideration so we all have a framework to agree on. Otherwise people will attack each other based on the highly amusing concept of \u0022acceptable conjecture\u0022 - which by its nature is purely subjective!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWikipedia (*sigh* not an acceptable source but sufficient for the purposes of this discussion - and it\u0027s accessible to everyone) can provide the framework for defining the TRL of whatever technology is proposed.

It\u0027s 100% implausible. We are talking about a high-powered beam (traveller ships are built of unobtanium, after all (SD or BSD), so beams have to penetrate this), so a few grains over a 40m path length does exactly nothing. You could posit that a coasting ship disperses the sand at some range in a much denser grouping. Basically, you look at the solid-angle the ship subtends from the POV of the shooter, and move away from the target ship until the radius of that solid angle goes from 20m down to a value that makes the sand quite dense. Quite dense is relative...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we have a 1cm beam for example. How many grains must be in even a single cc of space the beam passes through for a serious attenuation of the beam? Do we need all 50 kg in 1 cc? A cubic meter is 1,000,000 cubic centimeters. For our nominal 5mg sand particles, the entire 50kg is 10 million grains, so only \u0022dispersed\u0022 into a single m^3, that\u0027s 10 grains per cc. Do you think 10 grains of sand will stop a laser that can blow holes in \u0022superdense\u0022 hull?

They were \u0022balanced\u0022 back in the day (Little Black Books) to provide a \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E effective defense for small ships, nearly or actually 100% in most cases.

The goal with having it have a \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E low, but non-zero chance of it working in an RPG, is that the ref can always roll (fake roll), and let the players off if he does\u0027t want them killed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the traveller talk reminds me of arguments regarding missiles we had.

They existed before the Cold War, they existed after the Cold War, and they were used effectively both times. They are effective anywhere the primary threat from the enemy is small-arms fire and hand grenades. Which is pretty much everybody Israel is at war against right now. The reason Israel fields the Merkava is because it\u0027s theater-appropriate.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI said that the world is full of Cold War-era military forces. More specifically, many military forces are still organized in a similar way as the late Soviet military. This includes a large army with a plenty of tanks. While such militaries aren\u0027t effective against modern forces, modern forces aren\u0027t that (cost-) effective againt them either. If you have to be prepared to fight against such force, it\u0027s better to have some old-fashioned forces with a lot of tanks available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, military technology doesn\u0027t usually become obsolete by becoming useless or ineffective. It\u0027s more common that technological or tactical development just removes the need for certain specialized systems. For example, main battle tanks are expensive weapons platforms that are specialized for fighting other main battle tanks. If your enemy doesn\u0027t have main battle tanks, your main battle tanks become just expensive support vehicles that can perform the role almost as well as much cheaper specialized support vehicles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBecause they\u0027re effective against something else.
