They could have gone higher at that time, but the glider cabin was not pressurized and so they have to descend. This new project intended to have a pressurized cabin in the glider, but the funding was cut short due to Fossett\u0027s death in 2007. It is until Airbus fund it again in 2014 that they can return to working on the new glider and have it for testing in 2015.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Armchair Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":76165,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-23T03:03:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CaptainKorhonen\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CaptainKorhonen\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBecause gliding is a ridiculously efficient and cheap way to fly.

Not to mention that a solar-electric UAV could potentially maintain stratospheric altitudes for weeks or months at a time, while a manned glider would probably have less endurance than a zero-pressure balloon (although with more cross-range control).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"benzman","CreatedById":82512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-23T11:08:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe glider altitude record is already at the maximum that a crew can survive without either a pressurised cabin or a full pressure suit, both a bit problematic in a glider. Gliders, with their long wings and low wing loading are quite happy at altitude. The previous record of 49,000 feet was set in a normal club-type glider with a 15 metre wingspan. I have been in a Piper warrior at 10,000 feet and it wallowed around very unhappily. I have been to 14,600 feet in a 15 metre wingspan glider and it felt no different to being at sea level. As an old glider pilot, the most interesting part of the article was the claim that mountain waves can penetrate the stratosphere. If this turns out to be true, then we have to rethink our definition of the stratosphere, which is a level of the atmosphere without vertical transport. i.e. only horizontal movements. I must say that the article just made me think of Boys playing with Toys!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-23T11:45:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s the media.
