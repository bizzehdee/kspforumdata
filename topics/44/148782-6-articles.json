Look at ULA\u0027s CisLunar 1000 plans. Or this outfit from Luxemburg, who want to go mine asteroids.... There is already a lot of effort going on in the area of \u0022doing business in space\u0022. And then, when I look at the impending scarcity of rare earth materials, which are needed to build our next smart phone, laptop computer, hair dryer, microwave, car, you name it, I think this kind of business will have some merit and thus future. Not tomorrow, not in ten years, but Soon\u00AE. For this transport will be required - and this is I think, where \u0022mass transit\u0022 like Elon\u0027s ITS might (or might not) fit in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what about this whole \u0022Let\u0027s go to Mars\u0022 thing?! I totally agree with folks that say that it is definitely not alike the wave of discoverers that went ashore in the New World in the 15th and 16th century to make a living in an uncharted territory \u003Cstrong\u003Efull of unknown species, illness, potentially hostile natives etc.\u003C/strong\u003E Mars is a barren place, with what resources we still do not fully know, some form of water for sure, lots of carbondioxide and other stuff we can\u0027t breathe, the prospect of living under a dome for the rest of our lives.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, beyond the obvious scientific motives and some remote business motive (maybe some scarce resource we don\u0027t have on earth, though I doubt it...), there seems not much else to draw people there. Or is there? What Elon said, you can go anywhere on this world within 24 hours. If I may take this a step further and state: For mankind, there is little challenge, little focus \u0022on what to do next\u0022 remaining. In a word, literally boring. So boring in fact that one feels sometimes, our society is slowly degenerating to the old concept of \u0022panem et circensis\u0022 (Latin for \u0022bread and games\u0022), meaning that as long as people are fed and occupied, they won\u0027t stir excrements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, one\u00A0 thing kept me going in Elon\u0027s speech. That is the ambition and the inspiration he emanated. Maybe that is one thing that could drive us and inspire future generation to devite them more towards a \u0022higher\u0022 goal than just \u0022panem et circensis\u0022. Maybe it is also a means to inspire kids in school and college to devote themselves to engineering, physics and the likes and maybe this future economy represents also new opportunities for \u0022the common people\u0022 back on the blue marble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then I come back to the \u0022fertile grounds motive\u0022 of colonization: If corporations like SpaceX, ULA and the others pursue their plans, maybe not exactly a Mars colonization (or maybe exactly this), an orbital, lunar, cislunar, martian or asteroidal industry might emerge, offering jobs for highly qualified engineers. And then crafts like Elon\u0027s are required (well, maybe not as flashy, cruiselinerish, but you get the drift).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, anyway, that is my conclusion after thinking about this for a while.

Since about 1950, a third \u0022colonization\u0022 model has sprung up--the scientific outpost, a habitat which is inhabited permanently but by rotating crews to conduct some kind of scientific research, like in Antarctica or with space stations. Governments have, collectively, spent billions of dollars on these over a few decades even discounting the ISS (the US alone spends about $300 million per year on Antarctica, and there are a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of countries with Antarctic bases), so clearly they\u0027re willing to dump money into them \u0022just because\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdmittedly, in Antartica there are shades of the second point as well--Australian bases in the AAT, Chilean and Argentinean bases in their claims, and so on--and we know there is stuff there that\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0be mined.\u00A0But we know the same thing about Mars, too, and it makes about as much sense to set up a Mars base to do research and establish a seat at the table if something that could make doing stuff on Mars profitable emerges as it does to establish an Antarctic base to do research and establish a seat at the table for Treaty revisions if something that could make doing stuff in Antarctica profitable emerges. At least, if the cost is reasonable, which\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eif\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Elon can get his cost figures to where he wants would pretty much be the case--the delivery of payload to the Martian surface would have to cost less than about $2,000 per kilogram for a ticket to cost $200,000, which is about the same as what it costs to deliver payload to orbit today, or less. Thus, it would cost about the same or less to operate a Mars base as to operate a space station even with minimal \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E and, well, there\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0a couple of groups doing space stations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, the trouble is that this isn\u0027t what most people think of when they say \u0022colonization\u0022. Nor is the other probable model of space \u0022colonization,\u0022 which is oil rig-like asteroid mines (which would also be much more plausible\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eif\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the ITS works out), because in both cases you just have people traveling out somewhere for a limited time before returning to Earth, and making no attempt to permanently inhabit the area. But it is, nevertheless, a method of colonizing an area, and certainly some kind of a step into space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"todofwar","CreatedById":160465,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-28T15:02:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222777599\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022148782\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221475047922\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022132560\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RCgothic\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, RCgothic said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure they will, compared to other Martians.
