That\u0027s at current demand, we\u0027re going to need much more per year as the \u0022third world\u0022 develops and industrialises. Also, we can\u0027t just wait for the last deposit to dry out, and immediately switch to something else- it takes years, decades even, to change an entire infrastructure. We can either do that now,when we are functioning and progressing as a species,or do it later, and spend that time finding new forms of power in the dark ages.

The major niche that I could see for it right now would be to target asteroids with deposits of particular metals that have an extremely low natural abudance within the Earth\u0027s crust. There are some materials for which the entire worldwide production of these materials is measured in grams or kilograms. Many of these elements are very heavy and thus extremely rare on large planetary bodies, where they are found locked up totally inaccessibly within the core but can be found much more readily on the far smaller asteroids that we\u0027d be prospecting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could also allow insertion of resources into LEO in quantities that might be prohibitively expensive simply by launching them up there, potentially unlocking other avenues of advancement in space exploration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s certainly not going to be a profitable thing to do in the near future but I don\u0027t buy into the idea that means it isn\u0027t worth doing.
