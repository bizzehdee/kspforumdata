This is my first post here but I have a question which I am hoping someone could answer for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a certain common feature lots of the Russian rockets have like the Long March versions and the Falcon Heavy from SpaceX where the head of the rocket has a bigger diameter than the middle and then the end of the rocket has a diameter similar to the head. So the rocket has a thinner part in the middle. Is there any aerodynamic reason for this or is it simply to use up less material? I have no idea about rocket shapes and have every little experience with stuff like this but it would be great if someone could shed some light on this for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-05T16:03:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPractical reasons, Falcon 9 is 3.6 meter in diameter to be easy to transport on road.
