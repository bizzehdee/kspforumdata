Since Apollo, NASA has been tied up with the expensive Space Shuttle program. More recently, it has been focused on building and operating the ISS, which has also consumed a great deal of time and money. We could endlessly debate the relative costs versus the benefits of these programs. However, they have nonetheless kept NASA tied up in LEO.\n\nThankfully, an end to this deadlock is in sight. The Shuttle has stopped flying, and the Space Station will also stop flying at some point in the 2020s. Concurrent with this, we see a rear guard action being fought by the \u0022old space\u0022 establishment, with the use of Space Shuttle era technology to build the SLS heavy lift rocket, which is suitable for launching missions to interplanetary destinations. There are concerns about the cost effectiveness of SLS, but it does nonetheless demonstrate a strong political commitment in principle to human spaceflight beyond Low Earth Orbit. At the same time, we see \u0022new space\u0022 finally starting to come of age. Commercial space companies are sending cargo to the ISS at prices that \u0022old space\u0022 could have only dreamed of achieving. Commercial crew will follow soon. Proposals to adapt such systems to un-crewed BEO missions are already being submitted. [http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2015/05/falcon-heavy-dragon-solar-system-explorer/](http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2015/05/falcon-heavy-dragon-solar-system-explorer/)\n\nThe big change is that there is an acknowledgement that the ISS will have to be followed by something beyond Low Earth Orbit. However, NASA are currently constrained to develop missions based around SLS and Orion, along with the \u0022old space\u0022 thinking that goes with them. We therefore hear of expensive \u0022flags and footprints\u0022 mission proposals that cost too much and achieve too little. We had already heard of the Constellation program, which offered to replicate the Apollo missions of almost fifty years ago (at much greater cost). More recently, we hear of proposed Mars missions that either don\u0027t land at all, or offer ineffectual \u0022short stay\u0022 (flags and footprints only) missions that achieve very little actual exploration. We are assured that these missions will nonetheless allow astronauts to perform exploration through telerobotics, which offer the advantage of reduced time delay compared to operation from Earth, but don\u0027t even come close to justifying the increase cost and risk to the astronauts\u0027 lives in undertaking such missions!\n\nIt\u0027s little wonder then that many have drawn comparisons to the huge returns achieved by NASA\u0027s JPL robotic missions. Studies undertaken at Moon and Mars analogues on Earth have shown that human investigators can offer vast advantages over robotic missions, but only if they have sufficient time and mobility to exploit their advantages! It has been estimated that the useful data return from the three day \u0022J Class\u0022 Apollo missions (Apollo 15, 16 and 17) is roughly equivalent to a Mars rover mission such as Opportunity or Curiosity conducted over several years. If human explorers can only visit destinations such as the Moon and Mars for a few days, or at most a few weeks, then there is no way that the increased cost and danger can be justified!\n\nThe biggest obstacle to present day useful human spaceflight is the cost of space transportation and logistical support and their destination location. The obvious way to address this problem is to buy transportation services from \u0022new space\u0022. Let\u0027s look at the ISS as an example: The ISS is considered to be the pinnacle of present day human spaceflight achievement. Most of the transportation services required to support the ISS are provided by or purchased from the Russians. This is because the Russians are offering lower prices. \u0022New Space\u0022 companies are now being allowed to compete for the chance to send cargo and crew to the ISS. Sooner or later, the ISS will stop flying. Current NASA proposals for Mars missions make no use of Commercial Space or International Partners. What will the international space community do once the ISS stops flying?\n\nAn obvious solution is to allow a combination of international cooperation and \u0022New Space\u0022 to provide transportation services to BEO bases supported by In-Situ Resource Utilisation. The best solution that has been offered so far is Robert Zubrin\u0027s Mars Direct plan. This concept may not be familiar to everyone. I\u0027ll summarise it here as best I can. This plan was originally designed to be used in the \u0022Old Space\u0022 environment, using Shuttle derived launch vehicles. The plan is however readily adaptable to \u0022New Space\u0022.\n\nZubrin\u0027s plan solves the logistic problems of Mars missions by producing the fuels and consumables needed for Mars exploration from local materials instead of importing them from Earth. The chemical reactors needed to do this have already been tested in simulated Mars environments. Martian resources are used not only to sustain the crew on the surface, but are also used to provide liquid fuels to run ground vehicles and auxiliary power generators.\n\nThe crew spend six months flying to Mars, using tethered artificial gravity to protect their bodies from de-conditioning. Radiation protection is provided by a solar flare storm shelter. Cosmic ray dosage (total Mars spaceflight mission dosages have already experienced by long duration Earth orbiting astronauts) has already been assessed. The crew stay on Mars for a year and a half, making use of their mobility to explore large areas of the Martian surface. Once resources on the surface have been properly assessed, a site will be chosen for a permanent base.\n\nSince the launch window to Mars only opens every two years: there will be ample opportunity to support a Moon base and missions to LEOs."},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T17:23:29Z","Content":"Please see the other threads that cover Zubrin\u0027s plan.

Some have been proposed by national space agencies as a technological stepping stone prior to attempting missions to BEO destinations. If the International Space Station had been truly international in scope, there would be no need for a separate Chinese or BRICs\u0027 station. These represent an unnecessary duplication of effort!\n\nCommercially operated stations have also been proposed. Hotels, research labs, and specialised manufacturing facilities have all been suggested. These ventures would be entirely paid for by private capital as for-profit business ventures. These are dependant on lowering of launch costs to levels deemed acceptable to potential investors and customers.\n\nAs far as NASA is concerned, there is a requirement for a space exploration program that takes the agency beyond Low Earth Orbit. US taxpayers are currently funding the development of SLS and Orion. These have been promised as a means of flying exploration missions to Mars in the 2030s. However, these missions offer \u0022flags and footprints\u0022 with little meaningful exploration achieved. These missions are designed to keep SLS and Orion occupied, but make no mention of what Commercial Space and any international partners are supposed to do with themselves while all of this is happening.\n\nAssuming a very conservative outlook from all concerned, NASA could abandon their Mars ambitions and concentrate on establishing an internationally operated Moon base. Many of the national space agencies have announced their own Moon plans concurrent with the George Bush Junior Vision for Space Exploration (VSE). The main obstacle to Mars missions is the lack of suitable launch vehicles and transportation systems needed to get there. Once a Moon base was established, it wouldn\u0027t be terribly difficult to take the next step and establish a similar base on Mars, or other BEO destinations.\n\nThe main initial incentive for establishing a Moon base would be the construction of interferometer telescopes. While space-based telescopes can observe frequencies that are not observable from Earth, and the far side of the Moon offers a radio emissions quiet dead zone for radio astronomy, the Moon offers the added advantage of a geologically dead platform for building long-exposure interferometers. These are telescope arrays that require extremely precise knowledge of the distances between the telescopes in the array. Geological activity prevents the construction of such arrays on Earth. Orbital mechanics prevents construction of free floating arrays in space. In principle, the aperture size of such arrays is limited only by the size of the Moon itself.\n\nThink of the scientific discoveries offered by the Hubble Space Telescope and the Kepler planet hunter mission. Imagine what discoveries could be made by Moon based telescopes with the advantage of long exposure times and effectively unlimited aperture sizes and image resolution?! Such telescopes could allow us to unlock the secrets of the early Universe, allowing us to study the formation of early galaxies and stars. They will also allow us to directly image exoplanets, allowing us to learn as much about them as we can presently learn about our interplanetary neighbours using present day telescopes. Just as Hubble offered the secrets of our universe to the Stephen Hawkings of our day, so will giant telescope arrays offer unimagined knowledge to the physicists of future generations.\n\nEarth\u0027s moon is resource poor and is ill-suited to large scale human settlement, but that doesn\u0027t mean that it has no value to a spacefaring human civilisation.\n\nA more ambitious plan would be to send humans to Mars. Mars is a long-term goal that offers the prospect of a new branch of human civilisation. Mars is seen by some as too far away and too hard, but it can be reached with the same chemical propulsion systems needed to reach Earth\u0027s Moon.\n\nMars is the most Earth-like destination available in our own solar system. It can support food production and industrialised civilisation. Additionally, it lies within easy reach of the main asteroid belt.\n\nRobert Zubrin\u0027s Mars Direct plan allows for simultaneous establishment of Moon and Mars bases as well as outposts on Near Earth Asteroids. What matters is that outposts can be established in places that can be readily supported by space transportation services offered by both \u0022Old Space\u0022 and \u0022New Space\u0022. Just as the ISS is currently supported by commercial cargo and crew, so can BEO outposts be supported in the same way. International partners can support transportation to any or all of these destinations.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T21:30:05Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 09:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Torquemadus**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T05:25:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E As far as NASA is concerned, there is a requirement for a space exploration program that takes the agency beyond Low Earth Orbit.
