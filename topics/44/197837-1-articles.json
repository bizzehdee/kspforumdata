I don\u0027t think so. For one, given specific angles, 99.99% for visible and near IR is achievable with modern tech. As Q switched lasers often use. My question is then why are you trying to reflect blackbody temperature equivalency of like 10000 K \u002B? Also your engine needs to be able to survive emitting at that temperature which isn\u0027t easy. And that engine is probably not aneutronic. Reflecting neutrons efficiently is not nearly as simple as reflecting photons efficiently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have heard the idea proposed that microwaves in a plasma faraday cage under certain conditions (believed to be present in ball lightning by the study authors) would have something like within 10^-11 of perfect efficiency in a microwave cavity, allowing the microwaves to bounce around inside like some crazy photon gas for extended periods of time. But again that\u0027s only microwaves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for nuclear pulse, one, there\u0027s a pretty good amount of force there. With very efficient ablative mirrors you can indeed get about an equal mass loss of the weight of the nuke in the pusher plate/sail but you need it to survive a close range nuclear detonation and all the forces that imparts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-11-06T03:49:17Z\u0022 title=\u002211/06/2020 03:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 6, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Pds314\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vv3k70r","CreatedById":208078,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-11T11:07:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223875512\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022197837\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221604164629\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022197504\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spacescifi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 10/31/2020 at 6:17 PM, Spacescifi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeaning that 100% reflection is impossible?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDifraction and nonelastic scatering prevent any material (because of wavelength determine the atomic positions) in terms of atoms (build of core and electrons) from such use (atoms are simply to big for such a 100% lens/mirror).
