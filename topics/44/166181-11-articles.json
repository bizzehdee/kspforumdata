As long as we are talking about \u003Cstrong\u003Espare parts\u003C/strong\u003E you don\u0027t have exactly the same problem as you do landing and taking off living people on Mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLanding small objects on Mars is alot easier than landing large objects. You could have a companion ship escort your travelers and parts shipments sent to the surface when need from LMO. Im not trying to minimize the problem but we really have to differentiate two problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven an launch window, getting the physical human being to Mars is not a problem that much more complex than putting physical human beings in orbit about the moon. The work required to keep them alive is magnitude harder, but ISS is but a prototype survival unit, improvement have been made. Even so getting even one section of the ISS to the Mars surface is a monumental task. Getting it back in orbit is nearly impossible without better and more efficient engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo by definition we are going to initially be putting something small and manageable on Mars. This translates to extremely utilitarian structures. The next issue is how to do it. From a basic physics stand point if you want to put people on Mars and retrieve them, each person should go down as a single ship (one that can return to Orbit) but the ship itself would not be a habitat. So the habitat is something that could be assembled on dusty old mars (6000kg Per F9 launch with an ION Driven carrier but size would dictate a decent amount of fuel spent to land).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we are assuming the landed station is built at a time before humanization, then its not a problem to stock pile parts . . . . . . A sealed dumpster on the outside of the habitat could hold parts. Again, since parts are not living and not food . . .you can send them up to Earth L2 have a circulator pick them up and wander to Mars L2 then detach the ship for Mars reentry and landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have worked on some of the types of equipment that you might find on ISS. I have repaired a great many pieces of equipment. The largest piece I can recall was a power supply with about 12 different power feeds. It weighed about 15 lbs. Properly wrapped you could probably drop on Mars at 50 m/s and it would survive. These things are small you could drop them an inflatable heat shield over the target site and an airbag on landing, have one of those humans retrieve them. Most everything else are integrated circuit boards (which on many modern pieces means replace equipment).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are shipping fat to Mars you can simply embed a single wrapped circuit board in the oil and cool it to 4\u0027C, its now protected. lol. Ship it in the food supply.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you are shipping whole grains just put them in the bags of grain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs per the dust issue. . . .I agree . . . . I keep making the argument that the settlements on Mars should be built into the Martian landscape, not on top of them. Its just another in a long list of reasons not to be on the surface.

This is the major difference between the ISS and what you place on Mars. If you are aerobraking down to the planet (Thrusting down can cost as much at 4500 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E), the size of something is very important. Friction is a function of surface area, but force is a function of mass, mass that exist in 3-dimensonal space. As you increase the size of a sphere with constant density the equilibrium velocity at any given air density is going to increase. So for instance if you double the volume the equilibrium velocity increases by 20 to 40% and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe issue of size with the ISS, if we recall the complaints that have been repeated here \u003Cem\u003Ead-nausea\u003C/em\u003E in the past, was that the designated habitat launch vehicle was the STS. The STS has a limit on size given its cargo bay. It is not necessary a limitation on weight, but exterior volume only. Overtime the space shuttle was equipped to launch even more mass and could have launched habitats even double the weight (41% larger diameter) BUT could never launch structures of larger diameter. As a consequence the Shuttle is what determined the form-factor of the space station. Today there are many options, including ION driven systems to help station the ISS. With more efficient launch vehicles there is no problem getting humans or supplies to much higher orbits than previously desired.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe also forget that the STS is not the biggest or most payload worthy rocket that has been produced. THe primary problem with Payload Diameters is the aerodynamics below 30,000 meters. Part of this can be circumvented by launching and Alpine altitudes (also increase \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E) that establishes a Max Q at a higher altitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone want to see my space factory?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ZgDSHhh.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022447\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ZgDSHhh.png\u0022 width=\u0022967\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe design was supposed to have a sealable bay door but I could not work out a way to install it and animate it.

The side pieces (constructed of 3 pieces, two of which are pressurized and have enterior structure capable of part manufactoring or assembly. The three veiwing decks in the Top right are added to the interior. These act as a final assembly area for larger parts and have a large door capable of individuals parts up to a meter in diameter. There are 3 docking ports close by as well as a downward facing 2\u002B meter docking port.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis particular was designed to be assembled in space starting with the central 12 sided central access facility with 12 closable doors a viewing area centered by a docking port (2\u002B meter diameter). The sides of each peice have a rubber gasket and act as a second line of defense against leaks. They are strung together loosely in space and then in a predesignated compartment the bindings are contracted drawing the vessels together once drawn each peice is bolted to the next from inside the pressure vessel using pressure tight mechanism. The End pieces are bolted from the outside together since they lack a pressure compartment. Because of the size of the vehicle and its shape if can be spun to provide a non-inertial environment for crew. When the End plate door is shut the viewing deck is virtually free of cosmic radiation due to the number and thickness of 3 walls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe point I am making is that the ISS was not designed to be a space factory but an STS resourced science station.
