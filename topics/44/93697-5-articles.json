My guess is that the Black Arrow had a catalyst somewhere in the combustion chamber, to decompose some of the peroxide to hot oxygen and superheated steam, the reaction of which is highly exothermic, in order to ignite the rest of the peroxide, if any, with the kerosene fuel. Both the kerosene and peroxide had nothing but hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen molecules in it, so if done correctly, we\u0027d get a hypergolic rocket with an exhaust gas composition similar to kerosene/LOX rockets. It may not look like much, but it\u0027s definitely better than UDMH/N2O4 hypergols which throw off nitrogen oxides by the tons.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T07:24:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewe should ban people asking to ban stuff... hmm...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"78stonewobble","CreatedById":97559,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T09:58:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NERVAfan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NERVAfan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYeah, that\u0027s tiny on a planetary scale. \u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think solar is necessarily a good idea for cloudy high-latitude countries like the UK.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027re talking about converting the entire world energy infrastructure; no matter what you do, it\u0027ll pretty much be a megaproject.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think water vapor is \u0022a much more capable greenhouse gas\u0022 at least \u003Cem\u003Ein the current situation\u003C/em\u003E. These things are situation dependent; when you have a tiny amount of a particular greenhouse gas, every little bit has a big effect.
