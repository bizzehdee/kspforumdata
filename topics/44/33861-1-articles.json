I want to be able to cover most parts of a general rocket. What I have set up in Google Docs right now are four folders that are based off of function. I saw something similar on the NASA site and used it. I have propulsion, structure, cargo and electronic systems. Within those folders, I have folders for corresponding systems; capsules, communication, power systems, rocket engines, fuel systems, fuel types, guidance and control systems, and structure and support parts. I also want to have other folders talking about the actual equations and formulas behind what makes a rocket do what it does. Do I have a good system so far? Each of the systems is a folder, and I can put multiple documents in them in order to have resources I can refer to for notes. What resources can I use in order to add to the notes? I have some so far. Sorry if this is the wrong place, and thanks for any help!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
