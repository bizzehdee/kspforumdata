Like the already mentioned fact that someone needs to build the satellite, manage the ground station (possibly build one), test, test, test and then test some more that all the systems work, make the contract with the launcher, take responsibility for it, go to a meeting or two, manage the delivery of the satellite to the launch agency IN TIME, operate and manage the ground station after the launch, manage all the legal and paperwork and take personal responsibility for the not-so-little 100k\u002B dollars of money involved. Don\u0027t be offended is SQUAD isn\u0027t jumping on the chance to promote this project until someone actually steps up to handle all the organization involved. If something goes wrong and the 100k gets wasted or missing you can only imagine the bad PR for SQUAD.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m 100% confident that people on this forum have the ability to build some kind of CubeSat, it\u0027s the other stuff I\u0027m more worried about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrue.

In almost three years of hanging around this community, I\u0027ve observed that playing KSP gives players the mistaken impression that spaceflight is easy. It isn\u0027t. When you\u0027re 16, 18 or even 22, anything can seem possible, but the sad reality is that it isn\u0027t.

A cubesat in LEO is achievable but not very interesting and won\u0027t fire people\u0027s imaginations. A cubesat landing on Phobos is interesting but would sound (to anyone with the real means to make it happen) like the delusions of a dreamer.
