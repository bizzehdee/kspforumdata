In order to turn in one direction continuously, one or the other fields must be able to change polarity twice per revolution.

But you could use an electromagnet if you wish. It\u0027s more complex, but you\u0027d have no net magnetic field when the device is switched off. Some applications might call for such behavior, but I can\u0027t think of any off the top of my head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo\u2026no. You can build a motor with two electromagnets, or one electro- and one permanent, but not with two permanents.

Think of them as springs, can\u0027t power a motor with a spring. Or you can, but first you have to compress it, and then you only get out what you put in (at most).
