Now, we haven\u0027t seen major impact crater yet, however bear in mind that 1) resurficing on Pluto is still ongoing as ices sublimate and deposit 2) while it is true that in the outer solar system impacts almost never exceed 1-2 km/s, Pluto and Charon are also small bodies, so you don\u0027t necessarily need a huge impactor to generate some heat. Plus, I\u0027ve heard others say that even just the seasonal sublimation/freezing cycle could lead to asymmetrical mass re-distributions which in turn could lead to some imbalance in the locked system and generate heat. And even if that wasn\u0027t the case, any imbalance of any other nature could be amplified by a positive feedback resonance. You know, Pluto is perturbed, the perturbation is transferred to Charon, then back to Pluto etc. I suspect that after a while things would settle down, but I guess it\u0027s at least plausible that this tidal lock relationship could be amplifying some activity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwi1960","CreatedById":81697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T23:04:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spock1108\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Spock1108\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk, This processing is magnificent!\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/11216820_10204656102028814_7778036144301772582_n.jpg?oh=0d489dc5a577fc0c3cbca6492a58612a\u0026amp;oe=564CDC06\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/11216820_10204656102028814_7778036144301772582_n.jpg?oh=0d489dc5a577fc0c3cbca6492a58612a\u0026amp;oe=564CDC06\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, landing site selected then... who are we gunna send, Jeb?

So Neptune isn\u0027t really clearing anything, it\u0027s just throwing things around. Sure, in the past it probably cleared up a lot of stuff, but a lot of it survived too and still exists today. That\u0027s even more evident if you considered the scattered disk too. Sure, it\u0027s not part of the Kuiper belt, but most of the SDOs dive deep into it for most of their orbital paths.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-Velocity-","CreatedById":74097,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T00:11:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kiwi1960\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kiwi1960\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, landing site selected then... who are we gunna send, Jeb?
