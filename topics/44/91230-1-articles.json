The classic book \u003Cem\u003EIgnition!\u003C/em\u003E references this as why, e.g. white fuming nitric acid was less of a problem; it decomposes, but not exothermically (so it doesn\u0027t self-accelerate).

On the other hand, H2O2 \u002B jet fuel \u002B spark equals a fuel-air bomb as the fire vaporizes the fuel and the peroxide and oxygen mix with it before detonating.\u003Cp\u003EFor a tactical missile, you want storable propellant that\u0027s usable in a wide range of temperatures, which in the late 50s came to mean IRFNA \u002B UDMH. For an ICBM that lives in a steam-heated hole, N\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003EO\u003Csub\u003E4\u003C/sub\u003E that would be frozen in a severe winter offers better performance. But you can\u0027t use cryogenic propellants, and you especially can\u0027t use hydrogen that will jolly well leak through the tank walls. The US and USSR grudgingly accepted ballistic missiles that needed to be fueled right before launch, but only for the first (Atlas/Redstone/R-7) types. Nobody is going to stand around a battlefield pouring (toxic, corrosive, explosive) propellant into a rocket. And nobody wants the ICBMs to be warned that there\u0027s an incoming strike, but it\u0027ll be an hour before they\u0027re fueled to shoot back. So practical missiles needed storable propellants (although ICBMs didn\u0027t need a low freezing point). The really early stuff had the worst of both worlds, propellants that were awful to handle \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E ate the tanks so you couldn\u0027t store them in the rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then, as nuclear warheads got lighter and solid rockets got better, missiles pretty much all switched over. Yes, liquids have higher performance, but solids are more reliable. If you need more oomph, use a bigger rocket. On the other hand, space launchers care very much about the performance (and frequently want to throttle the rocket), don\u0027t want to deal with really nasty chemicals, and don\u0027t really give a damn whether their propellant is cryogenic. Thus, hydrocarbons or liquid hydrogen burned with liquid oxygen. Until you get to thrusters in space, which again have to switch back to storable propellants, and hypergolic combinations like UDMH and nitric acid/N\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003EO\u003Csub\u003E4\u003C/sub\u003E also make the rocket design a lot simpler and more reliable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe really exotic stuff, like fluorine and boron compounds, are just never going to make it. Yes, higher performance, but the military doesn\u0027t care (or want to deal with the handling problems) and if the space agencies were willing to deal with hydrogen fluoride everywhere, why not switch to a nuclear rocket? Higher performance, less hassle.

Keeping all three in liquid form was a nightmare, though. This is because at some point, despite high combustion energy, you\u0027re starting to lose efficiency due to high molar mass of the exhaust. As such, the most efficient rocket would actually use the combustion energy to heat up hydrogen, not only reaction products. This kind of \u0022chemical thermal\u0022 propulsion can also work with air, BTW (there were experiments with using this in ICBMs, but not much came of them), meaning you get free reaction mass when you need it the most.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"architeuthis","CreatedById":57137,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T01:28:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhy the half-measures?
