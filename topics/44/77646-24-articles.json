In general, the simpler organisms tend to survive more while the more complex organisms are likely to die off during succession. Over time the culture becomes senescent and mostly dies off, a process which unfortunately can take vastly different amounts of time for seemingly identical cultures**.

The gravity gradient will be extreme with such a small centrifuge so I\u0027m not sure how accurate it would be but any data is better than what we have now.

We cannot just have a plastic bag inflate and call it good. First it needs to be strong enough to take the pressure of the air (I think the air pressure at sea level is 14.7-ish PSI). Then it needs to be a material that will not degrade in the high UV environment or outgas into the enclosed space. Finally, if we want to have the plant chamber exposed to the sun, it is very difficult and expensive to get any sort of flexible window to do this. If we have a rigid container, we can simply have one of the walls be a plate of an appropriate material with the proper coatings to do the job while the method of attachment is very simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as weight balancing goes, I am a fan of having the probe be bilaterally symmetrical.

If designed properly, it could be possible for the mesh to hold the soil in place, but when the plants begin to grow they poke through. There are meshes used for this purpose on recently sculpted land masses, though admittedly they are not going to be dealing with 5Gs and vibrations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not super crazy about the tethered cubesat approach (where the cubesat separates and spins, connected by a tether). It will help with the \u0027gravitational\u0027 gradient definitely, but I am worried about the complexity required. If anything I think this approach ends up being even more dependent on proper balancing than a \u0027simple\u0027 axis rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough it would reduce the size of any given section as well as increase the mechanical complexity somewhat drastically, one possibility that occured to me is that we could actually break out the habitat into sections that deploy axially. I am attempting to think of a good way to explain it, but imagine if we had a 3U cubesat. The middle segment is command and control, the two ends each contain 4 habitats. Once in orbit, the system deploys the habitats where they hinge out unfolding from the center until the probe assumes a sort of barbell shape. Once it begins to spin, you now have 8 habitats all with the same gravity, each with its own plant payload (greenbeans in one, bamboo in another, potatoes, etc). Of course each habitat would likely be shaped like a triangular prism to fit this design. An additional downside would be that our sensor system would likely be reduced because we would be required to give each habitat its own sensor system. It would be way too difficult to have a probe that could move from one habitat to the next (a moving mass in a small rotating system would be a bad idea, plus the mechanical complexity). As far as another advantage, if we did it this way we likely wouldn\u0027t care too much about the orientation of the probe with relation to its spin. At least 4 of the habitats are likely to receive light.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"christok","CreatedById":93810,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T18:55:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Creature\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Creature\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ll have to look if I can find that Churchill\u0027s book.

ISBN 1-56347-524-3) to see what sorts of margins we will need in our initial design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The closest to our category of spacecraft of a completely new design needs to count on a 50% mass increase from the initial bidding stage. (p. 26)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Our design should also not exceed 50% of the throughput capacity of the computer we choose. (p. 37)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Our thermal design needs the ability to handle 35C higher than the expected temperature maximum we calculate and 35C lower than the minimum we calculate (10C on either side for the \u0022flight allowable\u0022 temperature, another 10C for our qualification and an additional 15C for the difference between what we design for and what we qualify the satellite at). We should calculate the thermal requirements on a per-component basis rather than a craft average. (p. 37) I am particularly worried about thermal design. As this satellite will carry living organisms with definite temperature requirements, without the battery capacity for any significant heating on the night side and with a very high surface:volume ratio, we will need to take care.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 40% margin on battery capacity.

We can significantly increase our power budget if the panels point towards the sun. Perhaps we can initially have panels on four sides of the cube, facing outwards so as to provide a smaller amount of power as long as any of them face the sun. When we are ready to spin up, we rotate the craft so that one of the other two sides faces the sun. On that side, the panels are hinged (without any motors) and the opposite side is attached with a once-off release mechanism. We then release the panels and spin the satellite up, allowing centrifugal effects to extend the panels.

Anything with a decent probability of working (especially repeatedly) is expensive to buy and we have too high a chance of mission failure if we try and design it ourselves. If it is problematic to deploy the panels with spin, I have two alternative ideas. 1: We release them with (very weak) springs before spinning up. 2: We add a few small coils of wire and deploy with electromagnetic repulsion.

One of the facts I got from Musgrave\u0027s documentation was that plants suffer from a problem NASA realized humans have. If a human is strapped down and sleeping (basically not moving) he will eventually suffocate on his own CO2 because it isn\u0027t mixing with the surrounding air. For plants it is the same thing, except they would be unable to reach CO2 because of all the Oxygen. This actually brings up another issue she spoke about. Depending on our plant choice, we would need some method of converting the oxygen to CO2. Otherwise our plants will kill themselves by removing what they need to breath entirely from the environment. One solution provided was to have a local storage of CO2 that you can use to keep the plants \u0027fed\u0027.

If we rigged it right, we could have the on board cameras constantly piping visual data to a small SD card (or something similar) in the module. If recovered we could add info to the discussion about what it looks like inside a craft as it re-enters. If we had the mini-arm, we could even save a sample of plant matter.
