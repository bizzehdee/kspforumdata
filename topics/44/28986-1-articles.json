A bullet costs the same no matter how fast you launch it from a magnetic accelerator cannon. To achieve the same kind of energy as a .04c round with an explosive or accelerate a projectile to that speed with even a fusion drive to allow mid flight course corrections is prohibitive. Also their is minimum distance to consider, if your opponent appears in high orbit as they do in the halo series close range engagement become a reality, only a cannon can deliver that 0 distance hit without damaging itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for projectile breakup it really has little effect at those speeds you are firing a kinetic slug. If the slug is not intact you have bits of the ship flying out the back at either a higher speed or more likely a higher mass. At those speeds terminal ballistics break down, you are not shooting them per see, but delivering a blow of kinetic energy that their ship cannot sustain. Any energy after initial impact is maintained in some form either high mass or high speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor lasers being better just look at current military projects. The navy is developing rail gun upgrades for their main cannons and the air force is working on anti missile lasers. The navy is almost done but the air force cannot make a laser with enough power without using chemical based lasers that need their chemical components reloaded after a few shots. Whops their goes the whole laser system if you have to fire multiple times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecoil in space has no backstop like on earth. A massive station would be able to correct course over a greater time perhaps even entirely after the battle however the energy requirements are the same. It may actually require less energy to keep a lighter station in orbit if you could deliver the thrust fast enough as you are accelerating a smaller mass after a few shots than a large station where the mass change is unnoticeable. Even a light station firing 600 ton projectiles I would imagine would weigh in at 4000 tons or more given only 50 rounds aboard.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EatThePath","CreatedById":123,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T13:58:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, first off the navy railgun isn\u0027t that near ready for deployment yet as far as I\u0027m aware.

Let us take a UNSC frigate as an example. I don\u0027t think they\u0027re given a mass anywhere, but they are given some dimensions on the halo fan wiki. The smallest is the Stalwart class, at 478m by 152m by 112m.

At least it suggests that Halo-humanity is a very solid type 1 on the good old Kardashev scale. I hope you see why the coilguns Halo uses are horrible weapons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut according to Newton every action triggers a reaction, so according to conservation of momentum the same amount of energy pushes the MAC \u0022backwards\u0022. To calculate the resulting delta v we would need the mass of the station ... which we sadly do not have. What we do have, however, is the mass of UNSC warships and the MAC rounds they fire (although it is implied that super-MACs are relatively lightweight). A Marathon-class heavy cruiser has a mass of 100,000 tons (yes, a kilometer-long scifi-warship is lighter than WW2 battleships. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E) and fires 600 ton slugs. This would put the mass of a orbital defense station at about 500,000 tons. Now it is a simply matter of rearranging the equation from the beginning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ev\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2=1/2m/E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ev=sqrt(1/2m/e)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ev\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2=(1/2*500,000)/216,000,000,000,000,000=1.157*10^-12\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ev=sqrt(1.157*10^-12)=1.075*10^-6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is ... disappointingly low. Probably my math is wrong somewhere. I totally want this things to be violently deorbitted/escaping Earths SOI. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
