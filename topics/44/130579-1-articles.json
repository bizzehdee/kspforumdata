New Frontiers missions have a cost cap of $1 Billion, and are used for medium class missions larger than discovery, but smaller than Flagship. Keep in mind that we know little about the design of these probes themselves, so this thread is more about where you would launch a mission. Missions may use an RTG or Ion Drive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Frontiers_program\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Frontiers_program\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThere are 6 Mission proposals being considered currently:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETitan/Enceledus Mission:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNASA recently sent out a call for New Frontiers proposals to study Titan and/or Enceladus.
