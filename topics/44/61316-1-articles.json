If we don\u0027t find life there, it\u0027s going to be a very important find. You simply can\u0027t go wrong with this one. In contrast, life on Europa or Mars could be of the same origin as terrestrial life, making it a good find, but nowhere near as useful one in the big picture. We already know that life can be carried between planets on asteroids. What we need to know are the odds of life evolving independently in two different environments.
