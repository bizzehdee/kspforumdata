I thought maybe some people on here would know or know where to point me. I was hoping to find out how much electricity is needed (in watt-hours, mAh, whatever unit, really) is needed to run an experiment on different devices, such as:\n\nAn Alpha Proton X-Ray Spectrometer, like the ones on the MER rovers and Sojourner.\n\nCuriosity\u0027s ChemCam.\n\nA Gas Chromatographer (any model, really)\n\nAccelerometers (Do these run all the time?)\n\nEct. Literally the only hard number I could find was basically \u0022it takes 1.5 watts to run ChemCam\u0022 which I am very suspicious of. \n\nAnybody know where to look? Or how to find out these numbers?\n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"Newt","CreatedById":131025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T04:57:40Z","Content":"I could potentially ask some people who work on those things, but they are more on the sciencey end than the engineering one.\n\nFor MER, [this](http://hobbiton.thisside.net/rovermanual/) site has distilled some information from seemingly reputable, and linked, sources.

If other resources are available to you, google is seldom the best means to search for this sort of technical information. I am more familiar with how to get science than engineering articles, but if you have access, I would be willing to look through some such sources, to see what I can find."},{"CreatedByName":"-ctn-","CreatedById":130898,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T14:23:02Z","Content":"Thank you!

It follows two rovers on the surface of Titan, and I was trying to find the wattage necessary to run systems so I can calculate what size batteries and RTG they would need, since that also influences the look of the design.
