I guess it all depends on what the demand is from the other side. Most likely they\u0026#39;d like stuff that we have that you can\u0026#39;t easily find in other places around space. Raw materials seems unlikely. Most of the stuff that can be found on earth can be found elsewhere on other planets. Heck, even martian soil isn\u0026#39;t that different from earth soil (barring the presence of perchlorate salts).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe only real thing that comes to mind that might be interesting is either\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\na) large quantities of refined or highly concentrated materials. But only if for some reason said materials are rare or highly valuable to our partners\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nb) Anything which absolutely requires earth-like conditions to be formed. If it\u0026#39;s easier/cheaper to perform the manufacturing process here on earth and then transport to someplace else rather then creating earth-like conditions someplace else and manufacturing there, then you have a good scenario for trade. Of course, for this to happen, our trade partners would need to live in radically different conditions than us. There is also the possibility that stuff that we consider simple by-product might be very valuable to our trade partners. That also opens up trade possibilities.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBasically it all comes down to perception. What does earth have to offer? Anything and everything that you find and that our trade partners would value highly. Whether or not we\u0026#39;d be willing to part with it is another question of course, but my money would be on \u0022stuff that requires earth-like conditions and/or human interference to be created\u0022.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T12:12:33Z","Content":"\nSome things that they might seek or we might offer, the specifics to be left to the imagination of the reader:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n- hospitable environment compatible to their needs\u003Cbr\u003E\n- military staging area and supporting manpower\u003Cbr\u003E\n- a workforce more flexible than robots, selfmaintaining and easy to reproduce\u003Cbr\u003E\n- lifestock/prey/hosts for parasitic reproduction (dead homeworld, trip on generation ship to long already, etc.)\u003Cbr\u003E\n- biological compounds of medicinal value\u003Cbr\u003E\n- stories/intellectual exchange/answers to their big questions\u003Cbr\u003E\n- another perspective on life, the universe and everything\u003Cbr\u003E\n- ancient artifacts (ancient astronaut cult, no matter if true or not)\u003Cbr\u003E\n- new food for the minds of a species that has explored itself and its world completely\u003Cbr\u003E\n- company in the wide empty void\u003Cbr\u003E\n- someone to take care for\u003Cbr\u003E\n- refuge for their offspring (from war, plague, etc.)\u003Cbr\u003E\n- someone to remember their dying species\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hugix","CreatedById":55379,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T13:01:25Z","Content":"\nWe have digital watches to offer.
