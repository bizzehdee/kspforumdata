So you end up with a big NERVA engine with half empty fuel tanks in orbit.

Preform the ejection burn and go for Mars. Once the ejection burn is done you can inflate all your hab modules and clean your wet workshop. Then you\u0027ll spend the next 6 months twiddling your thumbs as you wait for Mars. I\u0027m thinking a crew of 6 will do, trained in various sciences obviously.

Use the last dregs of fuel to slow yourself down to enter a highly elliptic orbit and use the next few months to slowly aerobrake into a circular orbit. Maybe send out a few trips to Phobos and Deimos since you\u0027re there anyway. Asteroid landings are cheap on fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStep 6:\u003C/strong\u003E Landing. The first things to go down should be a power supply and some life support. After that you can send the crew and habitation modules in any order. If your drive stage was a wet workshop leave it in orbit for future missions, else just dump it into the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom here on out you keep it supplied with food and water via relatively cheap care packages.
