What about personal weapons? What kind of weapons would our Space Marine uses in space, perhaps? What kind of challenges and obstacles that we will need to handle in designing these weapons? What types of weapons would we have for what purposes and in what kind of situations? In sci-fi, we have seen serveral kinds of weapons, from conventional bullets spewers to blasters firing lasers, but I doubt they would be all there is.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor example, such high powered weapons could severely damage equipments and hull, which could mean death in space thus necessitate a type of weapon that only damage or incapacitate another biological being. Or think about the cramping space within a space craft and the possibility that a close-quarter melee weapon may in fact be more viable if the user has the skill to use it in microgravity. Or what about EVA weapons, when one is hooked up inside a huge suit and doing boarding another space craft, possibly fighting defence system from outside?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor this discussion, I think we should limit our scope to near-future technology, so we wouldn\u0026#39;t have fancy things that bend laws of physics like teleportation or forcefield, but nanobots, monofilament whips, and energy weapons are still permitted.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo go ahead and discuss what you think the future of personal space combat will be. No need to discuss whether we actually need to do space combat in person or not...lets hand wave that for now.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T12:22:32Z","Content":"\nBullets sound like a bad idea because of recoil, so i\u0026#39;d say a big powerful laser that will cut through the other guy\u0026#39;s suit in no time.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T12:34:00Z","Content":"\nI remember in a scifi story I read, the choice weapons for security forces on a generation ship are pneumatic guns that shoot plastic darts, which deal minimal damage to the interior and equipment, no fire to spark up, and essentially endless propellent when resources are limited.

For keeping order inside a space station or spaceship, I think you\u0026#39;d want to use tasers - either the extending prong kind or the kind that shoot low velocity bullets that shock people from a greater distance.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWell, what if the unruly populace make themselves anti-taser armor (basically a suit made of foil)?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen you\u0026#39;d have to use regular bullets. Thing is, I don\u0026#39;t think the risk of a puncture is as bad as it sounds. The material that space habitats will be made of probably will handle getting shot fairly well. That is, there might be a hole, but it won\u0026#39;t lead to a rip, just a slow leak through a small bullet hole. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWell, so long as only one shot is fired. If you are talking about full scale military scuffles, both sides will be wearing pressure suits and the place they are fighting over will be evacuated of air one way or another (either by parties blowing holes in the side so they can board from an unexpected angle, or from the cumulative effect of firing thousands of rounds of ammunition that is designed to punch through space suits...and walls...and everything else)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother factor that would probably prove relevant are :\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n1.

Firearms people talk for hours on the grim subject of \u0022terminal ballistics\u0022, ie. trying to get the victim to bleed out as rapidly as possible, supposedly before they have time to shoot you back. So even if you assume our ray gun is based on visible / infra red laser technology , manufacturers are going to try pretty hard to prevent this from being the case. An obvious answer, which exists with current tech, is to compress the laser energy into very short pulses. The result, rather than acting like a cutting torch, is that the laser vaporises a small piece of the target into plasma, then , as plasma is opaque to electromagnetic radiation, the plasma will absorb the remaining laser energy and become hotter still. After this nanosecond laser pulse has ended , the superheated plasma will expand violently over the coming milliseconds, it will be like setting off an explosive charge against someone\u0026#39;s body.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe problem with this is that it isn\u0026#39;t very lethal either. The energy dissipates in all directions and will probably take the path of least resistance. If you imagine emptying the propellant grain out of a rifle bullet and detonating it against someone\u0026#39;s chest, it\u0026#39;ll leave a small burn and make them very angry, but won\u0026#39;t actually endanger their life. Compared with actually using the same amount of propellant in an actual rifle and shooting them with it, anyway.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, there\u0026#39;s something much more awesome than IR lasers and they already exist. Eximer (ultra violet) lasers as used in surgical procedures.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe thing is, all light, including that from a laser, is transmitted by photons. The brighter the light, the more photons transmitted per second. The higher the wavelength of light, the greater energy each individual photon carries. A light source with the same energy output will therefore emit photons at a lower rate if it is sending out UV than if it is sending out Visible or IR. However , the exiting bit is what happens when they land. Visible / Infra Red photons individually carry less energy than is required to break the chemical bonds of the atoms they strike, so all they do is heat those atoms up a tiny bit. Of course, a sufficiently large deluge of such photons can raise the temperature to the point where things melt, burn or vaporize.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut these UV photons carry just enough energy to break the chemical bonds of the atoms they strike, basically dissociating our body tissues into their constituent elements (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen) with little heating effect. You see them being used in surgery and the tissue just flashes to vapour, but there is no burning or cauterising.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSuch a laser would make a perfect ray gun, because it would penetrate deep without wasting energy, vapourise the flesh in the wound channel and not cauterise anything, so you\u0026#39;d bleed profusely.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T01:22:51Z","Content":"\n^ so basically, disintegrating death ray is possible.\n"}]}
