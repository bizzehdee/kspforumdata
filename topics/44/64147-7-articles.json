So in terms of what we can measure, Oberth results in more velocity than the ship would have without it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, if you read to the bottom of the wiki Oberth page, you\u0027ll see that Oberth\u0027s net effect is multiplying the impulse provided by the engines by some factor based on its orbital parameters at the time. Impulse is the time integral of force. Force is the product of mass and acceleration. If mass is constant or nearly so, then any multiplication of impulse mostly applies to multiplying acceleration. Acceleration is changing velocity. So again, Oberth is measurable by a change in velocity over and above what the engines provide. And because of this, Oberth really is a source of extra thrust, to create the extra acceleration, which results in the extra velocity. This doesn\u0027t violate conservation because this is being sucked out of the exhaust stream.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHere\u0027s where I think you\u0027re running into trouble. When you set a maneuver node and it calculates the effect of that burn, it takes Oberth into account because it is an inherent characteristic of Newtonian physics. It knows what your speed will be at the node, thus it can accurately calculate how much kinetic energy will be added by the burn.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t you see, though, that what you\u0027re saying here is really that the delta-V displayed when you create a node is DVR - DVO = DVE. Which means DVO really is a thing, a specific quantity the game is using to modify the raw DVR derived solely from vector math \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I don\u0027t think this is how the game works. If it is, then the way the game handles Oberth is flawed. This is because while the Oberth Effect in general really is \u0022an inherent characteristic of Newtonian physics\u0022, it does not affect all ships equally. The Oberth effect relies largely on TWR so doesn\u0027t help low-thrust, high-Isp engines as much as it does gas-guzzlers, even though they have the same velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the game knows nothing of a ship\u0027s engines until you run them. If you change to another ship, it forgets what it knew about the 1st ship\u0027s engines until you come back to it and run its engines again. Yet if you create a node for the ship before running its engines, the game still displays a delta-V number, which is either DVR or (DVR - DVO = DVE). But the burn time says \u0022N.A.\u0022, indicating the game doesn\u0027t remember anything about the engines. At least it doesn\u0027t know the TWR, upon which both the burn time and the magnitude of the Oberth effect depend. So, if the burn delta-V displayed is in the form of DVR - DVO, either the game has a generic DVO value it uses regardless of engine type, or it defaults an unknown DVO to zero and the number displayed is raw DVR so now you\u0027ll make too big a burn. Either way, you get the wrong result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, it would make more sense if the what you\u0027re seeing is raw DVR and the DVO is figured into the burn time once you remind the game what type of engine you\u0027ve got. Of course, there\u0027s no guarantee Squad thought of this when they wrote the code so it could well have the problems outlined above. But I figure they had to have known Oberth requires knowledge of TWR, so I think the displayed delta-V is DVR and the DVO is part of the calculated burn time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is, though, no matter how you slice it, there\u0027s a DVO term being taken into account, it\u0027s just on 1 side of the equation or the other. Either DVR = DVE \u002B DVO or DVR - DVO = DVE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETo really see Oberth\u0027s effect, take an elliptical orbit, burn some amount of dV at Ap and calculate the orbital energy afterwards, then revert to before the burn. Burn the same dV at Pe and calculate the orbital energy, it will quickly become apparent that the burn at Pe gained you more orbital energy. I\u0027m at work now, so I can\u0027t perform the experiment, give me a few hours and I\u0027ll whip up something and share the results.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know this is the example in the wiki but it\u0027s just vector math combined with the exponential change in the scalar speed value. Also, it would be way more accurate and also less confusing to say \u0022impulse\u0022 instead of \u0022dV\u0022. So think about this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow, given the lack of instrumentation for this purpose, would you go about creating equal impulse burns in the game? You have to apply the same impulse, not the same amount of DVE/DVA/DVwhatever. This means you can\u0027t use either value (magnitude or duration) of the burn shown by the in-game maneuver node system. If the \u0022delta-V\u0022 of a node is displayed in the form (DVR - DVO), then you can\u0027t use that at all because DVO at Ap and Pe varies with the orbit\u0027s eccentricity. Thus, a display of Xm/s at Ap is not the same impulse as Xm/s at Pe. But OTOH, if the displayed \u0022delta-V\u0022 is raw DVR, then the burn time and not the \u0022delta-V\u0022 includes the Oberth effect, so if you burn for the specified time, you\u0027ve overdone Oberth. Thus, the only way to do this is to point prograde, start burning, and time it with a stopwatch so both burns have the same impulse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOberth is in the game, it has to be. It\u0027s not some mystical effect that needs to be coded separately, it is the observation that, because speed and kinetic energy are not linearly related, expending dV at higher speeds gains more kinetic energy. It is a consequence of the most basic kinetic energy calculation, without which a game like KSP would not be possible.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have to disagree. Oberth depends on the TWR of the rocket; otherwise it would be of equal benefit to them all.

You\u0027re going to travel the Kerbin/Sun/Eeloo gravity potential wells and you need to change your orbital energy in a way which will eventually get you from point A (Kerbin orbit) to point B (Eeloo orbit). Amount of dv you will spend to do so depends on how smart you are with deciding when and where to perform changes of your orbital parameters. Oberth effect just means that when you need to increase or decrease your orbital energy substantially, it\u0027s best done at the point where your kinetic energy, i.e. velocity is the greatest - and subsequently at the place of the lowest gravitational potential of your current trajectory.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuppose you travel from Kerbin to Moho.

So where\u0027s Oberth when you need him?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason this capture burn at Moho is so huge is because of vectors. Your vector is crossing Moho\u0027s vector with a significant perpendicular component. You have to kill off all that perpendicular component first, just like killing off horizontal velocity for a lander on top of worrying about gravity. Speed here, at least in a disadvantageous direction, is actually a bad thing.

If they are different, then Oberth is a thing unto himself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the thing is, the pre-Oberth rocket scientists, who declared interplanetary travel impossible due to the huge energy expenditures involved, were fully versed in vector math and Newtonian orbital mechanics.

Here is why, and also why many of the examples are lacking a definitive demonstration of the effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Oberth effect is primarily obvious during inter-body transfer. If you are trying to execute an oberth effect around a planet (or the sun) and simply changing the shape of your elliptical orbit, you will not see an effect. To benefit from Oberth, you must leave what KSP calls an SOI (in reality, the \u0022gravity well\u0022). Hence why all the Oberth internet references talk about parabolic or hyperbolic trajectories. Those trajectories enter and then leave an SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s a conceptual example:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScenario 1:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine you\u0027re in a 75x75km orbit around Kerbin. So now the PE/AP debate doesn\u0027t really matter because it\u0027s the same all around. Suppose I do a burn prograde to Kerbin\u0027s orbit around the sun. The burn is such that the craft just ever so barely manages to escape to the forward edge of Kerbin\u0027s SOI so that it is orbiting the Sun just in front of Kerbin. It\u0027s no longer orbiting Kerbin, so from Kerbin\u0027s perspective it has zero kinetic energy. Also, it isn\u0027t capable of falling on Kerbin, so from Kerbin\u0027s perspective it has zero potential energy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if I am at this point and I burn directly away from Kerbin, my orbit around the sun will change by the amount of dV that I apply. Also, from Kerbin\u0027s perspective the speed away is the dV I applied and the kinetic energy is 1/2 * (dV)^2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScenario 2:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine you\u0027re back in that 75x75km orbit around Kerbin. Now if I do the same \u0022Kerbin orbit relative prograde\u0022 burn with enough dV to just escape, plus the dV that I applied once interstellar, I\u0027ve expended the same amount of dV as I did in the above scenario. My fuel expenditure has NOT changed in any way (i.e. I\u0027ve used the exact same amount of liquid fuel and oxidizer as scenario 1). As I\u0027m leaving Kerbin\u0027s SOI and enter the Sun\u0027s SOI, my speed isn\u0027t simply the extra dV that I applied. It\u0027s the converted kinetic energy. So from Kerbin\u0027s perspective, I have no potential energy (because I\u0027m incapable of falling back on Kerbin), but my kinetic energy is higher (because in Scenario 1 at SOI crossing my KE is zero).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, that extra dV that I applied interstellar in Scenario 1 has been multiplied. This is because I transferred more kinetic energy with the LKO burn, which has NOW been converted into velocity. How much higher is the escape speed? \u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/f/5/bf5a8b3c1dc875e334917324c1b6d979.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bf5a8b3c1dc875e334917324c1b6d979.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EPractical Example\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I don\u0027t believe you!\u0022 Well, for those who like experiments and numbers, here\u0027s an example you can do in KSP. Make a ship, any ship that\u0027s capable of escaping Kerbin\u0027s SOI will do. I made a ship that had almost 4000dV in a 75x75km orbit around Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScenario 1:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFire the engines while on the back side terminus of Kerbin so that you leave the SOI going forward relative to Kerbin\u0027s orbit. Getting an exactly perfect escape velocity is difficult because it\u0027s such a narrow speed range, but the burn takes about 935m/s dV. Speed around Kerbin is now about 3200 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis results in leaving Kerbin\u0027s SOI (for my test anyway) at less than 50m/s at the edge of the SOI (took several days). The orbital speed around the Sun was about 9340m/s. I then applied another 300 dV which brought my orbital speed around the Sun up to 9640 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo total of 1235 dV spent, and a solar orbital speed of 9640 m/s...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScenario 2:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFire the engines past the back side terminus of Kerbin. This ensures you\u0027re leaving the SOI at the forward edge of Kerbin\u0027s orbit. How much to fire the engines? At precisely 1235 dV worth. End result, the speed around 3500 m/s. So a gain of about 300m/s from the Scenario 1 burn. Makes sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcept this time when the craft leaves Kerbin\u0027s SOI, it was at 1426 m/s. Solar orbital speed is 10708 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo total of 1235 dV spent, and a solar orbital speed of 10708 m/s.

So not quite the 1420 expected. What\u0027s the difference, the 9340 m/s escape velocity included about another 56 m/s. So add that on to the 1368 m/s and you get 1424 m/s.

It\u0027s because it\u0027s conserving Total Energy (which includes Kinetic, Potential, and Chemical energy). This is why it originally confused rocket scientists.

And I also agree, you certainly don\u0027t have to be out of the SOI to see the results of burning at PE before leaving the SOI. Mostly I was trying to avoid adding qualifier after qualifier and delving into the equations, because when people have been referring to changing parameters of an orbit, there starts to become confusing about potential energy vs. kinetic energy vs. chemical energy. When considering the effect for inter-body transfers, it becomes clear that crossing the SOI (when potential energy hits zero) nets a gain in speed that is higher in the new reference frame than the dV applied.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of the examples I have been seeing simply focus on \u0022why doesn\u0027t the speed or fuel efficiency increase when burning at the PE.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I modified my post. I said interplanetary at first, but the conceptual exercise works equally as well leaving the Mun\u0027s SOI and returning to Kerbin\u0027s SOI. Burn lower at the Mun and you\u0027ll have more (or less) orbital velocity around Kerbin when you emerge from the Mun\u0027s SOI. You\u0027ll also have steadily higher velocity as you leave the Mun\u0027s SOI than if you did the same burn from a higher altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo defy the intuition of your burn to 50km example, another weird phenomenon...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-From that 75x75km orbit (orbital velocity about 2300m/s), burn prograde 500 dV. You end up with an AP of about 1.35Mkm\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-At the APof 1.35Mkm (orbital velocity about 950m/s), burn another 500 dV. The craft ends up with a 1.35Mkm x 2.23Mkm orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo at this point, 1000 dV has been added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-At the AP of 2.23Mkm (orbital velocity about 1000m/s), burn 500 dV retrograde. The PE ends up inside Kerbin\u0027s lithosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo how the heck did I add 500 dV at 2.23Mkm (at a speed of 1000 m/s) and it lowered my 1.35Mkm PE way below my original 75km orbit (where I added 500 dV at more than twice the speed)? - (NOTE: I\u0027m not looking for an answer to that.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy point is, this is why I dislike trying to use examples of Oberth inside an SOI. I see wacky examples like this (not necessarily in this thread), but there\u0027s so many things going on that it doesn\u0027t explain Oberth at all. In fact, if you just look blindly at this example, it looks like Oberth is a complete lie, which it clearly isn\u0027t. One has to be careful about setting up experiments based on a piece of an equation/theory, without understanding the assumptions behind it. That\u0027s why my explanation focuses on intra-SOI transfers, since everyone quoth the wiki, and that\u0027s what the wiki assumes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-27T03:53:24Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2014 03:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-27T03:49:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, the Oberth effect is not dependent on TWR.
