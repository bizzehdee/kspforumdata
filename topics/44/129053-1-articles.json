The crew had come down with colds, and after spending most of the mission arguing with Mission Control decided they would perform reentry without their helmets on. The helmets were a one piece \u0022fishbowl\u0022 design without a retractable visor, and the crew was concerned their congestion would cause their eardrums to rupture if they could not periodically blow their noses as the pressure changed. But the helmets had been designed as part of the restraint system, and controllers were worried they might suffer head or neck injuries. Ultimately the crew refused to put them on, and the two rookie astronauts never flew in space again. The commander, Wally Schirra, had already announced his retirement.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the one hand, being weightless with a head cold for two weeks (and no bathroom) would be enough to ruin any one\u0027s mood.
