Too much red tape for it to get off the ground. Elon is rich, but hes not oil/gas rich sadly... and oil/gas always wins. Same thing with the electric car. They were getting popular until gas priced mysteriously plummeted. So.. you gotta hand it to him for atleast trying. If Elon can nail the battery and that factory hes building for mass production. He would still have trouble pulling the rug out from under big oil.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T01:33:50Z","Content":"\nIt\u0026#39;s not so mysterious why the price of oil dropped.
