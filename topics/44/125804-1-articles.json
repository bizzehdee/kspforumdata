There are people in this world who wouldn\u0026#39;t believe that electric cars can rack up such a mileage and and still keep going just fine with most of its range left, but a car built seven years ago is perfectly capable of the feat. Today\u0026#39;s cars are doing [I]better[/I] than that. The key element is using lithium ion batteries with proper onboard temperature management; an EV with older battery tech won\u0026#39;t make it (which is where the widespread belief of poor battery lifetime comes from in the first place).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe high initial buy price is also offset by a lower average running cost. [URL=\u0022http://www.plugincars.com/total-cost-ownership-cheaper-electric-cars-study-proves-127503.html\u0022]This study from 2013[/URL] found electric cars perfectly competitive in a total cost of ownership analysis.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlong with that, resale values for electric vehicles are better today than they ever were. Tesla obviously is king here due to its cult following and limited supply (the Model S has the lowest year-over-year value loss, percentage wise, of any car in its price range [I]in the entire world[/I] right now), but other cars are also improving, especially those which aren\u0026#39;t just so-called \u0022compliance cars\u0022 (junk on wheels that automakers put out to comply with fleet emission regulations). The BMW i3 and the Nissan Leaf for example are both doing well for themselves.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe elevated production pollution through battery manufacture is more than easily offset by the high lifecycle emission savings of modern EVs - even when assuming that 100% of the electricity is produced from nonrenewable sources. As grids slowly move towards greater shares of renewable sources, the advantage of electric vehicles is only growing. One relevant study among many is [URL=\u0022http://de.slideshare.net/FrdricLambert1/cleaner-cars-from-cradle-to-grave-full-report\u0022]here[/URL].\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen, you need to account for the fact that EVs are driven and \u0022refueled\u0022 differently than conventional cars. In a conventional car, you drive until the tank is empty, then refuel. In an EV, you drive whatever you need each day, and then plug it in once you get home, meaning every single day you start with the maximum range available to you. As such, you don\u0026#39;t need as much range in the first place.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOf course, the one thing that EVs (apart from the expensive Teslas and their supercharger network) cannot really do yet is viable long distance driving, which is where high range is actually required. However, energy density of lithium ion batteries has increased by \u0026gt;5% year over year for the past 20 years, with enough improvements in the pipeline to keep this up for at least another 10 years into the future... that\u0026#39;s about two thirds additional energy storage capacity in the same battery weight over those ten years. Some would call this a conservative estimate and predict a flat doubling of energy density over the same timeframe. Considering that modern EVs can already get up to 400 km range today, and most conventional cars are built for about 700 km, that means that ten years down the road, the range of electric vehicles will match or exceed that of conventional cars... even when only the conservative estimate comes true. Fast charging technology has also improved tremendously over the last five years, to the point where the limitation is starting to lie in getting thick enough power lines from the grid to the charging station, and not in the batteries. You can already recharge 300 km range in under 30 minutes with a Tesla Supercharger today.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-18T23:18:51Z\u0022 title=\u002211/18/2015 11:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redjoker","CreatedById":68444,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T23:12:15Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Mighty1\u0027]Oh, you have no idea how I would like do go all electric but this stupid country of mine imposes extra tax if you want anything else than gas.

The technology just is a long way from being as good as conventional cars.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBattery degradation in modern type batteries is as much about age (and temperature) as power cycles/miles. If we look a little more realistically at the report we see statements like these:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[quote]A considerable number of owners reported that some or all of their battery pack had been replaced: 23 out of 122, or 18.9%.[/quote]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt shows the technology is not really ready for prime time yet. Those replacement numbers, even if they are not all because of battery issues, are terribly high. It also does little to mitigate the point that electric cars generally lose value much more quickly than conventional cars. Even if they are cheaper to drive, it is not really a sound investment. The fact that the technology is still developing quickly means the cars will continue to lose value at an accelerated rate for the foreseeable future, as newer and significantly better models keep appearing every year.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso remember that most cars have irreplaceable batteries. Tesla\u0026#39;s are the exception, but most cars have batteries that are welded inside compartments in the floor or some similar arrangement. This means that if the battery goes, your car goes. It is scrap metal after that and exactly the reason recent early hybrids and electric cars were written off so terribly fast.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[quote]The elevated production pollution through battery manufacture is more than easily offset by the high lifecycle emission savings of modern EVs - even when assuming that 100% of the electricity is produced from nonrenewable sources.[/quote]\u003Cbr\u003E\nHow would you imagine that? If you take increased production pollution and grid losses, your car and its charge has polluted a lot before it even drives off. Most countries still burn fossil fuels for the vast majority of their energy, meaning most electric cars run on coal and gas and have conversion and grid losses added to their power consumption.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[quote]Then, you need to account for the fact that EVs are driven and \u0022refueled\u0022 differently than conventional cars. In a conventional car, you drive until the tank is empty, then refuel. In an EV, you drive whatever you need each day, and then plug it in once you get home, meaning every single day you start with the maximum range available to you. As such, you don\u0026#39;t need as much range in the first place.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOf course, the one thing that EVs (apart from the expensive Teslas and their supercharger network) cannot really do yet is viable long distance driving, which is where high range is actually required. However, energy density of lithium ion batteries has increased by \u0026gt;5% year over year for the past 20 years, with enough improvements in the pipeline to keep this up for at least another 10 years into the future... that\u0026#39;s about two thirds additional energy storage capacity in the same battery weight over those ten years. Some would call this a conservative estimate and predict a flat doubling of energy density over the same timeframe. Considering that modern EVs can already get up to 400 km range today, that means that ten years down the road, the range of electric vehicles will match or exceed that of conventional cars... even when only the conservative estimate comes true.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEven if electric cars match conventional ranges they are not as useful by a long shot, because they take forever to charge. That is not an issue if you zoom around a city, but if you do some serious driving, a day worth of driving now turns into a week long expedition with an electric vehicle. As it stands, you still need to rent a conventional vehicle if you go on longer trips, which makes it rather a hassle.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have always said, and still stand by that statement - electric cars will only catch on if they are made at least as easy as conventional cars. Near instant charging and a considerable range are requisite. Them being cheap can be a huge plus, though we should remember that they will probably quickly become more taxed and expensive if they become more widely adopted.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-18T23:42:50Z\u0022 title=\u002211/18/2015 11:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T23:52:40Z","Content":"\nElectric cars are just as good, performance-wise.
