Alkali metals do not burn like organic material, breaking down and releasing small volatile molecules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to make a flame (in oxygen) of an alkali metal, or any other matter, you need sufficient concentration of vapor over its condensed phase. With sodium, that happens close to 800 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C (boiling point is almost 883 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C). Because burning sodium does not give off enough heat to maintain such high temperatures, the flame quickly dies and is replaced with smouldering which creates ash of sodium peroxide covering the melt. It is truly difficult to set sodium on fire under normal circumstances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERubidium melts at 39.3 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C and boils at 688 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C, so the temperature at which its melt will produce flammable vapors is probably somewhere in the range of 500-550 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C. That is also not sufficient, so rubidium will also start smouldering (\u0022metal fire\u0022) when you remove the heat source.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt room temperature, rubidium will start a metal fire after a while. It depends on the buildup of heat , quantity of the material, its surface, properties of air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we ignore water vapor constantly seeping through our skin, reaction of \u003Cem\u003Ejust molten\u003C/em\u003E rubidium with constituents of our skin is basically negligible, and even then, surface products buildup stops further reactions because they aren\u0027t soluble in metal or skin. At higher temperatures reductive power of it is way more obvious. For example, a blob of molten and hot sodium will make a hole in your skin, but dry finger touching a just molten sodium (approx. 98 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C) will survive fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if we include those traces of water, we get a weak reaction forming dense aqueous solution of rubidium hydroxide, which although doesn\u0027t react or is miscible with the metal, does react with the skin in the process of saponification. It is a strong base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuantities of water escaping our body are very small, so one could survive and even swim in it (density of the melt at melting point is slightly lower than of water in standard contidions), although the movement would be different due to different viscosity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere would be chemical burns, though. Quite severe ones after less than half a minute. If the man exposes his mouth with saliva, localized violent reaction would occur because of hydrogen burning and extreme injuries would certainly be a consequence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you exclude water from the situation, alkali metals do not react violent at all in normal conditions. If you pour water on their smoulderings, hydrogen rapidly develops and catches fire. The lower you go in the 1st group of periodic table, the more violent the reactions are, but it\u0027s basically about hot hydrogen and its mixture with air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you plan to jump into a pool of molten lower alkali metals, be sure not to be wet, to close your orifices, to ensure the melt is not hot and to get out ASAP, but chances are you\u0027ll get gravely injured. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
