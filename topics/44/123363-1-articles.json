While much of the time from the stone ages until now was spent in developing ideas and inventing, some of it was actually spent building. And, think about this. In order to make the computer you\u0027re likely reading this on, precision machines assemble precision parts together. In order to make those machines and parts, more precision machines are needed. To make those, precision hands are needed and premade materials. If we were to start over with nothing, this process would have to happen. The first tools would be used to make better tools, those tools to make even better ones, ect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, only taking into consideration build time, how long would it take to go from nothing to today\u0027s technology?

Then afterward, we will suffer some regression, as knowledge is lost little by little. Perhaps back to pre-industrial time. Then we might catch up once again.

The real kicker is going to be the resources. Back in 1900 when oil was discovered in Pennsylvania, it took little more than drilling a water well to get oil. Since then, oil that can be recovered for less than $50/barrel has already be drilled and mostly pumped dry (survivors in oil country will have it a little easier, for awhile). Iron ore won\u0027t be an issue: simply \u0022mine\u0022 a landfill and harvest the metals for recycling/reforging, but there is no way to \u0022recycle\u0022 oil.
