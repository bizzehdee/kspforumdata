There are a few markets that because of the silly situation the world finds itself in, it would work, be quickly trumped, and then eventually become king again on. The main example is rare earth metals. Right now with China\u0027s death grip on them, if they gained the capacity to bring down several tons of it every couple weeks, they\u0027d make a pretty penny. The end result is that China then further saturates the market to keep PR and whatnot from being profitable. Eventually though (like 20-30\u002B years down the road assuming they expand their retrieval infrastructure) the sheer output that could be produced from an asteroid in a near Earth orbit would result in prices low enough that it just isn\u0027t worth paying people to mine it on the Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo not forget that though the initial costs of putting up further systems (orbital foundries and factories) would be ridiculously expensive (still doable though), it then will effectively drop the cost of a return vehicle to zero. Once they have the system up and running, they no longer need to ship up the return craft, they just forge a bullet of iron, fill it with the REM of their choice, slap on some orbital-produced control systems, slam it down into the ground on a cleared location (loads of legal and UN-level hurdles to do there, but solvable).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis however is mostly a moot point. What a lot of people don\u0027t quite seem to realize, is that the true worth of setting up space infrastructure is not in the dollar value on the ground, its in the resources you claim NOW. Sure, right now there isn\u0027t enough orbital infrastructure to require vast quantities of resources. Once we can build some satellites and ships in space, their price drops a lot, which is nice and will make some money, but again is not the main show. Once PR and the others have some asteroids claimed as theirs, first off that is a long term investment. They can mine those suckers for 50\u002B years. Secondly they can use the resources that they own 100% to construct other systems that let them go around claiming more asteroids. Even if in a UN debate it is declared that they still don\u0027t own the asteroids themselves, it will be pretty hard for someone else to start mining it if they have already enclosed the asteroid in the debris-cover (basically the semi-rigid tarp you\u0027d put around the asteroid so that industry systems don\u0027t result in a dangerous cloud of rocky debris around you). That would require damaging property of the company, which WOULD be recognized by the UN.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace is the long game. Think of it like colonizing North America. Europe for the most part never really gave it its due, didn\u0027t think about it for what it really was. After all, it was mostly worthless. We had a few colonies, there were a few things here and there that were kind of worth shipping back. But really there was nothing. Just think, if you were France, would you have sold all that land? That was one of the advantages of the early US, they saw what all that land was worth, what it could be turned into one day hundreds of years in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, yes there are some asteroids near enough to Earth to be worth considering, while it would be an interestingly difficult undertaking to stabilize their orbits for ease of use, it is certainly doable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-27T17:08:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sky_walker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sky_walker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s not how it works.\u003Cp\u003EMassive machinery, lots of people, all this stuff is necessary because of how difficult it is to extract certain resources.
