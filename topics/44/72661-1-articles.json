Pumping air is easy. Excavating huge volumes of soil is not. Keep in mind that Mars Direct requires 8 tones of hydrogen because in that plan the ERV is going straight from the surface to an earth return trajectory. In this case you would need much less since you are only going to low orbit, so let\u0027s say only 2 tons is required. Even so this will require a huge amount of digging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom each ton of soil you dig up there will be some quantity of water ice in it, and from this ice you will get 1/9 hydrogen. If we assume the excavated material is 50% water we\u0027re going to need to dig up 18 tons of soil for 1 ton of hydrogen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the 3d illustration they are using a curiosity derived platform to do this. Frankly I find that to be wildly optimistic. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean just think about how long it takes every time JPL wants to drill a tiny hole on Mars.
