Why is the Orion capsule conical and not, say, cylindrical like the Mk2 Lander Can (lol). In space, you don\u0027t need aerodynamics. In takeoff, it\u0027s covered with a fairing. In reentry, it comes butt-down. If it was cylindrical they would gain useful habitable space.

(Which allows for a much wider reentry corridor, if you come in too steep, turn the capsule to deflect air downwards - in return the capsule goes upwards. On the other end, if you came in too flat and risks bouncing out of atmo, turn the capsule so the heat shield deflects the air upwards. This also allows to fine tune the final landing spot.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe specific cone shape allows for a bigger \u0027range\u0027 of deflection than a soyuz bell shape would be able to. (However, keep in mind that soyuz is primarily made for leo operations, with much slower reentry speeds (and easier to predict reentry angles), whereas apollo / orion is meant for moon / interplanetary returns (so this extra amount of body lift could be useful - without having to expose anything else than the heat shield)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-06T17:35:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tommygun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tommygun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve always heard that the cone shape was chosen for all of the US capsules as it is self righting if it tumbles over during reentry.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Soyuz is also self righting, as demonstrated by Soyuz 5.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tommygun","CreatedById":41293,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-06T19:47:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBut isn\u0027t that partly made possible by having a large ballast weight at the bottom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the cone shape needs less ballast.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-06T19:50:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tommygun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tommygun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBut isn\u0027t that partly made possible by having a large ballast weight at the bottom.\u003Cp\u003EI think the cone shape needs less ballast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E You need uneven weight distribution yes, but not necessarily ballast.
