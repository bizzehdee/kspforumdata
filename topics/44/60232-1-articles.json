The Soviet Lunar program failed not because Korolev died, or because they didn\u0027t have enough budget, or didn\u0027t have the right technology... It failed because the Soviet space program went into something of a decline after rabbiting out of the gate as they thought they had proved their point and they didn\u0027t take Project Apollo seriously. Internal politics further hampered their efforts and slowed their programs. By the time they figured that we actually intended to go through with it (which was something of a fluke itself) and put a man on the moon and that they needed to get serious, it was far too late to catch up. They had no time to put the necessary technological and industrial base in place. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, it\u0027s not clear that even had they taken the challenge seriously what would have happened because the US had an enormous lead out of the gate - the F1 was already well along in development, as was the Saturn series of boosters and the Apollo CSM. One thing people don\u0027t generally realize is that President Kennedy choose the goal a lunar landing over other options not just because it was hard or audacious, but because so many of the important puzzle pieces were already on the board. It would probably have been a close race, and more dependent on who caught the fewest bad breaks or who was the luckiest more than anything else.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
