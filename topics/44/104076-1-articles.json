It has two Blue Origin BE-4 engines on the first stage, and will begin with a Centaur upper stage and move on to the ACES upper stage. The first stage engines will separate from the first stage, decelerate in the atmosphere by some system, and be retrieved mid-air. The design no longer uses the Russian built and designed RD-180 engine. Live stream is over but was presented here: [http://www.ulalaunch.com/webcast.aspx](http://www.ulalaunch.com/webcast.aspx)\n\nSome things that were mentioned:\n\n- More powerful solid rocket boosters\n- Based off of both Atlas and Delta heritage\n- Twin BE-4 engines using methane / liquefied natural gas (I think they mentioned methane in the livestream)\n- Initially uses Centaur, then switches to ACES\n- Similar fairings, but different\n- No direct cost given, but I think Tony Bruno mentioned that a general rule for rockets is 1 billion USD for new engine, 1 billion USD for new rocket on top. Not sure if I heard correctly but I think that\u0027s it.\n\n*Please discuss below if you would like!*\n\n**Updates**\n\n[https://twitter.com/ulalaunch](https://twitter.com/ulalaunch)\n\n[http://www.ulalaunch.com/ula-to-unveil-americas-next-generation-rocket.aspx](http://www.ulalaunch.com/ula-to-unveil-americas-next-generation-rocket.aspx)\n\n[http://spaceflightnow.com/2015/04/13/ula-unveils-its-future-with-the-vulcan-rocket-family/](http://spaceflightnow.com/2015/04/13/ula-unveils-its-future-with-the-vulcan-rocket-family/)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/emmeil-0u5k?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/cXQcyHNA6Mg?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Pictures**\n\n![CCf3n1fUAAAcNYw.jpg:med](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CCf3n1fUAAAcNYw.jpg:med)\n\n![CCf3CkkW4AAVAPM.jpg:med](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CCf3CkkW4AAVAPM.jpg:med)\n\n![CCf2QMjXIAAHjGm.jpg:med](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CCf2QMjXIAAHjGm.jpg:med)\n\n![CCfzZLOUkAAOoUV.jpg:small](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CCfzZLOUkAAOoUV.jpg:small)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-13T21:15:18Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2015 09:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Woopert**"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T21:10:54Z","Content":"Hah!
