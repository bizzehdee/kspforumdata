Mechanical Stress. The only mechanical stress a robotic miner operating in vacuum experiences is the friction of its own parts and the wear of the mining equipment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn venus, you have tremendous heat and pressure to add to that. Machines operating in the deep ocean don\u0027t have much of a problem, because it\u0027s very cold. No need to put a cooling system in place to prevent the thing from melting. Due to the cold, you can even expose many things to the environment without trouble. That is not so on Venus, where you can\u0027t expose any parts that are heat-sensitive. Electric motors and electronics, to name a few.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you ever drilled a hole, in hard wood or stone? You\u0027ll then have noticed that the drill gets very very hot in the process. It cools down quickly, because the Atmosphere is by comparison very cold. Know what happens when a drill gets too hot? It bends and breaks. And that happens long before the 500\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C mark. Now think of the stress that would impose on mining equipment on the surface of Venus. Things would have to be built out of extremely durable materials, which has the disadvantage of being expensive as hell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake Titanium. The main reason Titanium anythings are very expensive is not that Titanium is rare. It isn\u0027t, we use it as white paint. But Titanium is very hard, and takes special tools to machine. And I think it\u0027s kinda energy intensive to purify (read: separate from Oxygen, as Titanium Dioxide is the most common form).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I was an investor and had to choose between Mars and Venus, I\u0027d choose Mars, because it has fewer engineering challenges, and doesn\u0027t require equipment that is quite as expensive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure, you can build drills made of Titanium Carbide or Tungsten Carbide, with Diamond tips and Titanium gears, as well as Liquid Helium cooling systems. But that would be extraordinarily expensive. You can use ordinary Earth mining equipment on Mars, with slight modifications. Same goes for Asteroids.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for NSWRs, have you every looked at them, done any research? You\u0027re talking about storing highly radioactive fuel that will undergo fission if enough of it is concentrated. And the engine itself is basically a continuously ongoing nuclear explosion under water. Nobody has any idea how to build it, or if it could be built in the first place. Nuclear Lightbulbs would be a better option imo.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-21T20:47:53Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2014 08:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SargeRho\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RuBisCO","CreatedById":59540,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-22T01:19:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AngelLestat\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AngelLestat\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFrom 0.1nm to 35nm, most particle however are 0.5nm.

They formed in the outer portions of the asteroid belt closer to the frost line where it was cooler so carbon compounds could condense. They also contain hydrated minerals so we can get lots of water out of them. Some estimates are that we can get over 20% of the mass of the asteroid out in the form of water. Since chondrites are undifferentiated they also contain primitive metals, sometimes as much as 40% by mass. These would be extremely good asteroids to mine, having water, metals, and carbon compounds, all three in one.

That right no giant windmills high in venus atmosphere, no generators operating at 500 C at 92 atmospheres, just a thin Mylar like foil. You on the other hand need rather \u0022innovative system\u0022 \u003Cstrong\u003Eand heavy\u003C/strong\u003E for having a mining, ore processing, refining, all over Venus mining at different ore deposit, utilizing at least megawatts if not gigawatt, nearly everything operating at least a 500 C and 92 atmospheres. My solution is simpler, cheaper, more practical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.... Back on topic:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd what is wrong with the oort cloud? Add up the delta-v needed to pull water off of europa, out of jupiter\u0027s gravity well, out of Jupiter space and to Venus, verse flying out to a comet and nugging it into free-fall into the inner solar system. And we don\u0027t need to go that far there are plenty of comets or other concentrated volatile material objects only as far as Neptune space, with no gravity wells to climb out of. The only hindrance is size, now if hundreds of thousands of small impacts of just a few kilometer wide comets can do just as good of a job as a few world colliding impacts of smacking plutoids into Venus, so be it. The Delta-V required in pushing either would be small. Pluto for example has an orbital speed of 4.7 km/s, so to get it to crash into the sun would require 4.7 km/s, to get it to crash into Venus would require a little less. Further out the amount of Delta-V required is less (but time goes up). Of course moving a comet of a billion tons a few hundred m/s over the course of decades could be done with multi-terrawatt fusion engines or that nuclear salt water engine, you would just need 10 million of said comets, each roughly 100 km wide, but only a single planitoid/eer I mean \u0022dwaft planet\u0022 of 10^19 tons, I don\u0027t know maybe the starship enterprises D with its \u0022multiphase tractor beam\u0022 or some other BS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo lets take pluto (what good is it anyways?) and somehow smack nearly all 1.3*10^22 tons of it, which is made of roughly 10-50% water or 93%-464% all the water on earth, into Venus. What would we get? Well a few percents of that mass would be blown off in the impact, this would include much of Venus present atmosphere, if we impact at an angle to the equator we could also impart a fair amount of spin to venus, perhaps a spin of just a few earth days in length instead of its present spin of ~4 earth months should be possible (a pluto size body impacting venus at radius length from venus at 45 km/s would impart a spin of 3.7 days, that without taking into account angular momentum which means only the mass at the surface of venus at equator is at full spin, not all of venus\u0027s mass). Shallow enough of a impact we might be able to make a tiny moon around Venus as well if we wanted, definitely a ring for a few thousand years. Venus would become a molten mass until its crust cooled after a few thousands years, assuming we also built a solar shade. The oceans would rain down, new Venus would likely be remarkably flat, an ocean world until it crust got thick enough to support continents which would take millions of years. Assuming I\u0027m wrong and some of Venus crust remains intact to form islands right way (around the poles?) Venus would be perfectly habitable thousands of years after impact, with a solar shade letting in controlled amounts of sunlight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps it would be best to smack smaller bodies into a venus, really bigger comets, to get the right ratio of spin imparted, atmosphere knocked off and water/hydrogen delivered, without destroying enough of the crust to require thousands of years of cooling and render the planet into an ocean world. Of course Venus equator would take most of the punishment so expect at least that area to be melted flat. Let see assuming a density of 1.3 tons/m^3 and 70% water that would require 50,000, 40 km wide impactors, or 3000 impactors of 100 km wide to equal all the water on earth. It would require only 120, 300 km wide impactors (at 50% water and 1.7 tons/m^3). There should be enough bodies of these sizes in the Kepler belts alone, forget the Oort cloud.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact the more I think about this the more just smacking Venus with 500-500,000 comets totaling roughly 10^22 kg is a really great way to terraform Venus!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. It will impart spin, how much, well that a good physic test question:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E 1000 impactors each weighing in at 1*10^19 kg impact Venus\u0027s surface at the equator a full radius from the center of Venus, each impactor is traveling at 50 km/s upon impact. Venus has a mass of 4.867*10^24, assume angular momentum of a sphere and 50% of the mass of the impactors imparting angular momentum, how much spin would Venus gain in m/s, and in revolutions per hour? \u003C/em\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy guess based on velocity imparted just from a direct strike is that a total spin will be less than 2 day. This is because a direct strike would impart 267 m/s change in Venus\u0027s velocity, calculate that velocity over Venus circumference equals a 40 hour long day. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. That spin imparted will not be uniform, a magnetic field would arise!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven after a more accurate measure of its spin is calculated from angular momentum of a sphere, it still won\u0027t account for a difference in density of Venus at depth as well for fluid motion of Venus\u0027s mental, crust and core. It is likely a spin up of Venus\u0027s surface will not translate directly throughout, the surface will end up spinning slightly faster then the core, this difference in spin would generate a magnetic field (sort of like on earth) which would protect Venus from solar striping over the long run.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Blow off Venus atmosphere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese impacts at such an angle could also end up blow off a good percentage of Venus\u0027s atmosphere. When each impact strikes against the equator a wave of venus\u0027s atmosphere will be blown off into space. This of course would also start blowing off what was already added to venus\u0027s atmosphere from previous impacts, so we can strip all of Venus\u0027s atmosphere in this manner, only a percentage, I would just throw a number out there an say we could get ride of 50% of Venus\u0027s atmosphere this way tops. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.

However, not only are most explosives themselves flammable (soldiers have been known to use small pieces of plastic explosives for cooking if they have nothing else available) but they will undergo a reaction called deflagration if they get too hot. Deflagration is effectively very rapid burning, unlike detonation which is a specific and much more energetic chemical reaction.

The maneuver is not instantaneous (obviously) so there will be no Oberth effect (except for the oort cloud body) and the cost in delta-v would thus increase, maybe even double but it may also be possible to fly past one of the gas giants for a gravity swing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt Pluto space/Keplar belt of 40 AU, a 1*10^18 kg comet has an orbital speed of 4710 m/s, It would require 1.5 million kg per second of propellant at an ISP of 4000 for 305 years, 58.8 GN of thrust at 1442 TW to cancel out that velocity in 305 years. 6 billion tons of fusion tug, or 150,000 tons of fission tug, plus 150 million tons of uranium/thorium. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClearly the Fission \u0022tug\u0022 is the lighter option, it is just we need to extract millions of tons of uranium or thorium and ship it up there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow it would take 1400 of the 10^18 kg comets to eqaul the mass of water on earth (assuming they are 100% water) I would say a full 10,000 of them to blast away venus\u0027s atmosphere, give it spin and add enough hydrogenated and carbon seqestering materials to completely soak up all the CO2. For the 10^16 kg comets we would need a million of those. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce a \u0022tug\u0022 moves a comet in for collision, it can detach in the final days, fly by venus and back out to kepler space to get another comet, minimal delta-v need be spent, but we are talking roughly 500 years per cycle, so to get if we built 500 of these things it would take them 10,000 years to move all the comets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we use the fission engine option it would require at least 1.5*10^15 kg of uranium/thorium, but that is 0.0066% the mass of the largest M-type asteriod (16 Psyche) so if just that one asteriod has a uranium/thorium concentration of 66 ppm (about 5-10 times earth\u0027s crust concentration) we are good to go, we would just need to process all 2.27*10^19 kg of Psyche to get it all. The fusion tug option would forgo this, but instead each one of those tugs alone is a gigantic asteriod size ship! Added together and assuming 20 reuses they weigh 2 times as much as the fission ships and all their uranium/thorium fuel. The only diffrence is the fusion ships would be made out of much more common stuff, aluminium, copper, steel, carbon composite, etc, use \u0022all\u0022 the parts of an asteriods. I guess both options could be done at once, keep building fusion tugs while collecting enough uranium for the much lighter fission tugs. Imagine a 100,000 ton standardize fusion tug produce via produce and operated automatically, it would require 60,000 of these to move a 10^18 kg comet to venus and back out to another comet in under 500 years, we would need 300,000,000 of these ships to do it all in 10,000 years, add in all the supporting infrastucture to keep these ships tuned up and operating for 10,000 years of operation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps a better option will come about, cheap antimater, gravity and anti-gravity drives, wormholes, etc, but yes it could be done within less fantastic technological limits, it just would require a massive solar system wide economy in which the largest of asteriods and in which hundred of millions if not a billion ships can built and kept operating for at least 10,000 years.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-25T07:29:16Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2014 07:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by RuBisCO\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ECorrection on free fall times!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-25T02:06:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf there\u0027s no rush, using a solar sail to deorbit an oort cloud object would probably be more efficent.

Hydrogen would reduce the amount of water needed on venus, plus soak up all of venus CO2 by converting it to water (and solid carbon). Hydrogen could be mined from the gas giants but that would require crawling to the bottom of the gas giants gravity well and stripping atmosphere off the top (will countering for drag) then crawling out of the gas giants gravity well. The energy required to convert 1 kilogram of hydrogen from water is roughly 200 MJ (assuming 70-80% efficency) that the same amont of energy needed to move 1 kg of material to 6.3 km/s, So if mining a comet direcly saves you more then 6.3 km/s in delta-v it might be worth it. Of course we also needed to add the mass of melting equipment, electrolysis equipment, fusionable extractors for making fuel for the fusion reactors, cryogenics plants to cool the hydrogen down to a liquid and massive fuel tanks to move the hydrogen. We can use the waste liquid oxgyen as propellant though, though it would provide worse ISP then water. Assuming we don\u0027t blow away venus\u0027s atmosphere we would need 4.2*10^19 kg of hydrogen to convert all of venus\u0027s atmosphere or about 400-500 10^18 kg comets would need to be completely coverted (assuming they are 10% hydrogen by mass, nearly completely water-methane-ammonia, 800-1000 if they are 5% hydrogen). Still 97% of the mass moved to venus would need to be water, not hydrogen (assuming there are negliable level of oxides on the surface of venus) and that would be at least 1.4*10^21 kg of water. The numbers I provided assume 10^22 kg of material smashed into venus which provides plenty of overhead, if we were to mine water directly and deliver it directly it could save some mass, but that depends on how much water a comet is made out of, if it 80% water is it worthwhile to melt and extract all the water?
