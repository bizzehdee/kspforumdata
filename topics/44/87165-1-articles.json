A person who simply abstains from meat does not do any change in the industry, while a person who eats meat that comes from lucky animals that were treated with respect and slaughtered with honour actually supports the industry of animal-friendly meat. This industry involves meat production like it happened in the past: the animals are given large pasture zones, are able to go by their natural diet instead of being fed some sort of genetically modified corn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeat from this type of industry not only has a smaller ecological impact and is more natural, but has a better quality and taste: if you eat for example, lamb ribs that come from a countryside farm, you will never, ever, again want to eat \u0022Meat\u0022 that you are not even sure comes from animals and not from some sort of rubber-plastic mix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe change to this type of industry is already proceeding at great paces in Europe, where at least 6 out of 10 meat cuts in the supermarket are labeled \u0022Bio\u0022 or \u0022Cage-free\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RizzoTheRat","CreatedById":123362,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-13T12:14:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a farmers son (arable and sheep).

We can make do with whatever we find, for some time. That\u0027s what allowed us to survive when food was scarce and let us come out on top of the natural selection process over time (together with other factors, of course). As omnivores, it benefits us to partake in the variety available to us. There is no biological reason to abstain from certain foods, so long as they are not poisonous to us (don\u0027t eat dem red shrooms, kids!). In fact, variety ensures that we get all the necessary nutrients we require to not only survive, but to be healthy and thriving.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are a vegan who only gets by through taking supplements to make up for what your food lacks, you\u0027re doing it wrong. At the same time, if you\u0027re a steak connoiseur who\u0027s struggling with high blood cholesterol, high body fat and vitamin shortages, you\u0027re also doing it wrong. If your chosen diet allows you to lead a healthy, happy life without the need for additional supplements, then you\u0027re doing it right, regardless of what food products it contains. Within that frame, you have room for ideological choices - you can abstain from animal products if you like, or you can skip that icky green spinach if you like. Just don\u0027t lie to yourself about your choices and your health. If you get cramps regularly, you\u0027re probably short on magnesium - don\u0027t bother chalking it up to some sort of \u0022being born with it\u0022 crap.

People differ to some extent - both genetically, and habitually. That is why some diets work to make your friend\u0027s pounds plummet, but you can\u0027t get anywhere with it. That doesn\u0027t mean that diet is bad, it simply means it\u0027s not the one suited to your body and your lifestyle. The same counts for general eating habits. If you make the choice to eat a certain way - be it vegan, vegetarian or all-fish-all-the-time - don\u0027t make that choice because others tell you they feel great while doing it. Make the choice because \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E feel great while doing it.

Just like you need to occasionally eat salad and other green stuff, you regularly need to eat meat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, the argument that it is hard to replace meat without doing any harm to your body is good. Lentils and similar plants may even include more protein that meat, but it is a different protein. Animal protein is REQUIRED for a healthy diet; there is no way to synthetize large amounts of animal protein without killing animals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn-Vitro meat will not be completely developed until 2050, but I think that by then, ecologically substainable and effective methods of breeding animals without doing harm to the environment will be invented. My personal idea is an idea that could be used in the future when humans colonize space: making entire planets giant pastures for animals, entirely robotized with robots that observe the animals and locate them in the giant pastures to slaughter them when the slaughter age comes. The methane produced by for example cows is then filtered out from the air and put into flasks to be exported or even used as a fuel for the planet\u0027s robots, that in turn will automatically breed animals and perform the needed medical care. The animals are automatically butchered, and the meat, which is probably eco-friendly, is packed into spaceships to be transported to the shops located on the various planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, I have read that Vegetarians break their bones more often because important proteins that strengthen the bones are located in meat.
