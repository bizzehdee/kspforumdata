A very large structure usually compared to a dam or something. Dams aren\u0027t too absolutely huge, even though they are quite towering; it\u0027s easy to put their sizes into perspective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut... What\u0027s the next step up? A gigastructure can be a little more difficult, but let\u0027s go take a look at some larger things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s see the island of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Jebel_Ali\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPalm Jebel Ali\u003C/a\u003E, a man-made island! This thing is absolutely huge, and while not the largest thing ever built, it is the largest island ever \u0022built\u0022. Standing upright, this thing would tower over the Hoover Dam, at only 220 meters. It would stand a crazy 8 Kilometers tall! It\u0027s not breaking any records in distance or anything, though, so let\u0027s go further, dubbed temporarily, a Terastructure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake a look at the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGreat Barrier Reef\u003C/a\u003E. Although not manmade and technically not one object, it\u0027s designated length is a crazy 2.6 Megameters. That\u0027s a lot... But if you want something man-made, look at the next thing: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_China\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThe Great Wall of China\u003C/a\u003E. This thing is nuts, and while it doesn\u0027t have a very moral origin story, it\u0027s a fascinating structure, stretching for 8.85 Megameters. Distances like this are still fairly sedate when you remind yourself it was built by people.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, it get\u0027s weirder. What would qualify as the next step up would be something the size of Uranus! [i swear, if anyone takes that out of context...]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENothing even remotely close to this had been built, but if you believe that a structure doesn\u0027t have to be man-made, look to planets for this answer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a massive structure, obviously beyond our capabilities for the time being.

Something this size would be... Just, ginormous. There\u0027s no other word for it.

Theoretically? It would have to be extremely sophisticated, and advanced at the same time. Something this huge, at at least 150 Terameters in diameter, would be much longer than a light day.

That\u0027s larger than an Exameter by far, which is already a distance difficult to appreciate! Nothing this big can really exist as a single, joined object, but maybe we could go back to the Great Barrier Reef, and make a system of intercommunicating objects.

Stretching a mind-blowing 3 Gigaparsecs in average diameter, it\u0027s length is only trumped by one thing: The distance from Earth to the Hubble Deep Field, which is an incredible 3.85 Gigaparsecs! Distances like this are just too big for our minds to comprehend. I mean, come on. The only thing bigger than this distance to measure within the observable universe IS the observable universe! If you want to get into distances much larger than 93 billion lightyears, look up Teraparsecs, and Petaparsecs. If you really want to give your brain a run for it\u0027s money, go beyond with Exaparsecs, Zettaparsecs, and Yottaparsecs even!

The radiation itself can be radiated, gas at the pressure of the outeratmospher of the sun would taken generations to build up. in theory if you had an uktralightstrong material you coukd use solar wind and solar pwer to accelerate the circle launch vehicles. The problem is that the anti\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- inertial force applied by the structure is built in the orbital vector and the radial force that comes from the radial. A carbon carbon bond can stretch a few percent and so the orbit would swell. lets asuume the dyson wheel is in orbit, The down forces comes from translations in theta, so for instance the downward force of a motif 1.5A long in the orbital is sine(1.5E-10/150,000,000,000) * breaking force of structure along the \u0027thread\u0027 = 1E-20 stretch strength. The breaking energy per unit is 348kJ/mole and a mole is 6.0229E23 atoms. but two of the angles are at 120 degress to a single orbital sp2-sp2 orbital. It comes out to about 2E-20, but at best we can get half 1E-20. That is a strength of 2E-41 per bond in the radial direction when curved into a circle of earths radius.
