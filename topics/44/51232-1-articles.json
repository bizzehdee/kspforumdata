Science fiction takes what is known about the world and takes it a step further. These two facts of literature mean the greatest works of sci fi ever written tends to borrow their \u0022worlds\u0022 from real life. Red Mars, one of the greatest books I have ever read, goes into detail of the environment known to exist on Mars at the time (my copy had a map of the red planet at the beginning of the book, complete with the settlements humans made during the colonisation, so you could imagine how the surface changed as time went on).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecently I had been watching the TV series Wonders of the Solar System (nonfiction, goes into the most exciting features of the worlds in the solar system, love it!) and I was treated with a real reminder of how gifted we are to have hundreds of worlds on our doorstep, each one having something extremely interesting about it. What adventures could the human race find on any one of these worlds?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least one environment stood out to me. The underground network of caves on Mars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.strudel.org.uk/blog/astro/images//20070524_martian_cave.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220070524_martian_cave.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThis is the entrance to a martian cave. It is also what total unknowing looks like. If you ever had to walk to the toilet at night as a kid, and you weren\u0027t sure whether or not there were monsters in the dark, then you have an idea of what planetary scientists feel about this hole.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing about these caves is, that once a (martian) year, around summer time, they spurt out a large amount of Methane. Methane can only be produced in nature in one of two methods, biological and geological. As far as we can tell, Mars is geologically dead. So, what is producing the Methane? Nobody has a clue. No probe has been sent inside, and since they require line of sight with Earth or a satellite orbiting overhead, an unmanned mission is unlikely to be technically feasible anytime soon. It is very likely the first time we look into these caves is when we have humans on the surface...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile human explorers going into the unknown to search for alien life is a fanstatic goal to work towards, for now, a tale of what they might find in there will be a good read. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E What corner of the Solar System do you think needs more attention, and would serve as a good backdrop for the next great story?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Faark","CreatedById":69775,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-30T22:22:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re sure there are mentionable caves?
