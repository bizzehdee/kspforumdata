One example is the Apollo CSM that is often seen in the drawings -- it wouldn\u0027t fit as it stands, because there\u0027s a tank wall just below. My plans is to create a classic Sea Dragon (as per drawings found online) and then a possible evolution of the design with different uppers to accommodate various payloads such as fuel, oversized probes, Project Orion drive, station pieces, etc.\u00A0 Apparently the large upper tank in the drawing is the \u0022payload\u0022 stand in, presumably bulk fuel to LEO, so in future versions I may remove and reshape the aerodynamic shell to fit other payloads.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is one of the reference images I\u0027m using\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022SeaDragonRocket.gif\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/SeaDragonRocket.gif\u0022 width=\u0022287\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI am fleshing out a rough shape, some inner tanks are not modeled since they won\u0027t be visible, but have some specific questions about some of the parts so that I get it right overall.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis first picture is an overall cross section of what I have so far. As you can see the small rocket motors sticking out from the sides on the 2nd stage have not yet been modeled, because this is an area where I have some questions.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u00226YeWMLE.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/6YeWMLE.png\u0022 width=\u0022338\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs you can see, there doesn\u0027t seem to be any sort of interstage section that falls away between stage one and stage two, and if there was one and the drawings just don\u0027t indicate it, then it may be an issue due to the positions of the small side rockets (not modeled here yet but visible in the reference images above). But that means there\u0027s almost ZERO detail visible from the outside with regards to the 2nd stage engine, and no room for the 2nd stage engine to expand at all like the 1st stage. Is that correct? If so, while it makes it easy to model (I can get rid of a lot of that interior actually) it is rather boring to look at... I wonder if a production version would have had an interstage of some sort. I\u0027m finding it unusual that the engine bell would be \u0022embedded\u0022 in the stage body like that, would it actually fire like this or is it supposed to retract or something?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022xMQI4PY.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/xMQI4PY.png\u0022 width=\u0022429\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is a view of the first stage from below. The reference pictures indicate that the first stage engine bell is capable of 3 degrees of movement off center, and I assume all the bits and bobs drawn in the cross sectional view are actuators to move the main engine bell. The problem is, I\u0027m having trouble visualizing what those parts look like in 3d so I can replicate them. Are they spheres or flat sided cylinders of some sort? They would partially fill the void at the narrow part of the cone here.\u00A0 I only see 2 actuators in some reference pictures, 90 degrees apart\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022w9TfAES.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/w9TfAES.png\u0022 width=\u0022643\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFinally, below is a cutaway of the structure near the top. For 3d printing purposes, I have holes in the Apollo CSM so that small neodymium magnets can be glued in order to keep the capsule on the service module for display purposes. \u00A0\u00A0 But this shows how the reference drawings don\u0027t necessarily match up to what is possible; if the CSM was buried about halfway in as in the drawings, the engine bell and the upper portion of the internal tank would conflict.\u00A0 It\u0027s just about perfect sticking out like it does on the Saturn V though.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022hMn5HRn.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/hMn5HRn.png\u0022 width=\u0022759\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-03T11:51:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid you check pdf files listed in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Dragon_(rocket)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewiki article\u003C/a\u003E?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSay, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://neverworld.net/truax/Sea_Dragon_Concept_Volume_1.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis one\u003C/a\u003E, all images in II-D section of the document.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
