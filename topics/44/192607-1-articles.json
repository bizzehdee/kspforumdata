thus no \u0027gravitational field\u0027 acted upon the photon\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe search for the Higgs (\u0026amp; etc.) is a quest to find a particle to help rectify the Standard Model with GR... but if they succeed, won\u0027t that mean accepting gravity has field like properties; and if so... how does a massless photon get turned by a mass?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe folks who launched New Horizons past Pluto used Newtonian physics to perform this incredible feat - they did not have to \u0027get down into the weeds\u0027 with Einstein; meaning Newton\u0027s physics is a pretty damn good approximation - and while it doesn\u0027t demand that gravity be a field... it doesn\u0027t refute this possibility either.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe precession of Mercury \u003Cem\u003Eisn\u0027t \u003C/em\u003Ewell described using only Newtonian physics, but \u003Cem\u003Eis \u003C/em\u003Edescribed well by Einstein\u0027s theories... so at some point Newton\u0027s approximation isn\u0027t sufficient and Einstein\u0027s is better... but why?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOur planet experiences seasons: the axial tilt keeps our Northern Hemisphere toward the sun during summer and away during winter... but why does it behave differently than a photon?\u00A0 I.e. if a fast moving photon\u0027s trajectory compared to the background stars can be bent by curved spacetime near a large enough mass... why doesn\u0027t the earth\u0027s path follow the same \u0027straight line\u0027 idea (I.e. moving in a straight line but through space that has been curved by the mass of the sun to keep it in an orbit... which in this case might keep the Northern Hemisphere always toward the sun rather than generally toward Polaris)\u2026\u00A0 which, I get that the spin stabilization is an enormous factor; but that seems inconsistent (to me) with curved spacetime - I.e the planet is affected differently than the photon (read; it\u0027s not \u0027still traveling in a straight line through curved space) -- and this, to me makes more sense if gravity is a field; the spin stabilization keeping the axis aligned with the fixed stars \u0027just works\u0027 better referencing a field produced by the mass of the sun attracting the mass of the earth (or each, the other) than does curved spacetime\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTidally locked bodies could be due to either a 1 rotation to 1 orbit, or because they\u0027re not uniformly balanced and thus the denser part will be closer to the mass it orbits (like a Weeble will wobble but not fall down)... but then a tidally locked body also looks like one behaving like a photon; from its frame of reference it\u0027s following a straight line, but the outside observer sees it as travelling a circular path defined by the mass it orbits warping spacetime.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of which probably helps you understand my confusion less than before I tried to explain.\u00A0 (Insert rueful grin)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it\u0027s like this;

its path would otherwise be straight except for the fact that the surface it is traveling on is curved - and the axis of its rotation is all over the place.\u00A0 IF that is a decent analogy to the curvature of spacetime defining the path of an object around another massive object... why isn\u0027t the earth\u0027s axis of rotation all over the place as well?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-03-25T21:36:11Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2020 09:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by JoeSchmuckatelli\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-25T23:52:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223760991\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022192607\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221585144783\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002274091\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022p1t1o\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, p1t1o said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNewtonian physics and Einsteinian physics are both \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eapproximations\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E of the same thing - physical reality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe question \u0022Why is the orbit behaving in a newtonian fashion?\u0022 is the wrong question - it has no meaning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe orbit is behaving in a real, physical fashion and we use Newtonian physics to describe and predict it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNature doesnt follow our theories, our theories follow nature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor regimes below relativistic (say, the problem involves no velocities above 0.1c), both Einsteinian and Newtonian physics are extremely accurate - but Einsteinian physics is harder and more complex, whilst Newtonian calculations can mostly be done in your head, so we would always use Newtonian here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen velocities approach relativistic regimes, Newtonian physics loses its accuracy (like trying to measure the temperature of the core of the sun, with a mercury thermometer, the results - vast expansion of mercury vapour - make no sense to the scale printed on the side of the glass tube) so we would use Einsteinian.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr if you need extreme accuracy because of reasons like GPS and the way it works.

You can\u0027t answer the question of how fast you are going. Only how fast you are going relative to something else. But you can always answer a question of how rapidly you are rotating. In Newtonian Physics, there is a globally inertial frame of reference. You can pick a direction and always know that direction, and if you keep facing in that same direction, you aren\u0027t spinning. Simple! And so a non-spinning satellite always faces the same direction, and we have Fig 2. I\u0027m sure that\u0027s clear, but I wanted to walk through this to set things up for General Relativity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, in GR, things get complicated. Imagine that you are standing on the surface of Earth at the equator. You start out pointing your hand directly North. Now you walk North until you reach the pole. (I don\u0027t know, water\u0027s frozen, or something.) You are trying to keep pointing in the same direction, but along the surface, and nothing really changes until you make it to the pole. You then start going directly to your right. So you\u0027re moving South, but 90\u00B0 of latitude from where you started. If you kept pointing your hand in the same direction, you are now pointing it East. And once you\u0027re at equator, you can move directly West until you\u0027re back where you started from. You always tried to point in the same direction, but somehow, you started out pointing North, and ended up pointing East. That\u0027s result of curvature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThings get further more complicated because time is a dimension and so, just like space, is subject to curvature. That\u0027s why gravity pulls on objects that aren\u0027t moving - they are still \u0022moving\u0022 through time. And so in general, just like you can\u0027t be sure of direction you\u0027re pointing when moving through curved space, even if you aren\u0027t going anywhere, keeping track of what\u0027s the same direction as you age through time is also impossible. So how can we tell if something is spinning if we can\u0027t say if the orientation an object is pointing at now is same or different than orientation a few minutes later. Well, we still have concept of parallel transport. Just like you could keep pointing in the \u0022same\u0022 direction as you moved along the surface of the Earth, you can maintain the \u0022same\u0022 direction. And so while there is no global inertial frame, there is always a local inertial frame. And because of that, a notion of whether an object rotates local to that object. For a satellite, that\u0027s a local free-falling frame along that satellite\u0027s orbit. And relative to that, we can absolutely say if the satellite is turning or not. But in general, you, standing on the ground, might disagree with measurements on the satellite itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the part where I would have to drag in a lot of heavy math to derive these things, so I hope you take my word for it. (Or ask someone else who understand the math and whom you trust more than stranger on the internet!) If Earth was a perfect sphere and was not rotating itself, nor had significant electric charge, the curvature it would produce is described by Schwarzschild Metric. It\u0027s one of the earliest exact solutions to Einstein Field Equations that we know. It\u0027s also why we knew to look for black holes and made many other discoveries. If our satellite was completely irrotational relative to its local free-falling frame of reference in Schwarzschild Metric, it would also perfectly follow Fig 2. The reason satellite moves in a circle but the chosen \u0022forward\u0022 direction doesn\u0027t curve with it is related to why a much faster satellite would curve less. Even light moves through time as well as space, and what we need for a reference is a straight line in space only, and that does not curve in this particular metric.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut Earth isn\u0027t a perfect sphere and isn\u0027t even electrically neutral. But it\u0027s Earth\u0027s rotation that throws a biggest wrench into our assumptions. There\u0027s another exact solution to Einstein\u0027s Field Equations that describes space-time near a massive rotating object. It\u0027s called a Kerr metric. And Kerr metric is weird. It doesn\u0027t get too wild until you have something really heavy with a lot of angular momentum, like a supermassive black hole, but technically, it\u0027s still a better description of what happens near Earth. And in that metric, there\u0027s something called frame dragging. It\u0027s named so because it\u0027s almost as if rotating object was pulling space-time itself along, creating a bit of a twist. And that twist does mean that an object orbiting above, one that\u0027s perfectly steady relative to its own local frame of reference, will appear to rotate ever so slightly from perspective of someone standing on the surface. Of course, from perspective of the satellite, it\u0027s the rest of the universe that\u0027d be drifting around ever so slightly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd just to be clear, I don\u0027t expect that effect to be remotely measurable. There are too many other things going on. There are tidal forces that make measurement of rotation much harder. There is the fact that Earth isn\u0027t a sphere, and gravitational field will vary, generating various torques that you\u0027ll have to exclude. And even external forces due to light pressure and what little of air resistance there is making it impossible to keep things steady enough. But mathematically speaking, there should be a tiny amount of drift.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeSchmuckatelli","CreatedById":154477,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-10T18:39:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223762517\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022192607\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221585382443\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/28/2020 at 4:00 AM, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n... .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGrin\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI love this stuff.\u00A0 Thanks for the long reply!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really appreciate people taking the time to write responses to my questions, and I learn something new every time.\u00A0 e.g. I\u0027ve read about frame dragging, but never heard of the Kerr metric until today (now I have more reading ahead of me!).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack with more questions after I\u0027ve had a chance to read more and scratch my head a bit!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
