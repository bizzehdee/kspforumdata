Titan\u0027s atmosphere is mostly Nitrogen, with a maybe 5% methane at the surface (both of with are odorless gasses) at approximately 1.5 atmospheres of pressure.

The problem on Titan is the very low temperature of its atmosphere (around 92 Kelvin), so unless you have some way of warming up the \u0022air\u0022 you are breathing, you\u0027d get very severe frostbite damage to your lungs and freeze them quickly.
