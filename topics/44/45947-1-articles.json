The hoax is intended to illustrate how the lack of scientific literacy and an exaggerated analysis can lead to misplaced fears.[1] \u0022Dihydrogen monoxide\u0022, shortened to \u0022DHMO\u0022, is a name for water that is consistent with basic rules of chemical nomenclature,[2] but is not among the names published by IUPAC[3] and is almost exclusively used in a satirical context.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA popular version of the hoax was created by Eric Lechner, Lars Norpchen and Matthew Kaufman, housemates while attending University of California, Santa Cruz in 1990,[4] revised by Craig Jackson (also a UC Santa Cruz student) in 1994,[5] and brought to widespread public attention in 1997 when Nathan Zohner, a 14-year-old student, gathered petitions to ban \u0022DHMO\u0022 as the basis of his science project, titled \u0022How Gullible Are We?\u0022.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022Dihydrogen monoxide\u0022 may sound dangerous to those with a limited knowledge of chemistry or who hold to an ideal of a \u0022chemical-free\u0022 life (chemophobia).[6] The only familiar common usage of the term \u0022monoxide\u0022 is in the highly toxic gas \u0022carbon monoxide\u0022, and the simplified term \u0022monoxide poisoning\u0022 is commonly used to refer to poisoning by this colorless and odorless substance.\u003C/strong\u003E[7]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe joke has been frequently extended over the years.
