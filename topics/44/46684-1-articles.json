We have theoretical warp drives within General Relativity. If, say, we talk about Alcubierre Drive, there is the corresponding Alcubierre Metric, and one can answer questions of what will the universe look like to the traveler with mathematical precision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome simple things can be answered without getting into differential geometry. For example, imagine somebody is shining light directly at the ship from the front. The simplest way to think about blue shift in this case is to picture that light is sent in pulses. There is going to be a finite number of such pulses sent and the ship will pass through all of them in finite time. So the light from the front will be blue-shifted, but not infinitely so. In contrast, light sent from behind the ship cannot catch up at all. You will not see any light from behind. You can also think of that as infinitely red-shifted. In general, you will see something qualitatively similar to what you would observe traveling at near light speeds. There will be visual distortion with more of the universe appearing to be in front of you than behind, as well as areas of blue and red shift. But unlike warp travel, if you travel at sub-light speeds there is no blind spot behind you which you cannot see at all. Depending on how fast you are traveling, from the warp bubble you cannot see a cone of space behind you. That doesn\u0027t mean that there is just a cone of darkness, however, since light you shine in any direction from within the bubble has to end up somewhere. Rather the field of view is distorted in such a way that you see something in all directions, but can still see only a portion of the universe around you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one thing I\u0027m not sure about is whether the rear portion of the bubble appears \u0022reflective\u0022. Basically, light you shine directly back behind the ship cannot exit directly back. Otherwise, light could enter going the other way and we already agreed that light cannot catch up to the bubble. So there will definitely be deflection. But I\u0027m not sure if any of that light is deflected back into the bubble. It seems most reasonable that looking directly back you should see reflection of your ship in some distorted form, but I can be wrong about this. I suppose, I could do some math and find out, but I\u0027m feeling lazy right now. It\u0027s a bit of work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
