It\u0027s people demanding the government pay for their sports facilities, movie theaters, subsidise their bus and train tickets when they go drink themselves into a stupor (using food stamps to pay for the booze), give them free vacations, etc. etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can\u0027t pay for booze with food stamps, it\u0027s not allowed and you will lose your food privileges if you try. Although I agree that U.S. citizens taxes could be better utilized.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the subject though, I would love to see what they would find out from Europa over Ganymede. I don\u0027t know much about either moon but I bet Jupiter makes landing, or orbiting, either an extreme challenge, and possibly impossible with current tech. If they can land or orbit them despite Jupiter at current tech, they still have to orbit the planet first before ever landing on it and just those orbiters will take up decades of time getting built and going out there. When they finally land something they will have to deal with even more problems, seismic events, atmospheric phenomena, and surface phenomena. Mars is a cakewalk compared to Europa, its relatively quite geologically, it does have the dust storm thing to contend with, and I think because of its atmosphere it has less of a radiation problem. And we still lost several craft to Mars despite its relatively simple hurdles.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-14T07:19:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jwenting\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jwenting\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eif they want it so badly, I\u0027m sure they are committed enough to donate the money to make it happen out of their own pockets, rather than have the taxpayer bleed for their hobby.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould you please tell me again why you are on these forums? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo blame the military for making the taxpayers bleed for their \u0022hobby\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"czokletmuss","CreatedById":28063,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-14T12:26:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EImage of the geysers:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tpKwifW.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tpKwifW.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2013/12/11/science.1247051\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2013/12/11/science.1247051\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-14T12:35:17Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2013 12:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by czokletmuss\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-14T12:31:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough until now Eceladus was a liklier choice for a mission of this type, Europa is MUCH closer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Neil1993","CreatedById":92469,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T18:29:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lajoswinkler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lajoswinkler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt would be funny if the lander was blasted of the surface of Europa after the driller pierces the crust and water starts shooting out into the vacuum.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s the kind of thing that would happen in KSP! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
