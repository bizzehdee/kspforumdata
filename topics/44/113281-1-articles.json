We put a space station with all the necessities in orbit around Eve. Now, with no maintenance, how long would this station remain stable? Stable in this case would mean you are able to get on board and walk around without the thing disintegrating.\n\nI\u0027m sure the question sounds stupid at first glance.. but I\u0027m more curious about the environmental effects. With no wind, water, or other abrasive substances I would think that the space station could remain in orbit almost indefinitely. Sure it would eventually run out of electricity and fuel (assuming it had to periodically correct its orbit) but the station itself I can imagine being in near-pristine condition... maybe minus some sun bleaching. Even decades or centuries later it should still be there. And additionally, shouldn\u0027t a space ship also be almost untouched after even decades of floating around in space? Or is there some force that would eventually return these vehicles to dust?"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T01:39:22Z","Content":"Space is not empty.\n\nSpace near a planet has atoms of that planet\u0027s atmosphere surprisingly high up.

And I imagine it would be even longer if it didn\u0027t skim in so close on its periapsis. The reason the ISS needs so many boosts is because it\u0027s at ~400 km up, which is well inside the thermosphere. The atmosphere there is still a gas. Above 500 or so km, you have an atmosphere of orbiting gas particles that don\u0027t collide enough to be an actual gas.
