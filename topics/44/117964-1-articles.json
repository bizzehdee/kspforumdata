I am a little new to this math stuff in terms of science, so bare with me. First and foremost, to determine the total delta-v of a spacecraft, you must express it as: Delta-v = Effective Exhaust Velocity \\* log(total, fueled mass (wet) / final, drained (dry) mass).\n\nThe answer for the Saturn V I got was ~17,862 m/s delta-v. I am asuming that this is for the three stage assembly itself, not including the Lunar CSM. \n\nAlso, additionally, I decided to calculate the initial thrust of each stage for the SV, using the equation F(thrust) = Ve \\* (delta-m/delta-t), where delta-m is the flow of mass over delta-t, the time being in seconds. Ve is effective exhaust velocity (expressed as Isp in seconds \\* 9.81 m/s^2).\n\nSpecifics (based on some onlinep research):\n\nStage burn time\n\nS1: 161 s\n\nS2: 390 s\n\nS3: 475 s\n\nStage masses\n\nS1: Dry = 135 t, Wet = 2,286 t\n\nS2: Dry = 39 t, wet = 490 t\n\nS3: Dry = 13 t, wet = 119 t.\n\nStage Isp\n\nS1: 265 s\n\nS2: 200 s\n\nS3: 200 s.\n\nMy math could be way off, and if so, tell me where I went wrong and what it should be. Based on those specifics, my results were as such:\n\nS1: 46,751 kN\n\nS2: 3,060 kN\n\nS3: 491 kN.\n\nI also tried to calculate the delta V of each stage chronically, but the numbers were way off and didn\u0027t add up to my 17.8 km/s delta-v result. (Admittedly, I don\u0027t really know what I am doing) I\u0027m most likely a huge noob at this, but I am really curious... please help me.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-08T17:04:04Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2015 05:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Der Anfang**"},{"CreatedByName":"MinimumSky5","CreatedById":115138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T19:39:07Z","Content":"I don\u0027t know the specifics of the Saturn V, but an Isp of only 200s on stage 2 and 3 seems way too low, as they are hydrolox stages I would expect their Isp to be closer to 380-400."},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T19:55:56Z","Content":"200 seconds is the *sea level* Isp for the J2s on the second and third stages, the Isp in practice would be much closer to the vacuum value of about 420 seconds."},{"CreatedByName":"Der Anfang","CreatedById":134627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T19:59:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t know the specifics of the Saturn V, but an Isp of only 200s on stage 2 and 3 seems way too low, as they are hydrolox stages I would expect their Isp to be closer to 380-400.\n\n[http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/saturnv.htm](http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/saturnv.htm)\n\nThis is where I got the specifics."},{"CreatedByName":"ElWanderer","CreatedById":114015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T22:12:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E [http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/saturnv.htm](http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/saturnv.htm)\n\u003E This is where I got the specifics.\n\nThat says Isp 421s for the second and third stages.
