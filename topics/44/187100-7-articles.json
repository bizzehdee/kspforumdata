leads to an intuitive understanding of why engines with high exhaust velocity are more fuel-efficient than engines with low exhaust velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn Earth, we talk about fuel efficiency in the context of distance, because an automobile must continually expend energy in order to keep moving against the drag of the air and the ground. With a rocket, however, we talk about efficiency in the terms of fuel consumption rate. The technical term is \u0022thrust-specific fuel consumption\u0022, i.e., the amount of fuel/propellant being expended every second in order to produce a specific amount of thrust. Since thrust is just force divided by time, you can cancel out the \u0022per second\u0022 on both sides, which gives you the amount of fuel required to produce a specific amount of impulse, or change in momentum.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuppose you have a spaceship with a mass of 1\u00A0kg and a prop tank containing 10 kg of propellant. The initial mass of the system is 11 kg and the initial momentum of the system is zero. If you throw 1 kg of props out the back at -100 m/s, it has a momentum of -100 kg*m/s. By the conservation of momentum, the spaceship must have an equal and opposite momentum of \u002B100 kg*m/s. The spaceship now masses 10 kg, so dividing its \u002B100 kg*m/s by 10 kg gives you a positive velocity of 10 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut if your propellant is more volatile (or, perhaps, is being accelerated by an extreme heat source like a nuclear reactor), it can come out the back end of your spaceship with much greater speed. For example, if you can throw propellant out the back of your spaceship at -1,090 m/s, then you only need to use 0.1 kg for the same effect. 0.1 kg * -1,090 m/s = -109 kg*m/s, and so the spaceship has a resulting momentum of \u002B109 kg*m/s, and dividing by the remaining spaceship mass of 10.9 kg gives you a positive velocity of 10 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223649283\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187100\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221565583810\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129408\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerbiloid\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, kerbiloid said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf make a barrel with mirror walls, fill it with light on the Earth, and attach to the ship, the ship will need no reaction to move, it may just open a tiny hole in one end of the barrel, letting the photons escape.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut it would be a lot of photonic mass stored inside, and the barrel walls would be enough strong to withstand the radiation pressure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027d also need a way to collimate the photons so that their thrust pushed you in the correct direction rather than dispersing out at angles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd, as \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129408-kerbiloid/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022129408\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129408-kerbiloid/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@kerbiloid\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s link indicates, photons do not actually remain trapped in resonant cavities indefinitely.

It means that if natural laws are the same at every point in space. Also other well known conservation laws are connected to symmetry properties of space (it is quite high end theoretical physics and I am not expert at it).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether\u0027s_theorem\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-18T14:47:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hardest part of the conservation laws is to realize that it\u0027s you...\u00A0yes, personally you... what it the center of the whole Universe, and throwing anything to the left needs to throw same to the right, because the Universe \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E can\u0027t move from you in any direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Say, the\u00A0ship to the left, the exhaust to the right.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-12-18T14:52:31Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2020 02:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by kerbiloid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-19T15:24:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223895466\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187100\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221608302845\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129408\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerbiloid\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 12/18/2020 at 3:47 PM, kerbiloid said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hardest part of the conservation laws is to realize that it\u0027s you...\u00A0yes, personally you... what it the center of the whole Universe, and throwing anything to the left needs to throw same to the right, because the Universe \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E can\u0027t move from you in any direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Say, the\u00A0ship to the left, the exhaust to the right.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn simpler way to look at it is that some reaction less engine\u00A0like the EM drive who did some magic and interacted with the quantum foam or aether would still be an\u00A0Perpetuum mobile, if it says that you get constant acceleration out of an constant trust.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe problem here is that as you accelerate your kinetic energy increases squared, at double the velocity your kinetic energy is 4 times as high, 3 time and 9 times the energy.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo if you put an EM drive on an rotor in an vacuum chamber you will spin up the rotor, at some velocity and rotation you could use an dynamo to bleed off the acceleration, use a bit of that power to feed the EM drive and the rest as free energy.\u00A0 This is something \u00A0who could be build, main cost would be the vacuum chamber and getting an working EM drive obviously \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kerbal-forum-uploads/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe issue with having to feed more and more energy to accelerate is not something we notice much, yes it affect cars acceleration but air resistance is more of an issue here but it affect braking distance strongly.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow if you was to build an coil gun launcher on the moon this would be an issue.

Distilled to its core, the argument is that power output of a drive with constant thrust increases with forward speed,\u00A0while power consumption of a reactionless drive must stay constant, as failure to do so would indicate ability to measure an absolute speed of the rocket. So a reactionless drive is an infinite energy source if all frames of reference are equivalent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way this is usually presented is from a completely different angle. Conservation laws come from symmetries, easiest to see from Hamilton\u0027s Equations. dp\u003Csub\u003Ex\u003C/sub\u003E/dt = -\u2202H/\u2202x, dE/dt = -\u00A0\u2202H/\u2202t. If Hamiltonian doesn\u0027t depend on coordinates, the momentum is conserved. If Hamiltonian doesn\u0027t depend on time, then the energy is conserved. But we know that what\u0027s spatial displacement in one coordinate system is also a time displacement in another. Because there is no preferred coordinate system, the above conservation laws must hold in all or none. So if you found a violation of conservation of momentum in one coordinate system, there must exist another in which conservation of energy is violated as well. And, of course, above example demonstrates that perfectly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just really like that you can have this convoluted mess of math that you can use to prove equivalence of conservation laws\u00A0in a very general way, or you can go and build a very simple example of a machine that makes free energy under given assumptions, and both of these are essentially built on the same core assumption that there is no preferred coordinate system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Albert ninestein","CreatedById":208751,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-21T16:08:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs there are some Physics experts on this forum please can someone explain why my idea of a free energy machine doesn\u0027t work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease consider a helium filled blimp on the ground attached to a tether which is in turn attached to an electrical generator.
