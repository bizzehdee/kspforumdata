It was AWESOME to see. I still get goosebumps watching Shuttle launch videos. I\u0027ve met many Shuttle astronauts, heck, I\u0027ve driven a bunch of them in my car, had meals with them, etc., and I heard many stories about what it was like aboard. In a sense, I still love Shuttle.

Because of the opportunity cost to NASA. Because it wasn\u0027t the holistic system first envisioned, just one part, without any of the other parts (tug, ferry, etc). I hate that it got bloated. I hate that the design was frozen at a point where it was not economical... never the \u0022pickup truck to space\u0022 it was pitched as.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also realize that due to the nature of NASA (and government in general), it could not be evolved in the way it really needed to. It was simply too expensive to change it in a significant way, and likely risk aversion played a role here as well. Any new vehicle faced an STS-1 moment with people riding up something utterly untested, and they chose the devil they knew. I get it, but that doesn\u0027t mean I have to like it.

In the case of the foam on the ET, however, the performance limitation was ET mass. Because the ET made it almost to orbit (and could have made orbit), every kg of tank mass is a kg of payload lost. Hence the constant rework of the ET to reduce mass (they trimmed many \u003Cem\u003Etons\u003C/em\u003E of mass off it, amazingly). I think the failure was that they didn\u0027t address safety in those changes. Most of the mass savings on the ET was in the metal work. I think that they would have been better served to take much of the ET mass savings, and \u0022spend\u0022 that on covering the foam (or replacing it with something else). Yes, they would have lost payload mass. We\u0027d have had a huge cargo bay that could only carry 15 tons instead of 22\u002B. So what. We\u0027d also have 7 astronauts still alive, and perhaps a more sustainable Shuttle program that might have continued, or evolved a 2.0 version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-17T17:44:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223270492\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022169590\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221516210435\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107380\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 minutes ago, PB666 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0The 747 for instance cannot land with a full load of fuel, the V land is too high and the descent angle is too great for its gear.

In the case of the foam on the ET, however, the performance limitation was ET mass. Because the ET made it almost to orbit (and could have made orbit), every kg of tank mass is a kg of payload lost. Hence the constant rework of the ET to reduce mass (they trimmed many \u003Cem\u003Etons\u003C/em\u003E of mass off it, amazingly). I think the failure was that they didn\u0027t address safety in those changes. Most of the mass savings on the ET was in the metal work. I think that they would have been better served to take much of the ET mass savings, and \u0022spend\u0022 that on covering the foam (or replacing it with something else). Yes, they would have lost payload mass. We\u0027d have had a huge cargo bay that could only carry 15 tons instead of 22\u002B. So what.

While a safe abort was possible after most types of failures, one was especially dangerous: a burnthrough by hot gases of the rocket\u0027s casing. The report stated that \u0022if burnthrough occurs adjacent to [liquid hydrogen/oxygen] tank or orbiter, timely sensing may not be feasible and abort not possible\u0022, accurately foreshadowing the \u003Ci\u003EChallenger\u003C/i\u003E accident. - wikipedia\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe challenger report and the following observations of SRBs retrieved from the Atlantic that penetration of the O-rings by sea water was not rare. The challenger was unlucky in the sense that the burn through pointed right at the 12 strut. That was what caused rapid progression. Following the accident investigation MT was to report any unusual activity with the O-rings, prior to that there was not a priority on reporting unexpected behavior.
