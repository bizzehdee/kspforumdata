The military already do similar things with artillery or air laid minefields here on earth. I would modify your idea to be basically a fragmentation warhead with a target detecting device. Something like the warhead and TDD from an IR missile such as a Sidewinder but with a long-term power supply. If it detects anything close it goes bang and slices up the target with it\u0027s nice expanding rod frag.

Explosives will deflagrate at high temperatures, but that\u0027s a different reaction from a proper detonation. Detonation doesn\u0027t require an oxidiser, and is a lot more energetic than deflagration. Explosives quite happily work underwater, underground, at high altitude.

Even if you do set fire to them they still might not detonate, they\u0027ll just deflagrate (although deflagrating explosives often have enough smash to properly detonate those near to them). Soldiers sometimes use small amounts of plastic explosives for cooking. I\u0027ve never done it myself, but apparently it burns just like a solid fuel (like the hexamine soldiers normally cook with). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re right that you tend to use a smaller amount of a more sensitive explosive to initiate them, but it\u0027s pressure not heat that sets them off. To initiate a detonation you need to hit the main charge with a pressure wave moving at a high enough speed. Even the primary detonator need not be particularly sensitive to heat, you could simply insulate it and then initiate it electrically.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-17T08:05:07Z\u0022 title=\u002211/17/2013 08:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Seret\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Will Fawkes","CreatedById":85847,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-17T13:35:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwsome.
