Even the Block I SLS won\u0027t be ready until at \u003Cem\u003Eleast \u003C/em\u003E2017, and in that configuration Orion-System can only go on a free-return trajectory around the Moon. Block IB will be more capable, but that requires more hardware - the Exploration Upper Stage - to be designed, qualified, tested, and manufactured. Even then, it would have nowhere to go until the scheduled Exploration Mission 2, the manned exploration of a redirected asteroid, which hasn\u0027t even selected a basic mission mode (bag a little one, or pluck a boulder?), much less actually discovered and selected a target, designed, qualified, tested, and manufactured the hardware. That could take years, and then they have to actually fly the redirect mission, which (since its using SEP) will take years more. The quoted 2021 launch is probably extremely optimistic. More likely System will fly EM-1 2017-2019, EM-2 2023-2025. Even then, Block IB System will not be able to support a lunar landing. This will require Block II, which means even more development of new hardware, plus the development and selection of a lunar landing mission mode, and the development of mission-relevant hardware (like the lander).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy point is developing new hardware, \u003Cem\u003Eespecially \u003C/em\u003Espace hardware, \u003Cem\u003Eespecially \u003C/em\u003Eman-rated space hardware, \u003Cem\u003Eespecially \u003C/em\u003ENASA\u0027s guidelines, takes a bunch of time and a bunch of money. That\u0027s why developing a whole new launch system and capsule and junk is a very bad idea, and expanding and incrementally improving on reliable designs is a very good idea.
