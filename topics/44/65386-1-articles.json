The plan is to place the rocket on the pad, turn on the reaction wheel, replace the nose cone, and launch. It will be spooled up by launch and won\u0027t even be needed for a few seconds afterwards when the 1st stage burns out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first few seconds would be stabilized by the fins. The reaction wheel is only needed for the four seconds between 1st stage MECO and 2nd stage ignition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is to keep the rocket pointing straight up during that time.

If the rocket slows down so much in those few seconds that it loses aerodynamic stability, something is probably wrong. Although I \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E read that it is advised to ignite the second stage as soon as possible to prevent arcing over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy main worry would be the ignition of the second engine - I am not sure that a motor designed for parachute expulsion is capable of igniting a second stage.

I just finished a class about controllers and now you\u0027re bringing me back in! But yeah, a controller/feedback loop sounds like exactly what you need since that is what real reaction wheels use. As for the equation you want, it would be a function equating those input lateral forces ([force of gravity and/or drag]*[cos(angle of deviation from vertical, theta)]) to the centrifugal force created by the reaction wheel, or (g\u002BF(drag))*cos(theta)=F(centrifugal). Theta will change over time which is why you need a controller. Drag and centrifugal/centripetal forces depend on the rocket but equations can be found online. This should hopefully at least get you started.
