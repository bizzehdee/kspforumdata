Now, as we all know artifical gravity seems to be some sci-fi stuff. But as we also know, spinning and centrifugal force can make you stick to a wall. So, what about a spacecraft with a slightly smaller spacecraft inside that spins at human gravity?

However, the biggest problem would be the acceleration gradient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine, if you will, you spun this device up so that the resultant force of artificial gravity is effectively 1 g. Now, the human body is sensitive to acceleration gradients of 1/100th of a g, or 0.0981 meters per second (This was tested by the nazis on rather unfortunate test subjects), and although this would TECHNICLY work, it would have problems with the internal acceleration gradients. If the gradient is too high... We experience rather violent involuntary dis-assembly, as the softer tissues tend to give way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, we will run some numbers on this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst: conceptualize the problem\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are assuming that you are \u0027standing\u0027 with your head pointing in the direction of the center of rotation, with your feet on the inside surface of the circle. This would generate \u0027artificial\u0027 gravity for the person standing, as they would feel a centripetal acceleration in a vector pointing perpendicular to the surface of the circle, away from the center of rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are 2 meters tall, and the module you are in has a radius\u00AE of 4 meters (of inside space, so you have 8pi*the length of the cylinder to stand on{as per the equation As = Cs*height}), that means that the capsule\u0027s floor has a speed of \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ev = sqrt(a*r)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a being equal to g, the earth gravity at sea level, the velocity would be 6.264 meters per second, or ~4 seconds per rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 6.246 meters/sec is 22,485.5 meters per hour, or 22.5 km/hr. This, kind sir, is really ****ing fast- if you jumped from a moving car at that speed you would probably hurt yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, that is generating a velocity of 6.264 meters per second at your foot level, to generate the artificial gravity at foot level. Now lets go to your torso.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I am going to be a bit biologically ignorant, but lets assume your belly button is 1 meter off the ground, making the relative radius 3 meters rather than 4. (We have to assume that your spine is strong enough to keep you upright)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ET (Period) = 2*pi*r/v , therefore v = 2*pi*r/T\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe velocity is 4.71 meters per second. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea = V^2 /r, therefore the acceleration your belly button is experiencing is 7.3947 m/s^2, or roughly 3/4 of gravity. {a = (pi^2 * 4 * r)/(T^2) }\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(A general assumption is that as you get get farther away from the center of rotation, the acceleration is doubled every time the radius is doubled.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, you head, having a radius only 2 meters away from the center of rotation, is not hitting anything as you whiz around this insane little cylinder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe period is 4 seconds, and with a radius of two meters we can use the equation a = (pi^2 * 4 * r)/(T^2) to calculate the acceleration. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe acceleration the top of your head is experiencing is 4.929 meters per second per second. Your eyes are experiencing an acceleration of roughly 5 m/s^2, assuming you are built like most humans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe difference in acceleration between your eyes and your feet is a 4 m/s acceleration. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYOU WILL FEEL THAT. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnything at eye level will be roughly half times the weight it will be at foot level, and your blood will be having trouble as you are in a semi-imposed artificial gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, onto acceleration gradient:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHumans have been known to survive a 170g acceleration (all-bet he broke his legs and spine, but he lived). Most people die from that. The acceleration gradient is the measure of acceleration change per meter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe man who survived went from free-fall to 1g in 2 meters. This is an acceleration gradient of 169g/2 meters, or 84.5g\u0027s/meter. To put that in perspective, that means that your foot and knee, being 1/2 an inch apart, are experiencing a difference in acceleration of 42.25g, or 414.4725 meters/sec^2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo put this another way, if your foot was held by a brace in zero-g, then the knee would be being accelerated at 414.47 meters/sec^2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe disembodied knee would be ripped from the foot, and it\u0027s ankle would probably tear like a spare actor from a zombie movie.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour body inside that cylinder would be experiencing an acceleration gradient of 2.4g/m, which, while not fatal, would be unpleasant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou would feel light-headed, and unbalanced when you walk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo prevent the acceleration gradient from being a problem, the radius should be equal to the height of the area you want to have be moving at 1g * at least a hundred. So if you want to have your whole body feel like it is being accelerated at 1g like at earth on sea level, your radius (for a 2 meter tall human) would need to be at least 200 meters. (I would recommend 220 meters, because it is a nice margin of error of 10% in case someone wants to jump a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would make your module large enough to put the ISS inside it 4 times and still have room for a 747 jet (just based off radius).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, a solution to not being required to make macro-structures that size but to still have a solution is to build for people lying down- a person lying down is what- 10 cm? That\u0027s 0.1 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe radius of the centrifuge for this would be 22 meters, meaning it could be feasibly built.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn theory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and your diagram needs a method of holding the outer surface from moving.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-18T07:26:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eheres a really good calc for testing hypothetical ring configurations:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.artificial-gravity.com/sw/SpinCalc/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.artificial-gravity.com/sw/SpinCalc/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
