For comparison some data and illustrations of the V-2 engine are in Chapter 9. Here are some of the other changes, when compared to the V-2: It had a new type of large diameter (flat surface) injector, a concept that was originated a few years earlier by the General Electric Company, as seen in Fig. 7.3-3. It was a stainlesssteel forging with machined internal circular grooves at the face, radial internal fuel supply passages, and a bolted-on dome to distribute the oxidizer flow through axial holes to alternate circular grooves. Alternate rings had drilled holes for fuel injection and for oxidizer injection, and the flat rings were brazed into the face of the grooves. The flat surface of all of the rings formed the face of the injector as seen from the combustion chamber. The hole pattern in the rings had doublet self-impinging pairs of liquid jets, as depicted in Fig. 4.3-13. Extra film-cooling holes were placed at the periphery of the injector. The thrust chamber and nozzle entrance did have three sets of film-cooling holes in the wall (as in the V-2), but the locations were not the same, and the percent of fuel used for film cooling was much less. The chamber geometry was cylindrical and not pear shaped. The new thrust chamber gave better combustion efficiency and performance than the V-2 engine even though the relative chamber volume was less (L of 60 in. vs 90 in. for the V-2). The engine control system was more sophisticated. The gas generator used hydrogen peroxide with a solid catalyst bed, which is shown in Fig. 4.5-2, instead of the liquid permanganate solution of the V-2. There were two different versions of the Redstone engine, with a key difference in the fuel piping.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first hot firing of the new large thrust chamber (with a pressurized test stand feed system) occurred in January 1950, which at 75,000 lb was then the highest rocket thrust in the United States. Your author was the designer and the development engineer for this TC. It was part of the job to inspect the chamber and injector for discoloration or burned spots immediately after a test run. To do this, I had to stand on a short ladder with a flashlight in hand and squeeze through the tight 15.5-in.-diam nozzle into the chamber. \u003Cstrong\u003EThere were fumes in the chamber from the denatured (poisoned) alcohol, and I quickly became drunk and got a big hangover from breathing these fumes all on company time.\u003C/strong\u003E Needless to say, I used a fresh air supply on my next inspection.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow George Sutton is the world\u0027s foremost engine-eer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-12-15T10:23:18Z\u0022 title=\u002212/15/2021 10:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 15, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by DDE\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-15T12:26:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Earth doesn\u2019t rotate once every 24 hours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Solar day might last for 24 hours, but during that time the Earth has moved just under a degree (on average) around the Sun (365 days, 360 degrees) so the Earth has to rotate 361 degrees on its axis so the Sun is in the same place in the sky again; this is known as the solar day for obvious reasons.

But when LRPL did this particular job (the feather-bedding at Picatinny was outrageous) there were about seven people on the site \u2014two or three engineers, and any number of rocket mechanics dressed (for no particular reason) in acid-proof safety garments. So there was a large audience for the subsequent events. The old destroyer gun turret which housed our card-gap setup had become a bit frayed and tattered from the shrapnel it had contained (The plating on a destroyer is usually thick enough to keep out the water and the smaller fish ). So we had installed an inner layer of armor plate, standing off about an inch and a half from the original plating. And, as the setup hadn\u0027t been used for several months, a large colony of bats \u2014yes, bats, little Dracula types \u2014had moved into the gap to spend the winter. And when the first shot went off, they all came boiling out with their sonar gear fouled up, shaking their heads and pounding their ears. They chose one rocket mechanic \u2014as it happens, a remarkably goosy character anyway\u2014and decided that it was all his fault.
