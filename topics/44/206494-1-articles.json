Why? Well, it\u0027s because right now they have the correct speed to be orbiting the sun. If you change the mass of the sun (either by making it\u00A0 a black hole or just by making it a star with a different mass), then they will suddenly be at the wrong speed to be orbiting. Either they will have too much speed and will try to fly away, or they will have too little speed and so will fall in toward the sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-19T23:30:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224079374\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206494\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221642626270\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002227914\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Vanamonde said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr maybe that\u0027s real and today you\u0027re dreaming that it\u0027s \u003Cu\u003Enot \u003C/u\u003Ehappening.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEver read \u003Cem\u003EThe Lathe Of Heaven\u003C/em\u003E?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-20T00:37:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224079450\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206494\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221642635020\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022137807\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mikegarrison\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, mikegarrison said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEver read \u003Cem\u003EThe Lathe Of Heaven\u003C/em\u003E?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA very long time ago.
