Like all other Iranian satellites that has launched it has upgraded capabilities that are greater then the last. Fajr has cold gas thrusters for stabilising and a small deposit of fuel for orbital changes which it demonstrated by raising it\u0027s orbit to 400KM, a first for Iranian satellites. It was designed and built by a university and is designed to last for up to 6 months.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lnbf8u36KY1qbnrqd.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tumblr_lnbf8u36KY1qbnrqd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother satellite called Sharif ,a more advanced imaging satellite, is supposed to be launched by March although I would say Autumn would be more accurate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"epoca","CreatedById":136475,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-02T22:35:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s actually Iran\u0027s 5th satellite, after Sinah-1, Omid, Rasad-1 and Navid.
