There are two ways I will discuss, radial rotation (rolling) and tumbling rotation (pitch).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRadial Rotation:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022f667cf9bd4e624503a3d11a987c47480.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002266.71\u0022 height=\u0022491\u0022 width=\u0022736\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.pinimg.com/736x/f6/67/cf/f667cf9bd4e624503a3d11a987c47480.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the what most think of when they think of rotational gravity. Yet it has some challenges. As you know, all the weight in the torus is pulled toward the perimeter, thus the walls must be strong enough to support that weight at 1g if that is the gravity desired. It is arguably cheaper to strengthen the walls with heavy material, but spaceships must be lightweight, so some lightweight but strong and expensive material would likely be used instead.\u00A0Also, larger radius rings are ideal for gravity, as smaller radius ones just are\u0027nt due to disorientation. Yet larger radius often requires more mass, and once again we are confronted with the long drawn\u00A0 out process of orbital construction, since lifting something that heavy all at once is not economical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTumbling rotation: what I like is that only the rear and front sections of a rocket need to be strengthened, since the middie will be zero g during rotation anyway. So less hull reinforcement is required I believe, leading to cheaper and more readily produced rotational gravity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if built in orbit it not need be a 100 meters radius, only a\u00A0length of about a 100 meters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-10-18T06:23:32Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2019 06:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-19T18:07:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust to throw in some real world numbers here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Eye\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELondon Eye\u003C/a\u003E is a 120m diameter Ferris wheel.

As a point of comparison, the Saturn V was around 120m long.
