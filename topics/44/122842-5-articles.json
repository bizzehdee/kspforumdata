It\u0027s about the weight which directly cuts into your payload. That stage would need to have way more fuel in order to return and to transport all the necessary equipment to remain operational on it\u0027s own after separation from the payload. That includes at least RCS, comm systems, avionics and batteries. The capability to reuse it also requires an engine that can be reignited multiple times (on multiple missions) which is expensive to develop and heavier than a disposable one. And of course you need something to recover or land it after returning from a higher orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor conventional landings parachutes would do the job, but since you\u0027re planing to reuse it, diping it in salt water is a bad idea. So you likely also need retro rockets for the landing (something like super dracos or the system that soyuz uses). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWings and landing gear could work as well, but would likely be even heavier. Both options would require it to be significantly more structurally stable and heavier compared to a regular 3rd stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to recover it in space, you could skip that, but it now needs an attachement node and a canardarm instead (or something similar). The vehicle would also have to remain in space for quite some time which requires additional precautions. It would need to stay up there until the next skylon launches (assuming we still talk about suborbital skylon hop) and recovering something during on a suborbital trajeczory is already a stupidly difficult thing on it\u0027s own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd remember, all of this is fairly heavy equipment that could as well be replaced by something that actually remains in space and that you get paid for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom my point of view, skylon involves more than enough unproven technologies already.

It was a beautiful machine and a work of engineering art but it was also noisy and expensive to maintain and run. Turns out that most people didn\u0027t care about crossing the Atlantic in two hours - they wanted cheap flights to Spain to get some sun. I am intrigued about that paint colour assertion - compared to the other engineering challenges involved in building and running a supersonic airliner it sounds like a load of hooey to me, but I\u0027m quite willing to change my mind if you provide a link.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the all-British satellite launch.
