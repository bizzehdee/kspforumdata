It\u0027s odd because we would expect to find them somewhere. Astronomers were looking at globular clusters as potential candidates for containing IMBHs, but found that there is instead a swarm of stellar-mass black holes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Schwarzschild radius of the sun is about 3 km, which partially explains why these black holes don\u0027t coalesce into an IMBH. The collision cross-section is just extremely small, and in a cluster, the velocities will be extremely high, too high for the kind of gravitational frame-dragging that can slow black holes as they pass each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat would it look like if this swarm did finally collapse? Would it be a runaway chain reaction? What would the gravitational wave signal look like?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thought occurred to me. The Schwarzschild radius is directly proportional to mass, which is why the average density of a black hole decreases with size. A supermassive black hole actually has a relatively low average density; the\u00A0ultramassive black hole\u00A0in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TON_618\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETON 618\u003C/a\u003E has\u00A0an average density of just 4.23 grams per cubic meter, half the density of hydrogen at STP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t done the maths on this yet, but what repeated mergers of globular clusters created a swarm of stellar-mass black holes so dense that it created a supermassive black hole\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ewithout\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0any actual collisions?

But I have two quick thoughts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst of all, yes, merger of a cluster of stellar-mass black holes into a supermassive black hole is a runaway process. As you pointed out, Schwarzschild radius is proportional to the mass. That means the gravitational cross-section of a black hole goes as square of its mass.\u00A0 And because the probability of collision is product of cross-sections, two 2M black holes are twice as likely to have a collision in a unit of time as four 1M black holes. There is a percentage of energy that\u0027s lost to gravity waves during merger, but it\u0027s not too high. So if it takes a billion years for your cluster to go from an average of 1 solar mass to 10 solar masses, it will only take 100My to go to an average of 100 solar masses, then 10My to go to 1,000 solar masses... And near the end, it\u0027s actually going to get even faster. The final black hole is likely to be comparable to size of the initial cluster, possibly a lot bigger. So you\u0027ll start running out of space, severely increasing the rate of merges.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I can\u0027t tell you is what expected densities are for this runaway process to happen in time comparable to ages of galaxies. I suspect that critical density is very, very high, as stellar mass black holes are tiny. One thing that can speed it up drastically is if you start out with a swarm of stars with just a few black holes. Cross section between the star and stellar mass black hole is way higher than between two stellar mass black holes. But of course, now the black holes have to get way heavier before this is a runaway process again. Either way, all of these conditions sound like they\u0027d be far more abundant in early universe. So one possibility for why we\u0027re not seeing this is because it just doesn\u0027t happen anymore. That\u0027s a very ad-hoc explanation, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, the signal. For the longest duration of this process, I don\u0027t expect anything special. You\u0027ll have a very occasional collision between two black holes, and we\u0027ve already looked at these. And part of the problem is that while we have very clear expectations for what intermediate mass black hole merging with any other kind of black hole will look like, the signal isn\u0027t going to be very strong. This might be part of why we\u0027re not seeing a lot of that. If intermediate mass black holes are a brief note in a history of young galaxies, there might be nothing close enough for us to detect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, that final ring of black holes with thousands of solar masses merging into supermassive black hole should be distinctive, as you\u0027ll see a huge number of very heavy objects coming together almost at once. Trouble is, there might still not be any candidates close enough even at that strength, and also, I\u0027m not sure we\u0027ll be able to recognize it. This is the sort of thing that will make any GR sim cry binary tears, and the only way we have right now to analyze signals is simulate event we think it might be, and compare signals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut yeah, definitely run this by a cosmologist if you want concrete answers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-12T22:39:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223925358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022200305\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221613166891\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 minutes ago, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut yeah, definitely run this by a cosmologist if you want concrete answers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou know how a kugelblitz would be formed by getting all the photons (which don\u0027t interact with each other) into a very small space at once?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s sort of what I\u0027m thinking. Ordinarily you get a black hole merger when two tightly-bound black holes are orbiting each other closely and frame-dragging begins to suck them in. They are already interacting. But what would happen if a bunch of black holes entered the same space at high rates of speed\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ewithout\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0being gravitationally bound, as in the center of two or more merging globular clusters? They really wouldn\u0027t be interacting with any of each other directly, just like the photons in a collapsing kugelblitz aren\u0027t interacting with each other. But yet there would nevertheless be a moment when the gravitational well collapsed everything into a black hole.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsider two tightly-bound stellar-mass black holes being pulled together by frame-dragging:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022merger.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002236.01\u0022 height=\u0022274\u0022 width=\u0022761\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.postimg.cc/vmmYLFhd/merger.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe black discs are the individual event horizons of the two black holes, and the gray circle represents their combined event horizon.

The event horizons of the black holes have now entered their combined event horizon, but you do not yet have enough mass inside the event horizon for it to constitute a black hole. What about the next step? Now, you the centers of each black hole solidly within their combined event horizon but the two event horizons have not yet overlapped. Finally, you have contact, over on the right. Which one marks the actual point of merger?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the swarm at the center of a black hole cluster, however, you no longer have tightly-bound black holes. You have a bunch of black holes zipping past each other at breakneck speeds.

Subatomic particles are kind of the same way - we draw them as tiny little spheres, but it\u0027s all fields, so collisions are never really collisions - it\u0027s interactions. And because they\u0027re all just whizzing about at relativistic speeds, you don\u0027t care about specific details of a particular\u00A0interaction. What you start talking about are cross-sections. It\u0027s the section area within which a particular interaction, such as capture, will happen with given probability. And yes, cross-section can depend on relative energies. So you start looking at it statistically. Given the average energy within a cluster and average mass, what is the probability per unit time that two black holes will come close enough to each other that gravitational wave this generates will steal enough kinetic energy to cause them to merge. And no matter what your cluster parameters may be, it\u0027s a finite number. So eventually, any cluster will merge - what we care about is how that \u0022eventually\u0022 compares to age of the universe. But we\u0027re still talking billions of years here, potentially, so the odds don\u0027t have to be\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethat high\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the crucial part is that cross-section is increasing as square of the mass, because whatever the shape of that curve is going to be based on your threshold probability and energy, I know that it will scale with Schwarzschild radius. So if on average, a stellar mass black hole in your cluster will encounter another black hole in a billion years, then in two billion years, the entire cluster will be a single black hole.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo again, what this comes down to is, a) Is this the only mechanism, or can you really grow a cluster to the point where you can\u0027t treat stellar mass black holes as individual objects, and have to treat the whole thing as one GR mess, b) Which mechanism is dominant, and c) Is either of these relevant on the scale of life time of the universe for a typical galaxy. To answer these you need to actually build models and crunch numbers. Hopefully, somebody has done that already, and it\u0027s just something you can find out from somebody working in the field.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-13T02:00:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223925358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022200305\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221613166891\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, that final ring of black holes with thousands of solar masses merging into supermassive black hole should be distinctive, as you\u0027ll see a huge number of very heavy objects coming together almost at once.
