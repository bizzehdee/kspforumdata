The reason lift is generated on any body is due to circulation. The precise statement is in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kutta%E2%80%93Joukowski_theorem\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EKutta-Joukowski Theorem\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E. Circulation is generated in the air stream by combination of body geometry and angle of attack. A brick will generate lift given proper angle of attack. The main reason for all the curves on the wing is actually to reduce drag and increase the critical angle of attack, which allows for much better flight characteristic. Camber on a wing can also allow for positive lift with zero angle of attack, which may be convenient, but isn\u0027t strictly necessary. Many jet fighters have symmetrical wings and generate lift purely due to angle of attack. A body can also have a \u003Cem\u003Enegative\u003C/em\u003E lift due to camber, and still have net positive lift due to high angle of attack. M2-F1 appears to be such a case. All of the pictures have it flying with significant nose-up attitude, which is probably necessary for it to generate lift. IIRC, such aircraft tend to have pretty lousy flight characteristics at high speeds, but allow for very low speed landings/takeoffs, making them of some interest to navy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T10:20:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENote that lifting bodies do not really \u0022fly\u0022.

To get a better idea of how that works look at capsules that reenter the atmosphere. Apollo for example also created lift by not flying perfectly straight through the airstream, but angled. The heat shield was jsed to create lift. It\u0027s typically used to stay longer in the high parts of the atmosphere which helps to reduce reentry temperatures as you reduce your velocity slower and over a longer periode of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELifting bodies also create some lift like regular wings do.

Simple example, you have a 747 at FL400 and you want to turn in a circle, you are roughly talking about 25km in a 30 bank turn. Why, 747 in level flight has one of the best glide characteristics do to its wing shape, it can almost approach the speed of sound, but it can\u0027t turn worth much at 400.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emomentum, it GS is near 500 kts.

It can slow down however at flight configuration it would stall, and fall. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo just before landing, say 20 km aircraft are expected to make 30 bank turns changing about 30 degrees. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo as the 747 descends it begine to lower flaps, this makes the wing much less able to glide at high speed but much more capable of flying at lower speed. Flaps increase the differential distance air has to travel over the top of the wing. This increases lift, but in a turn it also increases the change of angle per volume of air traveled through, because turnig is steered from the tail and produce from the wings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a result the plane can turn full circle over a few kilometers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding. Most planes could survive a landing withou flaring, but not at flight level speed, 170kts and traveling 1000 feet per 3 nauticle miles they are traveling downward at 17 feet per second. Contact the insurance company afterward. If the craft was traveling at flight level configuration, that would be 265kts, thats 26kts -verticle and you have airframe collapse on the runway as well as a wreckage that flies off the runway. Flaps are responsible for flight control at low speed, they allow the AC a nose level on approach an a tiny flare puts the front gear just a little bit off the runway so that a moment after wheels down the thrust diverters can be deployed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to correct these. The shape of the wing is adjusted during the flight to make it more or less like a plane for the purpose of flight control. If you need lift at low speed bernoulli is your friend, if you need efficiency at high speed low profile into the angle of attack is your friend. if you want to turn fast lots of control surfaces are going to need to be deployed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wizzlebippi","CreatedById":85324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T02:27:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a general guideline, the round fuselage of many civilian aircraft produces as much lift at the section of wing it obscures.

At that alt the IAS is near the minimum in trim flight to support the craft, the engines cannot produce much more thrust, they are often close to the N1 limit. Increasing flap would certainly allow a slower craft but dramatically increase drag, which a slower craft has less engine output, which means stall is more likely. The point though is that at FL400 and 500kts Flight control is heavily restricted by a performance application. If there was a runway at 39,000 feet the craft could not land because a precision turn would be impossible, it could not make a proceedure descent 6nm out. and it would hit the runway at 52 fps. dare say the wheels would prolly explode if the a/c flared in time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are craft that could do this, not commercial, but have alot more wing and thus fly much more slowly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should also make the point in that increasing the crossectional curvature of the wing does not increase lift indefinitely, on many commercial craft the last one or two flap settings do little more than increase drag and make it somewhat easiler to stop a heavy load.

The cross section of an airfoil has everything to due with its purpose. You\u0027ll find most aircraft have wings cambered or curved on the top, and the rear wings (horizontal stabilizers) cambered on the bottom. The reason is because aircraft are generally designed to have the center of lift behind the center of mass. This creates a torque or pull that would generally send an aircraft into a nose-down spin - the negative lift from the stabilizers at the rear help cancel that out. (Though in my personal experience some companies design planes so that help is needed in that department. ~3 weeks ago a buddy of mine had to maintenance ferry an airplane from Tuscon AZ to Mesa AZ, and since the aircraft was empty of fuel bags and people it was so tail heavy they had to round up about 900 lbs of junk to throw in the front galley before they could legally fly.

It\u0027s also easier to see what orientation the aircraft is in from the ground when it\u0027s shaped more like an airfoil and less like a cylinder. I\u0027d be extremely interested to see what you design. I find the most interesting (and difficult) part of designing any non traditional aircraft is the placement (or lack thereof) of stabilizers and flight controls.

Not to be build, just as a feasibility study. The idea is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA reusable heavy launch vehicle, that can get 100t to orbit. To do this i thought about an kerosene or methane lower stage with a flight profile of the Falcon 9R, it would be similar in performance to the Saturn V first stage. For the upper stage hydrogen would be ideal, not only because of the high efficency, but also because of the low density. This would result in a very large upper stage with extremly low ballistic coefficient, which would result in lower reentry temperatures (Skylon is supposed to work that way, according to wikipedia it would only heat to 800\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C) so a lightweight, easy to maintain heatshield would be enough. This second stage would be about as large as an space shuttle external tank, with engines similar to 4 SSMEs. A dry weight of 100T should be possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe question would be how to build the tanks so you get the best compromise of good tank weight and flight characteristics on reentry...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-13T00:31:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyes but from a level flight to dro 2000feet using the 3nm per 1000 feet, the standard final approach, the craft would have so much momentum at 500 kts that by the time it reached the OM it would have past the threshold before it began a safe descent vector.
