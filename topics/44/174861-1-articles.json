This includes the brand new falcon heavy. From what I can tell, plans to make the ITS and now very serious work to build the BFR have been in the works before falcon heavy became viable. So if the BFR concept has always been planned to replace everything, why did they use all the time and money for Falcon Heavy instead of accelerating the BFR? I can see some logic in being sure you have a heavy/super heavy lifter, just in case BFR got seriously delayed, but the FH resources could have gone towards ensuring the BFR program had a stronger financial backbone and thus more likely to succeed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-12T16:42:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe point of BFR is not super heavy lifting.
