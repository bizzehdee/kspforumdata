It\u0027s perfectly possible to recover a first stage that was on a stack; this was in fact planned for the Ares I first stage (which was a solid-fuel rocket, basically a shuttle SRB with an extra segment added). I think the reason it isn\u0027t done so much on stacks is that above a certain weight, you cannot effectively recover something with parachutes. The shuttle SRBs used among the largest parachutes ever made; the record was broken by parachutes being tested for the Ares I first stage. Three of these are put on the booster, and they only slow it to 23 m/s at splashdown (admittedly, even empty SRBs weigh 91 metric tons, but still). Taking that kind of impact is not easy, and the shuttle SRBs were among the first heavy rockets built to take it. With liquid rockets, you tend to have more moving parts (such as turbopumps), and you really, really, really don\u0027t want to expose it to seawater, and a land touchdown *will* destroy it at those kinds of speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe advantage of side staging has nothing to do with reusability - it\u0027s because side-staged engines are never deadweight. That makes side staging beat serial staging, but it might not beat not staging at all (in which case there just aren\u0027t deadweight engines, period). It\u0027s been used like this for a while - the R-7 and the Atlas missile both use side staging for that reason. However, that mostly affects TWR, which is irrelevant at altitude - hence why side staging is used for the first stage, but not for upper stages.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Armchair Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":76165,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-21T01:49:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhen we built the saturn 5 rocket, every stage was discarded after staging and was not recoverable.

First of all, the space shuttle SRBs are built like tanks compared to any liquid-fueled booster. At the descent speeds achievable with a parachutes, an LFB\u0027s fuel tanks would crumple like a soda can, to say nothing of delicate parts like engine nozzles. For that matter, LFBs would be more susceptible to being torn apart by aerodynamic forces in an uncontrolled descent. Second, the SRBs don\u0027t have too many moving parts, so dunking them in seawater isn\u0027t that bad, but liquid-fueled engines would require a LOT of refurbishment after a splashdown. Third, the more dV the boosters contribute, the faster they\u0027ll be going at separation. Too fast, and they\u0027ll burn up or be torn apart on reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, let\u0027s say we want to redesign the SLS with giant reusable liquid-fueled boosters. First of all, we don\u0027t want hydrogen providing most of the takeoff thrust, so we\u0027ll switch to kerosene. While we\u0027re at it, let\u0027s make the core stage kerosene too so we don\u0027t have to deal with different refueling equipment. The boosters can\u0027t handle a splashdown, so they\u0027ll have to perform a powered landing either back at the launch site or downrange on a floating platform. This means many engines on the booster so that it can provide very low thrust when it needs to. They also can\u0027t contribute too much dV or we\u0027d waste a lot of fuel slowing down enough to survive reentry. About the size of the core stage is a good maximum. But if our boosters are about the size of the core stage, we might as well make them identical and use a lot of the same hardware. Since they\u0027re using the same fuel, we can boost the payload capacity by adding fuel crossfeed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EYa know, this rocket is starting to look kinda familiar...\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sgt_flyer","CreatedById":57690,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-21T04:50:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELiquid fuel boosters for the SLS is already something being researched on, for future SLS upgrades.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAmong the contestants for advanced boosters design for SLS block II, P\u0026amp;W, Rocketdyne and dynetics have associated to revive Saturn V F-1 engine, to create the Pyrios booster - a Kerolox booster, each booster propelled by two of their F-1B engines, - the ISP advantage the pyrios would have over other planned Block II SRB would allow SLS to lift 20 more tons than it\u0027s competitors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP LFB KR1x2 is modelled after the pyrios booster concept art.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Besides, one of the other advantages of LFB would be to lower drastically the weight the Crawler would have to transport to the pad - they would be fueled only one in position, whereas the SRB\u0027s are full before getting out of the VAB.) - for an idea,in prevision for the various SLS configurations they had to increase the crawler\u0027s lifting weight from 5400 metric tons to 8200 metric tons.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"R0cketC0der","CreatedById":106748,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-21T08:25:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAside from the problems others have mentioned, reusability doesn\u0027t directly translate to a lower launch price.

For example, like the SSME\u0027s do. During staging, keep some liquid fuel/oxidizer circulating around the tank like ribs that would help cool the rocket as it reenters the atmosphere. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, you\u0027d have to run literally thousands of little pipes around the entire outside of the stage.

That means you\u0027d have to boil off the fuel to cool the vehicle, essentially using it like an ablative heat shield. Since oxygen and methane can\u0027t absorb that much heat by boiling, this fuel would be put to much better use with a braking burn, with the added advantage of not requiring the heavy plumbing. For that matter, an actual ablative heat shield - most likely using some kind of spray-on coating would be more effective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActive cooling systems have been proposed for spacecraft, but generally for things like SSTO spaceplanes on the way up (which would have significant aerodynamic heating with the engines running, meaning you could immediately burn the boiled fuel), or orbital reentry (where the speeds are so high that braking burns aren\u0027t practical).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBuild lighter parachutes OR keep the cooled fuel you used as reentry protection to slow down the rocket moments before splashdown.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPropulsive splashdown partially solves the structural issues, although the stage could still topple over after its engines were underwater and smack its upper section into the surface (I\u0027ve lost some stages like this in KSP), and liquid engines still don\u0027t like saltwater.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne idea I really like for lower-stage reusability is the BDB (Big Dumb Boat) approach. Basically, you land the stage on a floating platform downrange of the launch site. Semi-submersible vessels are very popular for deep water oil drilling because they\u0027re very stable even with wave action, which also happens to be a desirable trait when you\u0027re trying to land a tall rocket stage on one. Used oil platforms are about a hundred million dollars, and new ones a few times more, so $200M for a landing platform is reasonable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe platform would be towed into position approximately where the first stage would land by tugboats. At launch time, the tugboats and all personnel would station themselves several miles away, and the stage would guide itself to a propulsive landing. Once the stage is safely landed, the crew would return and perform any necessary post-flight checks. At this point, the stage could either be partially refueled and fitted with an aerodynamic nose cap, then fly itself back to the launch site (giving turnaround times of a few hours) or be loaded onto a boat and sailed back to the launch site (still allowing turnaround of less than 24 hours).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, SpaceX wants \u0022single digit hours\u0022 turnaround with their lower stages. However, this wouldn\u0027t allow much more than a preliminary \u0022are there gaping holes in the airframe or missing engines) inspection before slapping on a second stage and payload, refueling, and launching again. Besides, a launch provider doing 200 flights a year (a lot) with a fleet of 5 reusable vehicles would only need to launch an individual vehicle every 9 days. Also, on a fully reusable vehicle the second stage wouldn\u0027t even be back yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn theory, a second landing platform could be used, with one for low-inclination orbits and one for high-inclination orbits, meaning less time and fuel spent towing multi-kiloton platforms around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, this approach would be great for the core stage of a rocket with big boosters (such as the Falcon Heavy core), which would be going too fast to return to the launch site. However, the boosters would probably be going slowly enough to just boost back to the launch site.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xcorps","CreatedById":96531,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-23T02:30:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESemi-submersible vessels are very popular for deep water oil drilling because they\u0027re very stable even with wave action, which also happens to be a desirable trait when you\u0027re trying to land a tall rocket stage on one.
