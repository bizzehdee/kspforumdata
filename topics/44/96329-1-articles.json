First stage engines burn for 180 seconds, and they generate 5885 kN of thrust at sea level with a specific impulse of 282 s. Therefore there is around 383 tonnes of reaction mass in the first stage. With an average Isp of 300 s, the first stage would provide around 4.09 km/s of delta-v. This is obviously less with the reusable first stage, as it has to fly back and carry landing legs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we assume 9.5 km/s to LEO and further 2.5 km/s to GTO, the upper stage has to provide around 7.9 km/s of delta-v.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-11T12:15:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022B787_300\u0022 data-cite=\u0022B787_300\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe first Stage burns out while moving at almost 2 km/s which is quite fast, the main thing is that the first stage pushed the 2nd high enough that its main job was to circularize\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight. Atmo \u002B gravity eats through about 1.5km/s. So it needs to be closer to 3.5km/s total.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe can also do the math based on the stats. v1.1 is 505T off the pad. It has 5,885kN of thrust at 311s for 180s. That\u0027s 347T of fuel leaving 158T ascending at stage separation.

Similar math to above (801kN @ 342s for 375s) gives me 90T of fuel in second stage. With the 5.4km/s assumption above, this works out to a 22T rocket reaching orbit, of which 13T is the payload. That means empty, dry 2nd stage is 9T. Fueled with payload, 112T. And that leaves 46T for empty first stage.
