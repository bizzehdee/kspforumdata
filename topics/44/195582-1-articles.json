If tidal forces were based solely on comparative masses, the sun should have a tide-generating force that is 27 million times greater than that of the moon. However, the sun is 390 times further from the Earth than is the moon. Thus, its tide-generating force is reduced by 390\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E, or about 59 million times less than the moon. Because of these conditions, the sun\u2019s tide-generating force is about half that of the moon (Thurman, H.V., 1994).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-07-13T18:14:43Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2020 06:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by mikegarrison\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-13T20:12:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223820076\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022195582\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221594663886\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022137807\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mikegarrison\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, mikegarrison said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUm ... I live near the ocean and I\u0027ve seen a lot of tide tables. It\u0027s not obvious that \u0022the ocean tide is always synced with the time of solar day\u0022. Really big tides are synced to full and new moons, as well as the equinoxes and solstices, so there are definitely interactions with the sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, there are so many factors in local tides that go way beyond gravity. The day-night cycle is a lot faster than lunar cycle, obviously, and water has a lot of inertia, which means the two cycles will not have the same effect even if they were at the same strength. If you\u0027re living by the bay, the tides aren\u0027t due to water in the bay being pulled by gravity, but hydrodynamic flow of water in the sea/ocean around it, which is driven, among other things, by gravity. But how shallow the water is, how wide the inlet, etc, makes way more of a difference. In general, it\u0027s still synced to the tidal rhythm, albeit, with a bit of a lag, unless you\u0027re directly on ocean shore. And your highest tide is still going to be around the full or new moon, when Sun and Moon work in tandem rather than in opposition.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, this also has negligible impact on rotation of the Earth. The water that\u0027s sloshing around bays and shorelines is just not enough mass to make an impact. And the tides in the open ocean are a lot simpler. There is still a factor of water mass, but topography no longer plays any role. \u003Cs\u003EAnd the Sun has significantly greater impact there than the Moon. Not by as giant of a factor as Sun/Moon mass ratio, of course, due to the distance difference, as you indicated, but noticeably. It\u0027s probably sufficient to point out that Moon is pulled on by Sun\u0027s gravity more than by Earth\u0027s, and Moon\u0027s pull on Earth is going to be smaller by the mass ratio of these two bodies.\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0(Edit: Corrected by mikegarrison - tidal effect of the Moon is, in fact stronger. See link in quoted post.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, the tides caused by Sun on Earth have absolutely nothing to do with Earth migrating from the Sun due to tidal effects. You should be looking at tides that Earth-Moon system is causing on the Sun. And that\u0027s a whole another story, because the Sun\u0027s movement itself is rather complex. It\u0027s not even at the center of the Solar System at the moment. So you have to talk about how all of the planets interact with the Sun together to see what sort of tidal effects this results in, and then propagate that back to individual planets to see how much they get pushed around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-07-13T20:59:11Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2020 08:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by K^2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-13T20:25:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223820119\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022195582\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221594671133\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 minutes ago, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe tides in the open ocean are a lot simpler.

Then the average angular momentum after each collision is not high enough to maintain the current orbit, so Jupiter falls toward the proto-sun, experiencing a kind of \u0022drag\u0022. Keep in mind that Jupiter wasn\u0027t at its current mass, it gained mass throughout the entire process. Some of the material it collided with was captured and some wasn\u0027t. This is also part of the explanation for why the asteroid belt has so little mass (getting kicked out or getting absorbed by Jupiter), and even related to Mars having less mass than what might be expected. So there\u0027s enough material - much of it is in Jupiter today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Sun was likely rotating faster billions of years ago - and since Jupiter was closer the tides would have been stronger. So it could potentially bring Jupiter to its current orbit. The tidal acceleration affect would have been stronger initially since Jupiter would have been closer and the Sun would have been rotating faster. Though I suspect this may not be entirely enough - some gravitational effect from Saturn likely also factors in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s also possible that Jupiter didn\u0027t migrate that far into the inner solar system, instead reaching an equilibrium point where the drag was much lower.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
