The \u0027P\u0027 and \u0027D\u0027 portions of the acronym are effectively the to-course and on-course corrections respectively. The difference is that they are computed continuously, so that you never switch from one to the other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0027I\u0027 is the integral portion which corrects for any continuous action trying to move you off course. Such as, if there is a constant current trying to carry you off course.

Guidance programs used a preprogrammed pitch v. time table up until they\u0027d mostly left the atmosphere, only then switching to some closed-loop guidance program and correcting for any deviations that may have occurred during ascent. Trying to actually account for aerodynamics in real time is really, really hard when you\u0027ve got restricted computing capabilities, and most of the time it just isn\u0027t worth it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pand5461","CreatedById":172084,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-22T11:35:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/178039-spaced-out/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022178039\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/178039-spaced-out/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Spaced Out\u003C/a\u003E short answer is: of course there are some deviations but we know how to deal with them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLong answer: modern launchers have onboard guidance systems that detect the perturbations and recalculate the attitude program needed to get to desired orbit on the go (so-called closed-loop control). Switch to closed-loop control usually happens when rocket leaves the thick part of atmosphere, as \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157062-incongruousgoat/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022157062\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157062-incongruousgoat/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@IncongruousGoat\u003C/a\u003E already mentioned. One reason for that is that onboard computers have very limited capabilities to properly optimize atmospheric flight. Another is that large perturbations of reference trajectory early in flight will likely result in mission failure anyways, and small ones can be easily adjusted for later. So it\u0027s just much more reasonable to calculate the reference atmospheric trajectory and follow that as close as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the early space era, I believe, a number of trajectories were precomputed for missions where precision was crucial (like shooting the Moon), accounting for possible deviations. Rocket was then guided from ground stations based on which trajectory it\u0027s currently on. Sometimes the precision was just not that important, so just a simple precomputed pitch-time program for the whole ascent was enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
