I submit that they can\u0027t be - even if they wish to be kept hidden - unless they decide not to make contact at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming we are limiting interstellar travel to speeds below that of light, any alien ship to arrive in the solar system will announce its presence by its drive plume. I\u0027d expect that in short order, every observatory on Earth would be tracking the plume and scientists would shortly realize what\u0027s generating it. From there, the cat is out of the bag. Any attempt by a government to cover things up would be futile unless astronomy, both professional and amateur, was made illegal and all telescopes confiscated and destroyed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf a government needed motivation for such a cover-up, futile as it is, I suspect fear of chaos would be the reason. The idea that we\u0027d panic, flip tables, yell \u0022THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING\u0022, burn Bibles, torch cities, etc \u003Cem\u003Ead nauseum\u003C/em\u003E is so popular I\u0027d imagine more than a few politicians would panic themselves, and try the cover-up to \u0022save civilization\u0022. Said politicians really need to take a lesson from King Canute, who supposedly tried to command the tides to stop. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only scenarios I could see where aliens being kept secret would actually work would be these:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Alien remains are unearthed somewhere, perhaps the result of a failed colony or a stranded survey team. Politicians panic as per above and try to cover it up. Far more likely, the archaeologists themselves disbelieve the alien hypothesis (with kooks like the \u0022Ancient Aliens\u0022 proponents providing a huge motivator) and search for a more earthbound hypothesis to explain their findings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. A small alien colony exists on Earth since before the modern era, and wishes to be kept hidden - not from us humans, but from other aliens. Keeping their existence out of our news broadcasts might be their only defense against their otherworldly enemies (as Benjamin Franklin once noted, \u0022three men may keep a secret - if two of them are dead.\u0022). If they have some remnants of advanced technology with them, they might trade such technology with our governments to buy their silence.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-30T23:25:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AndrewBCrisp\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AndrewBCrisp\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou know, when an old, outmoded theory is replaced by new, better theory in science, people call it progress.
