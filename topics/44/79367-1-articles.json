Isn\u0027t the spacecraft outrunning the sound waves produced by the engines? If so, shouldn\u0027t there be no sound in front of the engines? The only explanation I have is: 1) The audio is mixed in from ground crews 2) The camera is IN the SRB tank, and picks up the vibrations from the rocket motor ONLY. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have an explanation for this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"R0cketC0der","CreatedById":106748,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T20:05:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe microphone is mounted on the booster and therefore picks up any vibrations from it.
