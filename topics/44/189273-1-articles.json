Probably heavily dependent on their approach to us. Most civilisations have been cautious but curious about visitors.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen again, if the civilisations arose on the same continent but encountered each other later, there might be a more gentle interaction; probably still lots of wars, but also trade and cultural exchanges which would eventually result in a society similar to our modern one, just instead of the differences being limited to minor racial differences it would be multiple species along with racial differences within each species. Perhaps that might make the merged society more tolerant, rather than less?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the latter case (interplanetary contact) I would hope to guess contact would be friendly - it would take technology on par to our current civilisation to reach other planets and mostly we\u0027ve started to respect other cultures now; at least in cases when there are no economic pressures. Case in point the tribe on that Indian island is being actively protected, whereas the natives in the Amazon are still being driven away/killed by local farmers with only lackluster governmental protection.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d strongly suspect that if we had detected not only life, but a civilisation on another planet by now we\u0027d have rapidly continued to advance\u00A0our technology sufficiently to be routinely able to travel there and back instead of stagnating in LEO. If they would be at a similar level to us technologically we\u0027d probably have established long-range communication before and have had significant cultural exchange prior to a physical meeting. If they had not yet reached our level of civilisation I\u0027d strongly suspect we\u0027d practice a no-interference policy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"farmerben","CreatedById":190194,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-25T13:30:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIntelligent aliens would be able to manipulate humans into treating other humans in ways that served the aliens interest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
