Also the stoichoimetric ratio will the hottest reaction but it may not have the highest exit velocity. For instance hydrolox engines run fuel heavy because the unburnt hydrogen significantly reduces the average molar mass of the products of reaction.

If you are following that first 70pg PDF you found (I forgot the name) some of those equations are empirical equations, and many already have gravitational factors built in and should only be used with English Engineering units and not SI or British Gravitational.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) How long are you planning on having the engine burn?

There are a couple things I noticed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) You can actually predict the performance of an idealized one dimensional case for varying O/F ratios. Also the stoichoimetric ratio will the hottest reaction but it may not have the highest exit velocity. For instance hydrolox engines run fuel heavy because the unburnt hydrogen significantly reduces the average molar mass of the products of reaction. A good tool for determining this stuff is \u003Ca href=\u0022http://cearun.grc.nasa.gov\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENASAcea\u003C/a\u003E. You will likely have to follow an iterative process to get the maximum results\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) I notice you vary your units a lot, this can be a significant problem where your numbers can be significantly thrown off. If you are following that first 70pg PDF you found (I forgot the name) some of those equations are empirical equations, and many already have gravitational factors built in and should only be used with English Engineering units and not SI or British Gravitational.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) How long are you planning on having the engine burn? If the burn is short enough you may be able to use a cheaper material and rely on the thermal mass/thermal inertia for cooling the engine. Otherwise you are significantly complicating your system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) Also there are tool available, some of which are free, which can help with that nozzle design, alternatively you could just use a 15 degree conical nozzle which would be significantly easier to machine on your part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5) Also make sure to figure out how you are addressing your pressurant issue as it will significantly alter the performance and stability of your engine.

Thanks for yout toughts, much appreciated! In response to your points,\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) Yes you can but the math is horrible. About o/f ratios, I mention that \u0022 There is an exception to that if running fuel-rich reduces the molecular weight of your exhaust, such as in hydrogen burning engines, but that is honestly beyond the scope of this discussion \u0022 so maybe you missed that part \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut really, I\u0027m not aiming for max performance. I\u0027m aiming for simplicity.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) All relevant calculations are performed with EE units. I use metric in my head, so I usually convert back and forth, but yes, I have taken the empirical nature of the equations that you mention into account.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n3) I\u0027m designing for indefinite run time, with a cooling jacket, but will operate it in 5 second increments, up to a max of 30 seconds when I have done many many test firings. Surely that is overkill, but then again, i\u0027m not aiming for a lightweight engine here.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n4) It surely would be easier to design, but I worry about the angle on the throat, where the nozzle and inlet are joined... A sharp corner there seems like it would be counterproductive? This requires more tought.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n5) That is already taken into account, I will use pressure regulators to get constant oxidizer and fuel pressures despite variations in tank supply pressure with expansion.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOnce again thanks for the feedback, it sure is appreciated!
