Although the engine, turbine and liquid hydrogen tank were never physically assembled together, the NERVA was deemed ready to design into a working vehicle by NASA, creating a small political crisis in Congress because of the danger a Mars exploration program presented to the national budget. Clinton P. Anderson, the New Mexico senator who had protected the program, had become severely ill. Lyndon B. Johnson, another powerful advocate of human space exploration, had decided not to run for a second term and was considerably weakened. NASA program funding was somewhat reduced by Congress for the 1969 budget, and the incoming Nixon administration reduced it still further for 1970, shutting down the Saturn rocket production line and cancelling Apollo missions after Apollo 17. Without the Saturn S-N rocket to carry the NERVA to orbit, Los Alamos continued the Rover Program for a few more years with Pewee and the Nuclear Furnace, but it was disbanded by 1972.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most serious injury during testing was a hydrogen explosion in which two employees sustained foot and ear drum injuries. At one point in 1965 the liquid hydrogen storage at Test Cell #2 during a Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory Test was accidentally allowed to run dry; the core overheated and ejected on to the floor of the Nevada desert. Test Site personnel waited 3 weeks and then walked out and collected the pieces without mishap. The nuclear waste from the damaged core was spread across the desert and was collected by an Army group as a decontamination exercise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[edit]In the space program\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENASA plans for NERVA included a visit to Mars by 1978 and a permanent lunar base by 1981. NERVA rockets would be used for nuclear \u0022tugs\u0022 designed to take payloads from Low Earth Orbit to larger orbits as a component of the later-named Space Transportation System, resupply several space stations in various orbits around the Earth and Moon, and support a permanent lunar base. The NERVA rocket would also be a nuclear-powered upper stage for the Saturn rocket (the Saturn S-N), which would allow the upgraded Saturn to launch much larger payloads of up to 340,000 pounds to Low Earth Orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENERVA rockets had progressed rapidly to the point where they could run for hours, limited in run time by the size of the liquid hydrogen propellant tanks at the Jackass Flats test site. They also climbed in power density. The larger NERVA I rocket gradually gave way to the smaller NERVA II rocket in mission plans as efficiency increased and thrust-to-weight ratios grew, and the KIWI gradually gave way at Los Alamos to the smaller Pewee and Pewee 2 as funding was cut to lower and lower levels by Congress and the Nixon administration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe RIFT vehicle consisted of a Saturn S-IC first stage, an SII stage and an S-N (Saturn-Nuclear) third stage. The Space Nuclear Propulsion Office planned to build ten RIFT vehicles, six for ground tests and four for flight tests, but RIFT was delayed after 1966 as NERVA became a political proxy in the debate over a Mars mission. The nuclear Saturn C-5 would carry two to three times more payload into space than the chemical version, enough to easily loft 340,000 pound space stations and replenish orbital propellant depots. Wernher von Braun also proposed a manned Mars mission using NERVA and a spinning donut-shaped spacecraft to simulate gravity. Many of the NASA plans for Mars in the 1960s and early 1970s used the NERVA rocket specifically, see list of manned Mars mission plans in the 20th century.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mars mission became NERVA\u0027s downfall.[2] Members of Congress in both political parties judged that a manned mission to Mars would be a tacit commitment for the United States to decades more of the expensive Space Race. Manned Mars missions were enabled by nuclear rockets; therefore, if NERVA could be discontinued the Space Race might wind down and the budget would be saved. Each year the RIFT was delayed and the goals for NERVA were set higher. Ultimately, RIFT was never authorized, and although NERVA had many successful tests and powerful Congressional backing, it never left the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn conclusion: In the Early 1970s, Nixon saw the NERVA project as a gateway to a manned Mars station, which he also saw as ending up costing a LOT of money. Remember in the early 70s we were still in the Cold War with the Soviets, so anything we would try to do, the Soviets would (shortly thereafter, and pretending it was their idea all along) also do the same thing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, Nixon didn\u0027t want to get into a spending match with the Soviets, to see who could blow the most money on their space program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s too bad, too, because this could be seen as the end of manned exploration in space.

Or something...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s exactly what I meant. Hubris, incompetence, greed, and sheer stupidity. Humans a prone to it, and nuclear power can be such a pain-in-the-ass when it comes to making mistakes, that it\u0027s wise to plan against human idiocy. A lot more than we do for say, airplanes. As for space agencies being somehow immune to bad design, error, and incompetence, (as the person I quoted asserted) that\u0027s equally absurd. NASA whelped a probe once by human-error and bad design, by completely mucking-up metric-to-imperial conversions. And Hubble was definitely a case of bad design and error (I\u0027m not bashing the telescope here; the thing is fantastic), which just goes to show mistakes happen, even at the best of times when you\u0027re extra vigilant. Add a bit of corporate greed and complacency to the mix, and you have a recipe for things to go very wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy point is, that most of the time, we can afford for something to go wrong some of the time. Civil aviation is a wonderfully safe enterprise, where things go right almost all the time, and when they go wrong...okay, some people die, but on the whole not that many when you consider how many people get moved-about in the same time frame. When nuclear power plants go wrong, they can go very, very, very wrong in the worst cases (analogous in this case to the plane crashing into a mountain, say; rare, but happens). We\u0027ve learned from our mistakes, sure, but we\u0027re still human. That means we need to be hyper-vigilant, and more so when these toys are in the hands of people with profit motives that want to squeeze their margins for all they\u0027re worth.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"karolus10","CreatedById":17876,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-15T22:31:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn short : don\u0027t give torch stupid person or he burn his house down (and entire neighborhood) instead illuminate it\u0027s interior \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"a1fonzo","CreatedById":35942,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-16T00:07:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIMO eventually the human race will figure out how to use nuclear power and everything without any risks but like so many things all we can do is wait.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LaydeeDem","CreatedById":5984,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-16T01:27:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022a1fonzo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022a1fonzo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIMO eventually the human race will figure out how to use nuclear power and everything without any risks but like so many things all we can do is wait.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe know how to handle it safely, but some people get ignorant.
