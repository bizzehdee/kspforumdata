Some are constrained by the amount of space available. Often payloads to the ISS are not full -- the disposal capability is more valuable than sending supplies. A guitar weighs basically nothing, but is bulky, hence space is the consideration. If they hadn\u0027t put the guitar on the payload, it wouldn\u0027t have affected the cost of the shuttle mission by any dollars. Likewise with the torch. If there\u0027s space, it costs nothing to add these lightweight items.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand your thinking, but it does not work that way. See my previous comment about 10.000 guitars. According to you, none of those guitars would cost anything to add seperately, but I assume you are not claiming that getting 10.000 guitars to space will be free. Payload is payload and the cost of a kilogram of payload is the total cost devided by the amount kilograms to orbit. You cannot pick and choose which part of the payload you include in the costs and which part you do not.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
