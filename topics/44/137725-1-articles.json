Unfortunately, it\u0027s doubtful than anyone will bother to build or design such a craft unless the market for rapid small-payload LEO launch already exists. This creates a chicken and egg problem, where the market won\u0027t exist until the launch vehicle does, and the launch vehicle won\u0027t exist until the market does.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s possible, however, that a launch vehicle could be designed for a broader market, thus becoming available without requiring the rapid small-payload LEO launch market to exist first. From an economic/investment standpoint, it is much more attractive to build a vehicle which can use an existing market than it is to build a vehicle on the speculation that it will create a nonexistent market.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuch a market could potentially be realized in a similar way to how we first got into space: using the same vehicles for suborbital and orbital flights. The US and the USSR both figured out that the gigantic missiles they were planning to use to lob nukes on suborbital trajectories could, when properly staged, be used to boost payloads into orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany\u00A0orbit-capable vehicles would make excellent hypersonic suborbital transports, suitable for transporting a large payload between any two points on Earth in an extremely short time. With a decent-sized fleet of such vehicles* servicing regular hypersonic transportation around the globe, you would have the support infrastructure necessary to service those same vehicles on orbital flights, either with reduced payloads or with a launch assist stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe question, then: does such a market exist? Is there a need for large cargo (or, on the other hand, passenger transport) to be whipped around the world in a matter of hours, regularly?

There\u0027s really nothing in the world that needs to be shipped in bulk to the other side of the world in a matter of hours...at least, not so desperately that people would pay for a suborbital spaceflight to accomplish it.

There\u0027s a glimmer of hope here, because while the difference between hypersonic and supersonic flight may be fairly low, supersonic options don\u0027t currently exist, and there is a big difference between hypersonic and subsonic flight. Subsonic flight means a trip to the other side of the world can take a day or longer; supersonic cuts this to several hours...suborbital hypersonic means no two points on the globe are more than an hour apart.\u00A0There\u0027s a fair probability that the ability to commute around the world would prove attractive to enough people/businesses\u00A0to service at least one or two routes from the start.

Sonic boom is not the biggest problem, going faster than Mach 1.5 presents all kinds of challenges, not the least of which is that super-Mach designs do not take off as easily as a Super-cub. Those designs require super long runways to safely take-off (something that the concorde never had). If you want to carry 200 passengers a 5 km runway is almost a necessity. In addition highly streamlined aircrafte need powerful lightweight engines that have high thrust to weight ratio. The reason is this, when the craft rotates to take off, its a combination of the sin(thrust) \u002B lift that gets the craft off of the runway (plus ground effect for swept-wing). As the craft becomes more streamlined, the sin(thrust) is a more important component of the lift equation. Ground effect may get you off the ground, but it will not keep you off the ground if drag at takeoff = thrust. If your delta has turned up 20 degrees and your wing is near stalling, you need to nose down and still have enough thrust to gain both altitude and speed. Stalls are not due to airspeed but differential angle of attack, and the more streamlined the crafts wings the higher the angle of attack for any given take off speed. Therefore runway length is critical and engine peak performance at MSL are critical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-22T20:25:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I was part of reaction systems, I would certainly want to go this route. \u00A0It might be a long shot, but I\u0027m sure it is a long shot that has a better chance than straight to SSTO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI vaguely remember a claim from rec.arts.sf-lovers (an ancient sci-fi forum to you youngin\u0027s) that suborbital flights to Australia used less power than supersonic flights to Australia. \u00A0Anybody know how to do these calculations? \u00A0And is it feasible to do a \u0022bouncing in and out of the atmosphere\u0022 flight profile with only mach 5?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure that SABRE can use kerosene. \u00A0I\u0027m less sure that such a plane makes sense for flights where the mass of kerosene might not be higher than the the dry mass of the plane. \u00A0LH2 might make more sense. \u00A0Obviously you need LH2 if you want SSTO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile the military does like \u0022prompt global strikes\u0022 and can certainly sell the beltway on that, I\u0027m less sure about the rest of the USA wanting to pay for \u0022another F35 program\u0022. \u00A0It seems much more likely that when (and only when) B-52s start falling out of the sky, Congress will approach Boeing and ask/tell them to make a 777 or 787 that can drop bombs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnybody have a guess at how many seats a SABRE-powered \u0022airplane\u0022 would fly? \u00A0Certainly a lot more than Skylon...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-22T20:35:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222531694\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022137725\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461356742\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022133850\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022wumpus\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 minutes ago, wumpus said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnybody have a guess at how many seats a SABRE-powered \u0022airplane\u0022 would fly? \u00A0Certainly a lot more than Skylon...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n747s used 4 engines with 200-300 kN each, so 800-1200 kN total.\u00A0One SABRE supposedly has 1960 kN at sea level.\u00A0I don\u0027t know how much capacity you lose by having to be hypersonic and vacuum-capable, but a naive ratio based on thrust would give 1633 passengers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-22T20:40:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222531694\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022137725\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461356742\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022133850\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022wumpus\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 minutes ago, wumpus said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I was part of reaction systems, I would certainly want to go this route. \u00A0It might be a long shot, but I\u0027m sure it is a long shot that has a better chance than straight to SSTO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure that SABRE can use kerosene. \u00A0I\u0027m less sure that such a plane makes sense for flights where the mass of kerosene might not be higher than the the dry mass of the plane. \u00A0LH2 might make more sense. \u00A0Obviously you need LH2 if you want SSTO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe SABRE engine cannot use kerosene, by definition, because it is an airbreather that requires you to dump LH\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E through a precooler.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut you wouldn\u0027t actually need LH\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E to get Skylon to orbit.
