For instance, while an iPhone fingerprint sensor can be fooled, you\u0027re more secure with a fingerprint lock that you use than a passcode that you don\u0027t use.

It\u0027s not practical to duplicate \u0022something you are\u0022 and likely won\u0027t be for a very long time; attacks by lifting fingerprints or using a photo rely on sensors that don\u0027t fully verify that it\u0027s an actual human they\u0027re sensing.

The actual way to implement biometrics is to have an entirely closed system containing both identifying data and the actual sensor; the sensor absolutely has to be trusted. This system would then output whatever it needs to (e.g. a password, cryptographic key, token, that sort of thing, or it could do something like sign data only when it gets the right input). The point is, the actual fingerprint data is only handled by the closed system, which makes it work against any attacker not disassembling the sensor.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-16T02:13:59Z\u0022 title=\u002202/16/2015 02:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cpast\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tommygun","CreatedById":41293,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-16T02:40:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wonder if it would be better to give people physical keys like a flashcard with a heavily encrypted pass code, maybe something that automatically changes each time you use it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething with half the code on the key and the other half on a central computer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA person would need to steal both halves to break the encryption.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe person using it only needs to memorize a seven digit alphanumeric code to use the key, so not any longer than a phone number.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen issue out a new one every six to twelve months.

The concept of someone else maliciously duplicating and spreading your fingerprints becomes more and more likely as they are collected, stored and used in more and more places. Even implementations with the best intentions can have some flaw that would facilitate this.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EUsually a fingerprint isn\u0027t enough to proof that someone did something criminal.
