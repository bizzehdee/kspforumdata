Here are my thoughts:\n\nYou could dock a Bigelow Module to Zvezda as a \u0022lobby\u0022 where incoming tourists dock (if Russia takes away their modules, you could attach the Bigelow module somewhere else). There could be a few \u0022exhibits\u0022 in this area as well. Then, people could go on tours of the station and be educated about the shuttle era of space travel since (hopefully) by that point space travel will be a regular thing and people won\u0027t think much of taking a vacation to space. This museum would probably not be fitted as a full-scale space hotel, so maybe tourists could undock from the main station and rendezvous with the ISS for a day of their vacation.\n\nA similar idea could probably be applied to the Apollo landing sites, if a Moon vacation is ever a thing.\n\nI understand that there are probably several things wrong with this idea:P"},{"CreatedByName":"cpast","CreatedById":112846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T01:52:07Z","Content":"For one, the ISS orbit needs correction several times a year.

It may require less, but it will still require maintenance no matter what you do with it - a space station can\u0027t simply be mothballed, so for the ISS to be kept for use, it kind-of needs to be kept in-use, unless some very generous billionaire wants to try keep it around for a bit.\n\nThis is of course, all assuming that you have a usable station after the Russians take their modules.
