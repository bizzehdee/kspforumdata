Ignoring the deeply questionable reasons for making these comments, I thought it would be interesting to do the math on how practical a space mirror would be as a way to barbecue things on Earth\u0027s surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, first off, just some basics: space mirrors are a big flat (or curved) reflective sheet or a swarm of them, but, in space. The difference between a space mirror and a solar sail is that a solar sail is meant to generate thrust using light while a space mirror is meant to redirect light to the desired target. One such target previously proposed was the city of Chengdu, China, as an artificial moonlight. The Germans during WWII also proposed a massive version that could burn cities but thankfully lacked the ability to construct such a thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo first off, Space mirrors are not just hovering in space. They need to orbit the Earth like any other satellite. That means in low orbit they would move at 7 km/s and orbit hundreds of km high.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeing in space also constrains the spot size they can produce. An image of the sun cannot be focused any tighter than the sun\u0027s image on the lens already is. That means at 550 kilometers the best possible spot size by the conservation of \u00E9tendue would be about 5 km. That is, you can only really focus the sunlight down to a spot about 5 kilometers across. Much less a giant laser and more a giant spotlight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, this means that it the mirror looks 5 km across from the ground, it can make a 5 km spot on the ground receive an additional sun worth of light.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis also constrains the degree to which a space mirror or lens can efficiently be used to pipe light around in a giant network. You essentially need a repeater every hundred times the diameter of the mirror/lens or mirror/lens array. What this means is that while you can definitely brute force light to the mirror or lens you want it to be at, you pay for it by needing like 20 times the number to cover a quarter orbit to no advantage in combined power output. So during the day there is essentially no advantage to piping light over long distances other than allowing you to use it at night. There is a limited use case for vertical piping over short distances to give full power at noon straight above the target rather than no power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the goal is to actually ignite things on the ground, let\u0027s look what that takes. Almost no tinder materials in nature ignite from long exposure to less than 50 J/cm^2. That\u0027s 500 kJ/m^2 energy flux. Fast ignition (seconds) can decrease the energy requirements significantly, but we do have time to focus on a target for up to around 2 minutes if we\u0027re directly overhead and smaller but focusing for longer is probably cheaper, albeit having considerably lower sortie rates. However, there\u0027s also a minimum power flux required to actually achieve ignition ever or at all. You probably cannot achieve ignition without at least 10 kW/m^2 and while shredded paper will ignite and flame under those conditions, small areas of grass or other natural tinder will merely char and smoke, not actually flame or spread below 40 kW/m^2. Whether this result applies to large (kilometers wide) areas of natural landscape is anyone\u0027s guess.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if we are going for minimum size needed to cause ignition of something that flames easily like dry shredded paper, we need a mirror with an exposed surface area of, at minimum, 140 km^2. That is not an insignificant amount of material. If it\u0027s a micron thick and twice the density of water, with a small amount of stuff for controlling the mirror, that\u0027s still minimum 300 tonnes. That\u0027s 3 Saturn V launches at least to get it to the necessary altitude. 4 or 5 if you want to be able to reflect the beam at 90 degrees and 6 if you want to use the thing during mid day. 600 tonnes of space mirror. We\u0027re already bigger then the ISS or around the size of a pair of starships. But that wouldn\u0027t really be enough to do anything reliably. If we want something that reliably ignites tinder and maintains high flux even without directly overflying the target, say, being off by a few hundred km, we need it to be about 8 times the size. So at this point we are talking about a pair of space mirror arrays each a thousand square km in size. These things would easily be visible from the ground and completely dwarf the moon or the sun when they fly overhead. Probably 4000 tonnes of mylar a micron thin in low orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not that this simply couldn\u0027t be done (or that there wouldn\u0027t be some better uses for it then setting things on fire like a giant magnifying glass), but I think just about everyone would know that the thing exists. It would be impossible to hide not just from astronomers but to anyone who isn\u0027t blind. Less \u0022secret space laser\u0022 and more \u0022the most obvious satellite system ever constructed.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also don\u0027t know what kind of damage the thing would recieve from micrometeorioid erosion but it definitely wouldn\u0027t be maintainance free in that regard. Probably colliding with something like several hundred grams of micrometeroid debris per day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-02-11T22:24:22Z\u0022 title=\u002202/11/2021 10:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 11, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Vanamonde\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-11T07:05:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suggest to make it easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust polish the Moon to let it shine like a night sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the lunar base is anyway going to refine the metals from regolith, let them make mirror foil and cover the visible side of the Moon with foil.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso this would significantly raise the SLS program significance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis also allows to get funding from commercial advertisements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSay, a giant \u0022Coca-Cola\u0022 across the Moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-02-11T07:07:37Z\u0022 title=\u002202/11/2021 07:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 11, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by kerbiloid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-11T09:59:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223924223\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022200263\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221613024282\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002270014\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pds314\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Pds314 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeing in space also constrains the spot size they can produce.

I\u0027m not sure how you\u0027re getting the light to become coherent there? Apparently so coherent that you feel like diffraction-limited performance is achievable? If you create an image of the sun on a mirror from a wide angle I think you\u0027re gonna run into the conservation of \u00E9tendue here. You\u0027re concentrating this light but also making it less coherent. Whereas you seem to be discussing a system that with no input of energy concentrates the light AND makes it perfectly coherent. In my understanding that\u0027s in violation of the laws of optics and the second law of thermodynamics.

So you need to make light coherent or deal with large spot sizes. Parabolic mirrors don\u0027t concentrate light to a single point but to an image that\u0027s equally coherent * concentrated as it was coming in. Which for a small secondary mirror will be *incredibly* incoherent to the point of total uselessness as a weapon.

So once I tried to diagram this out with 2 flat lenses, I realized that I\u0027d need secondary half-way between Earth and primary for this to work out... And it\u0027d naturally have to be a few kilometers across at that point.\u00A0But you can still make the final image much smaller in angle compared to the primary even if you don\u0027t move the secondary that far out.\u00A0Consider the following simple setup for illustration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022image.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002232.80\u0022 height=\u0022269\u0022 width=\u0022820\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ibb.co/9b8jBNQ/image.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere, there are two lenses with focal plains marked with dotted lines. The original image is on the far left. Final image is on the far right and is half the size despite being same distance from the primary. The reason this works is because we make the intermediate image a lot smaller, and then the secondary can be a bit closer and still give us a net win. If we can make the image of the primary a lot smaller, we can keep bringing in the secondary until we have it close enough and still produce a suitably small image at desired distance. And, of course, etendue is preserved for each pair of images with respect to relevant lens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, the limitation is that we want a large primary, so we can only bring in the focal distance so far. So we can only make the image made by primary so small.\u00A0And that\u0027s why we need extra mirrors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, lets say we keep the 110m focal distance on primary. So we have a 1m image of the Sun 110m from the mirror. Etendue preserved. Now we take a secondary mirror that\u0027s only a couple of meters in diameter and place it about 10m past the image. This one will have a much shorter focal distance, producing an image just 1m away which is now 10cm across. Again, relative to the secondary mirror, etendue is conserved. Tertiary mirror goes another meter past the image. This one only needs to be about 20cm across and will focus the image of the Sun just 10cm away to a size of just 1cm across. Yes, megawatts of power in a 1cm spot. What can possibly go wrong? At this point, we\u0027re already pushing limits of practical optics, so lets be happy with 1cm image and set up the 4th mirror. This one is located 5km away on a separate satellite that keeps station with the first one. It hosts a mirror 50m across, which is, yes, 1% of the distance, because, as you pointed out, optics! But now this mirror can reflect the sunlight from a 1cm image 5km away to a 1m image on Earth that is 500km away. Science!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd all it took is two satellites, one with a 100m primary mirror and a bunch of very carefully configured additional mirrors, and a second satellite with a 50m mirror that\u0027s keeping station with respect to the first one to within millimeters from 5km away, maintaining perfect orientation at all times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think, this might juuuust be possible to build with modern technology and considerable effort.

For example right on the sun\u0027s surface some (up to half IIRC) of your directional control is lost due to cancelling of forces of light at extreme angles. That being said I\u0027m sure it\u0027s better than trying to use a rocket at that distance. I think IIRC the idea of the stellaser was so you could push on light sails much further out with sunsurface-like intensity lasers or even stronger and use sunlight to push lightsails to near-lightspeed for fast and efficient interstellar craft. Though as usual braking would be a significant problem for such a craft, as there isn\u0027t a giant laser around some distant star to slow down with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-02-11T12:44:56Z\u0022 title=\u002202/11/2021 12:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 11, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Pds314\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-11T13:01:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223924366\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022200263\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221613047146\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002270014\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pds314\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 minutes ago, Pds314 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThough as usual braking would be a significant problem for such a craft, as there isn\u0027t a giant laser around some distant star to slow down with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bussard_ramjet\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBussard Ramjet\u003C/a\u003E.
