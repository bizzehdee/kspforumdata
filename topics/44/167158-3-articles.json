I find this rather difficult to believe given that the LIGO 1MW lasers are blasting away at the mirrors in those machines for months or years now and may well function without having to be shut down and repolished or replaced for many years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you guys say? Are space ships with reflective armor to foil lasers impossible or highly probable?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe simple calculation we use to determine a laser\u0027s effectiveness is to divide the laser\u0027s energy by the surface area of the spot at the target, then find out the depth of the cylinder created if all of the laser\u0027s energy is used to vaporize the target material. Lasers do not penetrate opaque materials so we only deal with the top-most millimeter layer at a time.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe calculation is sufficient for most cases, but fails at extremely high or extremely low laser intensities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReflectance comes into play at the lower intensities. If the target reflects 95% of the laser beam, it is absorbing 5% of the laser energy. From that 5%, we must deduct the energy that is dissipated through conduction into the surrounding material. What remains heats up the material.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll materials are only reflective within a specific range of temperatures. Some degrade at rather low temperatures and become charred and black. Reflectivity decreases as the temperature decreases. By the time the material melts, it can be considered a perfect blackbody absorbing all radiations.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith weapons grade lasers, the intensity of the beam at the target is so high that no material can get rid of its heat through conduction and it heats up very quickly even if it is only absorbing 5% of the beam or less. Here is an example:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA 10MW UV beam focused by a 2m wide mirror is focused on a target 1000km away.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe spot radius is 0.061m and the surface area is 0.0117m^2. The beam intensity is 855MW/m^2.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf the target material is aluminium, we can expect 90 to 95% of the laser to be reflected away. The target only absorbs\u00A01MW at an intensity of 85.5MW/m^2.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAluminium has a thermal conductivity of 209W/mK. A\u00A00.0117m^2 area a millimeter thick heated to room temperature can conduct 667.6kW to the surrounding material. It radiates an additional 0.5W. So, the millimeter thick layer gets heated up at a rate of\u00A0332kW.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAluminium has a heat capacity of 0.91kJ/kg.K and a density of 2700kg/m^3. A 0.0117m^2 layer of 1mm thick aluminium masses 31.6 grams. 334kW is enough to raise 31.6 gram of aluminium from a\u00A0temperature of\u00A0273K (freezing) to 993K (melting) in about \u003Cstrong\u003E0.06 seconds\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn practice, this figure is even lower. As the aluminium heats up, it loses reflectance and absorbs more of the laser\u0027s energy. This means it starts melting even faster. Once it is molten, it absorbs nearly\u00A0100% of the laser beam\u0027s energy, so our simple calculation becomes accurate again.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith even more megawatt, reflective surfaces are even less of a worry.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheir only use is to keep armor safe at extreme distances. For example, if the laser beam was being focused from a distance of 10000km, the laser spot covers a 1.17m^2 area instead. The thermal conductivity is now 66.7MW at room temperature. Absorbing only 1MW of the beam\u0027s energy means the aluminium remains safe.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223213401\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022167158\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221510085077\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022137807\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mikegarrison\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, mikegarrison said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere have to be some limits to reflectors.
