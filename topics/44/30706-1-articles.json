According to a red dwarf type table, a red dwarf star with stellar class M4V has 39% radius of the sun, and its mass should be around 36% of the sun\u0027s. Here\u0027s where Kerbol gets wacky--if its mass is indeed 1.756E28, then doing this: (1.756E27/81.989E30)*100 we see that Kerbol\u0027s mass is only 0.88% of our sun, a far cry than the expected 36% mass that we expect from a red dwarf star having about 39% the radius of our sun. I guess squad set it up like this, because if their gravity simulation engine is tied to mass, then giving Kerbol the expected 36% mass of the sun will render interplanetary maneuvers very difficult due to the amount of Delta-V needed, not to mention that the orbits of the planets around Kerbol would be drastically affected--the won\u0027t look as they are in the game, perhaps there would even be no planets (ejections).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-01T19:51:26Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2013 07:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by rodion_herrera\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbface","CreatedById":58573,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T03:15:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, it\u0027s just scaled down.

Assuming that the developers want Kerbin to have Earth-like surface conditions (which I assume is true because they gave it a surface acceleration due to gravity the same as Earth, and it has oceans and polar caps), we can assume that (once they get the clouds installed) it will have a similar albedo (percent of light reflected) and a similar greenhouse warming effect that Earth has. So, in order to have an Earth-like surface temperature with those conditions, it would need to have the same radiative equilibrium temperature that Earth has. Earth\u0027s radiative equilibrium temperature is about -17 degrees Celsius (yes...if not for the 32\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C of greenhouse warming our atmosphere provides, Earth\u0027s oceans would be permanently frozen). The formula for the radiative temperature of a planet (Tp) is given by the formula:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETp = Tsun * (1-Albedo)^(1/4) * SQRT[ Rsun / (2*D) ]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhere Tsun is the temperature of the sun, Albedo is the percentage of light reflected (about 36% for Earth with its clouds), Rsun is the radius of the sun, and D is the distance of the planet from the sun. Rsun and D need to be in the same units. Tsun and Tp are in Kelvin.
