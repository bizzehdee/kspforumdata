You do not need to spend extra money. Road signs need to be maintained and replaced at regular intervals anyway, so you can just naturally flush them out in the course of 5, 15 or even 25 years. People need to adjust, so there is no need to rush. If some signs survive beyond that, you can replace those in an accelerated fashion. Spreading those costs out over said period will still mean a rather low cost operation.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Wonder how long itll be till the world stops using 40ftx8ft shipping containers though\n\nThey don\u0027t.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-21T08:21:31Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2015 08:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha**"},{"CreatedByName":"sam.johnson841","CreatedById":104846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T17:01:57Z","Content":"Wait, you guys aren\u0027t metric?

It\u0027s probably more than that, but imagine the cost of all the conversions that US companies have to go through to do business with the rest of the world?

Other countries have changed currencies, switch driving sides, or switched to metric before... It\u0027s a bit of a big deal, but nothing that can\u0027t be overcome with a few years of preparation and adaptation. Imagine living for twenty years using the French Franc or the Deutschmark and having it replaced overnight by the Euro. Your entire value system is replaced.

It\u0027s just a matter of getting used to the values. For a guy, 1.80 is considered tall wherever you go in the world. 1.70 is average and 1.60 is a bit short for a guy. \n\nSix foot two is meaningless for 99% of the world\u0027s population.

It is a more precise(because of the smaller increments)\n\nThat\u0027s why the metric system has decimals. Weather temperatures are often expressed in steps of 0.5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C. \n\nBut is that precision important?
