Very bad music lol. Sadly terraforming Mars will never be viable. By time we have the technology to do what you see in that video we will have much better options for a new place to live. Mars has little to no magnetic field. There\u0027d nothing we can do about that even WITH that technology. We\u0027d need to build a massive dynomo otherwise any attempt to thicken the atmosphere gets blown away by the sun. \n\nNow I said terraforming won\u0027t be viable. You\u0027ll never be able to stand on the surface without a breather in shorts and a tshirt. But living on Mars in biodomes/under ground I can see. We eventually won\u0027t have a choice. Once our sun starts to heat up and cook the Earth we have to find a new home. So as the goldilocks zone of our system gets pushed back we will follow it. Assuming we haven\u0027t figured out interstellar travel by then. In which case were screwed."},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T17:22:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Very cool video. Very bad music lol.
