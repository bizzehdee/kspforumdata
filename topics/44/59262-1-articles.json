If we have the capability to return to Earth, but the mission is to set up a permanent settlement, I would go (kind of like how the Pilgrims could\u0027ve gotten back on the Mayflower and returned to England.)

No. Technical and ethical reasons, the fact humanity may have died out by the time you wake up, and the fact you would likely be out of contact with Earth would stop me there. And its pretty much the same thing as A.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC. So you are sending a sperm cell and an egg to be fertilized by robots and developed to be dropped onto an alien world with no parental supervision? Lets see what is wrong with that. First, the child would have to be living to consume milk, or what ever substitute you decided to use. Next, the child would need to spend about 24 years being educated (and fed.) During those 24 years, s/he is living in TOTAL isolation from every other human being, being raised by machines that look nothing like him/her. Humans are intelligent enough to tell the difference between themselves and something else. What happens when the child becomes aware of his/her origins and isolation? What happens when s/he becomes aware that with every passing second, s/he is becoming only more isolated from the rest of humanity? I can see this driving an individual to madness (this is a person, not a physiologically conditioned astronaut), possibly resulting in suicide and the failure of a multi-billion (which may be an understatement) dollar space mission? Assuming that s/he gets to his/her intended destination alive, why would s/he obey commands from Earth? At this point, s/he has likely discovered the reason s/he was sent. I would not be surprised if s/he wound up P----ed off at humanity for his/her creation and decided to rebel by not preforming his/her mission and shutting down the comms link. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow send a group of eggs and sperm, and you now get several children that must be raised by machines and may become aware that, other than each other, they are alone. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBreeding a child in a test tube with no family or parental guidance for a scientific pursuit is, IMO, wrong.
