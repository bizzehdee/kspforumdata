Mars Direct\u0027s architecture would send an Earth Return Vehicle ahead, that would produce fuel for the colonists that arrive 2 years later, similarly, the Mars Ascent Vehicle of the Design Reference Mission 5.0 would land ahead of the colonists to start producing fuel, while the lander would also be sent ahead of the colonists, and remain in orbit of Mars until their arrival.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t be surprised at all if Elon Musk\u0027s plans didn\u0027t involve sending robotic precursors first.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-21T02:51:11Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2015 02:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SargeRho\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FishInferno","CreatedById":106219,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T03:13:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SargeRho\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SargeRho\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t be surprised at all if Elon Musk\u0027s plans didn\u0027t involve sending robotic precursors first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElon Musk\u0027s plan sounds lie basically an upscaled Mars One base. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the subject of the TV series: Sure, people don\u0027t want 8 years of the TV show.

They got quite a bit of attention when they got to the final 100 candidates. The fact is, whether or not they succeed, people WANT this to happen. Not necessarily Mars One in particular, but it just so happens that at the moment they are the only people who have announced their plans to the public.
