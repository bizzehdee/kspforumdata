Now scale everything up to the observable limits of technology as viewed from a state-of-the-art perspective today.

Spending chapters upon chapters on minute explanations of technical details might have worked for Herman Melville, but \u003Cem\u003EMoby Dick\u003C/em\u003E was salvaged by its great characters and great prose.
