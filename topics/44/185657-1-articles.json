Due to its unique technology, SpinLaunch is able to offer readily-available, low cost, dedicated launches at high frequencies.

The tensile forces on the launch arm are going to be pretty massive unless the radius is large.\u00A0 That might be the gimmick though - use a material with either a) great tensile strength (CNTs) and/or b) great specific strength (CNTs) and use that to make a really long arm. I think specific strength here is actually more important because the taper on the arm would be less severe, and the longer the arm the lower the total stress at the end of it is. There\u0027s some optimization to be done there but I don\u0027t really want to get into it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither way, I don\u0027t see payloads being rated for more than a few hundred gee - your structural mass is going to increase significantly unless your payload is pretty small (especially because it will have to sustain large forces in two axes - longitudinal during spin and axial during flight), and\u00A0flight computers and\u00A0sensing systems aren\u0027t going to be able to be hardened significantly without increasing mass/volume to be point where one of those becomes\u00A0constrictive.\u00A0 These payloads are basically going to be bricks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat really gets me though, is the picture posted above. If it is anything representative of the final vehicle, I\u0027ll eat my hat.\u00A0Using the door and flight of stairs on the right, I would estimate the vehicle to be between 20 and 30 m\u00A0long. Even with a 1 kps head-start (and drag aside), you\u0027re not going to get much more than a\u00A0hundred kilos to orbit - and probably not even that much. \u00A0Plus, the pointy nosecone significantly constrains the geometry of the payload.\u00A0 This system is going to be pretty niche, and it might struggle to attract customers due to the mass/volume/hardening constraints.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs was mentioned, this would be a great candidate for a scramjet accelerator. I\u0027ve been trying to think of some more sinister military applications where this would be\u00A0tactically niche, but I can\u0027t come up with anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
