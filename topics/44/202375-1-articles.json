You see, I am studying at a private coaching center, and because of the pandemic, they are providing online classes through Microsoft Teams.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe are only allowed to attend the classes that are assigned to our batch. Those classes are scheduled from 6:30 to 8:30 pm. However, I have discovered a workaround that lets me join\u00A0 classes of other batches too! I have not informed the administration of this exploit, and I have not told any of my friends either. \u003Cstrong\u003EWhy\u003C/strong\u003E would I give up an advantage like this?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, there are\u00A0 4\u00A0 two-hour \u0027Time Slots\u0027 in which classes take place.

You see, there are a lot of different subjects that are being taught, some more important and some less so.

Awesome, all technical details don\u0027t matter and now you just need to solve your problems with your magic code fingers.\u00A0\u003Cb\u003EThis application needs to know whats important, but inherently\u00A0doesn\u0027t unless you tell it.\u003C/b\u003E\u00A0The issue with boils down to\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Emachines are dumb,\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Eso if there was a class offered called say \u0022Basic Orbital Mechanics with Elon Musk and Scott Manley, featuring fresh doughnuts\u0022\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eanyone in the right mind would pick that class\u003C/strong\u003E, except your app, which unless it was specifically told to categorize such stuff it wouldn\u0027t alert you, it would tell you about the Finance class at 2:30pm instead. Sure you might manually notice that class and sign up, ignoring the recommendation of your app, but you can kind of see the gap in what this recommendation app could do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere really isn\u0027t an easy way around this\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eunless\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0there is a clear, straight forward categorization system for all possible classes that you can rely on, so your suggestions know what is available and you have already rated all of them. So if classes are always categorized directly as finance, then yes you could \u0022sort\u0022 them based on this priority you set. This is more a sorting problem that any \u0022greatest developer on Earth\u0022 can handle\u00A0multiple ways.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this was a large scale problem, you could use advance stuff like machine learning to build an algorithm to create suggestions for you based on existing trends, but since this is just for\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eyou\u003C/strong\u003E, you can\u0027t take that route and need to more or less tell your app what to care about and rate manually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now lets remove the idea your the greatest developer on Earth and focus on the technical challenges.\u00A0Assuming you figured out the edge cases for your app, you should understand how the app would function for a list of classes without considering how to do this with code.\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EThis is where you have multiple options depending on how the application your currently using\u00A0works.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EI\u0027m not familiar with how MS Teams works, or how what your using to handle signups, but lets assume everything is just in a spreadsheet. As such a structure is very common, and a lot of people are familiar with it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour app would have to go thru this sheet, get all the \u0022rows\u0022 that represents all the classes available, determine which are the most important, and then filter out conflicting times. Again this isn\u0027t too difficult by itself,\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ebut\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0getting it to such clean structure is where I assume the difficulty would be. If you have to click on multiple pages to get the data that may or may not be categorized clearly, the technical challenges become more and more, and thus it will take more and more time and effort to build it. Its the \u0022get me the data to make a decision\u0022 part that is hard, possibly\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ereally really\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0hard, and then you still need to have your app understand the data well enough to make the right decisions, which also is hard and not perfect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe technical challenges to get the data to filter\u002Bsort though is the most questionable, and possibly the most work, and this assumes your fine with all the gaps such a solution would produce. Which is why I don\u0027t think its really worth trying to build anything to solve this problem.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have no idea how to code, learning to code, learning this problem, solving this problem, and then building a solution would suck up vastly more time, and be vastly more prone to errors than just manually doing it. Yea its boring, and you could always automate some parts of the process (macros?), or there might be easier ways to lessen that \u0022get me the data\u0022 part and you could automate this whole thing, but I kinda doubt it from how you describe the setup. If all the class schedules were in a nice clean list format, things get much easier, but if not its definitely not worth it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow if you have no idea how to code and\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ewant to learn\u003C/strong\u003E, while also trying to save yourself time, it would take some time and a good amount of work even for \u0022the greatest developer in the world\u0022 but would be a very interesting project to get started. Just worth keeping in mind this sort of problem is not easy to automate, very few cases are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
