One thing you defiantly want is a hull that can resist radiation and micrometeorite impacts or at least some kind of big magnetic shield system to keep out radiation and things of the like. Your armament pretty much comes down to projectiles, light beams, and missiles. A lot of laser weaponry could probually be countered with some sort of cloud gel chaff stuff or something to help defuse light. You might even want to coat your ship in some sort of aerogel like stuff if it would help at all (and not burn off). Missiles can probably be countered with other missiles and laser weaponry (Though missiles that turn into a cloud of debris before they are intercepted could be a pain for such systems). Railgun/projectile slugs MIGHT be able to be countered with a magnetic shielding system (Vaguely recall hearing something about the US navy looking into something like this to protect battleships). Apart from that you could have algae tanks as an addition to any temporary food stores (bring a heck of a lot of spices). Propulsion would likely be either an electric thruster, an Orion drive system, or maybe even be a fusion engine.
