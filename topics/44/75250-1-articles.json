Maybe that\u0027s outdated though. Theoretically it looks like entanglement can\u0027t get around relativity. And while you can\u0027t prove a negative, I would really hope this experiment gets done at some point to be sure. I wasn\u0027t able to find any example of trying to use entanglement as an FTL signal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skyler4856","CreatedById":76452,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-17T20:44:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Soda Popinski\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Soda Popinski\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy hope is there is an interstellar \u0022Federation\u0022 that won\u0027t talk to us until we get our act together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps there are better ways to communicate, other than light, that the Federation uses\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://xkcd.com/638/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://xkcd.com/638/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheSaint","CreatedById":70033,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-17T20:58:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Skyler4856\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Skyler4856\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://xkcd.com/638/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://xkcd.com/638/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was exactly what came to my mind as well.

That doesn\u0027t tell you anything about the other particle, except that it\u0027s in the opposite state from the one you\u0027re observing.
