Is it is a determent to the rocket overall? Is the aerodynamic shape all that\u0027s needed for stability?

There is a bit of a controversy about why the Saturn V had fins AND gimballed engines. Some are of the opinion that Van Braun wanted them because they looked cool, but they quite probably allowed to take some stress out of the thrust vector system or to provide some level of redundancy. They also probably allowed to maintain stabilization during staging when the engines were throttled down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn KSP you\u0027re right, on a properly designed rocket with gimballed engines, fins shouldn\u0027t be needed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T16:28:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMost rockets in KSP don\u0027t need any stability fins. There are two exceptions. Sometimes, you don\u0027t have enough vectored thrust to provide good control in mid-ascent. I\u0027ve had this happen, and adding fins improved performance. This might be a case with some real rockets as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond is purely a KSP problem. The way thrust vectoring works is that it assumes engine is placed behind center of mass. If for some reason center of mass ends up bellow center of thrust, your ship\u0027s controls will be reversed. Except ASAS doesn\u0027t know that, so if you keep it on, it will throw the rocket into a spin. If this is the case, you can disable gimballs on engines and try to make it on fins and RCS alone. This shouldn\u0027t happen to a real rocket, unless programmers screwed up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
