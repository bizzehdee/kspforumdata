My main question here is this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow will it be fueled? The lander uses liquid methane and liquid oxygen as its propellants, but as far as I\u0027m aware, there is no way to load those from the Falcon 9\u0027s transporter-erector through the fairing. I find it hard to believe that it would be fueled in the assembly building. I don\u0027t even know if they have liquid methane and liquid oxygen at 39A. Does anyone know how they will fuel the lander?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-17T18:05:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI assume they load before closing the fairing.\u00A0 Lander has to travel to the moon, enter orbit and land so it will spend days in space, couple of hour on pad will not add much more boil off.
