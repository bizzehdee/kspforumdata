You have to get pretty far away from Earth (out to around GEO or further) for it to produce more than a few hundred miles per hour of spacewarp. Thus, it can not be used as a WMD, because it slows down near things like cities.\n\nIt also is safe, in that it does not produce huge amounts of radiation when getting out of warp.\n\nBasically, it follows similar rules to the USI Warp Drive mod for KSP.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-30T17:18:15Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2015 05:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun**"},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T23:40:48Z","Content":"Aliens will cower in fear as we spread freedom and democracy, probably?\n\nOr the Shivans pay us a visit."},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T23:41:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The world realizes that this new space warp effect is real.

If it is pretty much open knowledge, expect an arms race to build warp capable ships. Military upgrades will probably quickly happen, since ships that can be hidden outside of your enemy\u0027s range of travel cannot be hurt.

Same thing as with the invention of the steam engine or the jet engine. The nations of the Free World will gain new knowledge by leaps and bounds. The Voyager space probes will get left behind as ships explore far outside the solar system. Probably some smart aleck is gonna fly up to Deep Space 1 and graffiti it.\n\nWill we encounter hostile aliens? (Don\u0027t give me that look, SargeRho already brought the subject up!) Probably not. We\u0027ll almost certainly encounter life on other planets--almost entirely microbes, plants and animals. The universe is 13 billion years old; human evolution took us from that point to our current level of technology in only a few thousand years. So whether we encounter alien civilizations depends entirely on how often that kind of evolution happens--a question we cannot answer until we go out into space and take a look. \n\nThe economic benefit will probably be pretty indirect; it all depends what valuable substances are discovered where. A deposit of platinum on a planet like Venus wouldn\u0027t be such a great find, because it would be impossible to reach, buried under 90 atmospheres of pressure laced with sulphuric acid. So most of the benefits would be in terms of new knowledge.\n\nThe military balance of power wouldn\u0027t change, even if everybody gained access to the technology at once. Because nations such as the U.S. have the wide array of other technologies needed to support this new one. So you have a warp engine. Fantastic. Do you have the economy to build a starship around it? Computers and instruments to pilot the thing? Weapons to defend it from suicide bombers? Nations such as the U.S. have all these other things. Most other nations on Earth don\u0027t. Even if North Korea had a nuclear weapon (they don\u0027t), they haven\u0027t got the technology to put it on a missile, or guide that missile accurately to Washington DC. By the time North Korea does have those technologies, the U.S. will have a fully-operational SDI network (assuming the U.S. doesn\u0027t have it already....) and North Korea\u0027s hard work will be for naught.

It\u0027s actually happening. What do you think would happen next?\n\nOkay, first of all, your title is misleading. I hate to be pedantic, but if someone had an idea for a warp drive (\u0022invented\u0022 a warp drive) tomorrow, nothing would probably happen for four or five years as tests were done. There would be some initial hype from the press, but that would be quashed as people correctly stated that unless repeated attempts worked, it wouldn\u0027t be worth even a tiny bit of attention.\n\n[speculation]\n\nAfter a working warp drive was created beyond a shadow of a doubt, the military would probably seize control of all plans and methodology behind the warp drive. They would state that this could be used against the United States, pointing to the law of E=mc^2^ turning mass into energy and thus releasing an almost unimaginably large explosion if the thing was abused. Debates about using the warp drive for war would become a household subject. North Korea would claim to have created their own warp drive, but nobody would believe them.\n\nAfter years of petitioning, scientists would finally be given permission to attach a small payload to a warp drive and send it out into space. The payload would merely warp a few light-days away from Earth to test the feasibility of such a project. While the warp initially appears to have occurred successfully, no radio contact is established. It turns out that warp drives generate such intense amounts of electromagnetic radiation in all frequencies while passing the light barrier, it cannot realistically be used.\n\nGovernment funding towards warp drives is finally cancelled due to the tensions it causes (\u0022if you can\u0027t use warp drives for scientific purposes, why are you still pouring money into the program?\u0022) and the exorbitant cost. The warp drive, however, has captured the public\u0027s imagination. Forty years later, a man claims to have the original warp drive\u0027s blueprints. An amateur team of scientists attempts to follow them and ends up killing six people and wounding another three when they get something just a *little* wrong. The days of the warp drive are over.\n\n[/speculation]\n\nYes, I overthink things. I also think, however, that this thread is more about speculation on humanity\u0027s actions than it is on spacecraft. Perhaps this thread would work better in the Space Lounge?\n\n-Upsilon"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T03:07:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The military balance of power wouldn\u0027t change, even if everybody gained access to the technology at once.\n\nThing is, that would never happen exactly parallel.

If anything changes the world\u0027s power structure, it will NOT be anything having to do with space travel. As John Crichton put it: humans don\u0027t even go to the Moon any more.

In the end, rather than putting weapons on spacecraft, it will be far cheaper and more practical to put those weapons on unmanned drones. For the price of one Pillar of Autumn, you could have ten thousand drones or a couple dozen extremely stealthy submarines, both of which have repeatedly proven their ability to blow stuff up with a minimum of fuss.
