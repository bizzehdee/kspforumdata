All of which have different tactics and technologies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately it all boils down to the tradeoff of main traits Speed/Armor/Weapons. Chose one major and one minor, ex. Missile is Fast with ok Damage but Battleships are Armor with some Weapons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Orbit, a war would require mainly battleships because of the Kessler syndrome that would result from many battles. A battleship would have heavy armor (to ignore the debris) and ok guns but no speed, and it would probably also house fighters/drones/missiles. Any small craft without a dock would eventually be worn down and destroyed by all the debris in orbit after the initial battle or 2. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA fixed point of interest like an L-Point or asteroid would likely have defense stations or battleships on the defending side but not on the attacker side. Because this would be like a siege the attackers would focus on high attack ships with decent maneuverability. The attacker would stay at long range and bombard the defenders that can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t abandon their base/resources. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn deep space it could really be any variety of craft but would likely lean towards the speed and firepower spectrum. Using hit and run tactics against heavy slow targets would be a good way to wear down the enemy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe equipment used by the ships would be mostly determined by what the other faction is using and what is available. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeat: in space heat must be radiated away, if not, then you melt. Radiators that get rid of lots of heat are large, unarmored, vital parts of your ship. If you have to little radiators then you can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t do much without melting, but if you have a lot of radiators then you have lots of weak spots. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWeapons/Armor: Very heavy, thick armor would be very expensive for us to launch into space and increase fuel costs of flight and therefore impractical. Lasers are great for space because of the speed of light, but could be blocked by good armor, create tons of heat, and take tons of power, as well as being massive. With these points Lasers are sniping weapons for use at huge distances or for use as point defense. Mass drivers/rail guns fire high velocity shells that can do tons of damage, but even at high speeds they must be very well aimed and will take a long time to hit their target, giving a good chance to dodge. Missiles are much slower and easily shot down but can redirect midflight to follow targets, missiles would likely explode into shrapnel well before the target is reached or carry a nuke. Armor and countermeasures can be designed for all the weapon types proposed, a very fine mist over a large area could refract lasers to negate or reduce their attack, missiles can be intercepted, and debris can be blocked with spaced armor (like the ISS uses). Rail guns would require very good armor to block but very little to dodge (in 100 km scale battles, even at 5km/s it gives 20 seconds to move).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFighters/Drones: with the cost of keeping someone alive in space I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t expect that manned fighters will be used ever. Point defense drones are most likely with the possibility of interceptors or bombers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGround Attack: Nuking is the most effective, Lasers loose power to the atmosphere, missiles are large and expensive for their damage, bombs specifically designed for this would work ok, and rail guns are good for precise targets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually invading from orbit is laughable given the troop/material/supplies needed to be delivered to the surface you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d be better to just bomb them into the stone-age and then set yourselves up as their gods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would expect that most battles would either be over very quickly (minutes) or end in a draw.
