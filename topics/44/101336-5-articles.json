I said it was a Saturn orbiter that made multiple passes (as in, flyby passes) of Titan. But I\u0027ll concede this point in the interest of avoiding a debate about semantics.\n\nBut it\u0027s not dedicated to Titan.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The Titan lander would have been a lake-lander. Not quite a submarine, but closer. And there was talk of [turning it into a boat.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_Mare_Explorer)\n\nThere is a plan in the works for a full fledged submarine.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This doesn\u0027t actually mean anything. NASA employees don\u0027t decide what gets funded and what doesn\u0027t. Congress does. And Congress is not gong to authorize the use of SLS to launch a Europa mission, because SLS is so freaking expensive, and because Congress hates unmanned probes.\n\nIt means quite a lot. Especially since their information (especially this) was said as fact already, meaning it is already planned and perhaps funded.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E True. But perhaps we should focus on getting more out of the mass we have, instead of spending billions of dollars to build a pointlessly powerful rocket to launch more massive things.\n\nHaving more mass means you can go to more places, assuming your mass ratio is better...\n\nAnd going to more places means getting more science.\n\nNot to mention that sometimes you just need to go big.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Tell me, what would you do with six Cassini\u0027s worth of probe available? Sure, it could carry more science instruments, but it would probably be easier to work on making those instruments smaller and more powerful, instead of trying to build a rocket big enough to launch them all together. (I will concede that there are some experiments and pieces of equipment that can\u0027t be miniaturized, and that having more payload available for them would be nice. But is it nice enough to justify a very expensive, brand new launch vehicle?)\n\nYou could have more reliable equipment. Many copies. It cold then last for many times longer than the prescribed time. (It kind of has, but hey).\n\nYou could use it as a communications relay, and release smaller probes throughout the Saturn system.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This is my entire point.\n\nDidn\u0027t sound like it..."},{"CreatedByName":"cpast","CreatedById":112846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T02:42:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Really the production equipment needs to be on hand...\n\u003E Not necessarily the rockets.\n\nAnd by now, the equipment would have rusted, the building would be coming apart, and anything neither rusted nor falling apart would probably have been stolen and sold for scrap.

It depends on the final probe. Which is why having a heavy-lift launcher is useful.\n\nI guess. But really, a heavy-lift launcher could be useful for lots of things, if it was cheap enough. The problem is that the cost of SLS makes it prohibitive for really launching anything.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I assume it\u0027s an early stage program, or basically only enough money to plan it.\n\nThen we\u0027ll have to wait until it\u0027s more fully developed until we can really make anything other than guesses about it.

Unless they launch on the same vehicle, hence a larger heavy-lift vehicle.\n\nLaunching them on the same vehicle would undermine the redundancy of having two probes. What happens if your launcher fails?\n\nAlso, going off of the costs of EELV launches (around 400 million) and expected SLS launch costs (planned to be 500 million, but will probably end up being over to 1 billion), it would actually be cheaper to launch two EELVs instead of one SLS. And if you go with a Falcon 9 instead (60 million for civilian launches, 100 million for government), you could send ten small probes. You might not be able to send them all at once, but you could still send them.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So, data from a bunch of places at once or something?\n\nBasically, yeah. I mean, the MER rovers, landed on opposite sides of the planet. If we sent ten little probes to Titan, they could land all over. In lakes, on mountains, near the poles, at the equator. Sounds a lot better than sending one big probe to explore a tiny part of the moon."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T03:46:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E True, but probes don\u0027t care how long it takes to get somewhere.

This would be especially true for Mars and the more technology you require the greater the cost of said technology and the greater the risk that this technology will fail. \n\nIt\u0027s not that we need to move people who live in inhospitable climates, it\u0027s that majority live where it is the most comfortable, there are plenty of places on earth where you genuinely do need technology to keep you alive, e.g. the ocean and Antarctica, but though people work there, there is no great rush to live there."}]}
