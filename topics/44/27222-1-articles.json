They start with the unit called \u0022A\u0022, then \u0022B\u0022. then after it the third number they call it A-B because they only have two fingers to represent such values. they divided A-B the basic unit with the sub-units A, B and A-B (0.334,0.667, 1)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe second unit can be then called C, then D, then C-D. then E, F. E-F.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is very, very different, very alien indeed. Humans may feel comfortable with numbers ending in 0 values like 1000, 2000, 43000, always counting near that value, but you\u0027d be surprised they are comfortable with A-B, C-D, E-F, G-H. which is 3,6,9,12 in our representations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever this doesn\u0027t change the fact that math is universal. You kick them 16 times. they represent it as \u0022G-HC\u0022 which is 12 \u002B 4, \u0022That human kicked me G-HC times!\u0022 we say its sixteen they say its G-HC, regardless it has the same value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey contact to you through beeps. one for each of their basic unit in increasing form. they used A-B, then C-D E-F, then G-H I-J K-L. for them, it represented 3, then 3,6 then 3,6,9. but since one unit for them is 3 already. they only beep once every unit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we interpret the beep as 1 beep, then 2 beeps, then 3 beeps. ofcourse we recognize the pattern. so we send 4,5,6 beeps. if we send 4,2,8,3 beeps, then there\u0027s no pattern at all, so it is wrong and it is not considered \u0022math\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey will then receive it as 12,15,18. There is a difference in number, but regardless we can show that we understand them, by understanding the pattern. and therefore it is proven that math is universal.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-21T04:29:50Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2013 04:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by lyndonguitar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stochasty","CreatedById":57264,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T05:24:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MatixCubix\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MatixCubix\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, the problem with comunication with other species is that we group things and we relate them with the world or whatever.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lyndonguitar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lyndonguitar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThey will then receive it as 12,15,18.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe two of you are on the right track here, but you don\u0027t take things nearly far enough. Math is universal, but a specific representation of math depends both on choice of axiom and choice of notation. A large part of the reason that math developed as it did for humans is because most of the resources we use and things we interact with come in discrete packages: 1 apple, 17 blood thirsty wolves, etc. Even for things that don\u0027t come in discrete packages, we try our best to discretize them when thinking about them: 5 miles, 2 and a half hours, etc. (Even fractions are just a way of discretizing quantities that don\u0027t consist of whole numbers.) This is why our system of math is based on counting - it\u0027s how we interact with the world, so it makes sense to us and is useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine an alien species with an entirely different way of perceiving and interacting with the world. Perhaps they live in a fluid environment (a water world, say, or maybe as plasma-based entities inside a star) and the resources they use come not as discrete packages but as densities (say, density of dissolved minerals, etc.) Their primary sense then might be something akin to scent, rather than vision, and they\u0027d view the world in terms of gradients rather than discrete quantities. What use to them would counting be? Rather, they might base their maths on a basic set of ordered relations (greater than, less than) instead of number, addition, and subtraction. Calculus (integrals, derivatives) might come as naturally to them as Algebra does to us. Topology and differential geometry (using density isosurfaces to define open sets and generate geometric structure) might come more naturally than Euclidean geometry. Sure, eventually, when their math became sophisticated enough, they\u0027d work their way back around to Algebra, but there\u0027s no reason to expect them to see it as fundamental.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven this, suppose such a creature were to become sufficiently technologically sophisticated to communicate with us. How would we go about recognizing their maths? We try to base a dictionary on their symbols for 1, 2, etc. only to find out that, when they bother to count at all (not often), they do it in base e! And that\u0027s just one possible example, based upon a series of speculations I find potentially plausible. If I can imagine it, then I\u0027m sure nature can come up with something even weirder that I am incapable of imagining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMath might be universal, but that\u0027s no reason to assume that we can use it to establish come ground for communication. Sure, sophonts which evolved in similar conditions to us probably think a lot like we do, but that\u0027s a rather limiting assumption, don\u0027t you think?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-21T06:08:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2013 06:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Stochasty\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheCardinal","CreatedById":22874,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T06:06:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA mathematic teacher told me once ( a long time ago) that in some cases 2 \u002B 1 isn\u0027t the same as 1 \u002B 2.
