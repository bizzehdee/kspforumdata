Cities and other human constructions are taking up habitats, migratory paths, and mating areas that were once used freely by animals in the wild, and forcing global animal behavioral patterns to change. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way that the victors are being decided, SciShow explained, is how well they can adapt to human environments. Animals like crows, pigeons, raccoons, and other normal city-dwellers can survive off of the detritus left in cities as our waste, as well as roadkill, which was a source of food for scavengers that didn\u0027t exist before we came along.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the gyst of it, anyway.
