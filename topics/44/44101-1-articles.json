In order to sustain fusion in a star you have to have enough pressure to keep the reaction together. Nuclear fusion requires your fuel to be at a very high temperature and pressure in order to overcome the natural electromagnetic repulsion of the atomic nuclei. Nuclear weapons do this by placing the fusion fuel close to a fission bomb, which provides the necessary heat and pressure to instigate the fusion reaction. But a fusion reaction releases immense amounts of energy. The effect of that energy release is to tear the nuclear fuel apart, rendering it unable to continue with a fusion reaction. That is why a very small percentage of the fuel in a nuclear weapon is actually fused, and the rest is released unused. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the heart of a star, this tendency to disperse the fuel is overcome by the force of gravity. Even with the huge energy release, the fuel is kept in a temperature/pressure configuration that supports ongoing fusion, so the reaction is self sustaining. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in your Jupiter scenario, your bomb drops to the core of Jupiter and detonates. It fuses its own fuel, it might get some boost by fusing some of the local hydrogen and/or helium, but there is not enough gravity to keep the fuel together, so the energy of the explosion is going to disperse the fuel from the locality of the explosion and the reaction will cease. There will be no sustained fusion reaction.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leax256","CreatedById":57364,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-27T23:41:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheSaint\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TheSaint\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo in your Jupiter scenario, your bomb drops to the core of Jupiter and detonates.
