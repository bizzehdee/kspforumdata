In a case where it is highly dangerous or impossible to get satellites to orbit, it seems probable that something will be done, if not for space exploration for military endeavors.

HIGH ISP Ion drives in pairs with chain-link fencing, Roll out the fencing and start knocking stuff into decaying orbits. The Cannae drive if it works has a job, go and deorbit stuff. All it has to do is put something in an orbit that will decay in a couple of years. Once it does this it corrects its own orbit and starts looking for the next object.\n\n2. Take a look at my Space Port, if objects were sent to this at EOL, then you could have a bot pick them up and put the objects inside. At some point they could be recycled into space hotels.\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/0NNRaJe.png](http://i.imgur.com/0NNRaJe.png)\n\n3. You could collect all the debris into packages put a shield on them and bring them back to earth and create a used satellite museum and research institute.
