That should convert to $1.74 USD.\n\nI myself have used a few for building small trinkets every now and then, but along the road, I decided to build a makeshift Arc furnace that could melt gold. Since I had some, I decided to use carbon rods from 2 large batteries as electrodes. It worked well, and now my supply is gone. I sold the resulting gold ingots for only 60 Tynes per Kilogram, but after the fact, I decided to look up how they typically sell. Yeah...\n\nApparently, I could have sold them for 1165870 Tynes per Kilogram on average, but that makes no sense to me, even now. Gold is not strong, therefore not useful for building. It is not common, but rare, so there is no use in even trying to find enough of it to build anything.\n\nEven if you aren\u0027t looking to build something, it is still next to useless. It is difficult to atomically react with, for example.\n\n So, why is it valued so high?\n\nFor that matter, why is anything valued high? Or at all, ultimately? Why invest so much money into something that you can\u0027t do anything with? It is dense, static, soft, and just uninteresting. I value even plastic higher than gold. At least it will keep my sandwich from the harmful atmosphere.\n\nHow is value defined? Why are abundant, versatile, light, and durable objects valued so low? I have a supply of the perfect example of this: Biosteel.\n\nUnbelievably strong, lightweight, flexible, and thermal tolerant. It is the perfect material for my organic electrodynamic fluid compound [a fancy way of saying my home power generator].\n\nBut the question is; why was it practically dirt cheap? Why are other metals, heavier, softer, less malleable, and more static valued more than ones that are useful?\n\nNow I ask you: How do you define value? What do you see in things that make them worth something to you?"},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T22:13:35Z","Content":"Value is based on how rare something is compared to the demand for it. We like shiny things, but gold isn\u0027t exactly the most common element, and it doesn\u0027t tarnish, that\u0027s why it\u0027s expensive. There are ways to \u0022abuse\u0022 that however. A prime example are Diamonds. Diamonds are not at all rare, their rarity is artificially created.\n\nValue is also based on how hard something is to create. Titanium is so common that we used it as white pigment to paint walls with in the form of Titanium Dioxide. But it\u0027s very hard to machine, requiring special tools. It\u0027s also very hard to actually produce in its elemental form, which makes it expensive as well.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-07T22:15:45Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2015 10:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SargeRho**"},{"CreatedByName":"vger","CreatedById":67603,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T22:16:21Z","Content":"Don\u0027t knock the value of gold too much.
