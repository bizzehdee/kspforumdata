(Anyone remember the old Cadbury Caramilk commercial? anyways...) Sure, you could, but once you reach iron and heavier elements, fusion releases less energy than it took to start fusion, so you could never break even on the reaction. This is how stars go supernova, once they start burning iron they collapse until they rebound (that\u0027s the nutshell version).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sillychris","CreatedById":103939,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-11T02:48:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAbsolutely.
