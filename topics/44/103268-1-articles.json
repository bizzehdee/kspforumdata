To understand the area better we have designed a survey to collect data from the players of a few chosen games.\n\nKerbal Space Program has been chosen because of it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s educational qualities, and we are asking you as a player of Kerbal Space Program to please take a few minutes to answer a few questions about your experience. It will take less than 5 minutes to complete. Your help would be greatly appreciated, and may aid in further research in the area of technology enhanced learning.\n\nlink to questionnaire: [http://goo.gl/forms/RG45g4voxr](https://goo.gl/forms/RG45g4voxr)\n\nthank you!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-02T21:47:05Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2015 09:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KasperVld**\n  \nfixed typos"},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T21:54:52Z","Content":"KSP did not turn me into the nerd that I am, but it surely directed my interests towards rocketry a lot more.\n\nI have achieved a lot because of this game and that is one of the many awesome things about it ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Linear","CreatedById":26619,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T22:02:14Z","Content":"I have taught and have family that teach and our general consensus is that it really isn\u0027t worth the time or effort. At least in the UK - all of the science/mathematics exams (L3\u002B) are exam based, and you\u0027re going to get little help out of playing a game like KSP. Sure, it might make it easier to see some of the orbital mechanics at work, but circles on the board are almost always enough.\n\nI\u0027m not against using games in education, I\u0027m just sure doing past papers and actual teaching is better use of your time.\n\nNote: This does not include modifications of games designed for education (like KSP) i\u0027m sure this is a lot, lot better however you stipulated a commercial game :-)"},{"CreatedByName":"Superluminaut","CreatedById":58963,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T04:15:56Z","Content":"Keep in mind KSP is in development.

I can say that Ive learned a lot about astrophysics (and aeronautics) due to playing KSP and the forums here and such. But the game itself isnt really \u0022educational\u0022. I know people who play this all the time and cant put 2 and 2 together and understand why stuff we do in space is done that way. At the same time though, a lot of others who Ive shown the game to who got into it.\n\nKSP is more like a gateway. You can read about say, how we put satellites up in space, or how an orbital rendezvous is accomplished. But it probably never clicks in a persons mind. Give them your laptop with KSP on it for a week though, and let them try and do it themselves. Suddenly it starts making more sense.\n\nIts a way to give a person a hands on way to learn as opposed to just reading or listening.\n\nI know that when I was subbing a couple years ago for a physics teacher and was doing the little bit at the end of the year about space orbits and such. Was literally 2 days before those classes that I found KSP. (Already had a prewritten plan from the normal teacher so I didnt even really understand a lot of the stuff.) \n\nWanna make a good presentation for some kids that getting to orbit takes more going sideways than vertical?\n\nI remember when I was in school we watched an expensive produced documentary about that stuff. When I was teaching, I made that documentary in realtime for the class, and let them try to get that damn rocket into orbit.\n\n(Also used it for showing orbital transfers, free return orbits to the mun like Apollo used, GSO, the coriolis effect. And various others.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Chowderpat","CreatedById":140156,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T23:52:35Z","Content":"KSP made me want to be an astronaut one day.
