Cycler ships, slowboating infrastructure, solar electric propulsion and all the rest, may be the best way to get a lot of people to Mars. I just don\u0027t think it\u0027s the no-brainer option that you\u0027re advocating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I\u0027m understanding the links on your other thread correctly, the Cycler ship mission profile would use a large, relatively heavy ship with adequate radiation shielding, possibly spin-based artificial gravity to support the colonists on the relatively long journey to Mars. Transport to and from the Cycler at either end of the journey is handled by lighter ships that don\u0027t need all the heavy life support gear that the Cycler does. Those lighter ships still have to match velocity with the Cycler at one end and lose that velocity at the other, so they\u0027re not exactly trivial to design, build and operate. Then you get into the whole debate of how best to get your crew off the Cycler and down to Mars. Reusable shuttle? Possibly but the logistics of operating and maintaining one out at Mars aren\u0027t simple. Limited use shuttle? Possibly but then you need to send a steady supply of them to Mars which to some extent offsets the advantages of your reusable Cycler. Disposable shuttle(s) (aka the MDV and MAV arrangement from \u003Cem\u003EThe Martian\u003C/em\u003E)? Even more ships required, further offsetting the advantage of your reusable Cycler.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, looking at the Wikipedia link you sent, there are non-trivial\u00A0tradeoffs in picking a good Cycler. You need to juggle crew journey time, vs frequency of journey, vs non-useful journey time (as in the original Aldrin cycler) where your ship is travelling way out beyond Mars orbit and back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCompare all this to the ITS concept which takes a single ship to Mars surface and back relying on orbital refuelling in LEO and refueling at Mars. Not a remotely trivial thing to design build and operate either but it\u0027s a potential workhorse ship for getting everything to Mars on a more flexible timescale than the Cycler ship and/or slowboating colony infrastructure. Sure its maybe a bit over the top for getting infrastructure there but again - you\u0027re only using a single ship, rather than a flotilla of different vessels.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK, possibly two vessels - ITS does need tanker support to LEO. But at a pinch that can be achieved using existing SpaceX technology and infrastructure.\u00A0They already have the infrastructure to get propellant to orbit (on-orbit refuelling yet to be proven) reasonably efficiently\u00A0with Falcon 9 and (hopefully) in more useful quantities at a time with Falcon Heavy.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s all trade-offs and - until somebody starts trying to fly serious hardware to Mars - mostly speculative trade-offs at this point. All we can say is that either option is going to be expensive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ModZero","CreatedById":89470,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-22T13:11:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223177676\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022165481\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221506055143\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002291005\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, Northstar1989 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNibb, there is a massive opportunity cost to NOT going to Mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry, but what?
