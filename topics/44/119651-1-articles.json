Volcanic soils fall into two broad catagoties, tufa ash which is relatively fertile but turbulation with the lower organic layers is required or if its thick it will concretize (laetoli foot prints as an example - but acid/base composition is a factor). The other hawaiian type of volcanism results from silica plastic ejecta and pyroclastic flows mainly silica plastics. For these typese of eruptions with sufficient rainfall grass seeds and annuals ca grow, which can cause the accumulation of deeper organics and with the crumpling of pumice you can get the second generation of opportunistic trees and scrubs. Farming such soils requires specialized plants an low/till or no till agriculture and classic gravity driven irrigation wont work. Following Second genertation you have formal trees and humus builders substantive deep bioturbulation, and in alluvian runoff areas you have completely arible land. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think
