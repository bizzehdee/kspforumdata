Most of the light output will be in infrared with almost none at the higher ends - depends on how you see it, it can be an advantage or a problem, as UV and X-ray are limited (less cell damage) but so are visual light (take photosynthesis - high frequency lights are needed to break water), probably life there could thrive on these lower wavelengths light. Also, planets will be hugging the star, which means tidal locking, and something worser - these tiny stars can produce flares _magnitudes_ above Sun\u0027s flares. Which means the life there, while used to low-energy light, suddenly will receive higher-end light and additional particle radiation.
