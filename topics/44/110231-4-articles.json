I *highly* doubt they\u0027ve got the actual flight plan mapped out yet. Also, according to the article, the probe will be solar powered - not nuke powered, so why not smack it into Europa at the end of its mission such as Messenger did with Mercury.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T06:09:50Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 06:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LordFerret**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nikolai","CreatedById":23085,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T14:40:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E why not smack it into Europa at the end of its mission such as Messenger did with Mercury.\n\nBecause if some of the speculations we have are correct and there is (a) a mechanism to transport surface minerals to the oceans below the ice, and (![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) life or proto-life in the oceans, then there is a chance (albeit a very slender one) that we could contaminate Europa with organisms strengthened by over three and a half billion years\u0027 worth of natural selection."},{"CreatedByName":"cryogen","CreatedById":134454,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T17:11:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Also the performance would be marginal for this application, it would likely require a third stage of some sort.\n\nI did a bit of googling; I think you\u0027re right.\n\nHere\u0027re the current figures for the Europa Clipper (although they\u0027re very likely to change). The total (wet) mass at launch is **3,582 kg** (first link). The launch C\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003E\u0027s, for the slow, gravity-assist Atlas V option, and the fast, direct SLS option, are 15 km^2^/s^2^ and 82 km^2^/s^2^resp.

Not sure). Either way it\u0027s probably a non-starter; even the payload to C\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003E=0 (i.e. earth escape) is much less than the Clipper\u0027s mass.\n\n![cZgr2gj.png](https://i.imgur.com/cZgr2gj.png)\n\n[http://www.spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/001/f9guide.pdf](http://www.spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/001/f9guide.pdf)\n\nWhat about Falcon Heavy? Well, it seems the specs haven\u0027t been published yet, so I did some extrapolating from some information that\u0027s already public. I used the marketing specs for the Falcon Heavy -- 21.2 tons to GTO, 13.2 tons to Mars Transfer. And I used specs from the Falcon 9 v1.1 upper stage, which I understand will be used unmodified (?) on the Falcon Heavy. (If there\u0027s a secret new stage under development, then this analysis is bunk). I used the vacuum I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E and wet/dry masses for this upper stage. \n\n[http://www.spacex.com/falcon-heavy](http://www.spacex.com/falcon-heavy)\n\n[http://www.spaceflight101.com/falcon-9-v11.html](http://www.spaceflight101.com/falcon-9-v11.html)\n\nHere\u0027s my extrapolation. Since the booster stages cut off well before GTO velocity, I\u0027m assuming a fit of the rocket equation, to the GTO and Mars payloads, will roughly extrapolate the payload to higher C\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003E\u0027s. There\u0027s *tons* of implicit assumptions here, too many to even discuss. This is a messy *guesstimate* at best.\n\nI did a nonlinear fit in Mathematica, using these values:\n\n[TABLE=width: 500]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E[/TD]\n\n[TD]340 s[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]F9-H stage mass, dry[/TD]\n\n[TD]3,900 kg[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]F9-H propellant mass[/TD]\n\n[TD]92,670 kg[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]delta-v from LEO to GTO[/TD]\n\n[TD]2.5 km/s[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]C\u003Csub\u003E3 \u003C/sub\u003Eto Mars transfer[/TD]\n\n[TD]10 km^2^/s^2^[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]F9-H payload to GTO[/TD]\n\n[TD]21,200 kg[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]F9-H payload to Mars transfer[/TD]\n\n[TD]13,200 kg[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Effective perigee altitude for Oberth (guess)[/TD]\n\n[TD]100 km?[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]\n\n![6o2mtaY.png](https://i.imgur.com/6o2mtaY.png)\n\nMy estimate for F9-H\u0027s payload, for the SLS-direct trajectory, is **2,664 kg**. This isn\u0027t very accurate at all, but it\u0027s *much* less than the Clipper mass (3,582 kg), so I think the conclusion is robust: F9-H can\u0027t do the direct Jupiter trajectory, with its current upper stage.\n\nThe VEEGA trajectory is easily an option. F9-H\u0027s payload would be slightly less than the Mars transfer -- **11,549 kg** for C\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003E=15 km^2^/s^2^.\n\n**update: On the other hand**, a single Star-63F upper stage -- one of the larger solid rockets of the Payload Assist Module -- placed on top of the F9-H, could comfortably launch the Clipper on a Jupiter-direct trajectory. Take the Clipper mass (3,582 kg), add 10% margin (3,940 kg). Add on a 4,590 kg Star-63 F (total 8,530 kg). From my extrapolation, the F9-H could lift this much mass to C\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003E = 30.2 km^2^/s^2^. (This is a more comfortable estimate: it\u0027s very close to the Mars transfer that we have a datapoint for). Then the Star-63F can give us another 2,019 km/s boost, to a final C\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003E of 84 km^2^/s^2^. \n\nI think that would be credible!\n\nStar-63F specs:\n\n[TABLE=width: 500]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Isp[/TD]\n\n[TD]297 s[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]empty mass[/TD]\n\n[TD]326 kg[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]gross mass[/TD]\n\n[TD]4,590 kg[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]\n\n[http://www.astronautix.com/engines/star63f.htm](http://www.astronautix.com/engines/star63f.htm)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload_Assist_Module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload_Assist_Module)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T17:47:17Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 05:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cryogen**"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T18:14:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Because if some of the speculations we have are correct and there is (a) a mechanism to transport surface minerals to the oceans below the ice, and (![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) life or proto-life in the oceans, then there is a chance (albeit a very slender one) that we could contaminate Europa with organisms strengthened by over three and a half billion years\u0027 worth of natural selection.\n\nIn that light, we\u0027ve contaminated every body in this solar system we\u0027ve visited/dropped a probe on thusfar.
