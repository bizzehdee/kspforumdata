If you think about it highest human earth relative velocity was achieved in1976, basically, new horizons is going a tad faster, we\u00A0have made almost no gains in increasing spacecraft in 40 years.

We have many new discoveries, some I posted\u00A0here in the last year, some of these, actually most, are hype, some are breakthrough. To get\u00A0between that future-fog and future technologies you have to pay engineers to sit down and work out the details, blend new technologies together, and\u00A0test hypothesis on the really small scale in a lab.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo give an example they plan to fire GWs\u00A0of power at a meter square of foil, my experience tells me that no metal can perflectly reflect.
