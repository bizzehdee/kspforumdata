The lower albedo (reflectivity, basically) of a solar panel means more solar radiation is absorbed rather than reflected. When absorbed, it\u0026#39;s converted to heat. When a solid object absorbs heat (and gets hot) another factor gets introduced into the equation. Convection. And it\u0026#39;s already common knowledge that that\u0026#39;s a lot of heat. Next time there\u0026#39;s a sunny day in whatever locale you happen to live in? Go outside around noontime and put your hand on the WHITE sidewalk. Not the asphalt, you already know how hot that gets on a sunny day. Notice that even the WHITE sidewalk gets pretty hot when exposed to sunlight (see what I\u0026#39;m doing here? showing you how you can verify something yourself, without looking up a single web page anywhere?)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe heat transmitting from the sidewalk into your hand is convection. When you\u0026#39;re hand isn\u0026#39;t there, the heat is going into the atmosphere. And it\u0026#39;s significant.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt doesn\u0026#39;t really matter where the heat is transferred to in the short term, the only real question is how much is captured. The ground and any structures on it will quickly come to thermodynamic equilibrium with their surroundings. Every watt absorbed that isn\u0026#39;t used to pump electrons, (either in electricity generation or in sugar production), will increase surface temperatures.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n(BTW: If you had bothered to look things up, you would have found that a white sidewalk has an albedo of about 0.5, the grey ones 0.3\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYour choosing to ignore the waste heat produced by other electricity generation methods is noted, (JSYK: Thermal systems top out at about 33% efficient with it being physically impossible to do better.)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[quote name=\u0027WedgeAntilles\u0027]And it\u0026#39;s also the reason why comparing solar panels to CO2 is bogus--the two are not comparable, because CO2 does something solar panels don\u0026#39;t (well, there\u0026#39;s other reasons in addition, actually). It\u0026#39;s common knowledge that the Earth\u0026#39;s atmosphere reflects about 30% of the Sun\u0026#39;s radiation energy back into space before it ever hits the ground. How? Greenhouse gases. CO2 doesn\u0026#39;t only keep heat in. It keeps it out.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWould that that were so: CO2\u0026#39;s big absorption peak in in the far-IR, the sun\u0026#39;s emission peak is in the mid-visible. Only a tiny portion of the energy reaching the Earth is at the right wavelength for CO2 to interfere with it reaching the surface. Meanwhile, the Earth had its emission peak nearly bang on that CO2 absorption peak.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[quote name=\u0027WedgeAntilles\u0027]Bogus. How do I know this? Equally simple: because in the last two centuries or so, Earth\u0026#39;s concentration of CO2 has gone up a lot (approximately doubled) but the planet\u0026#39;s temperature has barely changed. The ultimate verification of a theory is [B]testing.[/B] (GLaDOS says hi!) The testing has been done. CO2 has failed.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe amount of energy trapped by increased CO2 levels can be, and has been, directly measured.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[quote name=\u0027WedgeAntilles\u0027]Not done yet. Got more. It\u0026#39;s been estimated that, if there was no CO2 in the Earth\u0026#39;s atmosphere at all, it would be around 30 degrees colder than it is. Which leads to this: if CO2 levels have doubled since, say, the start of the Industrial Revolution, then before the start of the Industrial Revolution, the Earth should have been 15 degrees colder. It was not. (there was the Little Ice Age, but that didn\u0026#39;t even come close.) And yes, I\u0026#39;ve read the standard response by alarmists: that the planet takes a long time to respond to changes in CO2 levels. That response makes the theory impossible to test. If it\u0026#39;s untestable, it\u0026#39;s bogus.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nLeaving aside your confused dancing around the point of how concentration relates to absorption, (yes it\u0026#39;s nonlinear, that\u0026#39;s why climate sensitivity is often described based on \u0022per doubling of CO2\u0022), we can start with your failing in basic math. Just so you know, 400/280 is about 1.4, not 2.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0026#39;s a good thing we\u0026#39;re only at 1.4 times pre-industrial levels of CO2. If we were at double, we would have about three degrees of warming locked in and that\u0026#39;s about where we would get a oceanic CO2 release feedback loop and another event like the PETM.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is an important thing for people who think \u0022so what if it\u0026#39;s a little bit warmer?\u0022 Global temperatures have narrow stable bands and can rapidly jump between those bands if those narrow limits are exceeded. For warming, the upper limit of stability is controlled by the concentration of CO2 in the oceans, they are currently nearly saturated and increasing temperatures reduces solubility.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother important thing is how small of an increase we need before we see very nasty things. For instance, what do you think will happen if China\u0026#39;s food production drops by 25%[0]? Or if Pakistan\u0026#39;s water supply dries up[1]?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[0] Warming the world by 2-3 degrees only improves potential agriculture output in one major region: Siberia, an area that China has long claimed to be rightfully its.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[1] Almost all of Pakistan\u0026#39;s water comes from India, the treaty between India and Pakistan regarding that water places the impact of reductions in flow entirely on Pakistan.\n"}]}
