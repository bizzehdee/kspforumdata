Happily, the public entity owning the landfill apparently opened access at one point and actual non-figurative videogame archeologists worked the midden site..

At first glance I thought the task would be impossible, but I did a quick web search and apparently there\u0027s a system called PTOLEMY in prototype phase. Rather than relying on a high energy neutrino to whack into a water molecule and make a detectable burst of light (recoil) this experiment seeks to use low energy background neutrinos as a \u0027reactant\u0027 in a nuclear reaction.

It\u0027s also possible to have the pieces of consciousness function as parts rather than the ensemble. This can happen in extreme stress (out of body experiences), deep meditation or certain extreme sicknesses.

While there\u0027s certainly mechanisms for us to communicate outside our planet, like SETI, I don\u0027t think any of them are active enough to construe us being an element of a greater consciousness. As a fun example, one of the few famous possibly-extraterrestrial signals discovered was the WOW! signal, which didn\u0027t change human activity much.

Another aspect to consider is, when the human brain is still growing and new neurons are being born and added into the network, the new neurons will spontaneously flicker (\u0022I am here!\u0022). If they connect correctly to their neighbors and eventually get signals back they\u0027ll stay alive and become part of the brain.

It is, almost exactly, how you put it. I like to imagine it as mother nature having 1000 things going on at all times and we need to pin 999 in place to see the one danged thing we\u0027re interested in \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E .

The inherent fuzziness and spooky action at a distance of QM just don\u0027t jibe with the \u0027c is absolute\u0027 premise of relativity, but neither alone is able to describe the universe at all length scales! So I guess our disagreement is really a matter of scale and premise.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027ve already laid out the QM fuzziness stuff, so I\u0027ll add the relativity side to the table. Also, I\u0027m no theoretician, so grain of salt time. Despite all the fuzziness, the speed of light\u0027s traversal through vacuum is constant, and as a result it\u0027s every other thing in the universe that\u0027s fuzzy! Putting it in another way, the speed of light considered to be more fundamental than the the ability of light to travel between two points in a certain time; c is constant even as delta X / delta T is fuzzy.\u00A0 A lot of this boils down to exactly how relativity was derived. \u0027c (describing the speed of light in vacuum) being absolute\u0027 is one of its two starting assumptions, so everything relativity is able to do and predict is built on that as a keystone (along with one other). Now I\u0027ll be the first to admit that this may not be how the universe sees it! Though it\u0027s fundamental to our understanding, it may not be fundamental to nature. But when rationalizing the countless idiosyncrasies of the real world, it\u0027s often considered to be one of the few solid foundations to cling to at above-micron length scales.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSide thoughts on fuzziness, because I couldn\u0027t resist:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgreed that there\u0027s lots of sources of fuzziness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt sub-atomic length scales there\u0027s lots of fuzziness in how we define the absolute position of two points, or for that matter two times! There\u0027s also lots of elements of fuzziness in the activities photons at atomic length scales, due to their abilities to interact with all sorts of things such as evanescent waves, typical matter / metamaterials, or multiphoton interactions. I\u0027ve heard that if you\u0027ve created strong enough uniform EM fields it will alter the traversal of light (though I haven\u0027t done the math myself). There\u0027s the ability of \u0027set\u0027 points in space to move, thanks to the expansion of the universe, and also the ability of straight lines to curve thanks to gravitational fields. And I\u0027m aware of the instantaneous transfer of information through light in superposition such as in the bell experiment, thin film diffraction or the Elitzur-Vaidman bomb-tester, which can certainly cause unexpected \u0027fuzziness\u0027 in a signal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a side note, all of these things tend to happen on extreme length scales. For human length scales, we actually make devices that utilize the speed of light to pinpoint nuclear reactions / recoil-events based on the time of flight of the resulting photons!

Specifically, QC can search for solutions in parallel. This doesn\u0027t help with a simple direct problem. If I want to multiply two numbers, classical or quantum computer\u00A0will do it in the same number of operations. But if you have many sets of numbers that you need to multiply together, QC can do these at the same time. Likewise, if you want to know factors of a number, which requires many attempts to divide that number by potential factors, QC can try many divisor at the same time, speeding up the process.
