Getting started would be a huge effort, and a lot of machines and essential components would need to be sent to whichever body one is talking about. One might be able to build some simple machines on the moon\u00A0by sending the electronics and other precision components, along with a small robot to assemble them\u00A0and a small oven to construct larger components by fusing regolith. The fused regolith wouldn\u0027t be very strong, but in that low gravity strength is much less of an issue than on Earth so it might be sufficient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuilding a rocket... Nope. Not without many, many billions of dollars and many, many decades, even centuries of effort. We would have to start by sending a huge amount of startup infrastructure, and it would take a lot of trial and error to build new machines from scratch using the materials available. It is quite likely that a rocket manufactury on the moon would never be completely self-sufficient, and would depend on some refined materials being sent from Earth: the infrastructure needed for producing the dopes used in semiconductor manufacture (for instance) is\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ehuge!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsidering the very unlikely hypothesis that we could do it, then there would be advantages. There is no ecology on the moon to destroy, so we could mine and plunder what we needed without any concerns for the morality of wiping out species or fears for poisoning ourselves. Without a rain cycle, waste would stay where it was dumped. Solar power would be available in huge amounts, just by laying out large arrays of solar panels. And the products of a moon-based infrastructure would be in an ideal gravitational situation to be sent to much of the rest of the solar system, helping to start infrastructures elsewhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Steel","CreatedById":49317,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-17T13:56:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223150539\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022164512\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221502975148\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022165635\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NSEP\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n53 minutes ago, NSEP said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy question here is, is it possible to build a spacecraft, habitat, or another gizmo from scratch without getting any extra resources shipped to base from Earth.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnless you\u0027re planning on recreating the entire history of human tool use in a vastly accelerated time period (i.e starting off with stone tools and gradually working your way up to precision CNC machines and silicon foundries for electronics)\u00A0then no.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll the technology we have now is entirely reliant on the technology that preceded it, and this goes all the way back to the beginning.
