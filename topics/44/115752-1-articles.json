It has many forms. The Post-apocalyptic return-to-steam, the Victorian England or Aristocratic American story, even the Wild Western. It can be fantasy, a love story, or even hard science fiction. The latter is what we\u0027re going to talk about (or write about if you want to be technical.)\n\nWe here at the Kerbal Space Program forum certainly love our space travel and our hard science fiction. So how do you get steampunk rockets that can loft things into the Earth Orbit and beyond? This post aims to describe some of the possibilities to make rocketry and space travel in your steampunk world. If you have anything you would like to bring up to change or add, please do mention it.\n\n**Where to Start?**\n\nFirst, for general info on rockets in sci-fi, read [Atomic Rockets](http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/). There\u0027s some cool sections on the [decks of a ship](http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/deckplans.php), how an [astronavigator](http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/astrodeck.php) crewmember would do their job.\n\nA good source of inspiration are rockets and spaceships drawn up in the time period between 1910s and 1950. They tend to be surprisingly low-tech (when they\u0027re not using nuclear power plants.), and use things like mercury boilers instead of solar panels. Lots of spheres and structural beams, usually with circular holes in them to save mass.\n\n*\u003Cu\u003EInspiration\u003C/u\u003E*\n\nSpoiler\n\n![MODEL-OF-1903-KONSTANTIN-TSIOLKOVSKY-SPA](http://www.2luxury2.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MODEL-OF-1903-KONSTANTIN-TSIOLKOVSKY-SPACE-ROCKET-436x501.jpg?73f4fa)\n\n![16086090.jpg?d41d](http://images.24ur.com/media/images/original/Dec2005/16086090.jpg?d41d)\n\n![steampunked_space_station_by_steelrat1.j](http://img13.deviantart.net/07e6/i/2010/153/3/8/steampunked_space_station_by_steelrat1.jpg)\n\n![First_Martian_3_f2.jpg](http://www.victorianspaceage.com/First_Martian_3_f2.jpg)\n\n![bonestell_von_braun_colliers_1950s_moonl](http://img15.deviantart.net/170b/i/2014/185/d/a/bonestell_von_braun_colliers_1950s_moonlander_by_paul_lloyd-d7p60y9.jpg)\n\n![colliers_lander.jpg](http://www.centauri-dreams.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/colliers_lander.jpg)\n\n![89C0F0CA-36A5-4FC1-8BEF4262CC59A2BE.jpg](http://www.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/89C0F0CA-36A5-4FC1-8BEF4262CC59A2BE.jpg)\n\n![qOuLoQa.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/qOuLoQa.jpg)\n\n![M9FXLmZ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/M9FXLmZ.jpg)\n\n*\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFuel Types\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/u\u003E*\n\nSpoiler\n\n**Gunpowder Rockets**\n\nObviously, the Victorians didn\u0027t have access to the liquid-fueled engines. Gunpowder rockets were used in fireworks, sure. So that is where we will start. You could just aimlessly start filling big barrels with gunpowder, igniting it, and seeing how high it goes, but surely there must be a better way.\n\nIn the late 1930s, the British Interplanetary Society was designing a rocket that would be able to travel to the Moon and back. Now, it wasn\u0027t made to be completely steampunk, but it was designed with gunpowder rockets and steam-fed \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E (fed from a hydrogen peroxide tank, not a boiler).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The British Interplanetary Society web page said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E In 1938, the BIS Technical Committee decided to go the full distance and produce a conceptual design of a vessel that would carry a crew of three safely to the Moon, permit them to land for a stay of fourteen days, and provide for a safe return to the Earth with a final payload of half a tonne. The object of the exercise was to demonstrate that, within the capabilities of propellants that could be specified (at least theoretically) at the time, such a mission was not merely possible but would be economically viable in so far as the vehicle lift-off mass from the Earth would be no more than one thousand tonnes. The conceptual design that resulted came to be known as the BIS Lunar Spaceship, and for all its flaws and misconceptions it must be regarded as one of the classical pioneering studies in the history of astronautics.\n\u003E \n\nIt wouldn\u0027t take too much to redesign this to be your steampunk moon-boat. (Of course the launch vehicle would probably have to be as big or bigger than the super-Saturn-V \u0022Nova\u0022 rocket designs.)\n\n![bis1939moonship2.jpg](https://thewesternlines.files.wordpress.com/2007/07/bis1939moonship2.jpg)\n\n![BIS_Landing_2.jpg](http://www.centauri-dreams.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/BIS_Landing_2.jpg)\n\n![MoonshipDiagram_300.png](http://www.bis-space.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/MoonshipDiagram_300.png)\n\n![zbislo2.jpg](http://www.astronautix.com/graphics/z/zbislo2.jpg)\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/tXU67_cE3ss?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nGunpowder Rockets have an Isp of 100-200 seconds at best, so you\u0027re gonna need a big rocket to get to orbit.\n\n**Other Solid Fuel Rockets**\n\nDespite KSP having SRBs as the lowest technologies in the tech tree, advanced solid rocket fuels were not developed until the cold war required storable propellants, which hypergolic fuels did not tend to do so well (they would eat the tanks over time.) That said, I would imagine that working with solid fuels would be easier than trying to find more ways of liquefying gases. Perhaps the chemists would be able to create more efficient fuels.\n\nAdvanced SRBs have Isps from 190s-270s.\n\n**\u0022Coal Oil\u0022 and Liquefied Oxygen.**\n\nOxygen was first liquified in small amounts in 1877 and in much larger amounts in 1883. Hydrogen wasn\u0027t liquefied until 1898, near the very end of the \u0022steampunk\u0022 era. Coal Oil is another name for Kerosene, because it came from processing coal. Mix Coal Oil and Liquid Oxygen, give it a light, and BAM!\n\nThis seems to me to be the only viable bipropellant rocket fuel (aside from using other oxidizers) for the Victorian time period. Isps of 280s-310s or so.\n\n**\u0022Blast Coal\u0022 or other *Fictional* or *Magic* Propellants.**\n\nRecently I came up with an idea to get around the abysmal Isp of steampunk rockets. I call it Blast Coal. [Read the full post at /r/worldbuilding](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/4wg81y/a_new_borderlinemagical_elementmineral_in_a/).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Quote\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So recently I was thinking about how much I really want steampunk space warships and how impractical conventional rockets are. And so I said. \u0022Screw it, I\u0027m gonna make my *own* propellant~~, with blackjack, and hookers!~~.\u0022 The original idea being that it can produce energies between rocket fuel combustion and direct nuclear power. A Candle-Drive, in sci-fi terms. More specifically, what I needed was a propellant that would produce high thrust with low propellant flow. That turns out to also be a very efficient engine as well, which is nice, because Victorian rocket parts are much heavier. The idea has evolved since then.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The mineral known as Blast Coal was first discovered in 1807 by American geologist and chemist Kurt Murray Laurenz. Only around three kilograms of the material were found, but the properties of the material were well documented while the supply lasted. Granted, it only lasted a couple seconds after the first round of experiments, and the laboratory went with it, but at least one of Dr. Laurenz\u0027s assistants escaped to tell the tale. The combustion of the Blast Coal seems to have totally vaporized it.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Sample Rocket Engines: \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **RV-4s Solid Propellant Rocket Motor**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Fuel: Solid Blast Coal Charge (shaped for variations in thrust throughout the burn time)\n\u003E - Oxidizer: Built-in to the Charge\n\u003E - Height: 45 meters\n\u003E - Diameter: 4 meters\n\u003E - Fuel Feed Method: Solid\n\u003E - Thrust: 12,500 kilonewtons\n\u003E - Specific Impulse: 397 seconds\n\u003E - Burn Time: ~5 minutes\n\u003E - Dry Mass: 129,183 kilograms\n\u003E - Description: A dense, cheap, always-on solid propellant rocket engine.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **LBCO-01 Type 4 Liquid Blast Coal Oil and Oxidizer Rocket Engine**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Fuel: Type 4 Liquified Blast Oil\n\u003E - Oxidizer: Liquid Oxygen\n\u003E - Fuel Feed Method: Propellant Pumps\n\u003E - Height: 5.6 meters\n\u003E - Diameter: 3.75 meters\n\u003E - Thrust: 8022 kilonewtons\n\u003E - Specific Impulse: 462 seconds\n\u003E - Mass: 10,353 kilograms\n\u003E - Description: A powerful beast of a rocket engine, using liquified Blast Oil and Liquid Oxygen for propellant. It\u0027s so powerful it might blast itself apart if used continuously. One of the major advantages to this engine is that it can be turned off.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Blast Coal rules and info:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - If Blast Coal is reddish, it is a rare and highly dangerous self-combusting kind. Otherwise it will be a more brown color. Red Blast Coal can be manufactured from Brown (normal) Blast Coal.\n\u003E - Blast Coal requires an oxidizer to burn. (Red Blast Coal already has an oxidizer)\n\u003E - Blast Coal can not effectively be used to generate power, it burns too hot and too violently to do anything other than just explode. There\u0027s nothing in physics that says it\u0027s impossible, it\u0027s just much easier to work with different sources.\n\u003E - Blast Coal can be liquified in refineries into various types of Blast Oil.\n\u003E - Type 1 Blast Oil is the least refined, highest viscosity, and least powerful form of Blast Oil.\n\u003E - Type 5 Blast Oil is the most refined Blast Oil for conventional usage.\n\u003E - Type 6 Blast Oil is the most refined Blast Oil that has ever been refined as of 1910.\n\u003E - In standard atmosphere, Type 5 Blast Oil has a melting point of -10 C and a boiling point of 120 C\n\u003E - Blast Coal and Blast Oil are toxic. Drinking Blast Oil will definitely kill you, breathing in Blast Oil fumes, significant amounts of Blast Coal dust, etc will make you sick and you will need medical treatment. Skin contact is safe, however, as long as you wash it off. Some Blast Coal can give you mild chemical burns with skin contact, but you won\u0027t get poisoned from it.\n\u003E - Blast Coal is very rare on Earth (this is because it would likely burn off or react as\n\u003E - Blast Coal is moderately rare on the Moon.\n\u003E - Blast Coal is relatively common on Phobos and Deimos (along with water ice and dirt and the stuff that they likely are common with irl), but rare on the surface of Mars.\n\u003E - Frozen Blast Oil can be found on Metis, Amalthea, and Io.\n\u003E - Blast Oil is not actually that much like regular Oil can also not be used in internal combustion engines. It\u0027s too reactive and would quickly break any engine.\n\u003E - Blast Coal is meant to be like a sort of an analogue of Uranium, Plutonium, and other radioactive elements. Just, without the radioactivity.\n\u003E - Blast Coal\u0027s active ingredient is the (fictional) element Igntium. It has an atomic number of Tau, because I don\u0027t feel like re-writing the periodic table. It has an atomic mass of 13. If anyone wants to provide some insight into the chemistry of Ignitium or Blast Coal, do share.\n\u003E - With atomic number Tau, that means it has a non-integer, irrational number of Protons. That\u0027s fine, it\u0027s just an exotic and completely bullwaste fictional atom with quarks or something making it up. But since people in the 19th and early 20th century don\u0027t know about quarks, I don\u0027t actually have to care.\n\u003E - Shorthand/slang for Blast Coal or Oil is just \u0022Blast.\u0022 (as in, \u0022Pump in some Blast so we can get this rocket moving!\u0022) This is to separate it from normal coal and oil.\n\u003E \n\n**The Problem of the Turbopump**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Accelerando said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E However, a caveat for kerolox bipropellant engines: they may be restricted to relatively low power, if you want to go full 1800s tech. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E \u003E 1 engines for large liquid-fueled spacecraft and the [turbopumps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbopump#History) that make them possible did not start appearing until the mid-20th century, to my knowledge.\n\u003E \n\nThe problem comes from the material science and metallurgy available at the time. These technologies could not possibly handle the immense speeds at which turbopump machinery rotates.\n\nIt is worth noting that the absolutely gigantic *Sea Dragon* rocket would have been *pressure-fed.* We need not abandon the liquid fuel rockets just because of the turbopump.\n\n**Steam, heated from stored water in a boiler**\n\nNo. Yes it\u0027s very tempting, but in practice, it is very hard to make a convincing steam rocket work, especially when doing the classic firebox-heated boiler. If you *really really really* want a **steam**punk rocket, then use Solar heating for your steam.\n\n**Steam, fed from a Hydrogen Peroxide tank**\n\nYes. You can use the peroxide as an electricity fuel cell, as a water and air source, and as a propellant. I think it is best used for Reaction Control Systems, but it may be useful in a low-gravity lander of some kind. Its low Isp would make it fairly terrible for interplanetary or cislunar space, though Peroxide can be used as an oxidizer.\n\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFaster Than Light?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Csub\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E(really?)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/sub\u003E\n\n[Faster Than Light](http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/fasterlight.php) is okay in some cases in somewhat hard sci-fi, because, to paraphrase Atomic Rockets, \u0022everyone\u0027s doing it\u0022. If you use FTL, your science won\u0027t be as hard, but as long as everything else you do makes up for it in realism, you can use an FTL drive.\n\nIt would be seriously hard to imagine, however, that steampunks would be able to produce the energies needed to go FTL on their own. They might piggyback on more advanced species, or use ancient stargates or naturally occurring wormholes.\n\nOr maybe your planet\u0027s religion can take care of it. In a fictional story, you may feel comfortable introducing a magical element into it, but I would imagine that would seriously start to contradict the hardness of the science. However, if the faith/magic and the science/technology are split neatly enough, so that your rocketships are all realistic and your magic is a background force that only wizards and priestonauts can use, then it may be excusable. For instance, my Kerbal-universe Vernians that worship the Luna 3 Probe.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Interstellar Travel Handbook of the Kerbal Cosmos said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Their interstellar drive is a sort of a religious prayer that can only be done in a massive crew tank that might be described as a church or temple inside the spaceship. If the Philosopher Vernian of level 5 is inside and enough other Vernians are observing him, the chance of a prayer succeeding nears 90%. The ship then is able to increase its outside-perceived acceleration by a very big number (inside they feel the low acceleration that the ships engines normally would) so that it is able to accelerate faster than light. This isn\u0027t a problem as the Kerbal universe has no speed limit. [Of course in the real world the speed limit is a very real thing.]\n\u003E \n\nI would imagine your best bet for FTL is some form of magic. There\u0027s plenty of steampunk fiction that uses magic alongside technology. Why not use magic at the limits of what technology can do?\n\nJust as any good FTL in normal sci-fi (and indeed any good magic in normal fantasy) you will have to make sure that your FTL is defined to the reader through what it can do, not how it works. Make some rules about how your FTL works, stick to those rules, and that should be good enough.\n\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:22px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELaunching to Orbit\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\nSteampunk rockets would have to be built out of heavy materials. The old joke about Russian rockets being built like trains is especially true here. There was simply not enough electricity available to create much aluminium. To minimize launch costs and keep in the steampunk style, dirigibles or balloons might be used to reduce delta-v to orbit. I believe this is the only way to launch anything heavy into orbit.\n\n***\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:22px;\u0022\u003EColony Construction\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/u\u003E***\n\nIf your other planets have a breathable atmosphere (or if your colonies have enough pressurized volume to hold massive greenhouses), perhaps the best building material is **Bamboo**. It grows fast, it grows strong, and it grows too much. It can be used for structural support for your metal habitat walls, as rails for steam trains to run on. (in real life there were designs for logging locomotives that ran not on rails, but on logs.) They could even be used as structural support for various machines and devices. Bamboo may not be aesthetically very steampunk, but it is practical. Certainly much more practical than towing along all the building supplies with you, as more than ever in a steampunk universe, \u0022every gram counts.\u0022\n\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003EOn the subject of trains and railways\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\nSteam locomotives and railways could be very valuable on a steampunk colony, just as they would be anywhere else when you don\u0027t have mobile cranes and road vehicles. Railways would necessarily be narrow gauge, so that the engines can be light enough for individual transportation. Steam engines would probably be transported to a colony in pieces, and then assembled on site, with a majority of structural parts coming from bamboo. That way only the most difficult parts to produce in-situ would be sent across the vacuum of space from planet to planet. No need to waste precious payload mass on running plates, cabins, and fuel bunkers. Rails would be, as discussed earlier, bamboo tracks. Switch tracks would probably be somewhat difficult to produce, however, but no doubt possible. Locomotives could be used for mechanical power and towing, using a system of pulleys to lift things. They could be used to carry supplies and materials around a base. If the planet has multiple colonies relatively nearby, trains could pull passengers and supplies between the colonies.\n\n*\u003Cu\u003E...And Horses\u003C/u\u003E*\n\nIf your destination planet has a breathable atmosphere(or maybe if you have proper space suit technology), horses could be a valuable tool. Compared to trains, they repair and maintain themselves and they replace themselves in the form of baby horses (as many multicellular organisms tend to do) and are decently powerful. They don\u0027t need rails ([not they they would hurt](http://todayinsci.com/T/Train_George/TramcarAmerican500px.jpg)). Problem is that their fuel efficiency compared to trains (which can be solar-boiler heated or hydrocarbon\u002Boxygen heated) is abysmal, and they eat up your colonists\u0027 life support. An important thing to consider if the air and water isn\u0027t free.\n\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOther People\u0027s Thoughts\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\nSpoiler\n\nOther People\u0027s Thoughts\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Scotius said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Since it was too early for radio, steampunk space travellers would have to use mirrors/heliographs for communication with Earth, other ships or stations via Morse code.\n\u003E \n\nI had a funny idea about using a long-range power cable that you would shoot at the other ship to talk to them in Morse, sort of like the classic cups-and-string telephone.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Accelerando said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve been thinking about this for a while, as I\u0027m currently building a world wherein rocketry and interplanetary/translunar space settlement was achieved without electricity. Critically, I think, the setting I chose is an extraterrestrial society on a super-Mars sized exomoon, so (I assume) this greatly eases the issues of engineering a viable rocket using non-electrical technology, because for the characteristics I chose, achieving low orbit with any given mass of payload should only require about 1/4 the propellant that it would take to lift the same payload from Earth (which also eases delta-V saving acceleration requirements, and thus the forces the rocket has to be built to withstand).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E However, a caveat for kerolox bipropellant engines: they may be restricted to relatively low power, if you want to go full 1800s tech. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E \u003E 1 engines for large liquid-fueled spacecraft and the [turbopumps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbopump#History) that make them possible did not start appearing until the mid-20th century, to my knowledge.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E In general, depending on how far back you want to go, or especially if you want to (like me) remove electrical technology from your setting, you\u0027ll have to consider changes across the board in spacecraft design. In general, anything using electricity is likely going to need to be designed pretty differently from modern spacecraft, at least masswise - photovoltaics will be replaced by solar boilers, of course, and there\u0027s more. Before I start, I\u0027d like to reiterate Gregox\u0027s request for input, **and further ask anyone with technical knowledge in any of these sectors to please contribute** - steam/diesel/non-electric space tech is an interesting concept, but concrete information on the matter is understandably scarce.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **Communications**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E As Scotius mentioned, your spacecraft may need to use heliographs, or some bright light source, to communicate with each other and with Ground Control. Electric lightbulbs could be used on the nightside; an alternative, if you want to shy from electricity (like me) may be to use some sort of bioluminescent flora in a transparent container, with a door to flash the light \u0022on\u0022 and \u0022off\u0022. Given that [amateur telescopes seem to be able to resolve meter-scale details on the ISS](http://www.skymania.com/wp/2011/03/amateur-snaps-astronaut-on-spacewalk.html/3655/), I assume that you may not need very powerful telescopes to keep track of communications, either, as long as you have sufficiently large mirrors. Foil aluminum may be a viable material for lightweight, foldable mirrors; or perhaps your society has developed something like Mylar.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E However, if you are willing to incorporate turn-of-the-century technology, [radio communications was a thing by the mid-to-late 1890s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio#History) - Maxwell had predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves from the 1860s-1870s, and the first proven intentional transmission of radio waves occurred in the late 1880s, so you can probably fudge radio into a steampunk setting.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **Command and control**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Electrical control may be another issue, although likely solvable. [Tesla developed the first teleoperated, radio-controlled \u0022robot\u0022 in 1898](http://www.engadget.com/2014/01/19/nikola-teslas-remote-control-boat/), and according to Wikipedia [DC electric motors began appearing in commercial service on electric trams in the early 1880s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_trams#Electric_trams), while [commercially viable AC motors were developed in the late 1880s by Galileo Ferraris and Tesla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor#History), and were implemented in a mining operation in 1891. [Electric power distribution systems were also developed and deployed by the 1880s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission#History), so a system to control motors aboard a rocket for various purposes including \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E systems seems to have been viable.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If you want to use as little electricity as possible, hydraulics, pneumatics, and cables/pulleys stand out to me as the most readily viable control systems. However, these are going to be **heavy**. ***I\u0027m not sure what exactly a non-electric spacecraft control system would look like, in terms of mass and overall layout, and it\u0027s something I\u0027ve been wondering for a while, so again, if anyone could help that would be lovely****!*\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E As is noted on Atomic Rockets, computer systems will be heavy. Vacuum tubes [were known by the late 1800s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube#History_and_development), coming into their own more after the turn of the century. Mechanical computers are possible - the [Babbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine) [engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine) spring to mind, which would have been programmed with punched cards (wooden, although perhaps paper could have been used as well, especially with electricity). These would have been enormous, of course, but would have been possible with early-to-mid 1800s technology, and may have been employed at ground control or aboard space stations, or particularly large vessels. Miniaturization and cutdowns on mass could perhaps be achieved using smaller parts, and/or plastic parts, which could be developed as machining techniques advanced. It is also possible to build a binary digital mechanical computer, as demonstrated both by [modern hobbyists](https://www.google.com/search?q=mechanical\u002Bcomputer\u002Bknex\u0026ie=utf-8\u0026oe=utf-8) and by [Konrad Zuse in the early 20th century with the Z-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z1_%28computer%29). Both Babbage-computers and binary computers could store discrete quantities of data (iirc), making them useful for general-purpose computation, as it is easy to precisely store discrete quantities of data. Analog computers, in the vein of [artillery firing solution computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire-control_system), may be more common on spacecraft for astrogation and for other specialized purposes. The Soyuz has used an analog mechanical computer called [Globus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voskhod_Spacecraft_%22Globus%22_IMP_navigation_instrument).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Feeding astronomical data to the astrogation computer may have to be done manually, if your setting does not use much electrical tech, as I am only aware of photoelectric means to transmit optical/infrared/etc data to a computer. Perhaps it could be done by some chemical means, but I am not sure how. [This page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect#History) gives some history of photoelectrics; the photoelectric effect was known in the 1800s. If you plan to have steampunk space warships, this may significantly alter the mechanics of space battles, although I\u0027m not sure if it would be ruled out altogether; the pace of space combat (time between maneuvers) seems overall fairly slow. The requirement for manual data input may complicate firing solutions. However, it may be possible to perform space combat by saturating a trajectory with lots of unguided projectiles, such as iron spheres. Such a technique is mentioned on Atomic Rockets\u0027 Space War pages.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **Power systems**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E As you mentioned, all of these systems will likely use solar boiler power for the long term, using mercury, or perhaps water or ammonia-based liquid. For rechargeable long-term power storage, you may have several options: some sort of batteries, compressed gas tanks, springs, and flywheels come to mind.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Compressed air could achieve specific energies/energy densities somewhat smaller than those of batteries (~100-400kJ/kg), with compressed air tanks ranging from steel to carbon composites [able to store perhaps 40-100kJ/kg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_air_energy_storage#Specific_energy.2C_energy_density_and_efficiency). However, developing an air motor to provide constant power from the changing pressure in a compressed gas cylinder may be a challenge. I haven\u0027t been able to find ready data on spring energy density, aside from [carbon nanotube springs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_nanotube_springs), which are probably not going to be available to steampunk societies; although this isn\u0027t to say spring power isn\u0027t possible (I recall reading about it before, and only briefly searched Google this time). [Flywheels may be able to reach energy densities up to 400kJ/kg](http://www.damninteresting.com/the-mechanical-battery/), although modern flywheels for energy storage mostly use magnetic bearings, which [do not seem to have been employed much](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_bearing#History) until [well into the 20th century](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19910016099.pdf). Mechanical bearings could be used, but have the issue of rapidly losing energy due to [friction](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2010/ph240/haefele1/) and [change of orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flywheel_energy_storage#Energy_storage_efficiency), so these may not be very useful for power storage in a spacecraft, nor rotational correction. [This page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density#Energy_densities_of_common_energy_storage_materials) provides a table of some energy densities of specific storage media to compare against. I\u0027m not sure what the figures would be for steampunk-era batteries, but it\u0027s probably safe to err on the side of low-density for any of the media I mentioned.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E For short-term power solutions, APUs powered by peroxide as you mention, or by hydrazine or some other hypergolic fuels may be used.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If you\u0027re going with as little electric technology as possible, power transmission may also be an issue. Mechanical power, to my knowledge, will either have to be transmitted either by solid elements; via hydraulic/pneumatic systems; or by piping some hot fluid around the ship. This fluid will lose energy as it travels down the pipe, although I\u0027m not sure how fast power would be lost. **This is another area in which any help with numbers would be greatly appreciated.** I do know that [district heating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_heating#History) have been employed since at least the late 1800s, particularly in [New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_steam_system). Whether these would have been viable for power transmission, I\u0027m not sure. It\u0027s definitely worth looking into, since any sort of large vessel, space station, base, or habitat will require pretty long \u0022power lines\u0022, and may complicate the coordination of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thruster firing.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s perhaps also possible, if your steampunk society were to for instance [stumble upon the remains of a natural nuclear reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_nuclear_fission_reactor), for them to work out how to build one themselves, which would in turn provide boiler power for the ship\u0027s systems, thus enabling your steampunk astronauts to venture far from the Sun.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ----\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E There\u0027s a lot more to cover, which I may do later. Life support systems are of definite interest; especially filtration systems. The ISS uses a combination of various types of filter to make sure that the air up there doesn\u0027t stink, for instance.\n\u003E \n\nI see no reason that you can not use electricity, as long as you keep it on low levels. No doubt there will still be many many mechanical control systems. Perhaps you might require all aerodynamic control surfaces to be mounted near the command pod, so you could actually turn them using the control stick. For \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, you would be opening different valves in a hub of tube to throttle the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\n**Gun Launches**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Accelerando said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E A gun-style launch might work, although you would need some way to severely dampen the acceleration. Chemical-based gun propulsion is limited in projectile velocity by the speed of sound in its propellants, so [one of the only ways to achieve orbital velocities without railgun technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_gun) is by using a pure molecular hydrogen-based [light-gas gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-gas_gun), which has been proposed for the [Quicklauncher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicklaunch) concept. To my knowledge, firing the gun would produce accelerations of hundreds of gees on the projectile.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ---\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Another issue I\u0027ve realized is that if your setting doesn\u0027t have radio, you also won\u0027t have radar altimeters, in which case you won\u0027t have a precise altimeter for landing on airless bodies. This may call for an increased fuel budget on vacuum landers, and/or restrict spaceflight more to extremely low-gravity bodies such as asteroids, and to bodies with atmosphere. However, for extrasolar settings, this may not be as much of an issue - [at least one study](http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01668) indicates that [extrasolar gas giants in the liquid water zone may harbor multiple waterlogged super-Mars sized moons](http://www.astrobio.net/news-exclusive/water-rich-moons-could-form-in-goldilocks-zone/).\n\u003E \n\n**More Fuels and Control**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Idobox said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Nitrocellulose was invented in 1862, so definitely fits the steampunk theme, and is an actual rocket propellant. The sprint antimissiles are fueled by nitrocellulose with zirconium layers (that one isn\u0027t very steampunk) and gellified nitroglycerine, and accelerates at 100g.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E is the steampunk way of doing rockets. Guns, despite what Verne wrote, can\u0027t work with that technology. Ram accelerators and multi-charge guns are an actual option today, but the technology is more dieselpunk/atompunk.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hybrid or liquid fuel rockets without turbopumps are a decent option for circularisation and other orbital maneuvers, with their good isp and low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E. Cold gas \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and gyroscopes are also available technologies.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E A story about a space race between Great Britain and France in Victorian times (I can\u0027t think of any other power willing to invest the absurd sums required at the time, but if you feel like adding USA, Russia or Austria, it\u0027s your choice) would be amazingly enjoyable.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Fighting in the colonies to get suitable launch sites, oversized steam boats carrying giant SRBs, engineers devising mechanical \u0022flight computers\u0022 to keep the rocket pointing the right way, discovering hypersonic aerodynamics, reentry heat, cosmic rays, that natural rubber is crap in a vacuum, that copper and glass don\u0027t like 400\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0c thermal cycles, etc...\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I imagine it could start with single stage suborbital rockets with simple aerodynamic stabilization could be used in the beginning, with mechanical scientific tools on board, like pressure and temperature loggers. Steel would be the material of choice for most of the rocket.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Explosive bolts and electric systems might be possible, but coolness requires hydraulic or wire systems for the control surfaces and stage separation. In particular, for the stages, I imagine two concentric rings, with a number of cylinders in the radial direction, a bit like the big bank safe doors.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Once shock heating is discovered, transpiration cooling using water would probably be one of the first proposed ideas. Ablative heatshields could also be made of a variety of low tech materials, including cork or leather.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Thermal amplitude and airtightness would be trickier. Dewars were invented in 1892, and are a very good option for insulation. They would just require one airtight capsule surrounded by a thin metallic shell and a few spacers between the two. The lower tech option is to increase thermal inertia, IE bring a big chunk of ice. The best material for the capsule would be metal, since they knew how to make boilers. Riveted steel sheet would be a material of choice, but copper or brass might be viable options. For joints, I would have them use resin or asphalt first, before discovering they\u0027re crap for space, and moving to soft metals like lead or tin, and designing the capsule so that internal pressure keeps the joints tight. And also, I\u0027d expect a few catastrophic failures before they give up on glass windows, and even doors.\n\u003E \n\nFor insulation, I thought you might use wood instead of your golden mylar foil, and also cork wood for your heat shield. So all of your boilers and heat-sensitvie tanks might look like barrels!\n\nMy steampunk story assumes a chatastrophic failure, maybe the windows and doors is how that happens! The story also involves Britain and the United States in a space race after a gold meteorite from the Moon lands in North Carolina. This is what kick-starts the space program.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Accelerando said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Lovely! I assume you\u0027d have the astrogator calling out the distance to the ground to increasing precisions as the pilot kills velocity - a telescope or light pipe through the floor would be designated for the landing rangefinder. It is really neat how you can tell the distance to something by matching images...\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ---\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E This is one reason why I personally tend toward low-gravity planets and moons as the settings for steam/diesel/non-electric rocketry. The BIS lunar lander would have relied heavily on extreme staging, jettisoning small pods of black powder while igniting the next groups, but I\u0027m not sure how well this would work. Perhaps a really beefy black powder rocket could do the job, but if a powder rocket to Earth orbit is possible, I assume that it will need to be either a real titan, or will need orbital assembly to get significant payload beyond Earth.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Speaking of orbital assembly, in my understanding it *may* be possible - although you\u0027ll most likely need crewed vehicles to do the actual assembly, unless you want to try radio teleoperation, for which you will need some way for a spacecraft\u0027s systems to actively track its own position, and thus a camera. Gemini 8\u0027s crew made the first successful dock with Agena with the help of the [Gemini Guidance Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_Guidance_Computer) for rendezvous; perhaps an analog computer like the Globus could be used for similar purposes. Launching to orbit and rendezvousing with a vehicle without electronic computer guidance [does seem to have been considered at least somewhat feasible by designers of the Lunar Escape Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Escape_Systems#Guidance), which would have included an \u0022escape chair\u0022 aboard the LEM for astronauts to return to and dock with the CSM in case of a failure in the LEM; they would have relied entirely on manual piloting.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ***--- UPDATE ---***\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Additionally, on the subject of\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **Computers**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If your steampunk rocketeers are going to have general-purpose computers of any sort, then they may also want to incorporate some sort of user-friendly interface, if sufficiently powerful.

Although it may be slow to update compared to electronic displays, the rollsign may be advantageous over the other mechanical display options due to its low complexity, requiring only a single roll of material and turning mechanism per \u0022pixel\u0022 (letter).

And [even lunar regolith could be used to build hybrid rockets, with aluminum and oxygen isolated from the dirt](http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist.php#aluminum).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ---\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Also, another consideration: If you don\u0027t have radio, bulk communications in space will take place via sealed envelope.

Large relay stations may pop up in orbit, especially at advantageous spots such as the Lagrange points, to spot signals from spacecraft, and could have enormous mirrors to communicate long-range. Spacecraft may carry smaller mirrors, but I assume they will still need powerful telescopes in order to resolve different relay stations/messages from one another at extreme distance. **(Though perhaps this would not be a concern?

And with steampunk technology? You can\u0027t run a steam engine on coal in a vacuum.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E A solar boiler is just a sealed vessel containing water with an external mirror to concentrate the sun\u0027s rays. The solar heat boils the water. After that, everything works pretty much the same as if you\u0027d made the steam boiling water over a coal fire. You channel the steam through a generator for electricity, then either a radiator to cool it down and reuse or just add additional water to keep the process going as long as desired. This is not as efficient as solar electric cells, but it\u0027s quite within the bounds of 19th century technology. But could Victorians build a pressure-sealed craft that could operate in space? \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The late 19th century was a hotbed of submarine development. Numerous inventors in many countries developed undersea craft: Holland, Lake, and Nordenfelt to name just a few. The same design principles that keep high pressure water out also keep air in. Any shipyard that could build a submarine back then could make a vessel sealed against vacuum. But the main objection seems to be the idea of maintaining life support in space. After all, those Victorian submarines didn\u0027t remain submerged for months at a time. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [NASA](http://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/books/apollo/S6CH5.htm) determined for the Apollo missions that 1.8 pounds of oxygen were required per man-day of operation in space, plus an additional 4.8 pounds to replace losses due to leaks and such. The actual oxygen usage for the Apollo 15 mission was only 2.94 pounds per man-day, only 63% of their estimate which had been refined down after six previous Apollo missions to the moon. (NASA estimates were notoriously conservative.)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If we assume our hypothetical steampunk aether ship is the size of a contemporaneous armored cruiser (say the British Orlando class) it would displace 5600 tons and require a crew of 484, probably much less, assuming it\u0027s an unarmed exploratory vessel. This is roughly equivalent to the proposed size of the aforementioned Project Orion ship. Even supposing a crew of 484, and the actual oxygen usage of the Apollo missions (about 3 pounds per man-day) the oxygen requirement for a 100-day journey to Mars is only 72.6 tons. For a round-trip (assuming we can\u0027t resupply on the Red Planet) we\u0027d need at least double that, plus a reserve for time spent exploring, so let\u0027s triple that amount: 218 tons.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Water requirements are close to that of oxygen. NASA provided 25.4 kg for the Apollo 15 mission, a usage rate of 2 kg per man-day. At that rate a 100-day mission to Mars with 484 men would require 106.48 tons, tripled gives 320 tons. This is assuming no recycling. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The Orlando-class cruisers were designed to carry 900 tons of coal, which we need only enough to lift us out of the atmosphere, leaving plenty of room for the extra oxygen and water supplies needed for the trip. And remember, this is assuming a ridiculous size crew. A civilian vessel of the same size would have a crew about one-tenth that of a warship.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E But a major problem with long-term operations for both spacecraft and submarines operating on life support is the build-up of carbon-dioxide. Without constant removal the respiration of the crew will increase the concentration until it becomes toxic. Somehow we\u0027ll have to renew our air supply, and just pumping in more oxygen isn\u0027t enough.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Some have suggested greenhouses, and while that\u0027s certainly within the limits of Victorian technology, a greenhouse big enough to do the job would have to be larger than our ship. So, maybe we do add a greenhouse to the design, but more for aesthetics than practicality - always a big steampunk consideration. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E NASA used filters impregnated with lithium hydroxide to remove CO2 from the air of the Apollo capsules. When exposed to CO2, lithium hydroxide sucks it out of the air forming lithium carbonate and water. One gram of lithium hydroxide can remove 450 cubic centimeters pf CO2. The process actually made so much water the Apollo crews actually had to dump the excess overboard. A lithium hydroxide filter with simple electric fans to circulate the air would make an effective life support system for our aether ship and reduce the amount of water our expedition would have to carry.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Lithium hydroxide is not a high-tech material. It was first obtained by electrolysis in 1821 by William Thomas Brande. The process was improved in 1855 by Robert Bunsen, the inventor of the Bunsen burner. So the life support system of our modern moon missions employed essentially Victorian technology...\n\u003E \n\n**Pessimistic view of Steampunks In Space.**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Beowolf said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I worked with a semi-pro author on a similar concept. He wanted to stick with as much hard science as possible, and the big problem was with material strength and tolerances. The available steel wasn\u0027t strong or consistent enough to handle the demands of heavy rocketry. Even in steam engines, the stuff was always developing hot spots and cracks. Different parts of pistons, cylinders and linkages expanded at differing rates from heat, resulting in rapid wear.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Looking into the history of steam power, I learned that all the early engines used \u0022suction\u0022 rather than steam pressure. They\u0027d dump hot steam into the cylinder with the piston fully extended, and as the steam condensed, atmospheric pressure slowly pushed the piston down. And that was because their steel cylinders would fail under higher pressures. Plenty failed even using this negative pressure technique. Well, if it has trouble at 15psi, it sure isn\u0027t going to last as a rocket nozzle!\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Turbopumps would be even worse, as 19th century manufacturing tolerances didn\u0027t come anywhere close to what\u0027s required. AFAIK, before WWII no device more complex than a bullet could spin at turbopump speeds (30,000 rpm!) without tearing itself apart. The first gas turbine that produced more power than it took to overcome the friction losses of spinning it wasn\u0027t developed until 1903. The modern micrometer appeared around 1844, and the new, improved standard for super-precise machining became 1/1000th inch. There was a cool pic of a jet turbine weld on Reddit the other day. An aeronautics engineer said tolerance on those welds is 3/100,000ths. Nearly two full orders of magnitude tighter.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Then, for the icing on the cake, look at how reactive LOX is, and consider how they could possibly control the stuff with Victorian tech. Victorian gaskets are natural rubber and leather and that stuff explodes with LOX. Silicone and fiberglass weren\u0027t even words yet. LOX fed by nitrogen-pressurized tanks I could believe, but that doesn\u0027t seem like enough thrust for liftoffs. On the bright side, they did have access to the hydrofluoric acid used to clean LOX tanks and pipes of all organic material before filling. Though I bet they\u0027d kill lots of techs while they figured out how to handle the nasty stuff in such large quantities. Teflon safety-suits and SCUBA weren\u0027t things yet, either. They\u0027d have to use brass deep-diving suits, plus a hose to carry the used air back outside. Those suits are almost no protection at all against HF spills, and will only protect them from fumes for a short time. So while they learn nearly every accident will be a fatal one.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m not saying you can\u0027t have an alternate history where such things are dealt with. I imagine a 20-year Manhattan Project-style all-out effort by a major power could have solved a bunch of these problems. I\u0027m just saying they\u0027d need one heck of a good reason, because it\u0027s going to lay waste to their existing economy.\n\u003E \n\n**How Victorians Thought of Space Travel**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 1/21/2016 at 5:51 PM, CaptKordite said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I have been involved with steampunk for a number of years, have been playing Kerbal Space Program for just a year and have been playing the Professor Phineas Kerbenstein\u0027s wonderous vertical propulsion emporium mod for about a month so it was probably inevitable that I would come across this thread. One of the things I do in the steampunk community is present at conventions on Victorian spacecraft. And, in my research for that topic, I found the the 19th Century\u0027s ideas of how they were going to get into space, both in scientific romances and in science, was NOT rockets.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E In 1779, Erasmus Darwin, the famous grandfather of the more famous Charles, made a sketch of tanks of compressed inflamable air (hydrogen) and dephlogisticated air (oxygen) mixing in a chamber and being ignited to make a liquid fuel rocket. He understood the principals involved (that had been generally known for millennia) and understood that compressing (liquifing) the gas would make a better rocket but it would take until the end of the next century with the works of Konstantin Tsiolkovsky to put it all together into what we would recognize as a space craft.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E In between, rockets sucked. People used them for fireworks. The military used them for signalling. They tried using them as artillery but that\u0027s where they really stunk. So much so that no one even made the leap that, if improved, they could take people into space. Even Verne, who imagined the technological steps necessary to take the submarines of his day to create Nemo\u0027s Nautilus, didn\u0027t consider rockets when taking his protagonists to the moon.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E By far, the most common way that Victorians got into space, at least in the fiction of the day, was some variation of anti-gravity. Or, perhaps more accurately, non-gravity.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Based on new discoveries in the fundamentals of light and electricity, it was not uncommon for scientific speculation to imagine that gravity was something similar. A wave or a ray travelling through space to act on other objects. So, if you were able to make an object opaque to gravity, that shadow would protect things behind that object from the effects of gravity, thus rendering it weightless. While the Cavorite sphere in H.G.Wells \u0022First Men in the Moon\u0022 is probably the most famous of these anti-gravity machines, I want to talk about a much earlier, and perhaps the first such presentation.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E In 1847, John Leonard Riddell published a story titled \u0022Orrin Lindsay\u0027s Plan for Aerial Navigation.\u0022 He called his spacecraft the Electric Balloon and through an amalgam of steel and mercury plus an application of electromagnetism, his spherical ship became opaque to gravity and thus floated above the Earth. To direct the craft in one direction or another he would open a window, thus allowing a ray of gravity to enter the craft, act upon the inside, and thus pull the craft in that direction.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E His story was ten pages long with five additional pages of footnotes.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E At the end of the Victorian Era, Wells recognized that, were a sphere like Riddell\u0027s to be made suddenly opaque to gravity, it would already have the centripital force of the Earth\u0027s rotation and would be suddenly hurled into the sky. (Actually, it would be travelling tangentially to the Earth\u0027s rotation, 600mph in England, but would appear to leap into the sky at 150mph.)\n\u003E \n\n**Do Not Give Up on Liquid Fueled Rockets**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Do not give up on liquid-fuel rockets! The first liquid fuel rocket engine was built in the Victorian era by Pedro Paulet in about 1895.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Paulet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Paulet) Honesty compels me to point out that NO corroborating evidence has been found for his claims, first made in 1927 (Believe me I have searched! I\u0027ll send you the documentation if you want). However, his engine should have worked, and would have an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E of maybe 120-160. Of course, my hybrid (below) is much better.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E You do not need turbopumps, a liquid fuel rocket engine can be pressure-fed. For a great example, see the Sea Dragon rocket. It was the largest rocket ever seriously proposed; please note that it was to be built out of steel, by a shipyard. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Dragon_(rocket)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Dragon_%28rocket%29)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Also, the first ion-drive rocket engine was built by the Norwegian physicist Kristian Birkeland in 1912, and tested in an vacuum chamber.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I have been developing a thorough story, and have hundreds of inventors, characters, and methods. In my story, people go to Mars in 1917. I find that it would be very difficult to move this date back much more than ten years (twenty, tops), though, because so many enabling technologies were invented around this time.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I use a hybrid rocket engine using nitrous oxide and paraffin.\n\u003E \n\n*If you have anything to add, please feel free to comment, and I will add it to the O.P.*\n\n*If you have anything to add, please feel free to comment, and I will add it to the O.P.*\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-21T21:29:29Z\u0022 title=\u002209/21/2016 09:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun**\n  \nAdded section about Blast Coal, and"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T03:29:20Z","Content":"Since it was too early for radio, steampunk space travellers would have to use mirrors\\heliographs for communication with Earth, other ships or stations via Morse code."},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T06:07:30Z","Content":"This looks more like atompunk, than steampunk. \n\nSteampunk would mean something like a steam catapult throwing a powder-fueled rocket with a steamputnik."},{"CreatedByName":"Accelerando","CreatedById":543,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T06:39:58Z","Content":"I\u0027ve been thinking about this for a while, as I\u0027m currently building a world wherein rocketry and interplanetary/translunar space settlement was achieved without electricity. Critically, I think, the setting I chose is an extraterrestrial society on a super-Mars sized exomoon, so (I assume) this greatly eases the issues of engineering a viable rocket using non-electrical technology, because for the characteristics I chose, achieving low orbit with any given mass of payload should only require about 1/4 the propellant that it would take to lift the same payload from Earth (which also eases delta-V saving acceleration requirements, and thus the forces the rocket has to be built to withstand).\n\nHowever, a caveat for kerolox bipropellant engines: they may be restricted to relatively low power, if you want to go full 1800s tech. TWR \u003E 1 engines for large liquid-fueled spacecraft and the [turbopumps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbopump#History) that make them possible did not start appearing until the mid-20th century, to my knowledge.\n\nIn general, depending on how far back you want to go, or especially if you want to (like me) remove electrical technology from your setting, you\u0027ll have to consider changes across the board in spacecraft design. In general, anything using electricity is likely going to need to be designed pretty differently from modern spacecraft, at least masswise - photovoltaics will be replaced by solar boilers, of course, and there\u0027s more. Before I start, I\u0027d like to reiterate Gregox\u0027s request for input, **and further ask anyone with technical knowledge in any of these sectors to please contribute** - steam/diesel/non-electric space tech is an interesting concept, but concrete information on the matter is understandably scarce.\n\n**Communications**\n\nAs Scotius mentioned, your spacecraft may need to use heliographs, or some bright light source, to communicate with each other and with Ground Control. Electric lightbulbs could be used on the nightside; an alternative, if you want to shy from electricity (like me) may be to use some sort of bioluminescent flora in a transparent container, with a door to flash the light \u0022on\u0022 and \u0022off\u0022. Given that [amateur telescopes seem to be able to resolve meter-scale details on the ISS](http://www.skymania.com/wp/2011/03/amateur-snaps-astronaut-on-spacewalk.html/3655/), I assume that you may not need very powerful telescopes to keep track of communications, either, as long as you have sufficiently large mirrors. Foil aluminum may be a viable material for lightweight, foldable mirrors; or perhaps your society has developed something like Mylar.\n\nHowever, if you are willing to incorporate turn-of-the-century technology, [radio communications was a thing by the mid-to-late 1890s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio#History) - Maxwell had predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves from the 1860s-1870s, and the first proven intentional transmission of radio waves occurred in the late 1880s, so you can probably fudge radio into a steampunk setting.\n\n**Command and control**\n\nElectrical control may be another issue, although likely solvable. [Tesla developed the first teleoperated, radio-controlled \u0022robot\u0022 in 1898](http://www.engadget.com/2014/01/19/nikola-teslas-remote-control-boat/), and according to Wikipedia [DC electric motors began appearing in commercial service on electric trams in the early 1880s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_trams#Electric_trams), while [commercially viable AC motors were developed in the late 1880s by Galileo Ferraris and Tesla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor#History), and were implemented in a mining operation in 1891. [Electric power distribution systems were also developed and deployed by the 1880s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission#History), so a system to control motors aboard a rocket for various purposes including RCS systems seems to have been viable.\n\nIf you want to use as little electricity as possible, hydraulics, pneumatics, and cables/pulleys stand out to me as the most readily viable control systems. However, these are going to be **heavy**. ***I\u0027m not sure what exactly a non-electric spacecraft control system would look like, in terms of mass and overall layout, and it\u0027s something I\u0027ve been wondering for a while, so again, if anyone could help that would be lovely****!*\n\nAs is noted on Atomic Rockets, computer systems will be heavy. Vacuum tubes [were known by the late 1800s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube#History_and_development), coming into their own more after the turn of the century. Mechanical computers are possible - the [Babbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine) [engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine) spring to mind, which would have been programmed with punched cards (wooden, although perhaps paper could have been used as well, especially with electricity). These would have been enormous, of course, but would have been possible with early-to-mid 1800s technology, and may have been employed at ground control or aboard space stations, or particularly large vessels. Miniaturization and cutdowns on mass could perhaps be achieved using smaller parts, and/or plastic parts, which could be developed as machining techniques advanced. It is also possible to build a binary digital mechanical computer, as demonstrated both by [modern hobbyists](https://www.google.com/search?q=mechanical\u002Bcomputer\u002Bknex\u0026ie=utf-8\u0026oe=utf-8) and by [Konrad Zuse in the early 20th century with the Z-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z1_%28computer%29). Both Babbage-computers and binary computers could store discrete quantities of data (iirc), making them useful for general-purpose computation, as it is easy to precisely store discrete quantities of data. Analog computers, in the vein of [artillery firing solution computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire-control_system), may be more common on spacecraft for astrogation and for other specialized purposes. The Soyuz has used an analog mechanical computer called [Globus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voskhod_Spacecraft_%22Globus%22_IMP_navigation_instrument).\n\nFeeding astronomical data to the astrogation computer may have to be done manually, if your setting does not use much electrical tech, as I am only aware of photoelectric means to transmit optical/infrared/etc data to a computer. Perhaps it could be done by some chemical means, but I am not sure how. [This page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect#History) gives some history of photoelectrics; the photoelectric effect was known in the 1800s. If you plan to have steampunk space warships, this may significantly alter the mechanics of space battles, although I\u0027m not sure if it would be ruled out altogether; the pace of space combat (time between maneuvers) seems overall fairly slow. The requirement for manual data input may complicate firing solutions. However, it may be possible to perform space combat by saturating a trajectory with lots of unguided projectiles, such as iron spheres. Such a technique is mentioned on Atomic Rockets\u0027 Space War pages.\n\n**Power systems**\n\nAs you mentioned, all of these systems will likely use solar boiler power for the long term, using mercury, or perhaps water or ammonia-based liquid. For rechargeable long-term power storage, you may have several options: some sort of batteries, compressed gas tanks, springs, and flywheels come to mind.\n\nCompressed air could achieve specific energies/energy densities somewhat smaller than those of batteries (~100-400kJ/kg), with compressed air tanks ranging from steel to carbon composites [able to store perhaps 40-100kJ/kg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_air_energy_storage#Specific_energy.2C_energy_density_and_efficiency). However, developing an air motor to provide constant power from the changing pressure in a compressed gas cylinder may be a challenge. I haven\u0027t been able to find ready data on spring energy density, aside from [carbon nanotube springs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_nanotube_springs), which are probably not going to be available to steampunk societies; although this isn\u0027t to say spring power isn\u0027t possible (I recall reading about it before, and only briefly searched Google this time). [Flywheels may be able to reach energy densities up to 400kJ/kg](http://www.damninteresting.com/the-mechanical-battery/), although modern flywheels for energy storage mostly use magnetic bearings, which [do not seem to have been employed much](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_bearing#History) until [well into the 20th century](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19910016099.pdf). Mechanical bearings could be used, but have the issue of rapidly losing energy due to [friction](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2010/ph240/haefele1/) and [change of orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flywheel_energy_storage#Energy_storage_efficiency), so these may not be very useful for power storage in a spacecraft, nor rotational correction. [This page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density#Energy_densities_of_common_energy_storage_materials) provides a table of some energy densities of specific storage media to compare against. I\u0027m not sure what the figures would be for steampunk-era batteries, but it\u0027s probably safe to err on the side of low-density for any of the media I mentioned.\n\nFor short-term power solutions, APUs powered by peroxide as you mention, or by hydrazine or some other hypergolic fuels may be used.\n\nIf you\u0027re going with as little electric technology as possible, power transmission may also be an issue. Mechanical power, to my knowledge, will either have to be transmitted either by solid elements; via hydraulic/pneumatic systems; or by piping some hot fluid around the ship. This fluid will lose energy as it travels down the pipe, although I\u0027m not sure how fast power would be lost. **This is another area in which any help with numbers would be greatly appreciated.** I do know that [district heating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_heating#History) have been employed since at least the late 1800s, particularly in [New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_steam_system). Whether these would have been viable for power transmission, I\u0027m not sure. It\u0027s definitely worth looking into, since any sort of large vessel, space station, base, or habitat will require pretty long \u0022power lines\u0022, and may complicate the coordination of RCS thruster firing.\n\nIt\u0027s perhaps also possible, if your steampunk society were to for instance [stumble upon the remains of a natural nuclear reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_nuclear_fission_reactor), for them to work out how to build one themselves, which would in turn provide boiler power for the ship\u0027s systems, thus enabling your steampunk astronauts to venture far from the Sun. \n\n----\n\nThere\u0027s a lot more to cover, which I may do later. Life support systems are of definite interest; especially filtration systems. The ISS uses a combination of various types of filter to make sure that the air up there doesn\u0027t stink, for instance.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T08:55:59Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 08:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Accelerando**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hary R","CreatedById":111339,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T06:47:00Z","Content":"I suggest you to read \u0022From the earth to the moon\u0022 by Jules Verne to have an idea of how a steam punk world would have done a rocket.

Chemical-based gun propulsion is limited in projectile velocity by the speed of sound in its propellants, so [one of the only ways to achieve orbital velocities without railgun technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_gun) is by using a pure molecular hydrogen-based [light-gas gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-gas_gun), which has been proposed for the [Quicklauncher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicklaunch) concept.

The sprint antimissiles are fueled by nitrocellulose with zirconium layers (that one isn\u0027t very steampunk) and gellified nitroglycerine, and accelerates at 100g.\n\nSRB is the steampunk way of doing rockets. Guns, despite what Verne wrote, can\u0027t work with that technology. Ram accelerators and multi-charge guns are an actual option today, but the technology is more dieselpunk/atompunk.\n\nHybrid or liquid fuel rockets without turbopumps are a decent option for circularisation and other orbital maneuvers, with their good isp and low TWR. Cold gas RCS and gyroscopes are also available technologies.\n\nA story about a space race between Great Britain and France in Victorian times (I can\u0027t think of any other power willing to invest the absurd sums required at the time, but if you feel like adding USA, Russia or Austria, it\u0027s your choice) would be amazingly enjoyable.\n\nFighting in the colonies to get suitable launch sites, oversized steam boats carrying giant SRBs, engineers devising mechanical \u0022flight computers\u0022 to keep the rocket pointing the right way, discovering hypersonic aerodynamics, reentry heat, cosmic rays, that natural rubber is crap in a vacuum, that copper and glass don\u0027t like 400\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0c thermal cycles, etc...\n\nI imagine it could start with single stage suborbital rockets with simple aerodynamic stabilization could be used in the beginning, with mechanical scientific tools on board, like pressure and temperature loggers.

In particular, for the stages, I imagine two concentric rings, with a number of cylinders in the radial direction, a bit like the big bank safe doors.\n\nOnce shock heating is discovered, transpiration cooling using water would probably be one of the first proposed ideas. Ablative heatshields could also be made of a variety of low tech materials, including cork or leather.\n\nThermal amplitude and airtightness would be trickier. Dewars were invented in 1892, and are a very good option for insulation. They would just require one airtight capsule surrounded by a thin metallic shell and a few spacers between the two. The lower tech option is to increase thermal inertia, IE bring a big chunk of ice. The best material for the capsule would be metal, since they knew how to make boilers. Riveted steel sheet would be a material of choice, but copper or brass might be viable options. For joints, I would have them use resin or asphalt first, before discovering they\u0027re crap for space, and moving to soft metals like lead or tin, and designing the capsule so that internal pressure keeps the joints tight.

The BIS lunar lander would have relied heavily on extreme staging, jettisoning small pods of black powder while igniting the next groups, but I\u0027m not sure how well this would work. Perhaps a really beefy black powder rocket could do the job, but if a powder rocket to Earth orbit is possible, I assume that it will need to be either a real titan, or will need orbital assembly to get significant payload beyond Earth.\n\nSpeaking of orbital assembly, in my understanding it *may* be possible - although you\u0027ll most likely need crewed vehicles to do the actual assembly, unless you want to try radio teleoperation, for which you will need some way for a spacecraft\u0027s systems to actively track its own position, and thus a camera. Gemini 8\u0027s crew made the first successful dock with Agena with the help of the [Gemini Guidance Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_Guidance_Computer) for rendezvous; perhaps an analog computer like the Globus could be used for similar purposes. Launching to orbit and rendezvousing with a vehicle without electronic computer guidance [does seem to have been considered at least somewhat feasible by designers of the Lunar Escape Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Escape_Systems#Guidance), which would have included an \u0022escape chair\u0022 aboard the LEM for astronauts to return to and dock with the CSM in case of a failure in the LEM; they would have relied entirely on manual piloting.\n\n***--- UPDATE ---***\n\nAdditionally, on the subject of\n\n**Computers**\n\nIf your steampunk rocketeers are going to have general-purpose computers of any sort, then they may also want to incorporate some sort of user-friendly interface, if sufficiently powerful. Early implementations [may incorporate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface#1969.E2.80.93present:_Command-line_user_interface) a [Teletype-style user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter), with a ream of paper serving as the \u0022screen\u0022 upon which output is printed; pack lots of rolls! However, it may also be possible to have a refreshable display, perhaps using CRTs (especially if you\u0027re willing to stretch 1800s technology a bit) [which according to Wikipedia were first used to display images in 1907](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube#History); but if you want to stick to mechanical technology, there are several options at your disposal.\n\n\u003E ![220px-MBTA_Red_Line_rollsign_Braintree-Davis.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/MBTA_Red_Line_rollsign_Braintree-Davis.jpg/220px-MBTA_Red_Line_rollsign_Braintree-Davis.jpg)![009-TOON_DAN-R3F.jpg](http://www.rollsigngallery.com/009-Toronto/Danforth/009-TOON_DAN-R3F.jpg)\n\n[The **rollsign** may be reliable option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destination_sign#Rollsign). Commonly used in our world to display destination names on bus and train routes, the rollsign uses a flexible roll of material, pre-printed with characters and/or strings, that is turned by a motor to change the current displayed character/string. Although it may be slow to update compared to electronic displays, the rollsign may be advantageous over the other mechanical display options due to its low complexity, requiring only a single roll of material and turning mechanism per \u0022pixel\u0022 (letter). Along with your writing system\u0027s characters, one could even perhaps print colored squares onto the rollsign, so as to serve purely as graphical elements. Perhaps your steampunk computer nerds could play roguelikes?\n\nOn that note: I assume that mechanical pixels will probably be large, as each unit of a mechanical display will need its own separately controlled motor or drive system; they may also be particularly power-hungry, especially if you don\u0027t have electrical tech. **I\u0027m not sure how small a purely mechanical motor/engine can be made; if anyone can help, please do.** From what I\u0027m seeing on Google, it does seem to be possible to make very small (centimeters-scale) [purely mechanical](https://www.google.com/search?q=smallest\u002Bsteam\u002Bengine\u002Bever\u002Bmade\u0026ie=utf-8\u0026oe=utf-8)/[Stirling engines](https://www.google.com/search?q=smallest\u002Bstirling\u002Bengine\u002Bever\u0026ie=utf-8\u0026oe=utf-8), and perhaps [purely mechanical servo/stepper motors](https://www.google.com/search?q=mechanical\u002Bstepper\u002Bmotor\u0026ie=utf-8\u0026oe=utf-8)? I\u0027m not sure what kind of production technology it\u0027d take to make these small motors, but I know there are model kits with extremely small gears and other machinery, so perhaps...\n\nAt any rate, it may save your display designers a lot of headache to cut down on the number of pixels they need to build.\n\n\u003E ![Analog_clock_with_digital_display.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Analog_clock_with_digital_display.png)![640px-Split-flap_display.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Split-flap_display.jpg/640px-Split-flap_display.jpg)\n\n[The **split-flap** display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-flap_display) is another possibility. It\u0027s relatively compact, and can display many characters like the rollsign, but its clacky flap-display elements may perhaps get snagged, stuck, or loosened. Similar to the rollsign, it flips through a series of different pre-printed characters/strings to show the one(s) you want.\n\n\u003E ![640px-Opelled-detail.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Opelled-detail.jpg/640px-Opelled-detail.jpg)![640px-Ho%C5%99ej%C5%A1%C3%AD_n%C3%A1b%C5%99e%C5%BE%C3%AD%2C_za%C5%99%C3%ADzen%C3%AD_pro_provozn%C3%AD_informace%2C_%C4%8Das_20.06.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Ho%C5%99ej%C5%A1%C3%AD_n%C3%A1b%C5%99e%C5%BE%C3%AD%2C_za%C5%99%C3%ADzen%C3%AD_pro_provozn%C3%AD_informace%2C_%C4%8Das_20.06.jpg/640px-Ho%C5%99ej%C5%A1%C3%AD_n%C3%A1b%C5%99e%C5%BE%C3%AD%2C_za%C5%99%C3%ADzen%C3%AD_pro_provozn%C3%AD_informace%2C_%C4%8Das_20.06.jpg)\n\n[The **flip-disc** display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-disc_display) is the lowest density option of the mechanical display technologies. A disc is colored black on one side, white/green on the other (or any other color combination) and the disc is flipped to show an \u0022on/off\u0022 pixel. I assume this would be less favorable for purely mechanical setups, but electromechanical displays might use something of this nature.\n\n---\n\nOn a side note, programmable computers with accessible user interfaces might be a boon to musicians even in the steampunk era, although I assume some decades would need to pass before the concept would become practical. Automatic instruments go back a long way - and programmable automatic instruments, [\u0022player pianos\u0022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_piano) and [barrel pianos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_piano), had been in development and use throughout the 19th century.

If you\u0027re going to be far away from Mission Control, you\u0027re probably going to want your own computer(s) - minutes to hours of lightspeed communications delay may simply not do, which would be further complicated if your setting uses heliographs instead of radio.\n\nAnd besides, this is a worldbuilding *guide*, so it\u0027s for everyone\u0027s steampunk-y settings, aye? ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nAs a worldbuilder, I tend to ignore Every Gram Counts to some extent because I think it\u0027s a bit overhyped (much like other aspects of Atomic Rockets\u0027 ultra-machismo rocketpunk worldbuilding). True, exploratory and military spacecraft are going to be optimized, although see above; but once you get past a certain point - I presume nuclear thermal spacecraft in my setting, for instance, and some sort of ion engine may perhaps be viable for late steampunk - the amount of stuff you can carry is limited more by how much your space travelers, or their backers, are willing to pay to increase your propellant stock and beef up your engine. If you plan to have significant deep-space traffic - and I think it\u0027s at least possible - then space travel is going to have to be at least on par with air travel for cost. Asteroid mining, if you can do it, would help greatly. Though admittedly, low cost spaceflight may be pushing the envelope toward dieselpunk and rocketpunk, but this could be an acceptable evolution for a society developing from late steampunk.\n\nTake, for instance, the [Spacecoach concept](http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=33078), which is intended to provide a cheap reusable, lower-maintenance, more liveable vessel for exploring the Solar System. Although driven, again, by electric propulsion, one of the critical elements of it is that it uses water, or ice-derived materials, for propellant. Water is probably (relatively) cheap in space; if you can hitch onto a [near-Earth comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-Earth_object#Near-Earth_comets) or mine ice from asteroids, you may have it made. Spacecoaches are additionally designed to use the ship\u0027s consumable water as their propellant - why carry your heavy wastewater when you can hook your engine to your toilet - a feature that may admittedly be specific to its electric propulsion design, but is interesting nonetheless as it vastly cuts down on propellant requirements, [with a 40 ton ship of 6 crew requiring 54 tons of consumables and yielding 18km/s delta-v](http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=33467). If your steampunky setting can figure out ion engines, it may be worth a look - and I\u0027d reckon that, at a mass ratio of around 2:1, you could afford to carry some extra equipment like a sufficiently miniaturized computer.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I see no reason that you can not use electricity, as long as you keep it on low levels. No doubt there will still be many many mechanical control systems. Perhaps you might require all aerodynamic control surfaces to be mounted near the command pod, so you could actually turn them using the control stick. For RCS, you would be opening different valves in a hub of tube to throttle the RCS.\n\nAgain, a worldbuilding guide, though. And the timeline may be important - commercially viable DC and AC electrics and power distribution systems didn\u0027t really come to be a thing until the 1880s and 90s, whereas mechanical systems such as Babbage\u0027s engines were viable by the 1850s. Perhaps a small discrepancy, and mechanical tech for power applications may also have been relatively underdeveloped, but it\u0027s a path you could take since we\u0027re writing alternate history, or outright science fiction in my own case. My own extraterrestrial society did not pursue electricity far for a long time, for instance, because their sun is a red dwarf flare star.\n\nFor aerodynamic control surfaces, if they aren\u0027t driven by electric motors powered by the APU/gas generator, pulleys and cables were used on large aircraft in WWII, so you might be able to have control surfaces situated away from the cockpit.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E For insulation, I thought you might use wood instead of your golden mylar foil, and also cork wood for your heat shield. So all of your boilers and heat-sensitvie tanks might look like barrels!\n\nMaybe, although wood might take some engineering. A big problem with organic materials is [degradation upon exposure to space](http://www.popsci.com/article/technology/ask-anything-could-you-build-spaceship-out-wood); wood contains a lot of trapped water and air, to my knowledge, which could be a problem. [It also may not respond well to the extreme temperature gradients](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2b5lir/does_wood_rot_in_space_would_it_be_possible_to/).\n\nFTL travel may be possible with some new physics, but as you say, pure-steampunk societies would have trouble working that out on their own without developing other breakthroughs that could make them more modernesque. **To my knowledge, wormholes are the only viable form of FTL that allows travel to and from a destination without causality violations; drive-type technologies require causality violations due to the fact that you\u0027re making two \u0022jumps\u0022 or trips instead of bridging a point in space and time, although any input on this, as always, would be muchly appreciated.** The best information on the subject seems to come from Orion\u0027s Arm; [searching Google for \u0022orion\u0027s arm wormhole\u0022](https://www.google.com/search?q=orion%27s\u002Barm\u002Bwormhole\u0026ie=utf-8\u0026oe=utf-8) is the best I\u0027ve come up with thus far.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T22:04:33Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 10:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Accelerando**"},{"CreatedByName":"sndrtj","CreatedById":110589,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T21:38:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Take, for instance, the [Spacecoach concept](http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=33078), which is intended to provide a cheap reusable, lower-maintenance, more liveable vessel for exploring the Solar System.

I would think ion engines are rather complicated for steampunk, but there might be a way to utilize water in a more simple way: the electrolysis of water produces H2 and O2. Combine those and we have BOOM again.

The main reason I mentioned electric propulsion and nuclear thermal is because they\u0027re relatively \u0022simple\u0022 ways (at least, from our perspective) to cut down on propellant requirements, but chemical could perhaps be enough. And [even lunar regolith could be used to build hybrid rockets, with aluminum and oxygen isolated from the dirt](http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist.php#aluminum).\n\n---\n\nAlso, another consideration: If you don\u0027t have radio, bulk communications in space will take place via sealed envelope. This will probably just make up some of the boxes in a cargo hold in the early days, but if your space traffic gets sufficiently heavy, you might end up with dedicated mail courier-ships.\n\nAn angry communique from Mars to Earth might begin something like this, transmitted via heliograph relays:\n\n\u003E [https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/2f/19/b9/2f19b909b4cde7e52bdabbb82d306d74.jpg](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/2f/19/b9/2f19b909b4cde7e52bdabbb82d306d74.jpg)\n\nFollowed days or weeks after by the aforementioned strong letter, arriving in the cargo of an Earth-bound rocket.\n\nFor deep-space heliograph communications, you\u0027ll require big mirrors and big scopes. Large relay stations may pop up in orbit, especially at advantageous spots such as the Lagrange points, to spot signals from spacecraft, and could have enormous mirrors to communicate long-range. Spacecraft may carry smaller mirrors, but I assume they will still need powerful telescopes in order to resolve different relay stations/messages from one another at extreme distance. **(Though perhaps this would not be a concern? Since the message reaching the ship would depend on the orientation of mirrors, so one ship\u0027s message may not be visible to another.)**\n\nPerhaps [cycler stations](http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/infrastructure.php#id--Aldrin_Cyclers) could be incorporated into the concept, serving as heliograph relays as well as travelers\u0027 hostels.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T22:37:24Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 10:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Accelerando**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hary R","CreatedById":111339,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T05:34:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I suppose that is true.\n\u003E - - - Updated - - -\n\nWell my idea about reading this novel was not to see how accurate it was (in regard of today\u0027s science, it\u0027s not), but how a victorian rocket scientist would have conceived a spaceflight.

Food and water are not particularly difficult to store for a week or two, it leaves us mostly with atmosphere. CO2 is known since the XVII century, and had already been liquefied and frozen by the early 1800s. I\u0027m not sure how well its chemistry was known in the era, but activated charcoal or concentrated caustic soda solutions can be use as scrubbers. I\u0027m sure there are plenty of other simple reactions that could be used.\n\nThat leaves us with oxygen. Commercial production of liquid oxygen started in 1895 in the real world, so a simple vat is an acceptable option. Peroxyde has already been proposed, but it is unstable and liquid, and also likely expensive with steampunk technology. Modern oxygen generators often use sodium chlorate, which turns into salt and oxygen when heated above 300\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C, and was industrially produced in 1892, although I\u0027m not sure they were aware of the oxygen production properties by then."}]}
