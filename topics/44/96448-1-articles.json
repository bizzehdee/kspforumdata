We know that a rocky body with enough atmosphere is very nearly \u0022free\u0022 to land on from a low orbit using parachutes. However, the same atmosphere which reduces the landing delta-v cost also makes takeoffs more expensive (remember, no jet engines in this scenario). Beyond a certain point, increasing the atmospheric pressure begins to increase the total delta-v cost of visiting the body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s take a look at some rocky bodies in the KSP universe with the current (admittedly rather soupy) atmospheric model to see how they compare on this scale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Comparison #1:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Kerbin costs about 4550 m/s of delta-v to take off to a 70 km orbit, but is nearly free to land on. If we approximate 50 m/s to lower the periapsis nicely into the atmosphere, that gives a total delta-v cost for a Kerbin visit of about 4600 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Tylo costs around 2700-3000 m/s to land on (carefully) from a 20 km orbit, and about 2300 m/s to take off. Let\u0027s go with the lower end and say only 5000 m/s of delta-v is required for an ideal Tylo visit. Even with the optimistic estimate, that\u0027s still 400 m/s more than is required for a Kerbin visit, despite Tylo having an identical radius to Kerbin and only 80% of the gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo Kerbin is somewhere in the the \u0022sweet spot valley\u0022 in the diagram above, though not necessarily on the \u0022sweet spot\u0022 itself - probably somewhere to the right of it, given the current soupy lower atmosphere which makes takeoffs more expensive than they need to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Comparison #2:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Duna costs about 1400 m/s to take off from to a 45 km orbit, but the landing is mostly free with a decent number of parachutes. Let\u0027s say 50 m/s to deorbit \u002B 100 m/s to slow down just above the surface, for 150 m/s of landing delta-v. That means Duna\u0027s total delta-v cost is 1550 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Moho and Vall are both smaller than Duna (250/300 km vs 320 km) and have lower surface gravity (0.275/0.235 g vs 0.300 g). Nonetheless both require around 1000 m/s delta-v for landing and 950 m/s for takeoff, for a total delta-v cost of 1950 m/s each. That is 400 m/s more than is required for a Duna visit, despite Duna\u0027s higher gravity and larger radius.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna is definitely in the \u0022sweet spot valley\u0022 with its very low delta-v requirement. My suspicion is that Duna may actually be very close to the \u0022sweet spot\u0022 itself - perhaps a fraction to the left. The atmosphere is just thick enough to make a landing almost free, but not too thick to make the takeoff more expensive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack to choosing the atmosphere for our arbitrary rocky planet. Now, I\u0027m aware that the ideal atmosphere for minimizing total delta-v (at least with the current KSP 0.90.0 model) would probably look something like a step function: nice and thick next to the surface, then straight to vacuum a short way up (say above ~1 km). Real atmospheres decay exponentially though, so let\u0027s not cheat our way out of that requirement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/87213001/KSP/Optimal%20Atmospheric%20Pressure/Real%20Atmosphere.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Real%20Atmosphere.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_height\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Escale height\u003C/a\u003E of an atmosphere determines the rate of exponential decay of pressure with altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the same surface pressure, the atmosphere will be thinner (and the vacuum of space closer) if there is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Higher surface gravity\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Lower average temperature\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Larger average molecule size\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, for the same surface pressure, the atmosphere will be thicker (and extend further into space) if there is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Lower surface gravity\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Higher average temperature\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Smaller average molecule size\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for very small bodies, having an atmosphere - even a weak one - could actually be a disadvantage. The low surface gravity would mean the thin atmosphere would be dispersed over a wide range of altitudes, so to satisfy the \u0022stable orbit\u0022 requirement you\u0027d need to descend from - and takeoff to - a higher orbit, increasing the delta-v requirement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027d really love to see is a \u0022heat map\u0022 indicating the optimal surface pressure required to minimize the total delta-v for a given rocky body radius, assuming a simple atmospheric model. (For KSP and for the real world!)

Note that this is not a line of constant delta-v, but rather a line connecting \u003Cem\u003Eminimum values\u003C/em\u003E for total delta-v for different body sizes. (Remember we\u0027re assuming similar values for density, temperature, etc, between differently sized bodies.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s possible I may be wrong with this speculative heat map - I haven\u0027t done any actual calculations, just a few quick thought experiments. In particular I haven\u0027t considered whether the purple line flattens out or continues to increase at the higher values of radius. And of course there aren\u0027t any real numbers yet.

The air at sea level isn\u0027t made of soup in the real world. So losses to drag are much smaller than you\u0027d expect. Usually in the range of just barely more than a 100 m/s. And most of that is thanks to reduced ISP on the engines. The main problem with an atmosphere is the dynamic pressure breaking things during ascent.\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGut feeling tells me that the sweet spot is somewhere around 0.25 atmosphere and 0.5 atmosphere if we take everything into account.

Just look at the kind of nonsense engineers needed to put Curiosity on the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile the earth has too high an atmospheric pressure. If we had a lower atmospheric pressure we wouldn\u0027t need to worry about deviating from a zero lift trajectory and our rockets could have more efficient shapes (Like a sphere).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yea, gut feeling is telling me somewhere between 0.25 and 0.5 so we get a bit more leeway in rocket design yet can still use chutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery interesting. I agree that Mars probably is a bit to the left of the sweet spot - the atmosphere could probably be thicker to reduce that landing delta-v without increasing the takeoff delta-v too much. My hunch is that the sweet spot is closer to Mars atmosphere levels than Earth levels though - so perhaps somewhere around 0.1 atm of surface pressure would be optimal? Certainly somewhere between the lower bound of 0.01 atm and the upper bound of 1.00 atm anyway, at least for a rocky body of that size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about for much smaller or larger bodies - how might the optimal surface pressure change, if at all? For supersized Earths? Moons like Titan, Ganymede, or our own? Asteroids like Ceres? Comets like 67P? My speculation is that smaller bodies will be better off with a slightly lower surface pressure (or possibly even a vacuum), while larger bodies would be cheaper to visit with a slightly higher surface pressure.

Derivation does include some hand-waving as far as gravity turn goes, but I\u0027ll get to that in a moment. As far as I know, the only reason it\u0027s a poor approximation for real planets is because atmosphere isn\u0027t exactly exponential, rocket\u0027s drag/mass ratio changes as fuel as consumed, and drag isn\u0027t strictly quadratic at hypersonic speeds. Nonetheless, I\u0027m not aware of any simple formula that does better, so it\u0027s a good starting point before you refine computations with a proper model or testing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe formula works for airless or nearly so bodies so long as you assume that TWR is not your limiting factor. With infinite TWR you escape from an empty world by accelerating to orbital velocity instantly. That way, there are no losses to gravity. Of course, that\u0027s not how real world works. So if you want to consider it a practical limitation, the approximation works so long as atmosphere is a bigger factor than TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, onto derivation. Let us consider a purely vertical assent in which we attempt to escape the atmosphere. First approximation is that by the time gravity really starts to change, atmosphere is no longer a factor. So we will assume that g is constant. This is one of the very few approximations here that works even better in the real world than in KSP. This problem has an exact solution for quadratic drag. One must ascend at terminal velocity. Proof for constant density is trivial. The reason it\u0027s a bit more complicated with decreasing density is that you have to increase TWR past 2 to account for acceleration. Nonetheless, it\u0027s possible to prove that prescription of ascent at terminal velocity is still an optimal one. (Using Euler Lagrange Equation.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe consider special case of exponential atmosphere. This approximation is almost exact for KSP except for cutoff. It\u0027s considerably worse for real world. We can then write v(h) = v\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E exp(h/(2H)), where h is altitude. Clearly, we can look at it as a differential equation h\u0027(t) = v(h(t)), and it has a relatively simple solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eh(t) = -2H ln((H - v\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E t / 2) / H)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is where things start getting exciting. You\u0027ll note that this equation diverges at t = 2H/v\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E. In other words, it takes that long to escape completely to infinity if you continue maintaining terminal velocity. Of course, you\u0027ll be moving infinitely fast, and that will require infinite acceleration and infinite fuel, but we aren\u0027t really trying to escape out to infinity. We just need to clear significant atmosphere. And naturally, acceleration diverges to infinity just as you clear atmosphere, meaning that nearly all of this t = 2H/v\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E is spent escaping the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal observation is that amount of throttle you need to apply to follow this trajectory is F(t) = 2mg \u002B ma(t), where \u0027a\u0027 is acceleration and 2mg are your losses to drag and gravity. (Equally split at v = v\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E.) In vacuum and zero gravity, Integrating F(t)/m would give you your final velocity. So that\u0027s your real delta-V. However, the velocity you are actually getting is integral of a(t). That means integral of 2g over time it takes you to escape is your loss. And we know the amount of time it takes to escape. It\u0027s right above. So the total loss is 4gH/v\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are several approximations up there, but they are all reasonable, and one can even do some estimates on the errors, and they do work out to be very, very small for KSP, and reasonable for real world. Hand-waving starts here. We don\u0027t have a full solution for gravity turn. There are numerical models, but no analytic solution we can take. At this point, I wouldn\u0027t call it an assumption. The conjecture is that gravity \u002B drag losses during optimal ascent through gravity turn are approximately the same as during vertical escape. I do not have a satisfactory explanation for why it should be so. But it agrees with all of the numerical simulations on ascent, with all of the empirical numbers from KSP, including ascent from tallest peaks of Eve, and is even in the ballpark for real rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-13T06:08:11Z\u0022 title=\u002201/13/2015 06:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by K^2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerano","CreatedById":107460,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T14:18:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the detailed derivation K^2, that\u0027s very interesting indeed.
