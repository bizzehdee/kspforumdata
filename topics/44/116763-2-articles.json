Only the richest really had cars in the beginning. Besides the guys who built their own. Cars were toys for the rich at first. Like spaceflight is currently. Eventually, over a long time, they became cheaper. Henry Ford played a part in that. But infrastructure was also developed over decades, which reduced costs as well.\n\nEven boats took hundreds of years to get as fast as they are now, if not thousands of years.\n\nSpace is comparable, not in some ways, but they are comparable in that both are transportation systems. They are comparable, except space is on a much bigger scale. But so is our current industry compared to a century ago. So, wait a few centuries and space will be fairly accessible.\n\nBut people still need to build up infrastructure in space, supply depots and many other facilities.

How much did those facilities cost to build? How much do they cost to maintain?\n\nHow much power do solar cells generate in direct sunlight at a langrage point? Is there a more efficient place to put a solar cell to generate electricity, assuming attached heat radiators? How big then would the surface area of a solar panel need to be to generate electricity equal to at least one of the terrestrial facilities? Using the size of the solar panel, how big would the whole satellite need to be? Is there a rocket that could launch it, and how much does that cost? If multiple rockets, their total cost?

Testing, maintenance and systems management will probably require a permanent human presence on this orbital factory. As profits are made on this endeavor, more launch bandwidth will come online to support it and help it grow.\n\nOther industrial interests will want to explore the properties of various materials that can only be created in microgravity. Currently the human race is dependent upon materials which are available only on a 1g rocky-terrestrial planet with a dense atmosphere. As an orbital lab-foundry operation expands our catalogue of possible materials to include those which can be made in microgravity, some of these new materials will no doubt find themselves profoundly useful for high-technology applications, and industries will move mountains to start producing them in greater and greater quantities. This too will lead to more humans in space. \n\nGathering the available resources to fuel these two kinds of orbital industrial operations will then bring into existence the low-delta-V shipping lanes between LEO, L4 \u0026 L5, Moon surface, Mars, Ceres, various asteroids, and the Jovian moons.\n\nIt\u0027s just waiting for that one company to get hungry enough to get out there and start turning a profit, then others will follow."},{"CreatedByName":"SomeGuy12","CreatedById":103022,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T02:52:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I believe the two things that will herald the arrival of a serious human presence in space will be microgravity manufacturing and microgravity metallurgy.\n\nPretty sure you\u0027re wrong on both counts. Gravity is a very weak force - many ways to neutralize it in manufacturing. The simplest way is to continually rotate the product being worked on. There\u0027s no reason to think that we can\u0027t make any form of metal or chip that can be made in microgravity with a modified technique on Earth.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Your business plan is not viable, since it falls down at the very first point. That type of technology does not exist, and will probably not exist for at least a little while. If it were to exist, it would eliminate pretty much all mining on Earth.\n\nIt does exist - I mentioned it in my post you didn\u0027t completely read. It just takes up a lot of room. Enough pieces of manufacturing equipment in one building, and you\u0027d have a self replicating factory. It\u0027s a lot of gear - measured in square miles. It is self replicating, or we wouldn\u0027t have manufactured goods at all today..."},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T03:17:39Z","Content":"\u003E more heavier elements since the solar wind and heating has over the aeons blown away a lot of the light stuff.\n\nWhat? solar wind carry away light stuff? \n\nLol, solar wind is super weak, it may do it with hydrogen or helium atmosphere in billions of years.\n\nFirst when the moon form was due a collision between a body and the earth, all the light material had more chance to stay in orbit meanwhile the heavy material would come back to earth, then the moon form from all that \u0022surface light material\u0022 from the collision. So you dont have many expensive heavy elements in the moon, to search that go to Mercury or Venus (which it has more chance due their volcanoes.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Living things are self replicating. We can build 3d printers and other bits of tech that can make many of the parts used in themselves. We have massive factories that the sum total of the effects of all the machinery is that the factories replicate themselves.\n\nLol, that is the only thing we need? When we learn to do that, then we can make von neumann probes and conquer the universe. And if we dont take care with the replicating mechanism, we may consume all the matter in the universe (is exponential grow)\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nWell I guess my ideas are a lot more realistic, the only that it will need some development is the constellation to push or deorbit sattelites. But I accept critics."}]}
