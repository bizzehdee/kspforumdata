It\u0027s a bootstrapping issue. All this is predicated on Mars actually being compatible with humans, I\u0027d bolo a couple B3300 habs together in LEO and have some people live a few years at 0.38 g first (and breed several\u00A0generations of mice, perhaps) before deciding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny location for humans away from Earth is a 100% built environment.

Anything short of that, and those people better have the funds/income to order food supplies from Earth, replacement parts, etc. While I agree that additive manufacturing, and other tech will make this easier, the machines and stock (scaled to the population) needs to be there.
