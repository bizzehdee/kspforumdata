The latter combination is nothing you\u0027d want to splash around, but it\u0027s not half as bad as hydrazine and its pals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPropane (C3H8)/liquid oxygen has one or two nice tricks that make it a bit better than methane. Like methane, it can be used for combustion chamber or nozzle cooling, converting it into a warm gas to feed into the injectors, improving mixing. It also boils off into the atmosphere once testing is finished, making reusability easier. Unlike methane, once it\u0027s chilled down to LOX temperatures it has similar density to kerosene, and its melting point overlaps with the boiling point of oxygen, allowing it to share a common bulkhead with the LOX tank, saving weight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCarbon Monoxide (CO)/LOX could be a cheap, simple rocket fuel to produce on Mars or in the atmosphere of Venus, as while performance is poor, it needs no hydrogen and can be made directly from their CO2 atmospheres.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://yarchive.net/space/rocket/fuels/ozone.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EEthyl alcohol/ozone\u003C/a\u003E (O3) was tried, but the ozone was not only more oxidising than fluorine, it was too damn unstable.

It can even be used as a monopropellant for attitude control and ullage thrusters.

Not so cool was the tradeoff in specific impulse, but it didn\u0027t matter because of the extra thrust at the beginning of the ascent.
