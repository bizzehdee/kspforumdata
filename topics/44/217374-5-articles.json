They\u0027re useful general principles but knowing when \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E to use them is as important as knowing when to use them. Knowing \u003Cem\u003Ehow \u003C/em\u003Eto use them is another matter entirely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsider the well known \u0027show don\u0027t tell\u0027 maxim. Great rule - until it isn\u0027t.\u00A0 Sometimes it\u0027s easier - and better - to just tell your reader something rather than wrecking the flow or pacing of the story by trying to show it. Even if showing is the better option, \u003Cem\u003Ehow\u003C/em\u003E to show is a judgment call. At the very least it requires some understanding of a character, how they\u0027re likely to respond to a situation, and how to make that response believable.\u00A0 And that\u0027s before we get into consistent characterisation, and character development over a story arc - a believable response at the beginning of a story may not be a believable response at the end of the same story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLLMs are not (to my understanding at least) set up for this.\u00A0 They have no concept or understanding of a story beyond a collection of words arranged in a plausible way according to their training data. And without that understanding \u0027training on which are better\u0027 is an oxymoron, because an LLM is incapable of judging what is \u0027better\u0027.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a wise person once said to me: \u0022I can tell you how to make that chapter \u003Cem\u003Edifferent\u003C/em\u003E but I can\u0027t necessarily tell you how to make it better.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis, I think, is what will happen with LLM generated stories - it\u0027ll be easy enough to generate variations on a given story but generating \u0027better ones\u0027? Not so much. Even if you have an army of volunteers reading the stuff that the LLM spits out, grading them for quality, and using those grades to somehow train the LLM, it\u0027s not going to work. For openers, good luck getting any two volunteers to agree on which story is better but, more importantly, whatever qualities made version 2543 of a given story better than version 1723,\u00A0 are probably not going to help much in making the \u003Cem\u003Enext\u003C/em\u003E story any better.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLikewise for \u0027training an LLM\u0027 on my voice. That training supposes that I\u0027ve written enough stories having the same general plot and characters, that the LLM has a decent data set to use when writing the next story of the same type.\u00A0 Which isn\u0027t going to happen and I think it\u0027s unlikely to happen even for very prolific authors.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL: DR version.\u00A0 I found the above post to be a glib understatement of what goes into any sort of creative writing process (even potboiler novels).

I\u0027m genuinely unsure about how one sets off to write a novel. I recall Harlan Ellison explaining how he wrote every day. Treated it like a job, just got up and wrote. He used to write in store windows sometimes and would generate a short story from prompts written on a slip of paper by customers. All I can say is that a year ago when I heard about some of the generative \u0022art\u0022 then messed around a little with midjourney, other than some fun images with their own bizarre \u0022AI art style\u0022 it was fairly lousy. Fast forward a year... and it\u0027s amazingly capable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think in the case of LLMs and text, we\u0027re going to see continuous progress. The South Park, collect underpants, ???, profit meme... I\u0027m not seeing training as some sort of magic here. A number of papers have shown that self-reflection produces better results in LLMs, as does asking it to \u0022think step by step.\u0022 Specific domain training\u2014in this case fantasy writing, and specifically a dataset where humans have labeled works by quality\u2014is a path they could certainly try. If it generated multiple stories on the same prompt, then asked to analyze them, I wonder how it would do? Could it in fact \u0022pick a winner,\u0022 or at least \u0022out of these X stories, which one is likely to be considered the best written?\u0022 Then test with humans (people who have to read the stories). Short stories would be better here, because reading a whole \u0022meh\u0022 fantasy novel is not on my list of things to do, much less a bunch of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I was someone engaged in creative writing or digital art, I\u0027d be pretty concerned, and/or learning these tools to leverage the ability I already had. Not saying the current github linked is that tool for fantasy writing, but looking forward 1, 2, 3 years, who knows?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s say George RR Martin could dump the text of all his published work he considered good in (loads of tokens, his books are long), then asked the model questions about them... Like \u0022in Song of Ice and Fire, are there loose string plots that seem to exist?\u0022 (I can think of a few \u0022Chekhov\u0027s gun\u0022 things I was waiting to see l that just disappeared). With all those works still in the model, ask it to write further chapters. Or ask it to summarize character arcs, then propose where the characters can go from here\u2014keeping all the other characters in mind as they interact with each other. Martin apparently doesn\u0027t work off of an outline, but for this use case, maybe he does, and prompts it with an outline of directions he saw characters going it. Such an experiment would have to be done by an author I think\u2014they could read the output, and have a feel for quality, and \u0022voice\u0022 in a way that I would not (even if some of the output would fool \u003Cem\u003Eme\u003C/em\u003E).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe proof of the puddling will be in the eating. We\u0027ll know what LLMs are capable of in fiction when something gets published that is sufficiently good. I\u0027m old enough to remember when chess was a human intellectual pursuit that computers would never \u0022get,\u0022 then the goalpost moved after computers beat humans, to \u0022of course computers could \u003Cem\u003Ebrute-force\u003C/em\u003E chess.\u0022 Go, OTOH, was far harder... then that fell, and the goalposts move again. \u0022It can make some pictures, but they\u0027re crappy, look at the extra fingers, etc, lol!\u0022 Then models start making photo-realistic images within a few months, and the goalpost moves again. LLM can write some boilerplate novels, but can\u0027t write anything with any emotional underpinning that will engage real readers... until it does.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-06-26T14:13:02Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2023 02:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by tater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DDE","CreatedById":146349,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-26T18:29:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce again, AI proves to be comparable to a lazy intern.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vu3MXV24sLw?feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022ChatGPT is Coming For Me...\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-26T21:42:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224297577\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022217374\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221687804182\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022146349\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DDE\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, DDE said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce again, AI proves to be comparable to a lazy intern.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt face value, if the above statement is true, AI is shockingly powerful already.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInterns being human, after all, the suggestion is that it\u0027s equal to a meh human.

I\u0027m genuinely unsure about how one sets off to write a novel. I recall Harlan Ellison explaining how he wrote every day. Treated it like a job, just got up and wrote. He used to write in store windows sometimes and would generate a short story from prompts written on a slip of paper by customers. All I can say is that a year ago when I heard about some of the generative \u0022art\u0022 then messed around a little with midjourney, other than some fun images with their own bizarre \u0022AI art style\u0022 it was fairly lousy. Fast forward a year... and it\u0027s amazingly capable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think in the case of LLMs and text, we\u0027re going to see continuous progress. The South Park, collect underpants, ???, profit meme... I\u0027m not seeing training as some sort of magic here. A number of papers have shown that self-reflection produces better results in LLMs, as does asking it to \u0022think step by step.\u0022 Specific domain training\u2014in this case fantasy writing, and specifically a dataset where humans have labeled works by quality\u2014is a path they could certainly try. If it generated multiple stories on the same prompt, then asked to analyze them, I wonder how it would do? Could it in fact \u0022pick a winner,\u0022 or at least \u0022out of these X stories, which one is likely to be considered the best written?\u0022 Then test with humans (people who have to read the stories). Short stories would be better here, because reading a whole \u0022meh\u0022 fantasy novel is not on my list of things to do, much less a bunch of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I was someone engaged in creative writing or digital art, I\u0027d be pretty concerned, and/or learning these tools to leverage the ability I already had. Not saying the current github linked is that tool for fantasy writing, but looking forward 1, 2, 3 years, who knows?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s say George RR Martin could dump the text of all his published work he considered good in (loads of tokens, his books are long), then asked the model questions about them... Like \u0022in Song of Ice and Fire, are there loose string plots that seem to exist?\u0022 (I can think of a few \u0022Chekhov\u0027s gun\u0022 things I was waiting to see l that just disappeared). With all those works still in the model, ask it to write further chapters. Or ask it to summarize character arcs, then propose where the characters can go from here\u2014keeping all the other characters in mind as they interact with each other. Martin apparently doesn\u0027t work off of an outline, but for this use case, maybe he does, and prompts it with an outline of directions he saw characters going it. Such an experiment would have to be done by an author I think\u2014they could read the output, and have a feel for quality, and \u0022voice\u0022 in a way that I would not (even if some of the output would fool \u003Cem\u003Eme\u003C/em\u003E).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe proof of the puddling will be in the eating. We\u0027ll know what LLMs are capable of in fiction when something gets published that is sufficiently good. I\u0027m old enough to remember when chess was a human intellectual pursuit that computers would never \u0022get,\u0022 then the goalpost moved after computers beat humans, to \u0022of course computers could \u003Cem\u003Ebrute-force\u003C/em\u003E chess.\u0022 Go, OTOH, was far harder... then that fell, and the goalposts move again. \u0022It can make some pictures, but they\u0027re crappy, look at the extra fingers, etc, lol!\u0022 Then models start making photo-realistic images within a few months, and the goalpost moves again. LLM can write some boilerplate novels, but can\u0027t write anything with any emotional underpinning that will engage real readers... until it does.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the thoughtful response \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/119411-tater/?do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022119411\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/119411-tater/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@tater\u003C/a\u003E.

What saves it is \u003Cem\u003Erevision \u003C/em\u003Eand that can involve\u003Cem\u003E\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eripping out and rewriting whole chunks of story,\u00A0 maybe rewriting them multiple times from different perspectives or from different character points of view until you find something that fits. Cutting out the parts that don\u0027t work, expanding on parts that needs more explanation, or that would add to the story, maybe adding totally new material.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI appreciate that the way an LLM produces a story is probably very different but if you want to get an LLM to produce better stories, I would argue that you still need some way of enabling it to identify what makes a better story better.\u00A0 It\u0027s not obvious to me how you do that. To use your example, I don\u0027t see how you\u00A0 get an LLM to pick a winner from a set of short stories generated from the same prompt. If you could, then yes, you could maybe use it to evolve a story by generating drafts from a prompt, then getting it to pick the best draft, generating a new set of drafts from that best draft, etc. etc.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is - how do you define best? What criteria do you give the LLM for picking a winner?\u00A0 How do you direct that evolution to produce an improved\u003Cem\u003E \u003C/em\u003Estory rather than just iterating random drafts on random drafts?\u00A0 Put another way, how do you teach quality and then boil \u0027quality\u0027 down into a set of rules which you could train an LLM on? I\u0027m not sure you can. If quality was an algorithmic process then you could teach it to any aspiring writer.

It was enough to get me started and to get the words flowing but otherwise it wasn\u0027t very satisfactory.\u00A0 Likewise, the end of the story was okay but it needed foreshadowing to turn a rather contrived ass-pull into a reasonable twist. So I put in some bits and pieces of foreshadowing. At which point I realised that I could set the whole thing up via the opening. Better yet, that would give a much more immediate opening which would (hopefully) drop the reader straight into the story, or at least give them an immediate hook to get their attention rather than starting with a fairly waffly few paragraphs. The key thing is that it wasn\u0027t at all obvious to me how to rework the opening, until I had the rest of the first draft down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s the kind of thing I have in mind when I\u0027m talking about making a story better.

The use of simple and accessible language allows readers to easily follow the events and understand the implications of the society depicted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne notable aspect of the writing style is the consistent repetition of certain phrases and ideas. This repetition serves to emphasize the oppressive nature of the society and the characters\u0027 limited thinking abilities. By repeating phrases like \u0022equal every which way\u0022 and \u0022nobody was [superior] than anybody else,\u0022 the author reinforces the monotonous and homogeneous nature of the world, effectively conveying the lack of individuality and freedom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, the author skillfully employs dialogue to reveal the characters\u0027 thoughts and attitudes. Through the conversations between George and Hazel, the reader gains insights into the characters\u0027 perspectives and the consequences of the handicapping system. The dialogue feels natural and reflects the limitations imposed on the characters, with short bursts of conversation and frequent forgetfulness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, one potential criticism of the writing style is the limited development of characters beyond their assigned roles in the story. While George and Hazel are portrayed as average individuals within the society, their personalities and motivations are not deeply explored. Similarly, Harrison, despite his rebellion, is presented more as a symbol of individuality rather than a fully fleshed-out character. This limited character development may leave readers craving a more nuanced understanding of the individuals in this oppressive world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverall, the author\u0027s writing style effectively conveys the dystopian setting and explores the theme of enforced equality.
