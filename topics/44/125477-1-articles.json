[URL=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_protection\u0022]Wiki[/URL], on radiation shielding, says you need 1 centimeter of lead to cut gamma in half. So if the exposure rate off a high end nuclear reaction, enough to roar on engine thrust into orbit, is a lethal dose in 10 seconds 10 meters away, you need to halve it an awful lot of times to get to acceptable dose rates.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd you can\u0026#39;t fly to orbit if you have to have 30 centimeters of lead all the way around you engine. This is especially bad for flying cars, because there is severe danger if you have containment failure (after the aircraft crashes) and you have to shield from all angles because there are people underneath. (I assume you intend for the flying cars to drop people off on rooftops, etc)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nUnless you know something about gamma ray shielding I don\u0026#39;t, it\u0026#39;s one big nope. No way, ever, can humans safely use something like this. Maybe if we were radiation resistant cyborgs with electronic brains that can resist circuitry damage via digital error correction or be replaced when we take radiation damage, but not flesh and blood primates.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFrankly, aneutronic fusion sounds more plausible. The primary reaction doesn\u0026#39;t produce any gamma rays or neutrons at all (side reactions do), and the fuel is hydrogen \u002B boron or hydrogen \u002B lithium. Nothing exotic. Ironically, flying cars and SSTOs still don\u0026#39;t make sense - the fusion reactor, being a big honking pile of superconducting magnets and electric grids and vacuum layers, is too heavy. Power output scales nonlinearly with bigger reactors because your containment systems act on the surface of the fusing plasma, and so larger reactors need proportionally less magnet mass, etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo you might be able to plausibly make a flying ship that could stay airborne for years on engine thrust, but not a flying car. The engines would be superconducting lift fans, and the fusion reaction would produce electricity by collecting it from the moving charged helium atoms that are the main product. Much easier to get power out than from gamma rays, and the conversion apparatus would be much lighter.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYeah, it might resemble the helicarrier, except it would probably be much more lightly built - thin aluminum and lightweight internal structures, not the thick plates of steel and heavy interior construction a naval vessel uses - and the lift fans would have to be proportionally a lot larger. Also, there would need to be at least 8 or more lift fans - especially if you intend to fly for years, as you need to be able to fly with 1-2 of the fans not running.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nStill not an SSTO. To do that, you need to beam power from the ground, using lasers or microwaves. Keep the fusion, fission, or just gas turbines on the ground, leaving the spacecraft light.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-17T08:47:03Z\u0022 title=\u002211/17/2015 08:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SomeGuy12\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T14:59:24Z","Content":"\nGamma is not the easiest to shield from, but it all depends on the energy of particle.
