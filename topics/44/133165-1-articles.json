After reading about the Sabitier Reaction (a very common reaction for ISRU and closed loop systems), I got the idea of extending it to make it more useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, we have the process of respiration. On the Moon, spaceships, spacestations, etc.\u00A0this would be the primary source of CO2. On Mars and Venus, you can extract it from the atmosphere instead, thereby skipping this first step.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, you need to add H2. If you got your O2 from H2O, you can just reinsert that gas back into the reaction. If not, you can get more from step 3\u0027s products, or get more from elsewhere. If you combine the H2 from the orginal electrolysis of waterto get your O2 for respiration, combining it with H2 from the products of step 3 will give you exactly 1 H2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCO2 \u002B 2 H2 (added) -\u0026gt; 2 H2O \u002B CH4. (Sabatier reaction)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird, The H2O can be recycled for reuse, possibly for step 6, which needs H2O. The other product, CH4 can be used for rocket fuel. If not (say if your tanks are full), it has another use... which is where step 3 comes in. With the incomplete prylosis of CH4 (complete prylosis is problematic due to making solid carbon, which has the tendancy to get stuck in places, and clog up) and by adding 1 more molecule of CH4 from step 2, we get this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2CH4 -\u0026gt; C2H2 \u002B 3H2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFourth, the H2 is also recycled, as it\u0027s not important. The C2H2 can be stored or released- but let\u0027s store it. After all, mass=money. It might be worth it for construction and repairs, as a alternative for arc and friction welding, after combining it with O2 gas. Or it might be useful for an additional reaction. Once the C2H2 is\u00A0released, step 5\u00A0can begin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStep 5 involves the synthesis of C2H4 via C2H2 and H2. This is the most unknown process, as I couldn\u0027t find anything on how this might be activated, but I\u0027m going to assume heat and combustion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nC2H2 \u002B H2 = C2H4\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStep 6 involves getting H2O (possibly from step 2\u0027s products), and then using a phosphoric acid catayst adsorbed in silica gel to acid-hydrate the C2H4 into C2H6O\u00A0(a process used to produce ethanol industrially) to make ethanol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nC2H2 \u002B H2O= H6C2O.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylene#Niche_applications\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylene#Niche_applications\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol#Ethylene_hydration\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol#Ethylene_hydration\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabatier_reaction\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabatier_reaction\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe greatest use of ethanol\u00A0is to get drunk in space\u003C/strong\u003E- dilute the ethanol product with water, and you basically have the simplest form of drinking alcohol (ethanol is the active product in alcohol).
