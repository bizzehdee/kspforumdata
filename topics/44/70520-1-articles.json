There are certainly economic principles and general rules that seem to be followed (why economies often behave like ecological systems, but not always). But many of these models are highly contradictory. If you read Keynes and Hayek you read two very different views on how an economy works and how you can best influence or control it. It gets into your politics often which one you think is the most right and there will be very little that someone from the other camp could show you that would get you to change your mind and cause the incorrect one to be sent to the dust bin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the physical sciences we would try to reconcile models and systems that seem to accurately describe the universe proven via data (not computer models, we can make a computer model to spit out whatever we like), but seem to be incompatible, such as we are trying to do with quantum mechanics and Einstein\u0027s theories. All of which are supported by mountains of data and experimentation, but they\u0027re both wrong as they\u0027re incompatible. In economics this seems to not happen, once an economic model or theory is conceived it seems to never die.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEconomics seems to be more about politics and policy prescriptions rather than understanding of systems. From what I can tell there are few testable hypotheses and when future events prove an economic model or prescription a failure it doesn\u0027t go away, it stays as it is as there\u0027s some excuse as to why it doesn\u0027t apply to a given situation, or that next time it will work because this time we didn\u0027t apply it hard enough or absolute enough. That\u0027s not a science.

The latest DSM was met with controversy and for good reason, to the point that it seems that honoring it is optional. If your field\u0027s main diagnostic manual is optional because it\u0027s perceived by so many to be political... that\u0027s a problem.
