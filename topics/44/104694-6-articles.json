A pile of ore isn\u0027t worth much. You need to refine it to get the valuable stuff out. Then you need to get it to market where someone will buy it. Refining ore in space is far beyond our current technological capability (here\u0027s a [link to a brief explanation on how rare earth metals are currently refined](http://www.kitco.com/ind/Kidela/may102011.html)). There is currently no market for rare earth metals in space. Returning unrefined ore from orbit so it can be processed on the ground presents its own problems. Even returning refined rare earth metals and their oxides from orbit isn\u0027t easy, as you\u0027d have to send up empty \u0022re-entry hoppers\u0022 to bring it down.\n\nSure, but water and fuel alone could be a big market. I\u0027m not going to stick my head out too far here, but it seems to me that 1 billion turnover should be possible on that basis alone, even if launch costs drop somewhat and even if lower costs do not lead to more space exploration. For example I think the SLS Block 2 will have an upper stage with room for 100 tons of fuel. If you had a system that could completely refuel that once a year, it would be incredibly valuable, possibly on the scale of a billion dollars, even though it\u0027s hard to put a figure on it. And then there are smaller, commercial satellites that might be launched to LEO, refuelled and then pushed on to GEO with fuel left to spare for deorbiting.\n\nSo yeah, you don\u0027t even have to look at rare earth metals to see there\u0027s a business here... Even if that\u0027s what you talk about when investors are around, if you\u0027re planning to go there. As for making it profitable - I think you can only figure that out by trying it on a small scale. First step is controlling a small asteroid though. How is that done? No one knows for sure right now."},{"CreatedByName":"mardlamock","CreatedById":38972,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T17:06:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Indeed, there was a thread several months ago which touched on this.

Even with the current prices, it only costs around 33K/kg to return cargo from orbit, the current price of gold is at 38k, of course you have to mine it and stuff, but you only need to launch once. If we assume that within the next decade or so the price per kg to launch into orbit gets cut in half, we re looking at a very profitable business (but you\u0027d need a decent chunk of capital to get even remotely started). The price of gold could also go up a lot, as some people are predicting, which would also help boost the profitability. The most important part about the whole process is getting space ore processing and manufacturing working, there are many challenges to be overcome but its not unreasonable to think that within the next few decades it can be solved.\n\u003E Even current gold mining operations are unprofitable for the first couple of years, and they also require millons of dollars to set up.\n\nA geologist ran through a typical gold mining operation cost [here](http://www.resourceinvestor.com/2011/10/11/how-evaluate-gold-deposit-comparing-two-deposits). To recover a gram, a mining operation might have to strip mine, process and refine 2 tons of ore. A terrestrial mining operation makes its money by mining and processing millions of tons of ore per year. Assuming the numbers reflect actual typical values, it looks like costs are about $15 per recovered gram of refined gold. Gold currently is selling for about $50/gram, which means the mine makes, say $35 in profit on every recovered gram. But a space-based operation would have to ship that gold back to the ground, which by your cost quote above is something like $33 per gram. So, assuming you could set up an operation in space, with no gravity, in vacuum, far far far from any power/water/personnel infrastructure to operate at the same cost as a terrestrial facility with nearby infrastructure, you might be able to make $1 per ton of mined ore. Good luck."},{"CreatedByName":"mardlamock","CreatedById":38972,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T17:19:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E A geologist ran through a typical gold mining operation cost [here](http://www.resourceinvestor.com/2011/10/11/how-evaluate-gold-deposit-comparing-two-deposits).

Return on investment would not be that high though, probably around 10%.

Wikipedia tells me that scandium is present in most uranium and rare-earth ores, but it\u0027s not usually worth extracting because demand is so low. Currently less than 500 kg (kg, not tons) of scandium oxide is produced per year, and it\u0027s always produced as a by-product of other operations.

Demand would also rise with lower prices, demand for computers rose when they became more affordable, same with pretty much any other useful product. I think gold is a safer bet for mining, and I believe its a lot more common in asteroids."},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T17:48:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That price must be way off, that is 1/3 of the price of gold per kg.\n\nYes, and?

There\u0027s still plenty to be learned about the moon still. But of course the efforts of ARM are no less important. But the ESA has really been stepping up in huge leaps and bounds over the past decade. So where NASA doesn\u0027t go, ESA most surely will take up the slack. Not to mention the privatization of space. More and more corporate interests are pointing to the stars. This is the way it will eventually go anyway, it\u0027s just a matter of supply and demand before space becomes primarily a corporate/industrial endeavor, with the gov agencies only serving administrative and regulatory needs... probably not in our lifetimes, but eventually. Weyland Industries lol, except hopefully without the homicidal cybernetics and xenomorphs.\n\nThe many direct and indirect benefits of ARM:\n\n[https://www.nasa.gov/content/how-will-nasas-asteroid-redirect-mission-help-humans-reach-mars](https://www.nasa.gov/content/how-will-nasas-asteroid-redirect-mission-help-humans-reach-mars)"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacePsilo","CreatedById":141742,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T10:22:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E [http://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/55226207.jpg](http://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/55226207.jpg)\n\nCompletly agree !\n\nBut it\u0027s true that a travel to the moon, with live conference online with the astronauts on the mun, on youtube, would allow a major improvement on how people react to space travel financing.\n\nIt would also shut down all we didn\u0027t get to the moon theory.\n\nOn a science only goal however it\u0027s pretty useless.\n\nOr why not change the use of the iss to allow it to go orbit the moon?"}]}
