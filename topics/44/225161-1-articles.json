For the most part, shielding\u0027s about either diverting or stopping the particles. The latter scales roughly with how much matter you can put in the way. Earth\u0027s atmosphere is density-equivalent to 10m deep pool of water and blocks about as much radiation, and that\u0027s after the Earth\u0027s magnetic field has a go. Carrying 10 tons of shielding for every square meter you want protected is... well, not entirely unfeasible, but it\u0027s problematic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027re going to need more research on what\u0027s the threshold going to be. We clearly can\u0027t get everything, but neither does Earth\u0027s protection. Somewhere between ISS and Earth there\u0027s a \u0022safe enough\u0022 threshold. And we might be able to help by blocking more of the radiation that\u0027s easy to block. Hard UV, for example, is blocked by a sheet of foil better than by all of Earth\u0027s atmosphere. On the other hand, UV isn\u0027t the thing that was going to damage someone\u0027s kidneys. Next on the list are going to be charged particles. Earth\u0027s magnetic field is kind of wimpy. It acts in volume. We have superconductors. Flying with a tiny Jupiter on your ship will create all sorts of engineering challenges, but it should be safe to the crew.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe protons and other nuclei that are both abundant in the solar wind and dangerous to the crew are going to be in the 1MeV/amu range. Taking worst case scenario on charge (e.g. alpha particles) of 0.5q/amu, this gives cyclotron radius of about 30cm at 1 Tesla. So magnetic shielding isn\u0027t out of the question on basic principles, but that still leaves engineering the system, flying tests, etc. Worst part is that it\u0027s a system that\u0027s hard to both build and test at small scale, and it needs to be flown beyond Earth\u0027s bow shock before we can be properly sure that it\u0027s not going to collapse on an interplanetary voyage. Normally, I\u0027d say we\u0027re two decades if we start working now. The growing evidence that we need it for a flight to Mars might cause people to hurry it up, but we have to start gearing up for tests now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, if we\u0027re trying to combine shielding with centrifuge, the complexity skyrockets. (And it was bad already.) Here we have a modicum of good news. Recent research strongly suggests that while untrained individuals do poorly in AG environments above 2rpm, almost anybody can be acclimated to up to 20rpm. This brings the centrifuge radius requirement from 250m radius (half a kilometer in diameter!) which is viable only in a tethered configuration, which sucks for both magnetic and bulk shielding options, down to merely 2.5m, which means an entire centrifuge could fit inside a Skylab workshop.

Obviously, the applicability of said test is very limited for a long list of reasons. And yet, let nobody say it\u0027s never been done!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr, I guess, more relevant to the future missions, Starship\u0027s 9m hull can easily fit a small centrifuge inside its cargo compartment. Given all the other equipment that has to be brought, space is going to be at a premium, but if, say, a 3m section of it can be dedicated to the living quarters, with floor diameter probably ending up closer to 4m from center, you can have sleeping cots at floor level, where you\u0027d probably have full 1g, and standing up, your head would be down to about 0.5g. That might not be enough to fully remove negative effects of low g on your eyes, but it\u0027s not catastrophic even at 0g for a year, so hopefully good enough? And you can have slightly better conditions sitting down to do any computer work. This would bring centrifuge speed to 15rpm, or a quarter of a revolution per second. Not terribly fast, slow enough to go to the center transfer ring by ladder, and for the crew to use hand grabs to cancel/start their rotation. The transfer tubes to enter the nose or aft storage would have to be pretty narrow to reduce air drag, but they can still easily be similar in size to ISS connectors, making them easy enough to navigate and bring equipment through. The nose section can have the jump-seats for the takeoff and landing portions of the flight, research equipment for use in flight, as well any lighter cargo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith this sort of the configuration, you can have the engines, a significant amount of fuel on the outbound leg, and most of your heavier cargo/equipment serving as part of the bulk shielding from the solar radiation. Slightly thicker foil on outer wall, and floor of the centrifuge would have to be enough for most of the rest. Toroidal magnetic shield a few meters outside the centrifuge would help reduce effects from radiation coming from the sides reducing the work the ship\u0027s walls and centrifuge wall have to do. This won\u0027t be enough to bring the background to Earth levels, but it\u0027d be way better than what the ISS is averaging. Hopefully, that\u0027s enough, but a lot of test and engineering needs to go into it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously, a mission like what I\u0027m describing is not even close to what Elon\u0027s pitching. It will require a better built Spaceship with a lot of very expensive interior and exterior hardware, as well as several pieces of equipment that have to be engineered and proven to work. But also, I haven\u0027t been very optimistic about the promises for cheap flights to Mars both on general principles and based on previous promises from the same people. Nonetheless, I do suspect that Starship and Super Heavy will have to converge on something functional due to being critical to Artemis in its current plan, so the ship and the rocket will likely be available, with the rest to be filled in at the later time. If some of the relevant research is fast-tracked, 2040\u0027s is still a realistic goal.

So magnetic shielding isn\u0027t out of the question on basic principles, but that still leaves engineering the system, flying tests, etc. Worst part is that it\u0027s a system that\u0027s hard to both build and test at small scale, and it needs to be flown beyond Earth\u0027s bow shock before we can be properly sure that it\u0027s not going to collapse on an interplanetary voyage. Normally, I\u0027d say we\u0027re two decades if we start working now. The growing evidence that we need it for a flight to Mars might cause people to hurry it up, but we have to start gearing up for tests now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, if we\u0027re trying to combine shielding with centrifuge, the complexity skyrockets. (And it was bad already.) Here we have a modicum of good news. Recent research strongly suggests that while untrained individuals do poorly in AG environments above 2rpm, almost anybody can be acclimated to up to 20rpm. This brings the centrifuge radius requirement from 250m radius (half a kilometer in diameter!) which is viable only in a tethered configuration, which sucks for both magnetic and bulk shielding options, down to merely 2.5m, which means an entire centrifuge could fit inside a Skylab workshop. (And in fact, it sort of has...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022#\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/a\u003E \u003Cspan\u003EReveal hidden contents\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTimestamped to the relevant section.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022150\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/S_p7LiyOUx0?start=23\u0026amp;feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022Classic NASA Film - Skylab - #4\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is, as far as I\u0027m aware, the only real test of humans acting in artificial gravity on an orbital station. Obviously, the applicability of said test is very limited for a long list of reasons.

Given all the other equipment that has to be brought, space is going to be at a premium, but if, say, a 3m section of it can be dedicated to the living quarters, with floor diameter probably ending up closer to 4m from center, you can have sleeping cots at floor level, where you\u0027d probably have full 1g, and standing up, your head would be down to about 0.5g. That might not be enough to fully remove negative effects of low g on your eyes, but it\u0027s not catastrophic even at 0g for a year, so hopefully good enough? And you can have slightly better conditions sitting down to do any computer work. This would bring centrifuge speed to 15rpm, or a quarter of a revolution per second. Not terribly fast, slow enough to go to the center transfer ring by ladder, and for the crew to use hand grabs to cancel/start their rotation. The transfer tubes to enter the nose or aft storage would have to be pretty narrow to reduce air drag, but they can still easily be similar in size to ISS connectors, making them easy enough to navigate and bring equipment through. The nose section can have the jump-seats for the takeoff and landing portions of the flight, research equipment for use in flight, as well any lighter cargo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith this sort of the configuration, you can have the engines, a significant amount of fuel on the outbound leg, and most of your heavier cargo/equipment serving as part of the bulk shielding from the solar radiation. Slightly thicker foil on outer wall, and floor of the centrifuge would have to be enough for most of the rest. Toroidal magnetic shield a few meters outside the centrifuge would help reduce effects from radiation coming from the sides reducing the work the ship\u0027s walls and centrifuge wall have to do. This won\u0027t be enough to bring the background to Earth levels, but it\u0027d be way better than what the ISS is averaging. Hopefully, that\u0027s enough, but a lot of test and engineering needs to go into it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously, a mission like what I\u0027m describing is not even close to what Elon\u0027s pitching. It will require a better built Spaceship with a lot of very expensive interior and exterior hardware, as well as several pieces of equipment that have to be engineered and proven to work. But also, I haven\u0027t been very optimistic about the promises for cheap flights to Mars both on general principles and based on previous promises from the same people. Nonetheless, I do suspect that Starship and Super Heavy will have to converge on something functional due to being critical to Artemis in its current plan, so the ship and the rocket will likely be available, with the rest to be filled in at the later time.

Your typical interplanetary transfer is in tens of km/s. A 2RPM rotation involves a rotation around a point 250m from the center of mass (this can be more or less than 500m of cable, depending on your counterweight, naturally) and has velocity w.r.t. combined \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E of only 50m/s. This is\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ewell within\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the mid-course correction burns you\u0027ll be doing anyways. Likewise, loss of gravity, while disorienting, is about as dangerous as riding on a drop tower at an amusement park. You do still have the spin of the rocket itself, but it\u0027s likely to be a fairly stable rotation and the resulting centrifugal effects will be minor enough for this to be at worst comparable to a slip-and fall on flat ground. You can never exclude a risk of injury in any sort of a fall, but you can also slam your hand closing a hatch, so you know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is a real risk is the cable snap-back. Back of an envelope estimate, a lot of materials you\u0027d consider for a cable would stretch by about ~10% before failing. You want a good safety margin, so you\u0027re probably going to be looking at a little less than 5%. Call it a 10m stretch from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, where the cable\u0027s most likely to snap. A fully-fueled Starship is 5kT, which means you\u0027re looking at 1/2 * 50MN * 10m = 250MJ of energy stored in the cables. It\u0027s not a LOT, but it\u0027s enough to get the tip of the cable flying at you at a decent speed. (Yes, I know the energy is split between multiple cables, but so is the mass of the cable you have to get moving...) With a very rough estimate of 20T of cables in there, you\u0027d get something like 50m/s average speed, but the tip is likely to be traveling closer to the speed of a bullet. The odds of that tip hitting the ship are not zero, and it will absolutely slice clean through.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are safety measures you can take. The tension wave will propagate at the speed of sound through steel, which is on the order of a few km/s. That technically gives you enough delay for emergency severing of the cable. If you put accelerometers everywhere along the length of the cable, you can cut all the cables from the ship, causing both ends to snap together instead, resulting in very low chance of any part of the cable hitting the ship with significant velocity. You obviously want this system to be rock solid, but what emergency system isn\u0027t? And we are looking after a catastrophic failure, which is very unlikely to begin with. We build suspension bridges using essentially the same tech.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of that said, when people talk about testing a centrifuge on ISS, people do talk about small radius centrifuge. As mentioned earlier in this thread, we do now have strong evidence that even a sub-5m radius centrifuge is viable for artificial gravity with a trained crew. Especially if you don\u0027t mind ramping up the speed over a few days when the trip starts, and winding it down on arrival. And that is an entirely different structure. Something with a revolution period of about 4 seconds and compact enough to fit in the inner hull of the Starship. If we\u0027re going to see artificial gravity on a trip to Mars, that is far more viable than any tethered design. And it\u0027s also something we can comfortably test on the ISS with very reasonable expense. I mean, it\u0027s still a full sized module requiring some amount of orbital assembly with current launchers, but again, if we\u0027re looking at testing this for interior of a Starship, the best way to test it would be to assemble one within the Starship, dock it to ISS, and just keep it docked for a few months. What better proof of Starship\u0027s capability to take a crew to Mars could you possibly ask for?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
