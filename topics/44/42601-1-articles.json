Testing will simulate the recovery of NASA\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Orion Spacecraft in the Pacific Ocean during the Exploration Flight Test-1 (EFT-1) mission in the fall of 2014. EFT-1 will be Orion\u0027s first mission and will see the uncrewed spacecraft launch 3,600 miles into Earth\u0027s orbit. After the test flight, Orion will return to Earth at a speed of approximately 20,000 mph for a landing and recovery in the Pacific Ocean.
