I believe that a given capsule might be 1.5cm by 1.5cm, maybe with a depth of 1.5cm. In a ring formation we can fit quite a few in if we want. We definitely want at least 3, ideally in multiples of 3. This is because we can breed moss that grows away from gravity (up, or in this case inward), toward gravity (down, or outward), or perpendicular to gravity (sideways, or spinward/antispinward/left/right). For every multiple of 3, we can have redundant samples of a given type.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENewt: You misunderstand the purpose of the ring. The ring is not to act as the centrifuge itself. The ring stays still relative to the cubesat unless we need to point the cameras at a different moss capsule. So if it is just sitting in a growth cycle and nothing is happening, the ring is spinning at zero RPM relative to the cubesat because the servo is off. (Meaning if the cubesat is moving at 5 RPM, then so is the ring). But now we need to take a picture of a given sample, and it isn\u0027t the one the cameras are looking at right now. So the ring rotates to move the samples in front of the cameras. Now, you do bring up that this will change the rate at which the sat is rotating depending on which direction we turn. But this is not a big deal because of equal and opposites. Example: For simplicity of the example, we will declare the ring to weigh the same as the rest of the cubesat. We need to see a sample 180 degrees away, so we start the ring spinning at 1RPM clockwise. Because the two weigh the same, this means that the ring will be spinning at 0.5RPM clockwise, and the sat is now spinning faster/slower by 0.5RPM counterclockwise. But now 30 seconds later the moss is in the right position, so we need to stop the ring. We do this by applying the opposite force. So this brings the ring to 0RPM clockwise and the sat is now faster/slower by 0RPM counterclockwise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is important because it means any time that we are spinning the sample ring, the cubesat itself will be spinning faster/slower depending on the direction of the ring-spin. Therefor the system that determines our RPM is going to have to realize that this is happening and either ignore it or fight it. Someone should do some calculations on this, because I\u0027m struggling to do it in my head here at work, but other than the jarring from the servo accelerating up and down, will the force on the moss be constant? Instinctively it feels like after the cubesat is at the RPM for say 0.1Gs, then as long as the servo is rotating the ring at a constant speed, the forces should equal out, causing the moss to STILL feel only 0.1Gs. But this instinct also has the feeling of being wrong about that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless, the actual changes in gravity will be rather minute and short-lived, so if there IS an imbalance across the time the ring is rotating position, then we likely don\u0027t care to burn the energy needed in the torquers to keep the gravity constant. But maybe if we are efficient enough with power then we do?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Newt","CreatedById":131025,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-08T22:51:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is essential to look at how these things will all work together, though. Mr0nak raises a good point in that we should be well, a little more down to earth. All of the parts will interact, and if we at least had a basic sketch of what the hypothetical satellite looks like, how big everything should be inside of it, and a ballpark guess of what it will mass, that would keep things a bit more in perspective, and keep us from wandering too far from possibility. Maybe it can even give us some ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would be willing to try to put together a model of all of this, but really do not know if there is enough decided on at this point.

I had the page open for a while, and got somewhat lost in what was being said while I was not pressing f5. Still trying to sort out all the order.... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding gforce changes during camera spin, it was said that we would probably be spinning very fast (more than 50RPM). At .05m radius, at 50RPM, we should have about 1.37ms^-2, at 51RPM, 1.426ms^-2. Not too much difference, but worth noting. Also, as has been mentioned, we can take our time taking pictures and swiveling the camera, so 1RPM might be excessive. If you are refering to just the speed increase for the ring, my understanding is that the ring will be affected by the satellite rotation. But again, we are usually in no hurry to orient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne issue I just thought of was that of our Center of Mass.

Most of the cost comes from the PLACEHOLDER parts, which we most probably will replace with regular, more than order of magnitude cheaper components. Even if we have to buy the solar panels, there is a chance we need not that many of them. I believe K^2 said he will calculate the total power needed for heating, but he seems to be occupied. My own back of the envelope calculations show we need only 3 watt max if we want to heat the entire cube, which translates into 6 watt of solar panels. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally think that we can send the bird flying for cca $20 000 \u002B launch cost.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technion","CreatedById":85380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-14T09:40:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MBobrik\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MBobrik\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E Raspbery Pi compute module, weight 7 g\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre there thoughts on how you would power that?

If we heat and insulate only the samples and batteries, and keep the rest of the sat at say -10 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C heating requirements will drop to less than 2 W. And maximum cube projection area is, I believe sqrt(3) * one side, which would give us 3.5 watt with 3 non-foldable panels. But that would require the sat to rotate around its diagonal, which is awkward at best. And is a waste of panel efficiency. So I too think that the unfolding the panels will be unavoidable.
