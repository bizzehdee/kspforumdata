Let\u0027s say I have to launch for a specific polar orbit, from my experience, if I launch at 92 or 95\u00B0 (a little \u0027backwards to cancel the body rotation boost)\u00A0when I\u0027m just below the orbital plane, I get a final orbit that is anywhere from 2 to 10\u00B0 of inclination with said orbit (depending on the vehicle performance). I have to launch a little earlier to get a closer orbit, but how much earlier? Normally I just eyeball it a little earlier and correct the inclination after. But that\u0027s not optimal nor good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help is appreciated!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Mods: I posted it here and not on the Gameplay Questions and Tutorails thread because it relates as well to science and space flight, but please, move if it fits better there! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
