That may be because they are green. Plants are green because they have chloroplast in them which has green pigment in it. I am saying that Kerbals then probably have chloroplast in them, which absorbs light and makes sugar for mitochondria to turn into energy. (BTW i just gave you the entire first lesson of a 7th grade textbook in a sentence, meh? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E) This would probably let a kerbal live in space forever, assuming water is available. Oh wait, if Kerbals need water, then they can\u0027t stay there FOREVER! They could run out of water! And they also need CO2 for glucose production, so there can be no way I see to get what Kerbals need to survive. This is where YOU come in. YOU get to figure out a way to forever live in space undoubtedly like the scientist did many muns ago. This topic may become irrelevant in future updates, so if you find this in some archives or in the bowels of the Science Labs, then don\u0027t worry or care about it, like many other things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-10T03:59:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey have a rare, benign virus, named Gamicus Unfinishus.
