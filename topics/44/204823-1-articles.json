Some very\u00A0smart people at Niels Bohr Institute calculated that around 2037 we will be able to observe it going kablooey yet again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://phys.org/news/2021-09-astronomers-supernova-timesand-fourth-sighting.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://phys.org/news/2021-09-astronomers-supernova-timesand-fourth-sighting.html\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI find it amazing that they were (presumably) able to figure out the structure of matter so far away to be able to calculate the path of light.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI propose we get busy and build a whole bunch of dedicated space telescopes, bigger than anything ever built and launch them quickly into space to observe the big boom from the start. Just how often we get to predict a star is going to go supernova with such accuracy?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HvP","CreatedById":146104,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-13T18:50:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was aware that observations of gravitational lensing and light echoes had been used to map the distribution of matter surrounding interesting phenomena.
