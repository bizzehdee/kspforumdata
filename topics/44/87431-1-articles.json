And I\u0027m really stoked about whhat it might find there, too. It is however not a true \u003Cem\u003Ereplacement\u003C/em\u003E for what Hubble is currently doing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJWST is an exclusively infrared telescope. It can barely even peek into the red-orange quarter of the vsisible spectrum at best. By comparison, Hubble can do the entire spread from infrared across visible into ultraviolet. It has a far broader range of applications, while JWST is relatively focused. I have no doubt that it will walk all over Hubble\u0027s achievements in the infrared spectrum, but there are some things it just cannot do. A new wide-spectrum, super-versatile orbital telescope would be a more fitting, spiritual successor to Hubble, even if it wasn\u0027t quite as extremely powerful in any specific spectrum as JWST is in infrared. For all of its age, Hubble telescope time is still an extremely hotly contested resource in the scientific community, so I\u0027m sure there\u0027s plenty of work available to keep both JWST and such a high-versatililty telescope busy around the clock. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIronically, Hubble cost well over 9 billion dollars to build, launch, repair and upgrade over time.
