For this example, the position of Venus does not matter, as aerobraking will work at either of those speeds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEarth should be at apoapsis, because in this case we want to lose, rather than gain, velocity as Venus is in a lower orbit than Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s begin. First, the velocity of Earth around the Sun at apoapsis. We don\u0027t really need to calculate this, as it is well known: 29290 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe transfer orbit is an elliptical orbit with its apoapsis at Earth\u0027s apoapsis, and its periapsis at Venus\u0027 apoapsis (I think this gives the lowest delta-v). This gives a semi-major axis of:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Radius of Earth\u0027s orbit at departure\u00A0\u002B Radius of Venus\u0027 orbit at arrival)/2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr (152.1 * 10^9 m\u00A0\u002B 108.94 * 10^9 m)/2 = 130.52 * 10^9 m.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVelocity at apoapsis:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nv^2 = 1.327 * 10^20 (2/152.1 * 10^9\u00A0- 1/130.52 * 10^9)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nv = 26985.2 m/s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVelocity at periapsis:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nv^2 = 1.327 * 10^20 (2/108.94 * 10^9\u00A0- 1/130.52 * 10^9)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nv = 37676.3 m/s\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe velocity of the spaceship in Earth orbit can be calculated from the altitude, and the altitude is as low as possible to take maximum advantage of the Oberth effect.

We subtract because we need to lose velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut now it seems like we have too\u00A0slow an orbit even before the escape burn, which seems unlikely to me.

For one thing you have to get to escape velocity, and C3=0 basically puts you into the same orbit as Earth, give or take a bit. You have to escape Earth first, then subtract leftover velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you have to be going about 11 km/s. Subtract 7784 m/s, and you get the delta v to just get to a solar orbit that is close to Earth\u0027s. Now you have to add the remainder. At transfer apoapsis, velocity is about 27 km/s, but you have a velocity (Earth\u0027s) of 29.29 km/s. Subtract these and you get the next amount.... assuming that it\u0027s that simple.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-01T00:02:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHyperbolic excess velocity is what\u0027s killing you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically you can\u0027t add your orbital velocity around a body to the body\u0027s orbital velocity around its star to obtain your velocity around the star, because you need to escape the gravity well of the planet first. What you need to do is add your orbital velocity when you have escaped the planet\u0027s gravitational influence, ie: at infinity, which is exactly what the hyperbolic excess velocity (HEV)\u00A0is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example: if you reach exactly escape velocity around your planet, your HEV will be equal to zero: you will escape the planet\u0027s influence but you will have exactly zero energy left to alter your interplanetary trajectory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nComputing the HEV is quite simple, it is given by:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EHEV\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0= v\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0- v\u003Csub\u003Ee\u003C/sub\u003E\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere v is your orbital velocity and v\u003Csub\u003Ee\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0the escape velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor your example the velocity of the Earth around the Sun is 29290 m/s and the velocity at the apoapsis of your transfer orbit is 26985 m/s, this means that your HEV will be equal to 2305 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA circular orbit at 200km has an orbital velocity of 7784 m/s. By definition, the escape velocity at that altitude is the circular orbital velocity times\u00A0\u221A2, then v\u003Csub\u003Ee\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0= 11008 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom the equation above, your orbital velocity at 200km after your escape burn will be:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nv\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0= HEV\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0\u002B v\u003Csub\u003Ee\u003C/sub\u003E\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0= 2305\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0\u002B 11008\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nv = 11246 m/s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis means that your escape burn will be about 3462 m/s, or about only 250 m/s over the escape velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks to the Earth\u0027s gravity well giving you tons of gravitational energy, a 3462 m/s burn in Earth orbit is equivalent to a ejection burn of about 3200 m/s in orbit\u00A0plus a 2300 m/s burn once you\u0027ve escaped Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn your original reasoning, besides neglecting HEV, you\u0027ve also assumed that the 7784 m/s of orbital velocity you have at 200 km would be translated into a 7784 m/s difference in orbital velocity once you\u0027ve escaped the Earth. Thing is you forgot to account for the fact that you are loosing speed as you get away from the Earth because the latter is pulling you towards it: you\u0027re fighting against gravity so you change kinetic energy (speed) to potential energy (distance to Earth). Eventually you\u0027re only left with the HEV which is the important number to consider for interplanetary transfers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(In reality things will be a bit off because you\u0027re never getting infinitely far away from the Earth: you remain at a given distance from it, but its gravitational effect on you\u00A0becomes smaller as you get far away because the Sun has a greater influence on you.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-01T00:15:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh, that makes sense.
