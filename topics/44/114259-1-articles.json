It\u0027s literally cheaper to just randomly plop down a new building than figuring out how to properly dispose of old stuff. Also, back then, when the Soviet government said \u0022do not spend any more money on this\u0022, then you did not spend any more money on it, period. You spent completely different money on something completely different."},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T17:59:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Perhaps they forgot to hit New Craft.
