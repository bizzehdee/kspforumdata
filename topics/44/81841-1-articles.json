The maximum speed of the endpoints is limited by the strength of the cable material and the safety factor it is designed for.\u003Cp\u003EThe purpose of the Bolo is to either speed up, or slow down, a spacecraft that docks with it without using any of the spacecraft\u0027s onboard propellant and to change the spacecraft\u0027s orbital flight path. Effectively, the Bolo acts as a reusable upper stage for any spacecraft that docks with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe momentum imparted to the spacecraft by the Bolo is not free. In the same way that the Bolo changes the spacecraft\u0027s momentum and direction of travel, the Bolo\u0027s orbital momentum and rotational momentum is also changed, and this costs energy that must be replaced. The idea is that the replacement energy would come from a more efficient and lower cost source than a chemical rocket motor. Two possible lower cost sources for this replacement energy are an ion propulsion system, or an electrodynamic tether propulsion system that would be part of the Bolo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-16T00:56:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt you spin the reaction wheel one way the station spins the other. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBetter to use an tether, as in long cable connecting the satellite and station so you don\u0027t have to spin so fast. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever its no free lunch, you station would loose speed as the satellite gain speed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing a many kilometer long cable you don\u0027t need the spin but can simply use tidal forces, one idea for space stations was to lower a space shuttle some km below it on a cable and release it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would reduce the speed of shuttle and deorbit it while the station was lifted, would work well with the heavy space shuttle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMain issue is the cable weight, you might get problems with the winding or mechanism and most serious, stretch in cable would having the connector at the end coming back fast.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peadar1987","CreatedById":81207,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-16T16:43:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s completely feasible, and in fact, I wrote my Masters\u0027 Dissertation on an aspect of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a good paper on it: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.tethers.com/papers/cislunaraiaapaper.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.tethers.com/papers/cislunaraiaapaper.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe could build such a system, and build it relatively easily without any major advances in technology, we just don\u0027t currently have any reason to do so!

Reaction wheels are good for satellites that need to make tiny, very precise adjustments to their position without using propellant, not so much for something with a whole bunch of momentum. It\u0027s better to throw out the reaction wheel and use whatever system you\u0027re using to desaturate the wheel to directly boost the tether\u0027s speed.

To charge the \u0027wheel\u0027, just use a generic motor(one helluva strong one), and reverse the charge direction to slow down instead. As for the amount of energy required, I\u0027ll do the math I know. A one ton payload requires two tons to be launched in each direction(you\u0027d need a strong wheel, as so the forces don\u0027t rip it in pieces). Say you wanted to launched this one-ton payload at... 10 KM/s relative to the wheel. Since the velocity of one the objects is our angular velocity, we need to get a net torque on the wheel of some large amount(torque is always confusing for me, we need a math guy to analyze this better). As mentioned earlier, the other part of the launching craft would rotate opposite. How do we fix this? I saw in an Artificial Gravity video by HOCGaming a while back, that you can have a wheel on the opposite side in the opposite direction. You\u0027d need the same mass for the payloads. You would likely want the wheels to be slightly tilted back, as so the two forward payloads DO NOT collide, but the two behind do(?).
