I\u0027ll try to put that in perspective. There\u0027s this term called \u0022acceptable casualties\u0022. Military planners use it routinely because they take it as a given that some of their troops are going to die while accomplishing their objectives; after all, the enemy is trying to kill them.

Take driving cars for example. Even with all the safety features of modern cars and tougher DWI laws, still somewhere around 30-40 THOUSAND people get killed every year in wrecks on US highways. Until recently, it was like 50,000 people. Every. Single. Year. Think about that number. It took the VC and NVA a whole 10 years to kill that many US troops in Viet Nam, and they were trying as hard as they could, whereas wrecks are almost all accidents. But does this carnage stop people from getting in their cars every day? No. Why not? Because the casualty rate for drivers, appalling though it may be, doesn\u0027t outweigh the convenience, even necessity, of driving a car. Thus, the level of casualties is acceptable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the same goes for everything else. Workers in mines, oilfields, farms, and all the industries that manufacture, maintain, and transport every single consumer good get killed or maimed all the time, but we don\u0027t feel bad enough about this to stop buying those products. Or stop using the buildings where construction workers got killed. Or even working in any of these industries ourselves. And if we do work in such industries, the last thing we want is for people to stop buying our stuff because then we\u0027d be out of a job. So all this carnage is also \u0022acceptable\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow sure, these days there are shelves full of safety regulations published by organizations like OSHA, NIOSH, etc., intended to minimize casualties. But the very fact that it took bigtime special-interest lobbying to get such organizations created and charged with improving safety shows how \u0022acceptable\u0022 industrial casualties are to the general public, because the general public simply doesn\u0027t care. If it had, the safety regulations would have been in place from the get-go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBottom line is, everything around us is built on human blood, from the nations we live in to the shoes on our feet. But we cheerfully accept this. In fact, we accept these casualties so easily that we don\u0027t even think about them until tragedy strikes home. And even then we accept those as the cost of doing business, or just fate or bad luck, and keep on as before. Given this, why should we feel any differently towards animals?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
