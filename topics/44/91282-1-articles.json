In practice, gains start getting insignifficant pretty fast. But this \u0022infinite bell\u0022 approach lets you compute the absolute maximum I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E that a particular fuel mixture can have. Simply find the amount of heat produced, and assume that every molecule of exhaust has equal energy. Then compute total impulse per mass of material. If you do this for real fuels, you\u0027ll find that this maximum is somewhat optimistic. (I believe, it works out to well over 500s for LH2/LOX. Don\u0027t feel like doing the math right now.) The main reason is that exhaust does not have time to fully thermalize between the degrees of freedom, and that\u0027s because practical limitations requrie one to cut the nozzle short. Of course, there is some turbulence and drag as well that reduce efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOperation in atmosphere is a different story. Not only extending bell past certain cutoff doesn\u0027t give you extra thrust, but it actually reduces it.
