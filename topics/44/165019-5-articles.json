Examples are not entirely lacking, however. We have fossilized prey dinosaurs with healed wounds made by\u00A0\u003Cem\u003ET. rex\u003C/em\u003E, including one case where the . . . . . .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the question is being asked is a correct question but one that can be replaced by a better question . . .how likely is it that T. rex is only a predator. From predators to herbivores . . . the entire spectrum. How common is it when looking at all animals that we find animals that only eat what they kill. If you do this you find that the only examples pertain to certain lineages, for example snakes generally won\u0027t eat something they did not kill. If you put a rat and a rattlesnake in a cage, and the rat bites the snake, the snake may envenom the rat, but if he does not eat it soon after, he just leaves it and waits for the next rat to be thrown in. As you move into the warm-blooded animals that are social, they tend to have higher learned behaviors, these behaviors allow them to learn for example to create a learned behavior that when something is this level of dead, you can eat it, and beyond that level of decay you leave it. Most mammalian carnivores practice this and most birds also practice this to some degrees (I\u0027ve seen bald eagles chomping down on dead cows). Crocodiles, Birds, Mammals, Turtles for the peak predators all practice this. So the question based on the dinosaur lineages and based on the their dentate, etc how likely is it that the were strict carnivores in the sense that they never scavenged. The answer is that it is not very likely, but still possible.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere are some scenarios, T rex might have had a community of other animals that followed it, potentially indicators species (like the honey-catcher, humans and lions of Gujarat) where the indicator informs the hunter this is the prey, he kills, eats the choice bits, his entourage eats the rest, he moves on. This is just an example where the waste works, in the case of farmers its to their benefit the lions kill as many competitors as possible, even if they don\u0027t eat them. Another situation is that he kills, the offspring eat the remains, and he/she moves to the next prey, and since the offspring could be endangered by claim-jumping other kills, then the hunter then just quickly moves from kill to kill and leaves a trail of partially dead bodies. So there are potential examples were T.rex only killed or at a certain stage of life only kills (but at another stage of life only eats what other T.rex have killed). So there are complex reasons why they might or might not have killed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe have to look at pre-KT as a sort of \u0027other-earth\u0027 in that the smaller organisms were more accessory, this system evolved over 100Ms of years and so trend in the inter-species interactions between apex predators and the system may have been evolved, complex and advanced but with an Achilles heal, the ability both to survive the social advances in mammals and the effects of a catastrophe. The dinosaurs did survive in a genetic context, but the apex predators did not, that component was completely eliminated and replaced. We really cannot, today look backwards with any reasonable certainty and estimate the complexities of these interactions. So that its best to generalize, for example T. rex was a meat eater that commonly killed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-25T16:53:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223277529\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022165019\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221516896251\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022147869\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sh1pman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n41 minutes ago, sh1pman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re a hulking tower of meat made mostly of muscle like T-Rex, you need \u003Cem\u003Ea lot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of energy just to keep\u00A0your body functioning.

So that anyone who proposes an extreme hypothesis without also providing the evidence of that extreme hypothesis is by default, debunked. \u003Cstrong\u003EYou really don\u0027t want to get me started on paleontology\u003C/strong\u003E, i can shred the science of 40 ago into pieces without breaking a sweat. Only arguments that scientifically holistic in the approach have meaning. For example human paleoanthropology before genetics and serious climate modeling and a whole bunch of physics (essentially before 1980) was bunk, and people made alot of money selling bunk. Many popular theories are now in the garbage bin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-25T17:26:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223277565\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022165019\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221516899576\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157695\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sevenperforce\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n27 minutes ago, sevenperforce said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, yes.

You could, with enough DNA same create a few woolly mammoths. In my work we found that some SNPs in gene deserts 100,000s of nucleotides from any know genes had meta-analysis confirmation, its not clear how they are meaningful.

If you converted an Asiatic elephant embryo into a woolly mammoth it would still be an Asiatic elephant until you produced enough to create a breeding population, Again the DNA technologies (CrispR) to allow the sensing and recombinant replacement of nucleotide sequence you could get back to a woolly mammoths and it would no longer be an Asiatic elephant even at the level of random drift. If you did this sampling enough ancient DNA you cold create a viable population of individuals and you could continue to use CrispR to add variation (e.g. add elephant variation to MHC genes). The woolly mammoths would not have innate immunity to diseases over the last 10,000 years so you would have to create vaccines and immunize them for every thing they might contact.

If you want a brief outline, and it really comes no where close to giving the topic justice is the typology issue. In terms of non-human hominid species typology was a horrifically overstated case (meaning specifically defined was a definition lacking substance) but has improved. In this structure we place the Earth into a manifold by which all surface points are laid out in two dimension and a third dimension is time, and we roll this out from about 6 mya to the onset of the middle eastern Neolithic (lets say 12 kya, even though in principle since the ME neolithic begins all neolithics its hard to define). Then as we cross a barrier between 2.3 and 1.8 million years ago (the hominims) a putative genus (a significant one, as opposed to potentially trivial species like \u003Cem\u003Eboisei, robustus,\u003C/em\u003E (as opposed to \u003Cem\u003Eparaanthrops\u003C/em\u003E) and later \u003Cem\u003Eaustralopithiforms\u003C/em\u003E) homo arises . There in lies the problem as Erectines (homo ergaster strictu sensu) spread from Africa into Asia. Following this groups and tolerating some interbreeding with australopiths we get basically a partially representative structure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo here is the problem, some of these structures intermixed, some for only brief periods of time and some almost never (meaning leaky species barrier). We being good scientist presume that we do not know all of these, but we know enough to make some conclusion that there was a multihominim world. There is no real genetic understanding of this since humans are geographically isolated and the samples of ADNA must be less than 100,000 years. The problem with this report is that these numbers are well before 100,000 years. So I am going to give a timeline of the origin of homo sapiens sapiens. At the beginning of a time manifold about 250,000 years ago homo sapiens would fall into the category of archaic \u003Cem\u003Ehomo sapiens \u003C/em\u003Ewhich applies to almost all homo living in africa at the time. It share traits with Neanderthals and other traits uncommon in Neanderthals and modern humans. By 235,000 years ago the SSA component entered a bottle neck, in which it emerged within 50 to 100ky, so by the time 170 ky come along, and there are studies in Africa suggesting the population ebbed and flow, at this time there are still a large number of primitive traits in human. From that period on the human population only grew slowly up until about 80 kya. The genetics gives a kind of neat answer and currently both mtDNA and Y chromosomal studies are in pretty strong agreement at the inflection point in the branching we have homo sapiens sapiens. HLA studies suggest two centers of expansion in Africa, one from Central (Cameroon, CAR, N. Congo) and East Africa. The dominance of traits among click speakers at the core of these regions testifies to the driving forces of modernization many of these populations are gracile and short stature, which makes sense for a survival perspective in confined population living in an equitorial region.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo then we have to ask the question what is going on in Africa, and that is very much more complex. To start, there is, after 170 kya,\u00A0 no single species Africa population that actually works. According to Paabo, although the timeline of isolation goes back before 500ky, there has been some admixture in the intermediate times, and there is a perfect candidate for this, the N.African Levantine Neanderthal population. The problem, a non-trivial one, has been distinguishing the southward (but still in the northern hemisphere) 2-D\u002Btime construct of that population over time, no such boundary can be defined. And its not because of the lack of fossils, its because in the time between 200 kya and 20 kya such clear distinctions cannot be made. So one possible theory here is that you had \u003Cem\u003EHomo sapiens sapiens\u003C/em\u003E, \u003Cem\u003EHomo sapiens sapiens\u003C/em\u003E x \u003Cem\u003Eneandertalensis\u003C/em\u003E (southern), \u003Cem\u003EHomo sapiens neandertalensis\u003C/em\u003E (southern; Levanatine Neanderthals) \u003Cem\u003EHomo sapiens neandertalensis\u003C/em\u003E, \u003Cem\u003EHomo sapiens neandertalenis\u003C/em\u003E (Desanova), Homo floresiensis, Homo erectus (\u0026amp; subspecies) in which the modes of each population does not intermix but the peripheral of some populations do. For example Desanova, although largely archaic homo sapiens carries a presumably erectine mtDNA and does have non-Neanderthal/non-human DNA (whereas the contribution of Desanovan-like peoples to Indonesia does not). I have to state I believe there were other admixture events in Asia, we just don\u0027t have a sensor to parse these out of humans (and because they contributed trace amounts of heritable material.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you can\u0027t see my skepticism then let me lay it out clearly; the fossil record from super-equitorial Africa is not such that it clearly allows delineation of Hss in parts of Africa south of the Mediterranean border regions prior to 50 kya (even as late as 20kya). The people who lived there, obviously human, may no longer be apart of the human population, or alternatively, admixed with humans when they left in small units (a handful of admixture events)(I should add that Sarah Tishkoff the leading expert in human evolution in Africa does not believe, last I read, that humans and Neanderthals admixed in Africa). This indicates possibly that not only did the classic Neanderthal went extinct, but also large swaths of the human population). I am not questioning the dates per say, but even in SSA its hard to find a clearly modern Hss representative 160-180 kya. Thus the dentate is open to multiple interpretations.\u00A0 Even as far south as the Klaisus river, primitive traits continue to appear in the human population after the expansion into Eurasia occurred, and in the west/central African region primitive traits continue to appear into 20 kya.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the argument is coming from a person who deeply questions the results of Paabo (from the pre 2000 period) suggesting humans spread 52,000 \u002B/-29,000 years ago from Africa, I was and am advocate for earlier expansion and exit from Africa, but in further study I find that the physical anthropology has not supported a clean time-line and it is unclear the method by which people left. I should remind everyone that there is human evidence of arrival in Australia up to 65 kya despite a land route that places them there, that humans arrived in the Okinawa chain ~30 kya despite a visible route of arrival. So that the first arrivals of Hss (our guys) to Eurasia need not have come through the Levant and spread. In fact if you look at the M lineages of DNA, there is a much cleaner route that travels from the horn of Africa and b-lines into India. This is not the only tme this route has been used. . . . . So really the question revolves not around did genes flow from Africa into the Levant, we know this is true even looking at Levantine Neandertals, the question is whose genes traveled into the Levant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain avoid drawing me into arguements of Paleontology, its not conducive to pleasant debate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-26T15:23:10Z\u0022 title=\u002201/26/2018 03:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 26, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-26T16:11:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry m8, my eyes fell close when you came to manifolds and the neolithic.

IOW, to state succinctly it only tells you that human apomorphies (modernisms) were appearing more frequent over time, it does not tell you whether they come from humans or admixtures of humans and other archaics living in the region. This is the same caution you gave the other day, and I caution you that these things have to be studied in a larger context, not just physical anthropology, because physical anthropology by itself has a terrible historical track record for making correct conclusions. Same goes for all paleontology.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
