This means that when you fall into a large gravitational well, you will observe the rest of the universe to move more quickly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing this concept, that means that when you fall into the event horizon of a black hole, you will observe the rest of the universe to speed up, right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a thought: When you enter a black hole, you will observe the universe to speed up. If the gravitational well is deep enough, you can see the movement of stars sped up by millions of times, you will see civilizations rise and fall, stars explode and stellar systems form, galaxies collide. The very last moment before you enter the singularity, \u003Cstrong\u003Eall of time would have passed\u003C/strong\u003E (since g approaches infinite).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003ETo keep the story going, lets just assume that you\u0027re wearing a suit that\u0027s resistant to heat, fire, and any other elements that would destroy it (spaghettification included).\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EBlack holes are known to dissipate by hawking radiation, but they take a very, very long time. However, since \u0022all of time\u0022 would have passed once you reach the centre of the black hole, would enough time have passed such that before you reach the centre, the black hole would have dissipated away (And you emerge from the other side a googol years later) ?\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Neil1993","CreatedById":92469,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-23T15:47:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKind of? No one really knows.
