I\u0027d advise wearing a helmet and some shinguards while reading.\n\nNo, seriously. This is gonna get crazy.\n\nSo yesterday evening, I was invited over to a friends\u0027 house for some dinner. While I made up a quick pizza [had to bring the flour and the toaster oven], Jared was pulling out some frog legs. Very fresh, I might add. In fact, he grabbed my attention, as well as a salt shaker, and proceeded to pour some salt on all of the frog legs. Briefly after, they began to twitch. Even though they were dead legs, they were able to move around and respond to stimulation. \n\nI actually got very curious about this. I went under the assumption that this was caused by a type of reflexive response, which is also why you would pull your hand away very quickly, and without thought, from salt, lemon juice, or hand sanitizer travelling into the nearest papercut. The same could also be said for involuntary responses.\n\nBut anyway, this got me thinking a bit. I got back after a while, and decided to share this thread.\n\nBecause, the fresh legs were part of a living thing, which had a brain, a consciousness, and intentions. If you just went up and killed the frog, you can still have it respond to simulation through all kind of methods. But, who\u0027s doing the responses? The cells in the corpse? Or the frog itself? \n\nYou could argue that the frog no longer has the intention to respond to stimuli, therefore isn\u0027t responsible. A reasonable argument, but that begs the question:\n\nWhat, and where is the frog? \n\nOr for that matter, you. What, and where are you? Keeping the principles all the same, would you continue to do things after you are dead? \n\nYour cells for that matter. If they are the ones responding to stimuli after you are dead, then what about when you\u0027re alive? If you could pluck off a single cell from you right now, is it a separate entity? What\u0027s keeping from being separate while attached to you? For that matter, what about putting it onto another person? Is it now their cell?\n\nFor another matter, imagine this scenario: micro surgery is now a medical standard. Cells are capable of being taken off one by one.\n\nIf you had your cells being removed one by one, are you having yourself removed? Or are you simply just relieving your cellular crew of duty? I mean, if you consider your cells to be separate life forms, then what about you? You can locate those cells, but can they locate you? I mean, where are you? You could say you are sitting in your chair reading these words, but aren\u0027t those just your skin cells? I\u0027m talking about your sentience. Where is your sense of self-awareness? \n\nYou could argue that the various quick interactions within your sensory systems is what gives you the ability to identify your surroundings, but what about thought? Or feelings, for that matter? Where do those come from? What allows ME to be able to think about this subject with intense depth?\n\nIf you think that your consciousness comes from the brain, then are you calling yourself just a brain? Is it you? Or is it your brain?\n\nIf you think your consciousness comes from the brain, then why do you say \u0022my brain\u0022 rather than \u0022me\u0022? \n\nFor that matter, if you believe consciousness originates outside the brain, then where is it? Why does it go away after death?\n\nIf your brain were to suddenly burst, but your body left intact, would you continue to live?\n\nIf my brain and your brain were to suddenly trade places, would I be me, or you?\n\nIf I were taken apart cell by cell, then reconstructed, would I still be me?\n\nThis is gonna spiral out of control if I keep this up, I\u0027ll leave it here.

That what he thinks about his past experiences also would not change? That his *interaction* with the world has no impact on how he processes the world, or rather, his mind? Could his wife be the victim of first degree burns all over her body, and, upon seeing this, he now feels a sensation he never felt towards his wife ever before... repulsion? Could, the spot where he would allow the cool breeze to flow overhim as he imagines a beautiful sky-scape be a deteriorating ramshack. The world around him has changed in ways he never imagined, what he knew and loved is different from what it was before... but is he still the same person, do these changes in perspective represent a change in mind?\n\nAnd more so... if he were hooked up to a machine that used the power of his brain, and two others, to achieve an end task... have we created a new individual? Can we create a new body, supply it with a hive-mind, and create a unique individual independent of the minds that control it?\n\n[http://www.ted.com/talks/miguel_nicolelis_brain_to_brain_communication_has_arrived_how_we_did_it](http://www.ted.com/talks/miguel_nicolelis_brain_to_brain_communication_has_arrived_how_we_did_it)\n\n---- now let\u0027s have fun\n\nAre we our body? If the frog loses his leg, has he lost apart of himself... or are his legs an entity in themselves? They respond independent of external control, can we say that reflexive responses indicate the presence of a primitive mind? If your mind is not controlling your body, could it be that your body is actually controlling your mind?\n\nDid you drink mother\u0027s milk because you wanted to, or because it was your body that told you to? Did you rise on two feet because you wanted to, or because of an instinctual drive to walk? Did you learn speech because you wanted to talk, or because you were programmed to process and learn languages?\n\nOur body controls our mind, feeding it neurochemicals to get you to eat, to sleep, to mate... what actions are actually a result of you MIND and not a result of your body? Can you really separate them, are there not subtle influences over the years to mold your mind into something the body desires? The body that lacks the capacity to produce these chemicals often seeks to supplement them elsewhere, causing various pains unto the mind until the needs have been met. Depression, Addiction, these are physical ailments that create mental components; do you drink because you want to, or do you drink because the neurochemicals released by the body drive you to do so.\n\nThe question that remains is, admitting that the body can hold control over and influence the mind; what would you be like as a mind without a body. Neurochemicals create feelings of fear, of love, of hate, of passion.... would stripping ourselves away from our bodies would yield a sociopath? Does that mean morality is a physical response; a kindness one body passes onto another but not what one mind passes onto another?\n\nBodies act independent of the mind, they perform actions we wish they did not and do things without our permission. How can we honestly say that WE are in control of our bodies; they may exist in a symbiotic relationship for us; but the question is who benefits more... the mind, or the body.\n\n\\*\\*\\* Epilogue\n\nSheesh, this is crazy.... the assumption always has been that the actions of the mind induced an action in the body; i.e. neurochemicals are a mind-body conduit; the mind wants to feel happy so it has the body produce serotonin. Or that the body and mind remain one and seritonin production is a result of you, as an organism, feeling down.\n\nBut what is also true is that many of these chemicals aren\u0027t needed for a mind to exist; how far down the rabbit hole can you go? Where does the body start and the mind begin?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-19T03:36:56Z\u0022 title=\u002204/19/2015 03:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fel**"},{"CreatedByName":"peadar1987","CreatedById":81207,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T11:18:25Z","Content":"This is an incredibly old argument, probably almost as old as philosophy itself.

Have fun with trying to reply.\n\nNo its not, these are old questions.\n\nHenrietta Lacks - the first immortal\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Lacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Lacks)\n\nOk, so this is how it works.\n\nLife = ability to control the fate of energy in the environment by containing and controlling chemical reactions, in essense life provides catalyst to direct reactions capable of rebuilding itself. Of course it needs a source of energy (most - organic molecules and dissolved oxygen, some - hv, CO2 and H20, a few = other sources of oxygen or chemical energy)\n\nReproduction schemes (following the darwinian concept of reproduction - survive and reproduce)\n\n-fission (e.g. bacteria, simple fungi, certain procaryotes, we could also include parthenogenic animals or plants).\n\n-recombinant reproduction - gametes from two individuals fuse, undergo chromosomal recombination, and then either produce new organism or multiple new organisms.\n\nSo humans fall into the second category. We are non-parthenogenic, however with cloning this scheme is possible, it is currently banned and the experiment with dolly the sheep shows that the best telomers are derived from germ-line cells, not stem cells.\n\nThis means that to survive and reproduce, IOW, to fit the criteria my germ cell line has to survive and be cabable of recombining and this can be done without my brain, although its much more likely to occur with my brain. So Lacks is still with us in her cells, but the reality is that the DNA that is in those cells has evolved away from HeLa prototype, and the prototype itself was cancerous, its not really henrietta anymore, its kind of a zombie cell that only trained scientist can keep going (HeLa cells that are alive today have spent the overwhelming majority of their existence frozen in dimethylsulfoxide solution in liquid nitrogen. If those cells were truely Lacks\u0027s cells, they would have reached their natural limit to divide decades ago and died. So for instance the oldest person that has ever lived had better than good ability to conserve cell divisions while at the same time had good ability to facilitate cell division without transformation. Thats about 130 years of age, there are some stem cells that can divide longer under the right conditions, but by and large by that age at 37\u0027C our cells are playing out. \n\nSo this issue handled lets move to the last one.\n\nYou are treating the human brain like a programmable digital computer. The human brain is a learning machine, it can compute, and there are certain digital qualities to it, but the digital computer and the human brain are very different things. The computer has memory that is near completely erasable and replacable. In the human brain the hardware and software are prettymuch the same thing. And no two human brains are alike. If you took all the memories and higher CNS function of one person and tried to shove it into the brain of someone else, they might see your short-term memories, but by and large the incompatabilities would knock out much of the function and you would have a very confused 2 year old mind that would have to relearn a whole lot (and the older mind cannot adapt as quickly as 2 year old). \n\nYour brain has a function, survive and help you reproduce and do optional stuff on the side. You do the optional stuff like create post here because your biology is tolerant of kin- and social selection activities that improve fitness indirectly. It assumes that all the creative stuff will improve the tribe, the nation or the species allowing humans some overall survival benefit. It gets confusing in the short-term whether this works, but in the long-term success is self-evident. \n\nSo that to answer your question, your brains function stems from its ability to help you survive and reproduce, its function is tied to the rest of your corpse and really has no benefit to you or the rest of society if that corpse is no longer alive. The memories are not like the on and off bits in a computer, and if you somehow could detect all the memories in your brain and transform them into another person you would not have accomplished much because most of your emotional and functional state is hardwired into your brain."},{"CreatedByName":"benjee10","CreatedById":84110,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T22:13:44Z","Content":"I don\u0027t think the frog legs twitching is to do with reflexes at all actually. Sodium is a key part in the transmission of nerve impulses and muscle contraction and salt contains a lot of sodium. The salt likely dissolved into the frog legs and triggered nerve impulses, and likely not co-ordinated ones, hence the twitching rather than a coordinated contraction of a knee or something. It was an involuntary response to a stimulus directly affecting cell level biology.\n\nThe concept of consciousness is a very tricky one. It\u0027s difficult to define and I won\u0027t pretend to be any expert in philosophy by any stretch, but I remember a New Scientist article once that postulated that consciousness was a property of matter, like mass, which arises when information is processed at different levels. Your brain is effectively just an information processor. It takes information from the sensory organs and works out what\u0027s going on, effectively. That\u0027s what consciousness is. Simply receiving information is not enough for something to be conscious; it is the act of combining that information with other information that causes consciousness to arrive. Imagine you\u0027re playing kerbal space program. You\u0027re receiving lots of information. Vision, hearing, the touch of the keyboard. On their own these mean nothing. Together they make a conscious experience of playing kerbal. Your brain takes the images you perceive and gives them meaning, it relates them to past experiences, co-ordinates your body to respond in a certain way. As to whether consciousness is a by product of having advanced information processing or is actually a driving force in it no one can really say. That raises questions of free will and philosophical zombies which is a can of worms you don\u0027t really want to open up ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T22:26:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Your brain is effectively just an information processor.

It will go down if it use an learning algorithm. \n\nThe brain is not an computer, yes it will probably be possible to emulate an brain however this require that the model is good enough not only that you have enough cpu power. \n\nProblem is that say you emulate an mouse brain, you will have no idea if the computer really emulate an mouse brain or just is trained to behave like an mouse who this is far simpler. \n\nThat is unless you can observe all of the activity in the mouse brain and see if the computer act similar. This again has problems as two brains does not behave the same way."},{"CreatedByName":"-Velocity-","CreatedById":74097,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T16:52:48Z","Content":"First of all, the feeling of a constant existence, a constant self, tied to a specific piece of matter is an illusion on multiple fronts. First of all, we are in no way tied to a specific piece of matter. Your brain is constantly rewiring and replacing itself. The brain is like the proverbial \u0022ship of Theseus\u0022- by the time you die, your brain will have probably replaced and rewired almost everything between the time of your birth and the time of your death. Secondly, as the brain is constantly rewiring itself, the idea of a constant self is also an illusion. So you could majorly rewire the way your brain works, even wholly replace your brain with a new one (which would be at least mostly functionally identical) and you would still feel that you were the same person- though you might think a bit differently if the new brain was wired a bit differently.\n\nAnyway, the matter that makes up our brains is utterly irrelevant. Everything about who and what we are is nothing but the information in our heads. When I say \u0022information\u0022, I mean all the information we store in memory PLUS the manners and rules by which that information and new information is processed, and the information that describes how our neurons are wired to make us think. In other words, the information that describes our memories plus the information that describes how to create our process of thought and self-awareness. To make a computer analogy, you are all your \u0022save files\u0022 in memory PLUS the source code of the program that makes up you.\n\nBecause we are information, a functional equivalent of you made on a computer simulation- a simulated brain- would be *exactly* you. **NOT** a \u0022copy\u0022. Because you are NOT made of matter, you are made of INFORMATION that is described in matter. How exactly matter is made to describe the information that is you is irrelevant- be it a biological brain or a computer software simulation.\n\n(I already hear someone\u0027s lame-brained counter-argument: \u0022But what if the simulation were to run faster than your original brain!?!?!!! It would be very different than the original you!\u0022 Well of course, then you haven\u0027t replicated your original brain. EVERYTHING about you is information, including how fast your brain processes information. The information that describes *you* includes everything needed to exactly replicate the function of your brain.)\n\nSome people have a hard time conceiving this, so let me give an example. Lets look at another piece of information, say the number 1,638. Like you, it is a piece of information. A VERY TINY piece of information. So here\u0027s a question, when I write the number 1,638, am I writing the number 1,638 or just a \u0022copy\u0022 of the number 1,638?...\n\nIt is idiotic to say that I\u0027m writing just a \u0022copy\u0022 of 1,638. The number is just *the number*, as all information that is exactly the same is exactly the same. Likewise, an exact copy of your brain- regardless of what medium it is realized in- would be *you*, because *you* are nothing but information, and thus all instances of that information are exactly you.\n\nSo far, we don\u0027t have any real use for these ideas outside of the philosophy of the mind. But, we may find a way to replicate human minds in software. Such minds could be vulnerable to prejudice and denied the rights of human beings. The above reasoning would show us that we should treat such software minds with the same respect we treat a biological mind.\n\nWe can also have fun applying these concepts to a silly science fiction debate about the *Star Trek* transporters. The argument goes that, if the transporters destroy the body at one point and then replicate it somewhere else, then every time a person uses a transporter they in fact \u0022die\u0022. However, applying the knowledge of the mind as information, we see that you do not die when using the transporter, as the only thing you are is information, and that information *does* get properly transferred from place to place. The immense byte stream that is \u0022Captain Kirk\u0022 does in fact get beamed up or down from the *Enterprise*.\n\nIt\u0027s a silly debate, but it could eventually have real world analogs for humans if \u0022mind scan\u0022 like technologies come into being. And of course, it would have immediate real world analogs for any machine intelligences we might create in perhaps the not-so-distant future. That they were nothing but information would be immediately obvious to them, however, in a way that isn\u0027t immediately obvious to (most) humans.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-20T17:05:35Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2015 05:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|**"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T17:35:50Z","Content":"Perhaps this ties into our goal of creating artificial life?

Silicon is still **many** orders of magnitude behind biology in efficiency and information processing density.\n\nThe reason that silicon computers outperform us on things like adding numbers is because we did not evolve such an ability because we did not need such an ability. That said, there are of course many areas where we vastly outperform silicon computers.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-20T18:14:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2015 06:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|**"}]}
