You could replace what look like analog signal cables bundles with digitizing the sensor data closer to the sensor and use lighter digital bus cables. So I wonder how much performance you lose, although I guess the reasoning is that reliability is a much more important goal than saving a few kilograms on the control and sensor systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Second_stage_of_a_Delta_IV_Medium_rocket.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Second_stage_of_a_Delta_IV_Medium_rocket.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Voidryder","CreatedById":57308,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-04T02:49:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWooo-weee, you sure ask a lot of questions.
