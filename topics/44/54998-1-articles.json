Do you actually understand all of the equations involved in computing drag and what to do with these? If so, read on. Otherwise, you need to brush up on basic mechanics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStart with a capsule first. Besides orbital velocity, it only has one parameter to vary. Basically, re-entry angle. There might be more efficient ways to go about it, but with modern computers, just go for it. Take your ship, write equations for forces acting on it based on current velocity and altitude, and then use a numerical differential equation solver to compute trajectory. Compute loading factors and heating along trajectory, adjust re-entry angle and repeat. Do this for a range of possible entry angles, and use the data you get to establish the corridor. For the numerical solver, I\u0027d use Mathematica. It has a lot of nifty symbolic algebra features that makes this kind of computation a lot easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResults probably won\u0027t be as reliable as you\u0027d want if your life is going to depend on it, but you can definitely compute a plausible corridor for a simulation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mmmmyum","CreatedById":85231,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T06:33:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI understand the maths, some of it is a bit above my level though (currently doing IGCSE, and A levels next year).

A number of numerical models to achieve a good approximate solution do exist, though to achieve the required precision (e.g. as to hit a target with an artillery round at long range) corrective factors need to be found from experimental measures. But I believe you don\u0027t really need such extreme precision.
