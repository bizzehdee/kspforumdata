The US shuttles aged until the point where they were no longer deemed safe (remember they purchased old chips to keep the stuff going) and got retired. The modern Soyuz, however, can not be compared to the original version and this is its strength. Of course, this is also the nature of a rocket when compared to a shuttle, but they take the cake.

I saw her countless times before she died at the age of 94. I remember hugging her when it was time for my family and I to head back home. I have a certificate from NASA that commends her for her work. The main reason I play KSP is because I love space and space travel.

Why? Sure, they lagged behind, but in the end, they came out on top. Want to counter that? Well: U.S.S.R. didn\u0027t even get their moon rocket to leave the atmosphere, while the USA never had a problem with any of the Saturn Vs (Apollo 1 wasn\u0027t using a Saturn V, and the Apollo 13 incident was a result of the CSM, not the Saturn V). Also, on a side note, the US rocket was bigger. So much for Russia doing everything big. Finally, the last time I checked, the US is still in existence. So, the US has a double win: they (actually) got to the moon 1st and are still in existence.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei think people forget to make their points clear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUSSR got to the moon first actually...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this is about the space race, not exsitence, also the USA uses a soviet launch vehicle to send Soyuzs up (which was also soviet) so without the soviet union, the U.S would probably still be using the old Saturn 1B.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore points I\u0027m going to make:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUSSR got the\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst ICBM (R-7 Semyorka)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst artifical sattelite into orbit (Sputnik 1)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst living thing to orbit (Laika)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst human to orbit (Yuri Gagarin)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst flyby of the moon (Luna 1 [it failed to hit the moon so flyby instead \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E])\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst object to get to the moon (Luna 2)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst landing on the moon (Luna 9)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst orbit of the moon (Luna 10)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst flyby and return to earth from the moon (Zond 5 [it also had some animals in it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E])\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst Rover to the moon (Lunokhod 1)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst thing to enter the atmosphere of another planet (Venera 3)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst lander to mars (Mars 3)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst lander to venus (Venera 7)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst space station (Salyut 1)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-25T16:37:58Z\u0022 title=\u002209/25/2013 04:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by M.Wolfy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
