Most of what I see in the satellite photo is basically rio-grande sand, basically West Texas silty sand, relatively dense with low organic content. You basically scrape any surface organic stuff to the side. Bring in the select fill and build up (From what I see 10,000s of truck loads) then depending on what you are going to do, lay down the forms pour the concrete, then take the stuff you tossed to the side, mix in some compost and layer it on top, add about an 1/8th of an inch of sand and put flats of st augustine grass on top in the high end areas and toss short growth bermuda in the middle end areas and xeroscaping stuff in the transitional zones. Although they could use xeroscaping plants and cobble across the whole area and save money on water. There are alot of choices now, south texas xeroscaping is particularly useful next to launch pads, prickly pear does not mind to much getting blasted by fire. On the east side you have a surge impact zone (it needs to be able to survive 15 knt of tidal force), so its likely they are going to drive some sort of barrier material into the ground, based on what happened during Allen, they will need to go down about 12 feet to prevent undercutting, On the south side a reasonable transition in select fill along with some permanent barrier should do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t see the development in South Bay going very far, I think they are going to run into environmental impact considerations, but most of that is not property they own anyway. SPI is sinking, its got both global warming sea level rise and lower sand accumulations because the dams at Amistad and Falcon lake and water usage from New Mexico and Mexico basically prevent alluvial sands from reaching the coast and blowing up. So south bay development is also going to run into rising cost of building up to safe height. For gulf hurricane we are no longer just looking at airspeed but integrated kinetic energy instances, for example IKE, a cat1-2 storm on impact had a storm surge of 17 feet (3 meters) and basically shaved 10s of meters off parts of the coastline. Building requires insurance, and insurance companies look\u00A0 now for structures that have the platform layers at 20feet or higher, preferably 25 feet above MSL, and from what I have been told piers that go down twice as far as structure goes up. Everything below, basically the insurance companies wants to blow out during a storm surge leaving only the piers and the structure on top. Road improvements are another problem, the roads out there are laid on blocks of of granite 6 to 8 ft cubed (if you look at satellite images of south jetty you can see the blocks), and basically they dig down 8 feet below sea level drop these blocks in a couple high, fill in around with aggregated and put road material on top. The bulk of the blocks was not sufficient during Allen to prevent the roads from being torn, it simply ripped the blocks up and tossed them in the laguna madre. This road is going to have to be doubled in size so that is going to be a major stumbling block to progress, once they get inland then the road bed does not need so much basement support.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/lKFL1G3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/lKFL1G3\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMt chimbo doesn\u0027t look too bad now does it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-24T12:27:33Z\u0022 title=\u002203/24/2016 12:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave G","CreatedById":160719,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T12:43:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222471344\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022134755\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221458821372\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107380\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n26 minutes ago, PB666 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey are going to bring in select-fill, some sort of material with high initial compaction.

I have a good experience on the eastern edge of South Bay, not pleseantly good, just experience wise. I saw a tow truck dig (Ford F350 4 x 4 base frame) itself about two feet down on terra firma, before we could get it hooked to an anchor it was already filling in with water, it was a mess the tow truck was wenching itself up on the side in order to dig sand into the bottom of the pit, then rolling across to the other side, it has about a 45\u0027 ramp on the exit side before it got out. At least in South Bay, the pan is on the surface, you break it with a vehicle, your dead in the water even if you don\u0027t see it, yeah, that was a hard lesson.\u00A0 I literally took may car to the car wash and washed out the interior of the car with the blaster nozzle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou get your compaction up (weight) to as high as you can, vibrating the soil helps to\u00A0 then you start draining as much water out as you can (not much). Anything below the spring tide maximum, you wick water out, it flows back in. Anything above that it still flows by much more slowly. In fact in the village that is the reason they don\u0027t drink the water, the wells are all salted in, thats why they collect water off the roofs of their houses. I suspect now muniwater has made its way out. That neighborhood, it hasn\u0027t grown since I was there in \u002783, there\u0027s a reason for that.\u00A0 The key is the vegetation, you see lines and ridges in the vegetation above the water line, those are areas which the salt concentration at root level is too high, marsh grasses will grow in salty water, but not full salt in hot climate, there has to be an inflow of freshwater to brackish it up a bit. The areas devoid of grasses means there is a constant inflow of salty water that basically replaces rainwater after evaporation and transport has taken its toll. This is not the everglades, soils here are very sandy, no trinity clays or equivilents and silt to sand ratios are lower than on the upper texas coast. its more of a fine grit than anything else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fredinno","CreatedById":143381,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T19:36:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222470962\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022134755\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221458786264\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107380\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 hours ago, PB666 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGetting permission from the Mexican government is not as difficult as you might think.

There are things the could do, like telescoping vanes a tail drag devices that could use GPS to target certain LZ. Port of Brownsville (obviously) is not a big port, there is traffic but not like the Houston ship channel. If spend the whole afternoon in the turn basin fishing, you might see one or two ocean going ships pass. There are a ton of shrimp boats though, so port in brownsville and many port isabel, there are a few charter fishing boats, but far less trips than before they implimented to new federal snapper limits (and long line commercial fishermen started taking down the snapper stocks). You are actually more likely to hit a shrimp boat than any other vessel. Alot of mexican brown shrimp are packaged in Brownsville. The laguna madre is so well preserved (heavily grassed on the south end), that on a good night if you hit the side of the boat, live shrimp just hop right in. This is the problem with South Bay, it is one of the most pristine bays in the country, it has a relatively shallow channel that makes it difficult for a majority of boats to enter, combine that with the fact that alot of the SE quadrant is owned by TxP\u0026amp;W and you have major dev problems.\u00A0 The thing about the launch pad side is that it catches overflow from the riogrande, its already degrade because the Mexican side dumps untreated human waste right into the river. Thats actually good for the site because althoughs docs in the water will lower the redox and prevent corrosion of the iron. If you dig into the mud and all you see is black (iron II sulfide) and smell is sulfides . . . . . . .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave G","CreatedById":160719,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-27T18:24:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222475119\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022134755\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221459034879\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107380\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n18 hours ago, PB666 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPort of Brownsville (obviously) is not a big port, there is traffic but not like the Houston ship channel...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt depends on how you define \u0022big\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHouston is obviously busier, but as I understand it, Brownsville can handle larger ships than\u00A0the Houston. \u00A0Aircraft carriers, huge oil drilling ships, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf SpaceX decides to assemble BFR cores somewhere along the Brownsville shipping channel, the ability to handle large water vessels is a big plus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-27T18:31:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222475939\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022134755\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221459103095\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022160719\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dave G\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 minutes ago, Dave G said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt depends on how you define \u0022big\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHouston is obviously busier, but as I understand it, Brownsville can handle larger ships than\u00A0the Houston. \u00A0Aircraft carriers, huge oil drilling ships, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf SpaceX decides to assemble BFR cores somewhere along the Brownsville shipping channel, the ability to handle large water vessels is a big plus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHouston can handle panamax vessels and oil tankers.

There are 4 port facilites along the channel, the is the port of galvesto, the brand new bayport favility, the port at baytown, the various portages for refineries along the channel and the port of houston ,w hich happens to handle more industry shipping than any othe port in the country. The biggest problem for a small boat is you have gulf swells that cross ship wakes they can toss things up pretty bad if you have more than two lrage craft passing. Even down at sargeant the brage traffic is still pretty heavy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou sit on the side of briwnsville and you might see a barge pass way off ine the distance, youll see shrimpers come and go with a flock of seagulls in tow, and occassionally you will see a ship pass, maybe every three hours.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving said that the port of Brownsville is more than adequate, the channel is deep, it has a double step that goes\u00A0down to about 65 feet at the jetties,\u00A0routinely caught small snapper off the second edge. The inner channel is basically a deep barge canal. Queen triiger, snapper, grunt, sheephead, blackdrum, gulf trout, spade fish, large rays, sharks, \u00A0The fact there is less trasfic off the brownsville channel is a plus, imo, they have fairly good development areas to the south, as long as they stay west\u00A0of South Bay, thats going to get politcal fast. That liite road from the POBv to BCv aint going to carry anything that those ships can bring invanyway, assembled.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike I said if they can get a permit to canal to the wset sude of BCv then they could really bring in heavy stuff, but that means buying all the land on the other side of the road all the way to the beach, creatin a drawbridge . . . . .Otherwise they are going to have to beef up 4 to handle heavy loads. 12 inch concrete slabs. They arent going to be doing anything heavy yet, they are going to have to assemble close to the launch site.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMention here one thing, winds in florida may be bad but boca chica has the highest summer wind in Texas. The wind can blow white chop for days, and its a given after 2pm youll have chop on the bay. On the beach the sand blows hard enough to sting when it hits you, again this can go on for days in september. I was out off the coast about 15\u00A0miles out and we got hit by a rogue squall lines that was carrying 16 foot waves, the boat pulled about 8 kts and could not keep up withbthe waves they were passing us with about 2 knts to spare. After that i don\u0027t fish offshore anymore. Its one thing to be thrown\u00A0up and down 16\u00A0feet over and over, but to be drenched in salt water and the occasional stinging jelly fish tentacle, but then have to smell the blowback from diesel for 2 hours.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts not unusual\u00A0to have 20\u00A0knt strait line winds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(forgivr the typos, posted from an\u00A0iOS)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
