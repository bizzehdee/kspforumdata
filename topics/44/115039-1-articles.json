In KSP i tend to think of the edge of the atmosphere at the point in which orbits are indefinitely stable, so I guess what I\u0027m actually asking is:\n\n\u0022At what height would a satellite in an circular equatorial orbit of Earth need to be such that the orbit does not effectively decay over the course of many, many years (say a human lifetime)?\u0022\n\nSome numbers I found from a quick google search\n\n100 km: where \u0022space starts\u0022\n\n380 km: googles answer to \u0022how tall is earth\u0027s atmosphere\u0022\n\n400 km: ISS orbit height\n\n~600km: end of thermosphere / start of exosphere\n\n10,000 km: end of Earth\u0027s Exosphere, where it is pretty much impossibly to distinguish the air from the vacuum of interplanetary space. (seems to be some variations on this altitude?)\n\nSince the ISS isnt entirely stable (needs help to stay in orbit), I\u0027d guess the answer to my question is somewhere between 400km and 10,000km. I guess 10,000km would be the more official \u0022end of atmosphere\u0022 height where orbits would be 100% stable almost forever, but I\u0027d imagine that orbits much lower would be stable for a very long time (by human standards)."},{"CreatedByName":"impwarhamer","CreatedById":80499,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T16:31:44Z","Content":"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s possible for a satelite to be in a 100% stable orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T16:33:43Z","Content":"Well you did a pretty good job of answering your own question. Yea technically theres traces of gases all the way out to the moon iirc. As for the question of how far out a satellite needs to orbit before air resistance no longer factors into its station keeping routine ( there\u0027s gravitational influences of course you gotta deal with ) I\u0027m.. not too sure. 800\u002Bkm up I\u0027d say your satellite would take a human lifetime to deorbit. So anywhere beyond that point you just have to deal with the Moon and Sun\u0027s gravity."},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T16:44:29Z","Content":"There is atomic gas througout a lot of space, so you will need to draw a line somewhere and call it quits.

(Though the ISS orbit is a bit more nuanced, with apoapsis ~440km and periapsis ~300km.) There is no exact altitude where the atmosphere \u0022ends\u0022, just like there is no exact altitude where the layers of the atmosphere transition. It depends on time of day, time of year, latitude, solar activity, local weather, all sorts of factors. For example, the Thermopause can range from ~400km at its lowest to ~1000\u002Bkm at the highest, and as you observed that\u0027s not even the upper layer of the atmosphere. \n\nThe Exosphere is even more varied, and measured by matter that is in orbit of Earth or in a suborbital trajectory, not so much in its atmosphere. So the upper limit of the Exosphere would then be the point where the force of gravity, the matter\u0027s momentum, and the pressure from external factors (solar wind, gravity of other bodies, etc) all balance out [Edit: for atomic hydrogen]. Above that and external factors will pull the matter out of orbit. There really isn\u0027t a point where an orbit would be 100% stable, such as in the mathematically ideal 2-body physics of KSP.\n\nSo I suppose my question in response would be \u0022For what definition of \u0027Atmosphere\u0027?\u0022\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-04T17:50:57Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2015 05:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cydonian Monk**"}]}
