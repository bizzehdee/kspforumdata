Graphene already has so much potential for new and better electronics and now this. Graphene seems almost too good to be true. I\u0027m curious, besides heatsinks, how could this property along with its other properties be used in possible applications. It seems as though there are boundless possibilities enabled by this one material.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStronger than steel, lighter, incredible electrical conductance, and now this. What about graphene\u0027s structure makes this possible? I understand it has something to do with how the atoms are arranged but my chemistry isn\u0027t so great :S\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, what are the issues stopping us from widespread use of graphene?
