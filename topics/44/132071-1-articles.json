Would it be possible to use a regular car turbo for pumping liquids? My source of gas would probably be some regular compressed air running through where the exhaust would go and the liquid running through the area the air would come in. I remember hearing somewhere that turbos had very low torque so they couldn\u0027t\u00A0pump liquids very well when they ran off of gasses. I know rockets use turbopumps to pump liquids but I\u0027m not sure if those work like a car turbo. So I\u0027m asking here if its viable to pump liquids through a car turbo using compressed air as the force to spin the turbo. The liquid wouldn\u0027t be very thick, just water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SomeGuy123","CreatedById":154263,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-14T05:49:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can build a machine that would have the same basic set of spinning blades connected by a common shaft that pumped liquids while using gas to drive the other set of blades. \u00A0This is probably what you mean. \u00A0The governing design constraints\u00A0would be radically different - it depends on the gas temperature and pressure, the liquids properties, etc. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the engineer who designed it would totally change how the impeller was shaped on one side and how the gas turbine was designed on the other. \u00A0It would vaguely resemble a car turbo in the same way a jet engine vaguely resembles a car tubo - some comparable parts but basically a totally different machine. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-14T06:19:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you asking whether a turbine can pump liquid?

The actual turbine stage on a car turbo is exactly what you want for a cheap turbo pump. Author might not have been aware of it, and then your comparison stands, but at least through dumb luck he wasn\u0027t that far off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCompressor from a turbo charger, however, is completely the wrong type. It will not pump fluids. Still, the pump is the easy part. So if you want to build a small-ish rocket engine at home, starting with car turbo is a pretty good idea. What you want to do is take the car\u0027s turbo apart, separating the turbine from compressor. You can throw compressor away, but keep the common shaft. Then grab two centrifugal pumps, the kind that are typically used with electric motor to pump water out of wells. You want high RPM, low torque pumps, which electric driven ones typically are. Then connect both of these pumps to the common axle from the charger. Now you can feed gas from your pre-combustion stage into the turbine, and it will power the pumps. The output from the turbine goes into your main combustion chamber, and output from pumps should be split between pre-combustion chamber, main combustion chamber, and regenerative cooling piping as appropriate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis wouldn\u0027t be exactly commercial grade rocket pump, and it\u0027ll be far more likely to fail under the real launch conditions. but on the flip side, it should be sufficiently powerful for either a heck of a hoby rocket or even a second stage of a small orbital rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S. I should warn, though, that this is getting into seriously dangerous stuff territory. I don\u0027t expect OP to be able to build a complete rocket engine, but if you just get pre-combustion chamber going, or even simply feed the system from external pressure source for testing, this thing can pump ludicrous quantities of fuel and ox. I would strongly advise not trying a live test without a full engine built. What you can do reasonably safely is to test the concept by feeding water through both pumps and using something like a leaf blower to power the turbine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.P.S Ok, on closer inspection, I might have jumped the gun on that \u0022second stage\u0022 thing. I\u0027m not seeing a lot of commercial, easy to find centrifugal pumps that go above 0.5 MPa, and you need at least ten times that to have an efficient RP-1 engine. In fact, charts I\u0027ve found don\u0027t even start until about 1MPa. But 0.5MPa isn\u0027t terribly bad for a hobby engine. Of course, at mixture ratios that involves, you\u0027re kind of building a giant turbo charged flamethrower...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-15T18:41:00Z\u0022 title=\u002202/15/2016 06:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by K^2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hannu2","CreatedById":154334,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-15T18:48:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCommercial water pumps use typically 3000 rpm electric motors (or 3600 rpm in countries with 60 Hz electrics).
