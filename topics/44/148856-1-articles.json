Space-time that lovely amorphous quality whose composition is still pretty much up for speculation gets all funky as you approach the event horizon of a black hole. To make matters worse as particles spiral into this flattened space-time units (quanta) they also emit light in generally within the heat and uv spectrum (dissociation of matter by extreme gravity causes the ionization of matter also), but because the matter is spiraling in, some of the stuff comes out as x-rays. The consumption of large amounts such as the core or dyings stars, planets, etc cause the belching of gamma rays.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe authors of this paper argue that two qualities of the light carry quantum information (2 qubits) each and that each black hole therefore has a signature of information at a given wavelength (as a consequence of the shape of the space-time units) that matter crosses through as it approaches the event horizon. The information is stored in the polarization and angular momentum of the photons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI disagree with the authors. Their conclusions are rather theoretical .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last quantum cell around a black holes event horizon should be emitting Hawkings\u0027 radiation, on top of this photons are emitted from amorphous and warped space-time and these may encode quantum information, but X-rays emanating from a black hole are produced from \u0027shells\u0027 of space-time which is well about this and much more amorphous, yes the space is flattened, it has to be other wise we would be seeing and visible light instead of X-rays and heat, but flattened does not mean the unit cells are uniformly shaped and so the information produced (the majority of X-rays) should not have uniform polarization or angular momentum. The information could be biased, but its not digitized.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
