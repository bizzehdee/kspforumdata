Most likely, if you just jack her up, lower the landing gear, and replace the prop and engine (which will need a full teardown and inspection if not a full rebuild due to the torque loads imposed on it), she\u0027ll be airworthy for at least a \u0022hospital\u0022 ferry flight immediately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPropeller-driven warplanes, with those big piston engines, were *tough* birds (so were propliners), because of the vibration environment that they lived in.

The first time was in 1953, when it was used as a target in military effects (i.e., damage) studies at three nuclear tests in Nevada. After being repaired in 1965 (cannibalizing parts from another essentially-destroyed B-17 that was used in the same tests), it was restored to service for use as a water bomber for fighting forest fires... pretty much just in time for the US Forest Service to ban the type from water bomber service; it was then converted back to regular bomber configuration and became an airshow warbird, until, in 1986, a botched landing saw it go through the fence at the end of the runway, tear off its landing gear on a drainage ditch, and lose an engine and the outboard part of the right wing to hitting a telephone pole. While this would have been considered fatal damage and resulted in a trip to the scrapper just ten years before, the owner decided to repair her, and by 1990, the bird was flying again and remains on annual tours around the US to this day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, most likely, that Sea Fury will be flying again pretty soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tommygun","CreatedById":41293,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-02T14:23:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell they dug up a P-38 that had been been buried and partly squashed under a glacier for 50 years and got it flying again, so I\u0027m sure they could fix that plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s just how much time and money you want to put into it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-02T16:03:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rdfox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rdfox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOn the prototype 707, there were a large number of gauges that didn\u0027t work on the early flights without the pilot tapping them any time he wanted to read them, because they were designed for propliners and had lots of resistance in them so that they\u0027d read steady in all that vibration... and on the 707, there was no vibration, so they just tended to stick in place!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s why you get that buzzing sound in modern types as soon as you power on; there are vibrators in the instrument panels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-02T16:14:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MightyDarkStar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MightyDarkStar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELooks a bit like a scrape to the underside and a wrecked prop but it should be fine!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is going to be pulled apart completely for sure.
