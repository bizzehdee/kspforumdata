It\u0027s one of my favorite \u0022non conventional\u0022 rocket propulsion techniques. While not strictly \u0022realistic\u0022 or \u0022plausible\u0022, I find it\u0027s quite fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou take a pair of wormholes, small discs kind of like in stargate. Or better yet, like the portals from the Portal games. You place one somewhere really really hot, like on the Venusian surface, or even inside of a sun if it\u0027s strong enough to handle that. That\u0027ll be the \u0022in\u0022 portal. You then put the other one inside the reaction chamber of your rocket, which will be the \u0022out\u0022 portal. These have to be one-directional for it to work. Or at least the portals have to obey entropy (where a hot material will want to flow into a cooler environment). Assuming it does work that way, the superheated gas/plasma will enter via the portals into the reaction chamber of your rocket. A carefully shaped nozzle would then expel the gas out to produce the thrust. What you get is a rocket with effectively endless propellant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But wait!\u0022 you tell me, \u0022Won\u0027t you\u0027re ship melt the moment the waste heat starts to seep through into the hull?\u0022 If left uncontrolled, yes. And as the old adage says, you can move heat, but never destroy it. And since heat radiators are bulky (and we\u0027re already cheating physics with one pair of portals) we move the heat off of the ship using more portals! We move the heated coolant off of the ship to somewhere really cold where it can dump the heat. After that the coolant returns to the ship to pick up more heat, creating a closed loop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a quick and simple diagram of my portal powered propulsion system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/h9aoy0x.png\u0022 alt=\u0022h9aoy0x.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-07T22:26:56Z\u0022 title=\u002210/07/2013 10:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by PTNLemay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dharak1","CreatedById":61137,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-07T05:20:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPretty cool!
