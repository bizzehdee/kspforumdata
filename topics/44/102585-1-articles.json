They are the black thing on this picture. As you can see, they are too small to be used for storage. \n\n![Space_Shuttle_docked_to_station_-_cropped_and_rotated.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Space_Shuttle_docked_to_station_-_cropped_and_rotated.jpg)\n\nThere are 3 PMAs on the station. One of them permanently connects Node1/Unity to Zarya and cannot be removed. The others are the actual docking ports for visiting spacecraft and will be used by commercial crew vehicles (Dragon and CST-100). They will be fitted with another adapter that will convert the APAS-95 ports to the new IDS standard."},{"CreatedByName":"Mazon Del","CreatedById":32991,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T18:51:01Z","Content":"I must say, I never noticed before the part of the shuttle that says \u0022CUT HERE FOR EMERGENCY RESCUE\u0022.
