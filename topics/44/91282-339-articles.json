There was some appreciation of the greenhouse effect - Svante Arrhenius himself, the guy behind the discovery, backed the \u0022swamp world\u0022 theory for Venus - and there was the conjecture that the unbroken cover of what back then were assumed to be water vapor clouds meant the planet lacked heterogeneous surface features like continents (and, therefore, was from sci-fi).

It\u0027s just how the CPU talked to the program. Audio card ready for another packet of data? Interrupt. User pressed a key? Interrupt. Some fixed amount of time passed, as set by the timer registers? Interrupt. Having a divide-by-zero generate an interrupt wasn\u0027t seen as a problem. You can literally write a two instruction handler that says \u0022set answer to zero, then resume,\u0022 and you\u0027re done. You get your x/0 = 0 behavior practically for free if you want it, but you can also do something fancier if you needed it. It just wasn\u0027t a problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then 80386 happened with its 32 bit addressing only available in the protected mode and over the next decade the interrupts went from something the programmer takes care of to something the operating system takes care of. But the design choice of division by zero always raising an interrupt remained, because that was legacy behavior that had to be maintained. In principle, there was a design choice to be made with all of the modern operating systems to handle that interrupt differently. After all, a key press still generates an interrupt under the hood, but the operating system takes care of it without generating a signal. So we never think of a key press as a bug. But because division by zero is a signal, along with fun things like general protection fault and illegal instructions, they are handled by a programmer in a similar way to a genuine error. Or, if unhandled, will terminate the program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWas this the correct choice for the operating systems? Hard to say. But given that both Linux and Windows adopted this approach in the early 90s, by now it\u0027s basically just a fact of life. If you want to write your own operating system, or even just a kernel mod for Linux, that handles division by zero differently, it\u0027s absolutely an option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis does bring up one more curiosity. Floating point is different. Unlike the integer division by zero, which always raises an interrupt, floating point division by zero\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emay\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0raise an interrupt. There is a CPU flag that controls whether this happens, and it is off by default for any new process, meaning the programmer has to opt-in to receive floating point division by zero as a signal. Otherwise, that division is ignored, and you get either INF or NAN result. This was partially done because on 386 the FPU was originally a co-processor, but I suspect at least in part because it was anticipated that this will happen more often with floating point computations, and an interrupt should absolutely not be the default way to handle this, especially with protected mode enabled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ability to set up floating point traps is absolutely amazing for development, and I do wish that more people would know about it. I like to run debug builds with FPU interrupts, because then if I didn\u0027t do the correct checks in my collision detection code, for example, and generated an unchecked division by zero, instead of finding out about it after hours of debugging a weird collision glitch, I can simply get an interrupt when it happens. There are, however, some compiler optimizations that come into conflict with this. One that caused me most gray hair back in the day was when Microsoft decided to emit SQRTPS signal for the sqrt() call in SSE-optimized code. So any time you take a square root, there\u0027s a chance that some of the unused values in the MMX register are negative, and that will trip an exception handler which is slow! So the fix for it is writing your own sqrt() function that emits SQRTSS and hope it doesn\u0027t wreck the optimization. Naturally, it\u0027s not a great strategy for production code, but it\u0027s good for debug builds. So I still recommend doing this, but it is a bit of a hassle. And don\u0027t forget to make sure it\u0027s disabled in production.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-21T20:41:37Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2023 08:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by K^2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
