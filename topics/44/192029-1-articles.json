Back then most used a scsi interface so you had to install an scsi card in an ISA slot and connect the scanner to the card.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe had scsi card in storage and the boss ordered the scanner. Customer came with the computer, I added the card, then installed the driver for the card and the scanner, tested that it worked and even scanned some stuff for myself, put the lid on the case and customer collected it.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe was back the next day as the scanner did not work.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nI started the computer and driver did not find the scsi card. Ok the card came loose or it was an bad connection, open computer put card in another slot, started it up again and it found it, I put on the cover but thought that I should also test the scanner, the card could had come loose in transport.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nComputer cases back them tend to have an U shaped cover covering both sides and the top. it was slotted into the front and secured with 6 screws at the rear as shown in the image.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022open-computer-chassis-of-the-90s-picture\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002266.21\u0022 height=\u0022678\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/open-computer-chassis-of-the-90s-picture-id641854292\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow the weird part starts. I unscrewed the 6 screws while the computer was running and then done I found that the scsi card was detected again. Putting screws in and it disappear.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nNailing it down to the lower right of the screws killing the card. My first thought was was the cower was twisting the case and the motherboard who could happen. however the screw had an clear pass and did not even have to be fastened for the card to die.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nNo its not that it touch anything its bottom screw opposite of the one you see in this image so it would be far from anything.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI imagined it would be something to do with electromagnetic noise. PC\u0027s back then tended to make lots of it in many computer labs radios did not work as most computers ran on 25-50 MHz and FM radio is around 100 MHz.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut can one tiny hole have an impact. Not that the hole look to small for an 50 MHz wave to pass, its not much bigger than the screen in an microwave oven.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny ideas?\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nI delivered the pc with just 5 screws attached customer never complained for the year I worked there.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-29T20:08:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Da5w.gif\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002266.71\u0022 height=\u0022467\u0022 width=\u0022700\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.gifer.com/Da5w.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"radonek","CreatedById":84077,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-29T23:01:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy guess would be that something touched motherboard outside of mount points. \u00A0Still,\u00A0 symptoms beats me.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-29T23:11:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223749812\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022192029\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221583017310\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002284077\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022radonek\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nJust now, radonek said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy guess would be that something touched motherboard outside of mount points. \u00A0Still,\u00A0 symptoms beats me.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo it was the screw at the bottom on the opposite side of the\u00A0motherboard\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe bottom part one not seen on the stock photo and also the front part of the case.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nFirst thing to check second was\u00A0twisting.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-29T23:41:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d strongly believe that you couldn\u0027t see whatever was shorting out the board.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it is also quite possible that ground return noise was the problem.\u00A0 Most likely that ground current was flowing through your problem screw back into the power supply.\u00A0 This current happened to flow over some overly sensitive part of the circuit board and induction forces created a current going the opposite way.\u00A0 And that was enough to make the board not work (probably only sending the wrong bit once every million times, but that\u0027s easily enough to crash it in milliseconds)...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might want to google \u0022ground loops\u0022 as well.\u00A0 Nasty little buggers.\u00A0 But if there really isn\u0027t anything touching where it isn\u0027t supposed to touch, and board designers love to use mounting screws as ground, weird grounding current issues are the most probably cause.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"radonek","CreatedById":84077,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-29T23:44:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe screw probably\u00A0 just closed a loop that involved something else.
