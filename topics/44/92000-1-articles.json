Especially in such a small sample pool, with just a handful of launch vehicles in each era. It might be that this is simply a coincidence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, the fact that Ariane 6 will no longer be using giant solid strap-on boosters but instead shift to small solid strap-on boosters is partly due to being expressively designed for modular payload capability, and partly because those small solid strap-on boosters are borrowed from the Vega project so they can save money by not having to develop new ones. And Ariane 6 would never go all liquid or all solid either, because France is producing solid fuel tech and Germany is producing liquid fuel tech, and these two countries alone account for more than 50% of ESA\u0027s budget between themselves and are thus \u003Cem\u003Erequired\u003C/em\u003E to find a compromise before ESA can do anything at all. As you can see, none of these reasons actually involve the discussion of liquid vs. solid in any way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there is a pattern, though, then perhaps it is driven by payload needs and technological advances. Solid motors have always had a price advantage and a performance disadvantage. During the space race, price was irrelevant, performance was all that mattered. Your rockets had to lift more and fly farther than the other country\u0027s rockets. The payloads were huge, and losing was not an option. Then after Apollo, the space race evaporated, and space budgets evaporated with them. Solid boosters suddenly looked a whole lot more attractive. And finally in the modern era, payload sizes plummeted as the ISS was finished and hardly anything larger than a commsat remains to launch (and even those are getting lighter). Now you want to downsize, have rockets as modular as possible so they can handle different payload sizes at minimum price. Very large solid boosters don\u0027t deliver that, better use larger numbers of smaller ones. Or try to save money by copypasta\u0027ing your liquid mainstage instead of having to develop a new solid solution for a profile where no existing ones are readily available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(And by the way: Ariane 5 is a post cold-war vehicle, launching first in 1996 - seven years after the collapse of the Soviet Union.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-05T10:04:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause there are only a few nations with launch capability in the first place, individual policy changes and technological advancements have a large effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Some countries have consistently used solids since the start of their programmes-Israel, India, Japan, Brazil-with only India using large segmented similar to US efforts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Some simply don\u0027t use solid boosters-Iran, both Koreas\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Some only use solids in missiles, and relatively small launch vehicle derived from missiles-China and Russia\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E US dropped large solids for HLVs for cost reasons, but they\u0027re being retained for SLS\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-05T11:43:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first space rockets was ICBM with an extra stage, liquid fueled with storable propellant and oxidizer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey was expanded as you wanted larger payloads. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elater you got specialized space rockets with LOX, an satelite launcher has very diferent demand from an ICBM.
