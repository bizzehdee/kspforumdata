correct me if this is way off.\u00A0 A gas gun with between 300-400 psi has in the ballpark the thrust of a falcon 9 or similar.\u00A0 Supposing you can maintain that pressure through the length of a barrel.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThree huge\u00A0problems arise.\u00A0 1) You need reasonably\u00A0tight gas bushings on the vessel.\u00A0 2) You need an exponential increase of gas behind the vessel inside the barrel. 3) the barrel must be maintained with absolute precision.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPossible solutions: 1) The vessel wadding is made up primarily of CO2 dry ice.\u00A0 It could have fibers to control cracking, have hex tiles,...\u00A0 It could have pneumatic pistons like self adjusting brakes to push the shoes\u00A0against the barrel with constant force and diameter as the dry ice\u00A0ablates.\u00A0 The shoes can be discarded at the muzzle of the barrel and will evaporate before they\u00A0hit\u00A0the ground\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Rather than use foul timed explosives or sit on the wrong end of a rocket nozzle, we could use N2 as the driving gas.\u00A0 The heat and driving energy can all be kept external to the barrel.\u00A0 We can dump an exponential amount of heat into liquid nitrogen and get an exponential volume of cold gas.\u00A0 This is very clean and beneficial to the system compared to hot corrosive gasses.\u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) To make the barrel absolutely precise we construct it out of H20 water ice.\u00A0 Specialized Zamboni robots can machine an entirely fresh barrel surface in only a few hours.\u00A0 Reserves of liquid N2 help ensure the special glacier remains stable throughout the year.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-29T19:52:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou want the projectile to be softer than the barrel this tend to be solved with copper on normal guns even artillery who operates with far higher pressure and is rifled.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nGas guns for target shooting tend to have an cone in the rear, the gas pressure expands the rear of the bullet giving an thigh seal even with the pretty low pressure this increases

number of supersonic gas-pressure gun designs around.\u00A0 One I\u0027m aware of is used to do things like shoot ping pong balls through ping pong paddles (leaving a neat, round hole, at least on the impact side).\u00A0 Another uses hydrogen to accelerate tiny projectiles to six or seven (or ten?) times the speed of sound to study high velocity impact (like micrometeoroids hitting the ISS).\u00A0 All of these have in common that the\u00A0 barrel is held in a vacuum before a rupturing diaphragm releases the high pressure driving gas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, ordinary spring-piston air rifles can reach modestly supersonic velocities by compressing the air at the time of the shot, and using the compression to multiply velocity (the piston is, say, ten times the area of the barrel, so the barrel can drive at tein times the piston\u0027s velocity on the same volume flow) -- but this would require some massive apparatus to produce the needed pressure/flow on an instantaneous basis.\u00A0 You can\u0027t make it from liquid nitrogen on demand; it takes time to transfer the heat needed to boil off the liquid into gas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd all that said, you have the same problem with this kind of launcher that Jules Verne did with his underground cannon in Florida, written to fire men at the Moon in the 1860s: the acceleration needed to build up useful velocity in a manageable barrel length would be enough to liquefy bone and flesh.\u00A0 It\u0027s possible to build electronics that can be fired from a gun (they did it with \u003Cem\u003Evacuum tubes\u003C/em\u003E in the Second World War) -- but humans couldn\u0027t survive the tens of thousands of G that would come with launching to orbital speed in a barrel short
