We could, for instance, travel to the Greater Magellanic Cloud galaxy at a distance of 163,000 light years in 23 years (ship relative) if we could maintain a constant 1g of acceleration (towards the destination until the halfway point then decelerating after that.) This is possible due to time dilation and Lorentz length contraction at relativistic speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, if we wanted to time travel 1000 years into the future, we could do a trip at 1g out to 500 light years from Earth, turn around and come back. (You\u0027d have to switch acceleration directions twice: once halfway out and again halfway back.) The whole trip would take about 24 years, ship relative. You could do it in less than a decade if you could accelerate at 3g. But living at 3g for a decade would be pretty difficult (if not fatal) for a human body. I was wondering if there\u0027s a way around it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGeneral relativity tells us that acceleration in a spaceship at 1g in deep space is indistinguishable from standing on the surface of the Earth (neglecting tidal, Coriolis, and centrifugal forces.) So, we can conjecture that since we don\u0027t have a way to mitigate a constant gravitational pull on Earth, there would also be no way to do it (through, say, a rotating habitat) on the spacecraft. Buoyancy through water immersion seems like a possibility; I wonder if it would be possible to design gear so that humans could live in a fully immersed environment 24/7, and what the ramifications would be for this kind of system in 3g. Also, with the spacecraft, we have the advantage of theoretically being able to change the thrust of the engines at will, so we don\u0027t have to have a constant acceleration; you could have everyone get into the tanks for 8 hours out of every 24 to sleep and accelerate at 7g during that period and 1g otherwise, which would average out to 3g.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny other creative solutions?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZetaX","CreatedById":60692,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-09T21:48:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am not convinced that buoyancy will help enough.

Should I open a new thread?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, a spaceship has a considerably more delta-v capacity than a missile. The first few km/s of a missile\u0027s delta-v budget is already spent to accelerate it towards the target spaceship. If the target ship jinks enough (changes its orbit by thrusting in a random direction), the missile could have expended all its fuel before reaching the ship, making it easier to dodge.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T18:08:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022shynung\u0022 data-cite=\u0022shynung\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEven if the thrust\u0027s axis were perpendicular to the direction of travel?

There are additional problems with trying to hit a relativistically moving target: it can only be \u0027seen\u0027 in the rest frame from directly in front of it, and by the time you see it, it will already be here. (If you were able to detect an object travelling toward Earth at 0.99c when it crosses Jupiter\u0027s orbit, you\u0027d have about 24 seconds to do something about it by the time the light got to you.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shynung","CreatedById":101096,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T18:26:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see what you mean.
