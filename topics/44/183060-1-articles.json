They have to compete with New Glenn, and I\u0027m pretty confident it flies in the sort of timeframe that Blue has been pitching. The existence of Starship/Super Heavy at pretty much any level of functionality is a game changer, and starts allowing all kinds of choice in architectures for lunar bases. Even just as a LEO vehicle, the mass to orbit is transformative in that space assuming any reuse. Obviously if it doesn\u0027t work, we\u0027re still in a sort of F9/FH and NG future for a while, which is useful, but not substantially different that what we have already.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nivee~","CreatedById":183478,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-23T22:30:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also think it is going to be China.
