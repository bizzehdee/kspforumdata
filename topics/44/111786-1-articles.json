But let me tell you, almost everyone, both regular citizens and people in gov\u0027t and industry, compare the two. And right now, SpaceX has a huge lead. Actually, you can tell just by asking yourself, \u0022Where do the hotshot young engineers want to work for?\u0022. And right now, it\u0027s SpaceX, and there\u0027s pretty much no other competition (not Lockheed, not Boeing, not NASA). They\u0027re helped by a charismatic CEO, an underdog story, good marketing, and a media world that absolutely loves everything Musk or SpaceX does.\n\nBut let me provide a counterpoint. When I studied abroad in Ecuador a couple of years ago and talked with Ecuadorians about the US, they all revere NASA. It definitely surprised me. When I wore a cheap NASA shirt (not a real NASA shirt, just a souvenir one) to class, I got peppered with questions. I have to admit that probably this reputation is really just a legacy of the NASA glory days, but still. It was enough to make kids in another continent basically bow down to me when I told them I had some experience \u0027doing space stuff\u0027. I thought that was funny.\n\nAnd also, compared to the rest of the federal government, NASA is ALWAYS ranked as the best, most-loved, and most-respected organization. There\u0027s no doubt within gov\u0027t that NASA is still top-dog. I\u0027ve sat in meetings with ppl from other big agencies like Defense or FBI or FAA or whatnot, and I haven\u0027t ever met someone who doesn\u0027t think NASA personnel are excellent.\n\nI think it\u0027s that durability of reputation that matters. So on a scale from Kerbol to Eeloo, NASA still ranks as a Jool.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-03T01:56:58Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2015 01:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NASAHireMe**"},{"CreatedByName":"Requia","CreatedById":112924,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T02:09:01Z","Content":"I gotta say pretty bad, not because of how people view them or anything, just that I get an \u0027emergency bailout vibe\u0027 from the interim between the shuttle and the SLS, as well as how hard it was to get the funds for a shuttle replacement at all (which is why its taking so long really, they didn\u0027t start nearly as soon as they needed to)."},{"CreatedByName":"ChrisSpace","CreatedById":140622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T08:01:47Z","Content":"NASA: sways from -900 to -999\n\nSpaceX: around 100\n\nChinese space agency: around 200-300\n\nRussian space agency: -800\n\nIndian space agency: 0\n\nESA: -999"},{"CreatedByName":"peadar1987","CreatedById":81207,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T08:32:33Z","Content":"Ouch, bit harsh on the ESA there, seeing as they\u0027ve pulled off Cassini-Huygens *and* Rosetta within a decade of each other!"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T08:36:23Z","Content":"AFAIK there\u0027s no launcher purely under NASA\u0027s name now.
