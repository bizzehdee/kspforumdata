However, if you are looking for something easy, then a goto altitude/azimuth mount with a small schmidt-cassegrain may be the way to go. Schmidt cassegrains have the additional advantage of being long focal length which makes them great for planetary viewing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA dobsonian is another option that gives you the best value for money for viewing, but is no good with a camera. They are also big and hard to move. I have never used one, so that\u0027s all I can tell you about dobs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo use a camera easily, make sure your telescope takes at least 1.25\u0022 eyepieces. For deep sky imaging (eg messier objects) an equatorial mount is a must. For planetary though, anything is okay.
