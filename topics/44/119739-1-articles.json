We\u0027ve really only looked for a signal around about 1000 stars, and those have only been looked at for a few minutes at a time. The image in your link showing all the stars you can see in the night sky in that tiny little circle is one of my favorites. Finding a signal in all that vastness is a Herculean task, like finding a specific needle in a stack of needles. A further complication is we have no idea what a signal from an entity we know nothing about would be like, so it\u0027s analogous to looking for a needle, in a stack of needles, without knowing what a needle even is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe galactic center is an interesting place to look because it is the single, unambiguous point in the galaxy, but it is also an incredibly dangerous place for biologics, like ourselves (our only data point).
