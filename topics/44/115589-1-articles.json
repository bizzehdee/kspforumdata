Basically, I believe that reentry heat is the result of friction; that is, kinetic energy becomes thermal energy. Is that even true or are there other reentry effects that create a lot of heat, seemingly out of nowhere?"},{"CreatedByName":"kurja","CreatedById":66303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T22:00:01Z","Content":"Air is compressed and heated in front of the craft, which then heats the craft.

Your craft compresses the atmosphere immediately in front of it which increases temperature.

The \u0022free-stream\u0022 air approaches the object (seriously - it makes more sense if you imagine the object as being fixed and the air as moving) at hypersonic velocity, crosses a shock wave, and is suddenly moving sub-sonically relative to the object. Kenetic energy is proportional to v^2, so all that energy has to become something else, and very quickly. So temperature goes up."},{"CreatedByName":"Leszek","CreatedById":119053,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T22:18:06Z","Content":"I would also point out that it is still kinetic energy becomes thermal energy, or rather kinetic energy \u002B gravitational potential energy = thermal energy.

The faster you\u0027re moving the less of a change in velocity you need to experience for heatting to occur. And as someone pointed out, gravity is in that equation too. It\u0027s entirely possible to be generating increadible amounts of heat and still be speeding up if you\u0027re going down.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Radiative heat transfer has a net cooling effect on objects entering the Earth\u0027s atmosphere, while there\u0027s a net heating due to radiative heat transfer during Mars atmospheric entry.\n\nWe\u0027re catching up, though. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"}]}
