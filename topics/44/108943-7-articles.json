I cannot repeat and emphasize this enough, it\u0027s one of the most basic axioms of rocket design.  (You can *assume* the TWR, but that\u0027s treading on very, very thin engineering ice.)  The **mass** is the starting condition for the booster and the foundation for all other calculations.  \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s not an alternative method - **it\u0027s the only method.**  That being said, those numbers look way off, two tons of aeroshell (even without TPS) isn\u0027t going to buy you much in the way of structure.   (And I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if your thrust web ended up eating a significant fraction of that.)  And are the control surfaces included in that?  Where is your recovery system (parachutes and landing gear) in your weight estimates?  For that matter, what is your recovery method?  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E Your tank estimates seem similarly off - you can\u0027t use conventional rocket numbers as these tanks will have to take stresses in directions that a conventional rocket doesn\u0027t, meaning your tanks will be heavier as will your structure.  \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E I have tried repeatedly to offer constructive criticism, only to be shot down because you don\u0027t seem to grasp what I\u0027m saying.   Serious question, is English your native language?  Because we have a communications gap, and it\u0027s either language or you really don\u0027t grasp the engineering as well as you think you do and don\u0027t (or won\u0027t) grasp the existence of the gap.  (And no, this is not *ad hominem.*  I have yet to make such an \u0022attack\u0022, nor do I plan to.   Pointing out the errors in your design process is not an attack.)\n\u003E \n\n1. I will try to get an image uploaded.\n2. If I cannot start with the TWR, where can I start? If you had told me this earlier, instead of just shouting about how \u0022you can\u0027t do that\u0022, that would\u0027ve been constructive criticism.\n3. This was the first time you talked about the structural problems, and I thank you for bringing the problem of the elevons to my attention. I realized that the dry mass would need to be higher after sevenperforce commented earlier, and I had a few doubts about the TPS.\n4. See #3.\n5. English is my first language, however, I am an inexperienced engineer at best (probably related to being a high school freshman). I apologize for the comment about ad hominem attacks, I was getting rather annoyed about you saying I was wrong without giving alternatives, and may have misinterpreted your post."},{"CreatedByName":"fredinno","CreatedById":143381,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-16T19:03:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On February 15, 2016 at 9:03 AM, RocketSquid said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Fine.
