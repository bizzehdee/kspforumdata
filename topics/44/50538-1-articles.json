It would be impossible to rebuild an exact copy of the Saturn V today, simply because many of the materials and manufacturing techniques are no longer available. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, many parts in those days were forged and welded by hand, which are prohibitively work-intensive and expensive nowadays. Today, you would want to make most parts with CNC milling, which would require each part and component to be redesigned with modern CAM/CAD techniques.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lot of stuff on the old Saturn V was made with materials that are no longer available. Some of them have even been banned because they are toxic, polluting or simply obsolete. Many of those materials have been replaced with more modern composites and alloys, but for each part, you would have to make sure that they meet the same physical and thermal requirements. So again, each part would have to be redesigned. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of the avionics and telemetry equipment is obsolete, so that would need to be replaced. This would includ all the wiring, which would have to be rerouted through the structure. This means that any mechanical part that had wiring or sensors or connectors attached to them would have to be redesigned too. Any software would need to be rewritten for those modern computers and the ground infrastructure would need to be rebuilt and reconverted, including launch towers, the VAB, MCC, propellant depots, etc...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd the fact that a lot of the Saturn V design was rushed and not optimal. It wasn\u0027t the best design possible, because it was a crash program designed to put a Man on the Moon before the Russians, not to be part of a durable versatile space infrastructure. Many components were based stuff that already existed or could be quickly adapted or was based on limited knowledge of spaceflight. You would want to improve on the design, and again, that would mean redesigning a lot of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically, if you wanted to build a Saturn V today, you would have to redesign each and every part of it. A modern Saturn V would have a whole lot of different mission requirements, a variety of payloads to be placed in different orbits. It would need to be modular and reconfigurable to support all those missions. In effect, what you would end up with is an equivalent-sized launcher, with modern engines that are currently available, tanks built with tooling and techniques that are available today, modern avionics and telemetry... and in the end it would look a lot like SLS.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-25T17:14:55Z\u0022 title=\u002210/25/2013 05:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T16:06:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been looking for a Penny-Farthing, because it looks like a hoot to ride on.
