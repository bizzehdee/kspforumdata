The only exception to this is a small amount of RL-10s for SLS, and SSMEs, which would probably not keep the company afloat without significant downsizing. The Single-stick launcher could keep the company afloat long enough to develop a much cheaper RL-10, or a completely different product. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENASA would benefit, as they will have greater use of KSC but commercial customers, and not have to man-rate SLS blocks (3 different rockets needed for man-rating). It would also allow Orion to fill the congressional requirement to be a back-up in case CCdev fails (which sadly may actually be the case, due to underfunding), and increase possible payload capacity of future SLS missions, with a Constellation-style 1.5 launch structure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis launcher would also be relatively cheap (probably) compared to Delta IV Heavy, which could be retired by ULA after Delta IV retirement in 2019, and would fulfill the 2-launcher requirement for DOD payloads (the other being Falcon Heavy, as Vulcan is too small for over 20T payloads w/o ACES)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea is that AR would make this rocket primarily off their own money, with some help from the govnt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, apparently, Ares I tooling still exists, so the 2 stages are Ares I diameter (5.5 meter). This would use NASA\u0027s facilities, along with KSC, which would appeal to NASA, which is trying to increase the commercial use of its (especially KSC) facilities. Should all else fail, Vulcan/Delta IV 5 meter tooling will be available to build the rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket would launch in a new LC-48 south of LC-39A, \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.americaspace.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Vertical-Launch-Areas-.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Vertical-Launch-Areas-.png\u0022\u003Eaka the notational \u0027small vehicle launch site area\u0027 at KSC on this map. In the case it is not large enough, a new pad could be built north of the railroad north of LC-39D, (though that means that they would not be able to build a runway there, as NASA is planning.) If all else fails, it would launch at LC-37A, next to Delta IV, and use the h2 lox infrastructure there in place. The Vandeberg pad would be SLC-2E, 2W, 1W, or 1E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-12T21:35:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhere are AR supposed to get the money just to develop F-1B, nevermind the launch site and LV factory?
