What confused me was the lack of RS-25 engines. The SSME engines burn hotter than reentry during launch yet they don\u0027t melt. I know the propellant flows through the engine bell ribs before entering the injectors to COOL the rocket down, but I am a little shocked to hear that rocket engines don\u0027t survive reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess my question is, what is the upper limit of heat tolerance that rocket engines can endure when they are NOT cooled by flowing cryogenic propellant?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, why don\u0027t the RCS thrusters melt during reentry as well? They are directly exposed to reentry heating, moreso than the 3 SSME engines, but I don\u0027t think they are destroyed on reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, what is the upper limit of thermal protection that fuel TANKS can endure? How hot can it get before those are destroyed as well?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I am asking is because I have been editing DRE values for KSP to be more realistic, basically handicapping the kerbal thermal protection system to be more like OUR thermal protection systems when we reenter at REAL LIFE speeds. I know the mod comes with a different shockwave value that directly does this, but I think altering the max temp values on the parts is more realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peadar1987","CreatedById":81207,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-29T17:00:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI doubt it was the reentry heat that destroyed them, I\u0027d say it\u0027s more likely that the spacecraft breaking up just pounded them with debris.

What survived breakup would have been smashed as the engines, possibly separate from the stage after break up, hit the ocean spread out over a wide area of the ocean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve heard the latter kind of damage as being common during the Columbia break up. The hypersonic shock waves and high compression heating ripped the \u0022soft\u0022 orbiter to pieces during the high speed, high-altitude re-entry.
