There are the two harpoons mounted below the main body of Philae. The three landing legs have auger bits built into them (separate from the sampling drill). The idea was that the the thrust on top of the craft and/or the harpoons would provide a downward force so that the augers could anchor the landing legs to the comet, assuming the surface is soft enough for them to penetrate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I\u0027ve heard, the ESA is saying that the harpoons never fired and there were issues with the thruster. My guess would be that Philae bounced due to a lack of downward, anchoring force from either of those two devises, so the augers never had a chance to anchor to the surface. I would also imagine that the augers attempting to drill into the surface under such low gravity would have pushed the craft off the surface, if it weren\u0027t held to the surface by the harpoons/thruster.
