also requires tuning and/or significant engine modification* for any effect to happen (it basically increases the octane rating of your car). \u00A0The ones that work (and do the same thing) do so by replacing gasoline with a \u0022better\u0022 fuel (see E85) and also require the same tuning and are obviously going to be more expensive than gas (unless your gas taxes are sufficiently high and \u0022paint thinner\u0022 is actually cheaper).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a bunch of \u0022low hanging fruit\u0022 out there that either engineers or manufacturing managers don\u0027t bother to include in a car. \u00A0A few of them simply require owners to perform more maintenance then the public will do (oil catch cans, methanol injectors) and others simply cause more warranty\u00A0issues than they want (i.e. you should understand that the cost for adding the part may well be much, much higher than the part itself). \u00A0But all of them only add a few percent (if that) changes in performance (and all the insanely aggressive tricks, such as including steam turbines to scavenge exhaust heat) seem to give about ~20% improvement in mileage). \u00A0Anything more than that is a scam.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* read \u0022changing the compression ratio\u0022, especially on non-turbocharged cars. \u00A0I knew a hot-rodder who liked to do that in the 1970s, but I suspect that changing a modern combustion chamber isn\u0027t going to help (although getting there by increasing the stroke isn\u0027t an issue). \u00A0If you have to ask what it is, don\u0027t even think about trying it yourself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn upcoming car engine will use an movable\u00A0crankshaft to change the compression ratio while driving. It would also need to change the ignition setting and fuel balance but that is software.
