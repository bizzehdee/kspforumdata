Stealth being non-existent is silly under any circumstances. One does not have to be invisible to be stealthy. Stealth is just one variety of crypsis and crypsis can take on many forms. D-Day managed to be fairly cryptic despite a complete lack of \u0022stealth\u0022 in the modern sense of the term.

With that in mind, leaving it out of the game seems like a perfectly reasonable design decision. But that is a design decision based on project scope and resources, not \u0022realism.\u0022 In a truly realistic space warfare sim, crypsis of various forms would be at least as paramount as it is today in modern international relations and quite possibly moreso by virtue of the vast distances, enormous populations and myriad hiding places.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-18T06:04:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, in space you radiate basically all generated energy.

compared to specially made optics, at least) and sensitive\u00A0sensors (current DSLRs have fairly good sensors, enough for that work) and some software for tracking and finding the stars on the

gun spares of the Formidable-class battleships.\u00A0 Torpedoes were seen as unreliable beyond 1000m against faster moving ships and a single shell should kill most merchant vessels.\u00A0 None saw

designed to be a cruiser, as the Washington Naval Treaty limited cruisers, but not submarines.\u00A0 This was fixed soon after the launch by the London Naval Treaty, making her one of a kind.\u00A0 She was lost in Febuary 1942 to either friendly fire or accidental collision at night (or both), not having fired shots in anger.\u00A0 (There was a fight with 4 dead, but that was side arms, when the

It is 100% true.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis doesn\u0027t mean it is impossible to make detection less likely, stealth has a specific meaning. A stealth aircraft has a signature that is that of a bird. If your sig is distinguishable from a natural object, you\u0027re not a \u0022stealth\u0022 target, you\u0027d just a less visible target. reducing the ability to direct weapons is only a thing outside ranges where missing is impossible. Directed energy weapons are unlikely to miss out to whatever their max range is, because they can simply raster shots across the possible target cross section.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll that said, we can postulate directional radiators, etc, and that\u0027s fine, but you need to flesh out the specifics of the SF universe we\u0027re talking about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s assume that for some reason warfare makes sense at all (a large, marginal assumption, IMO). Reducing signatures is possible via radiators tech, etc. There are none the less a few problems with this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn such a situation, the combatants cannot maneuver without being detected, they only have stealth in the sense that they are visible maneuvering, the they coast. If the maneuvering is detected, then then Newton is doing the driving, and you need not detect them at any given moment, you know exactly where they are (within some cone of uncertainty). Regardless, the militaries in that situation would then have a powerful incentive to place detection systems in a halo around the star system such that any directed radiation is detectable. That is a cheap countermeasure, so it would happen. You\u0027re now directing radiation away from some specific enemy, but not from their detection system at large.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I\u0027ve said above, and in every other thread about this, any arguments need to specifically enumerate the sci fi universe and all the tech available within that universe or they don\u0027t mean much. Using current tech, any space battlefield is in Earth orbit, and the sats are literally visible from the ground. No stealth, we even track tiny sat debris. Any battlefield beyond Earth orbit must be predicated on some SF future where there is some reason for such a fight, with all the tech that requires.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223436603\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022177674\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221534698180\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002227914\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Vanamonde said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDiscussion split from another thread.
