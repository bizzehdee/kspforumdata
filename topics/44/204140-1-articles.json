The shorter half-life means you get more decay events in the same concentration, but short half-life products also don\u0027t accumulate as much, because shorter half-life, so you don\u0027t usually get the same concentrations as the longer lived stuff. Not to mention that the kind of radiation matters. In waste, gamma and alpha might be nasty for handling the waste, but they aren\u0027t going to poison ground water, dust, or what might have you. Basically, neutron radiation is the only one you really have to be paranoid about long term, and the energy of the neutrons matters a lot. Particularly slow neutrons will just bounce around and decay to trace amounts of hydrogen gas. Very high energy neutrons tend to either not interact or convert whatever they hit into something very unstable, causing immediate collapse, and generally, safer products. But if you hit the energy\u00A0sweet spot for a particular nucleus that a neutron might encounter, something entirely harmless might become radioactive with long enough half-life to get out there and cause harm, and that\u0027s the kind of radiation you\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0have to watch out for with radioactive waste. Radiation that makes other things radioactive. And some isotopes are a lot worse for that than others and it has nothing to do with their half-life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, reactors were never my jam, so I can\u0027t tell you off the top of my head how the waste is going to compare. There are complex decay chains for different isotopes of Uranium and Thorium all resulting in all kinds of candidates for bad neutrons, and it would take me entirely too long going through isotope table to sort it out. I\u0027m sure people have done this work and there are probably some summaries out there on how the wastes of Uranium and Thorium reactors compares. The only point I\u0027m trying to make here is that it\u0027s not as simple as \u0022short-lived, therefore,
