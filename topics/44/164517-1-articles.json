Earliest rockets used solid fuels - no way to stop the ignition. Even those that had liquid fuel too often was only ignitable once or on the ground. So most rockets will have stages intended to lift them to heights, and then some more stages to make the orbit. The numbers could be arbitary but modern optimized design tends to use the lowest number of stage possible, which is one for each.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-17T17:24:51Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2017 05:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by YNM\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-17T19:40:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223150746\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022164517\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221502989555\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022126740\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gaarst\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Gaarst said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0the most efficient configuration is a large powerful first stage and a very small upper stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile the most efficient configuration is complicated (there is no trivial way to optimize it), a good starting configuration is often equal amounts of delta-v from each stage (another good starting point is each stage half the mass of the previous one).\u00A0 And while the upper stage should typically use a very small engine, it doesn\u0027t always follow that the fuel\u0026amp;oxidizer tanks have to be tiny.\u00A0 It certainly helps to have a small dry weight (including payload), but you need the wet weight for delta-v.\u00A0 Don\u0027t forget it is far easier to get delta-v without the dry weight of an additional stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t forget that the Falcon9 first stage provides a lot more delta-v when it isn\u0027t coming back to land (and the first stage is considerably more powerful with the 1.1 and later models that started trying to perform a powered landing).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-18T17:27:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223150892\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022164517\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221502998856\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022133850\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022wumpus\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n21 hours ago, wumpus said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t forget that the Falcon9 first stage provides a lot more delta-v when it isn\u0027t coming back to land (and the first stage is considerably more powerful with the 1.1 and later models that started trying to perform a powered landing).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn such cases they usually put in more payload instead.
