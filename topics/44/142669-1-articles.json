I\u0027m researching if a homemade rocket is truly possible, or not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. The rocket should not use any highly-pressurized fuel, or hard-to-attain fuels such as liquid hydrogen. Kerosene and LOX should be easy to get, so is solid fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Fuel should be storable between temperatures of 10C and 70C, and in a pressure not exceeding 100\u00A0bar. This excludes oxidizer/LOX.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. The rocket should not contain any expensive, rare metals(such as niobium).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Rocket core should be not bigger than 10m in height, or 1.5m in diameter. Rocket can have multiple strap-on cores, asparagus is fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, the rocket built should be made with materials accessible to the common man. Milled machine parts and metal are fine, just not space-grade.

The stage will burn for about 57 seconds, after which it will separate, revealing a second stage about 1m in length, and 80cm in diameter.

ITAR is very arms oriented, while other nations try to prevent mishaps with airliners or classify rockets as fireworks. This means that if a permit is required, it should often be very doable.

Which means you need a large propulsion unit. But hybrids in general have massive issues with vibration-induced uneven burning, which causes the motor to vibrate more, which causes even more uneven burning... yeah, you get the idea. With a small motor it doesn\u0027t matter much, but the larger you make it, the more erratic the combustion becomes, and the more vibration is inflicted on the vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCase in point: Scaled Composites won the Ansari X-Prize in 2004, using a small suborbital spaceplane driven by such a rubber/NOX hybrid motor. They then entered a joint venture with the Virgin group that is now known as Virgin Galactic, and thought that they\u0027d upscale the vehicle and fly customers by 2009. But, turns out it is 2016, and they still haven\u0027t fully flight qualified a SpaceShipTwo vehicle. And the vast majority of delays were due to the motor, which just didn\u0027t want to scale up peacefully. They blew up more than one, even killing a worker in the process, and went as far as examining completely different fuel choices (but still sticking to the hybrid concept) in hopes of solving the issue. Then finally, after some ten years, they ended up with something that stayed within acceptable tolerances, but it had less performance than hoped, and SpaceShipTwo will not quite be able to reach the Karman line during commercial operations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(And then of course, while testing that new motor, they had that unfortunate loss of vehicle and life due to piloting error, which is why the delays continue to this day...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwi1960","CreatedById":81697,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-28T19:28:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is illegal to actually exceed a certain height.... and if you achieve orbit, they would probably lock you up for life... citing a navigation hazard for REAL satellites, ships or stations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-28T20:16:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thickness of air has a lot to do with it.
