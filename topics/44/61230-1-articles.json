You\u0027d have the headroom to build the required rocket to get to Mars (Mars is the only realistic interplanetary target for manned mission atm is it not?) plus whatever you\u0027d need to build to get you back, and still with just enough headroom for whatever else. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real problem is how much of the hardware you\u0027d have to (or decide to) reengineer if not completely reinvent, which is what\u0027s going to start eating into your budget the deeper you go with this.
