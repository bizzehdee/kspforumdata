ISP is a measure of exhaust velocity and we produce that velocity by heating gasses. Lightweight gasses move faster at the same temperature. So using hydrogen gas at 2000K is more efficient than using Helium at 2000K. When burning kerosene and oxygen you\u0027re never going to get a perfect mixture, so you have some leftover oxygen and kerosene floating around in your hot exhaust. When you use an oxygen rich mixture you ensure that most of the leftover molecules are oxygen, which has a lower molecular mass than kerosene thus giving better Isp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you burn a LH2-LOX mixture the situation is reversed. Here hydrogen is the light molecule while oxygen is the heavy one. So if you use an oxygen rich mixture here you reduce the Isp. So you need to mix in some extra H2, and they indeed do this IRL.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-23T17:00:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMake that \u0022a lot of extra H2\u0022.

(result of such combustion) Most of H2 in the rocket exhaust is actually just heated up and expelled from the nozzle.

What does it give?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, first of all that\u0027s more energy per mass of propellants (the key factor that limits theoretical ISP). However this extra energy is difficult to harvest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the same mass of fuel you get more energy but less particles. And more heat capacity. Result - higher temperature (slightly, the heat capacity eats part of the difference) and lower pressure at the same temperature and density (the actual engine might be rigged for higher work pressures). The question is getting the thermal energy out of this exhaust and converting it into kinetic - it\u0027s more job for the nozzle. Unless you make perfect nozzle for this system, you\u0027ll get worse ISP. That\u0027s why these were created much later than the simper solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding more H2 for LOX-LH2 has diametrically opposite effect - you get slightly less energy per mass, but it\u0027s easier to convert it to kinetic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s actually a sad story: Kuznetsov tried to pull this revolutionary design, but the reliability of NK-15 determined the failure of the entire N1 project, the upgraded NK-33 weren\u0027t even given a chance. Only years later Glushko perfected the scheme for his super-rocket (that flied only twice, but at least this time the engines weren\u0027t abandoned), and only recently the NK-33 were put out of the warehouse\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-28T10:48:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ebut the reliability of NK-15 determined the failure of the entire N1 project\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWoah woah. That\u0027s in no way true. NK-15 is an extremely reliable engine, as evident by the fact that NK-33 built more than 40 years ago is still considered cutting edge hydrocarbon engine today and still in use. It\u0027s the N-1\u0027s 30 engine arrangement for the first stage that causes reliability problem. If you look at the reason why N1 failed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst launch: metallic debris in the turbine of one of the engines, probably came from fuel tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond launch: a piece of slag in the fuel tanks or debris from a faulty fuel pump ingested by one of the engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird launch: fuel filter added to prevent the same type of issue as the first two launch, this time the problem was aerodynamic\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFourth launch: cause never identified\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENone of them were really caused by the NK-15. N1\u0027s layout was just a bit too novel and required test to iron out the bugs. It didn\u0027t help that N1 first stage was originally designed for 24 engines and they had to try to fit in six more since the spacecraft turned out to be overweight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGlushko was Korolev\u0027s nemesis, so even though N1\u0027s fifth flight was to have the upgraded NK-33 and had a good chance of being a success, he was not going to tolerate Korolev having the last laugh on him with his magnum opus super rocket. And you have to remember that Glushko\u0027s thing was moon bases, so had N1 being a success under him he would have the tool to actually build his moon base. Even so he cancelled N1\u0027s fifth flight only to design his own super heavy lift vehicle 8 years later, after back tracking from his pro-hypergolic position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow as for oxygen rich, I don\u0027t think NK-15 / NK-33\u0027s exhaust is any more oxygen rich than other hydrocarbon engines. The \u0022oxygen rich\u0022 part refers to it being a staged combustion cycle engine as opposed to the more common gas-generator cycle. Take for example Saturn V\u0027s F1 engines. To pump all that fuel and oxygen into the engine requires a very powerful turbopump. The turbopump is driven by what basically is a smaller rocket engine that burns some fuel and oxygen to generate hot gases, these hot gases spin up the turbine of the turbopump and provides the energy to pump vast amount of liquids to the main engine. Once the gas has going through the turbine blades it\u0027s just dumped overboard. Thus for a given level of fuel and oxidiser flow into a F1 engine, a small amount is spent driving the turbopump and thus do not contribute to thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a staged combustion engine, instead of dumping the turbopump exhaust out the side, the exhaust (which is still relative rich in oxygen, hence oxygen rich) is instead ducted so it flows into the firing chamber of the main engine, mixed with fresh oxygen and fuel and is fired again. Thus all of the oxygen and fuel that is feed to the engine eventually flows through the main firing chamber and out the nozzle. That\u0027s why staged combustion engine has higher Isp than gas-generator cycle engine - it\u0027s able to use all the fuel and oxidiser and shoot them out the back for thrust, instead of having to sacrifice a small amount to drive the turbopump.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe catch is oxygen is an oxidiser, which mean it really likes to react with things, weather that be RP-1 fuel or the metal walls of your engine. Oxygen as a hot gas (such as say, the turbopump\u0027s oxygen rich exhaust) is extremely corrosive and is likely to produce what rocket engineers like to call \u0022engine rich exhaust\u0022. So in order to build a staged combustion engine you must have much better understand of metallurgy and gas dynamics. The Russians and only the Russians for some reason has mastered this technology. On the other hand Russians are pretty poor at building cryogenic engines unlike Americans (you can probably blame that on the stubborn Glushko and his insistence on hypergolic fuel), hence why no one has built a staged combustion cryogenic engine - the Americans don\u0027t have the staged combustion technology and the Russians don\u0027t know how to work with hydrogen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiagrams on staged combustion cycle vs gas generator cycle, notice where the orange turbopump exhaust goes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Gas_generator_rocket_cycle.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Gas_generator_rocket_cycle.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGas generator cycle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Staged_combustion_rocket_cycle.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Staged_combustion_rocket_cycle.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStaged combustion cycle\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-28T10:57:13Z\u0022 title=\u002203/28/2014 10:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Temstar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sgt_flyer","CreatedById":57690,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-28T11:09:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother feature (and difficulty) of staged combustion cycle, is the high chamber pressure.

ISP is a measure of exhaust velocity and we produce that velocity by heating gasses. Lightweight gasses move faster at the same temperature. So using hydrogen gas at 2000K is more efficient than using Helium at 2000K. When burning kerosene and oxygen you\u0027re never going to get a perfect mixture, so you have some leftover oxygen and kerosene floating around in your hot exhaust.

There\u0027s a good reason for this, though; the SSMEs were required to be staged combustion to achieve the very high chamber pressures needed to have good performance from the ground to space, and this proved to be very expensive to develop and build. Other rockets, however, didn\u0027t (and don\u0027t) have the same boosted-sustainer design of the Shuttle, so they didn\u0027t need those chamber pressures. In particular, the RS-68 grew out of a program specifically designed to produce a cheaper booster version of the SSME for expendable applications, and so they went to a gas generator design to improve the characteristics (cost and TWR) that were important in that role.\u00A0Similarly, staged combustion was unnecessary to achieve high performance in upper stage engines like the J-2X or RL-10/RL-60, so it again was not used in this role (in fact, there\u0027s a very clever trick that the RL-10 uses that gives you staged combustion-like qualities without actually having staged combustion, by taking advantage of some special properties of hydrogen. But it only works for small engines, not for engines with the SSME\u0027s thrust). In hydrogen engines, staged combustion has a very limited niche where it actually makes sense to use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, you don\u0027t want to run hydrolox engines oxygen-rich. It produces an extremely high flame temperature and greatly reduces performance, as Ralathon explained. In the case of a kerosene engine, running oxygen-rich solves certain problems and can provide higher performance, but in the hydrogen case it just adds difficulties to the design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-04T18:25:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00221027973\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002266570\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221395594033\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002217022\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dragon01\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/23/2014 at 6:00 PM, Dragon01 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMake that \u0022a lot of extra H2\u0022.
