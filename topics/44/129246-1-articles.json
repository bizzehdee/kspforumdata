If it was announced that planet Earth as we know it is being destroyed in 5 years then many people will simply just not believe it. Like I said, for their own personal reasons.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNot to mention the people helping the other people in those disasters likely helped because of sympathy. There were no conflicts with what they believed in. The transaction to them was: Disaster Happens \u0026gt; Check with my beliefs \u0026gt; No Conflict \u0026gt; Help. Where as in something like the Earth being destroyed, the transaction to some would be: Officials Claim that disaster is going to happen \u0026gt; Check with my beliefs \u0026gt; Conflict \u0026gt; Argue and Discourage the idea. I hope that makes sense.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPeople could have reason not to trust officials when they say something major will happen. Again, personal issues.
