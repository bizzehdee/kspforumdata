I say this because in recent years China has stepped up their game so now would be a good time to cooperate, however congress would never do it right now due to their ideologies. The time limit to let them on the project is about 2020 since that is when their Mir-class station will be complete or started and the prestige will make it more attractive then the ISS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy predictions: I really don\u0027t know since anything could happen China or the US could do something stupid and stop cooperation, US could use china to get to ISS, although personally I think it may already be to late to cooperate on that aspect.
