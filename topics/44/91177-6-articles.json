I somewhat agree with you : if you had a given amount of mass available for weapons on your ship, you would do more DPS, essentially, by putting that mass into railgun/coilguns. The TLDR reason for that is the an FEL has a lot of heavy components, and a semiconductor laser heats itself up, while the superconducting magnets in a coilgun do not.

Essentially, it would be a golf ball sized slug, and the rocket motor might be a series of solid rocket propellant \u0022pits\u0022 drilled into the slug. Electrical igniters under control of a tiny computer would set off these pits. The slug would use crude sensors to detect a carrier beam coming from the launching ship that would orient it in space and tell it course corrections in flight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason to do it this way is that a railgun/coilgun is not itself subject to the rocket equation. It could send the slugs at 10-20 kilometers/second (the slugs heat up when in the armature of a railgun or barrel of a coilgun, so the limit to how fast the slugs can be launched would depend on heating among other problems) without the slugs needing to carry 20 kps worth of delta-v onboard. And that\u0027s the other problem : rocket engine designs exist that have large delta v, but those engines are things like orion drives and nuclear salt engines and nuclear electric engines. All those engines are \u003Cstrong\u003Ehuge \u003C/strong\u003E: scaling laws means they cannot be miniaturized.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo missiles, by necessity, either are something that will run out of fuel quickly while chasing a target running away on orion drive, or they are essentially robot spacecraft the size of a modern day rocket or bigger that you are throwing away. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you could shoot down an incoming missile the size of a falcon 1 with a railgun or coilgun slug the size of a golf ball.

If the missile is incoming at 20 kilometer/second, and you intercept it 500 kilometers away with a railgun/coil/laser beam, then your spacecraft has 25 seconds to get out of the missile\u0027s shrapnel cloud. If your spacecraft has an orion drive or nuclear salt thruster able to accelerate at 10 m/s^2, then it could \u0022dodge\u0022 by 3 kilometers and avoid the big pieces from the missile\u0027s debris cloud.

IE: No surprise attacks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESupposition 7: Both sides have multiple ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESupposition 8: Excluding when part of a fleet or in orbit near an inhabited location, a ship without engines will be unlikely to receive aid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven these 8 suppositions and a basic understanding of physics one can extrapolate out a great many things about the ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtrapolation 1: Bigger ships will require more fuel to accelerate/maneuver to the same degree as smaller ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtrapolation 2: The greater the physical requirements of the weapons, the greater the ship will mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtrapolation 3: Ships will generally require engines capable of endurance burns (planet to planet travel), but also burst burns (\u0027dodging\u0027).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtrapolation 4: The direction that projects the maximum firepower of a ship will also present a minimum of risk to the engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtrapolation 5: The direction that projects the maximum firepower will endeavor to minimize the visible footprint of the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtrapolation 6: To some extent the ship will provide protection to the engines from the side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtrapolation 7: The fuel storage requires at least as much protection as the engines, preferably more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtrapolation 8: The thermal radiators will require some level of protection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a result of these extrapolations I believe it is fair to state that a likely warship design ends up being something resembling a cone (there are pros and cons for making this a longer or shorter cone) with a bit of a \u0022bowl\u0022 area in the rear. The engine(s) will be largely embedded within the bowl area in the back, and the fuel storage will be in the center of the ship, just forward the engines. The main thermal radiators will likely be focused in the rear of the ship in either the main \u0027bowl\u0027 or in their own similar enclosures. Expendable/stowable radiators will be on the cone itself, minimizing footprint to enemy, but not impeding ship systems. The usual assortment of thrusters for orientation/dodging will exist on the hull, likely with several backups. If the ship is expected to be going on a heavy war footing, then there would additionally be hardpoints to mount \u0027disposable\u0027 systems. IE: Increased fuel, heavy missiles, possibly things like SRBs, all things that can/will be tossed once used up for mass reasons. There will be 1 forward facing engine, for specific instances requiring large reverse thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReason 1: Any weapons on the outer surface of the cone can face forward, providing a maximum firepower orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReason 2: With the cone pointed towards the target, a minimal footprint of the ship is presented (less area for the enemy to target).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReason 3: With the cone pointed towards the target, the maximum effective mass of the ship is between the enemy and the fuel/engine section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReason 4: This shape presents an angled surface to the front and to perpendicular directions. Sloped armor provides additional defense from any hit not perpendicular to the slope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReason 5: In the event that the tactic of rolling the ship is necessary (preventing a laser from holding its spot?), you are still presenting a sloped surface to physical munitions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReason 6: In all but the most up-the-skirt style shots, the engine bell(s) are not exposed, indeed the shape of this location may provide a slight extra thrust boost as it could act as a larger bell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReason 7: The thermal radiators will be protected and in cases where no risk of damage from the side exists, they could extend backwards to increase efficiency (less radiating onto the ship itself).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReason 8: More radiators is pretty much always going to be better than less (only mass/stealth [hah] constraints are really going to restrict these).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow onto weapon systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most likely load out for these ships is going to have a relatively heavy complement of lasers/masers, a few railguns (2 minimum for full coverage), a bay for a limited assortment of small missiles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming the war footing mentioned, the ship would likely launch with several heavy missiles (3-5) attached the external hardpoints as well as some extra fuel tanks and a couple SRBs. In a scenario of a fight between say Mars and Earth, the ship assigned to defend Mars would likely utilize the SRBs alongside the main drive to get it the initial high thrust kick out of Mars orbit and on its way to intercept an attacking Earth ship. Once something approximating an intercept (at least insofar as the ships will be entering each others weapons ranges [note: YES railguns have a \u0022range\u0022, this is determined by the dV they can impart on the shots. Not enough and they cannot reach their target\u0027s orbit.]) was assured the Mars ship\u0027s opening move is the launch of the external missiles. All fuel utilized by the ship will be from the drop-tanks. Detaching can happen to increase maneuverability, decrease footprint, or because they are empty. At this point I need to pause to explain the tactics of the Mars ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing back to the beginning, a destroyed ship cannot complete its mission. This is desirable. A ship can be made incapable of completing its mission without being destroyed. This is also desirable. If you can incapacitate the crew, the combat ability of the ship is vastly decreased, namely in that repairs cannot be made. If you can destroy the ships engines, then you have removed their primary method of changing vector. This LIKELY means that the crew is going to die. Without another ship capable of intercepting it physically to transport repair materials or to offload the crew, the ship will never change vector and will either hit something, or likely enter some abysmal solar orbit far from help. Additionally, if the ship cannot execute large vector changes, it becomes that much easier to target for eventual destruction. The same eventuality occurs if the fuel supply is lost or expended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plan of the Martian ship is to force the Earth ship to maneuver itself into uselessness. Those missiles of yours will likely spread out a nice distance to both minimize the chances of being hit by the crossfire, but also to allow a greater chance that one of them will be in position to strike at the Earth ship. They will occasionally need to exert course changes in order to meet up with the Earth ship. The Earth ship has a choice, if it wants to, it can spend fuel dodging around in the hopes of forcing the missiles to waste too much of their fuel to allow for an intercept. Or, he can not care and just hope for the best. Note: The Earth ship has the advantage against the missiles. It knows the missiles want to hit it, so it knows where the missiles will try to put themselves. But the missiles don\u0027t know where the ship will try to put itself. Given this, the Earth ship can be imagined to have nigh-instant knowledge of what the missiles are doing and roughly when. If it shifts up, the missiles will need to shift up. Due to the light lag the missile has no way to tell if a 1 second up burn is going to stop at one second or not until that time has passed. If the Earth ship fires the main engines up for one second, then slams on the reverse engine (told you it would have a use) for 10 seconds, and the ships are at a range of 10 light seconds, it has executed a relatively massive vector change before the missiles even saw it happened. The missiles will begin reacting to the first burn before needing to react to the second. Meanwhile they don\u0027t know where the ship might be going to next.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I can continue on the logic, counter logic, etc, of missile vs ship combat. But in the end the result is that the ship is going to be spending fuel, probably whole lots of it. Now those of you who favor missiles are probably asking what the point of the rest of the weapons are when you have those missiles. Remember, while your missiles are on their way, you don\u0027t really have much to do. Adding more missiles won\u0027t really change what is happening. More missiles only means that you can repeat this process after the first have hit or missed. But more missiles with useful amounts of dV means you get much heavier, and thus less capable of dodging the enemy and HIS missiles. Now, while the enemies ship is bandying around in its fuel based chess match with the missiles, it is time for the lasers to make an appearance. Your lasers are not designed to burn through the enemy ship, no, that is certainly silly at these ranges. Your lasers are simply designed to dump as much heat as possible into the enemy ship. Remember all those radiators? You need them because YOU will be generating quite a lot of heat firing these beams, but also because you are going to likely be hit BY the enemy beams as well. You both are going to be sitting there trying to cook each other. You have an advantage over your missiles. While you still have the same light lag as they do (worse, since they are approaching the enemy at a faster rate than you, they are closer at any given instance of time and thus have less lag to deal with), you have the advantage that the Earth ship cannot tell where you are positioning your shots. Oh, like with the missiles, he can assume that your beams are going to be bracketing his ship (say 40% across the forward arc, 30% across the rear arc, 10% incase he translates \u0027up\u0027 and 10% for \u0027down\u0027, and 10% straight at him. While you may or may not have 10 lasers to fire, this rough distribution is probably the best to start with if they are being particularly dodgy, but of course adjust as necessary), so it really doesn\u0027t matter much which way he picks, he\u0027ll run into your flash-light beams of heat and pick up some for himself. Now, this isn\u0027t totally a very efficient exchange rate of heat generated vs heat deposited. At this point in the combat, that is perfectly fine. The more heat he picks up from your lasers (especially from running the engine as well) the better. As he heats up, he is going to need some method of dumping the heat that is faster than just radiators (especially because any radiators you are managing to hit with your beams, are losing their efficiency). Assuming that the fuel of both ships in question ends up being not a monopropellant, then you are both going to do the same thing. You are going to flush your ships in fuel to boil off the heat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s assume you are both working with good old chemical rockets. Flush your radiators, engines, and weapons with some of that liquid/gaseous hydrogen and boil it off into space. Chances are the heat in your ship has been building up pressure in your fuel tanks, since you have to vent it anyway, might as well have it take as much heat as possible. Starting with those external tanks you might still have of course. The hydrogen isn\u0027t dangerous until it comes into contact with the oxygen. Which you will of course use \u0022last\u0022 considering that if you\u0027d lost life support, you\u0027d rather have a bunch of extra oxygen than a bunch of hydrogen lying around. But once the fuel levels start getting unbalanced enough, switch over until they are equal again, then go back to hydrogen. Now what is this doing? Its making your enemy dump fuel! During this whole exercise, do not bother firing the railguns. They will generate heat you do not have the thermal budget for, for zero gain. The enemy ship is ALREADY dodging missiles (and technically your lasers), your railgun rounds are just going to miss and they get no utility out of causing him to waste extra fuel. This is because at the distances you are still fighting on, the Earth ship is not going to be anywhere near where you targeted the railgun rounds by the time they reach him. Bracketing him is worthless at these ranges since the necessary bracket size would have you quickly deplete your ammo stores. What you are going to want your railguns for at this point in time, is missile defense. You have the magic knowledge of where the missiles are going to be and what they are doing before the light of this event reaches you. Remember, they have to hit you, so they MUST react to you. You know what they have to do to hit you, so you can predict what they are doing. Sure they might not follow this prediction, but its a safe bet they will.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end though, lets assume that all the missiles have missed or otherwise been destroyed. While you are still at these absurd ranges, the fight will stick mostly with the lasers. You will occasionally potshot at/around the Earth ship, but this is mostly just to verify his fears that he needs to occasionally burst just a tiny bit from his thrusters/engines to change position to dodge. More fuel waste. Meanwhile the whole time, you two are lazing each other, dumping fuel for heat purposes, and maybe executing a major dodge to get a couple seconds reprieve (if your engine\u0027s heat efficiency is that good). Eventually though, assuming one crew hasn\u0027t managed to broil the other alive yet or surrendered, the ships will enter into railgun range. Where the cost of bracketing the enemy ship isn\u0027t very high. Now is when any last trump cards you have for heat come into play. The closer range means both that the railguns matter a lot (if you hole their engine or fuel source, they are out), but that lasers will hit more accurately, but now everybody needs to use their engines to dodge. At this point its a grudgematch to the death, play all the games you want with rotating ships, beam/railgun sprays. The victor will be determined most likely by who entered with the larger capacity to suck more heat. If not, it was then determined mostly by luck of the draw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point you might ask why bother having those small missiles that I had mentioned earlier? Simply because there are some situations your warship might find itself in that lend itself towards missiles rather than railguns or lasers. These situations are generally speaking only when the ships are at obscenely close ranges for space ships, such as in the same orbit as each other. They likely wouldn\u0027t have the dV necessary to perform an intercept on an interplanetary intercept. Lets say you need a nuke for some reason, these missiles at least let you have that without the expense of a full on system missile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow of course the whole darn thing changes if Q-Thrusters ARE real...no fuel requirements, absurd accelerations (and thus closing speeds), fuel-less missiles, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
