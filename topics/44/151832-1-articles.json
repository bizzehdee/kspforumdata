Often the antibodies start out in one species and end up being humanized (meaning information in one protein is replaced, bit by bit by information in another). There is a considerable amount of know-how and experience that goes into making some of these.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst you start with an antigen, It can be a whole protein or a segment of it. But thats actually not where it starts, because published X-ray crystallographic data has probably revealed a binding site or an enzymatic site you are interested in. So the first stage is to immunize into a model species such as Balb/C and generate an immune response. From this point you need to test for specificity and you need to find an assay that will give you the results you want. In the old days once you had specificity you would then create a hybridoma and then use multi-tier limiting dilution to screen the hybridoma lines for the specificities that are most similar to what you want (there is a whole process in that). We don\u0027t yet have a biologic, just a cell that produces something. Next the cells are expanded and injected in the peritoneal cavity of mice. The mice are then drained and you have an amount of antibody that you can used for testing in experimental animals. You will be doing this probably on 10 to 50 antibodies. Thats on the order of 50 mice per antibody. Meanwhile your cells are frozen into liquid nitrogen. The fast technique is gone now, pristane priming of mice has been pretty much ban by NIH for any institute that uses NIH money. The antibodies that make it to publication will be given a name like AMT-150 or B6H2F1 (limitiing dilution nomenclature). Then it goes through several rounds of publication and testing in different laboratories. Once the antibody has been tested the human on-variable parts of heavy chain and light chain will be genetically engineered into the mouse variable regions (1 or both chains, depends how the antibody works). This is then expressed in an E. Coli expression system. This whole process again is not one step, frequently does not work the first time, many PCR primers need to be made, remade . . . . .Then from the E.coli expression system you first have to test that it expresses, then you probably will have to move it to a system that optimizes folding and you can begin the first rounding of retesting. About this point big pharm is sniffing at your door, they might purchase here.\u00A0 In may have to be moved to a eucaryotic expressions system, and still further retested. Next you have to absolutely purify if from all microbial contaminants. The Hep B vaccine that was made about 15 years ago had a small amount of contaminant that caused severe autoimmmune disease in some of the recipients. Once its purified you can retest it in a model in-vivo system. Then you have to begin testing in human volunteers\u00A0 for tolerance, off to the prison system you go, but before you do that you have to establish its safe in animals. Next you can start looking, prolly in some country with relaxed protocols whether the drug is effective in humans. In very fatal diseases they may allow you test immediately. In one such test a drug was given and 6 of 12 recipients promptly died.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then the pharmaceutical companies just buy you out, the pay your university most of the price and you prolly get a new lab or a raise. Start to finish, around 15 years, the companies can do more quickly but they often don\u0027t publish what they have done, and some of the drugs have been pulled, so . . . . . After the wheel has been invented several times along of feild then big pharm starts making their own product de-novo, but in many cases we hardly know what it is that they produced.
