This is only useful speculation if the Kerbal universe doesn\u0027t have fictitious elements...the way the Kerbol system defies some of our conventional rules in comparison to our Solar System, there must be some unusual elements present to explain the phenomena.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn comparison to Venus, Eve is unusual in having large bodies of liquid as it\u0027s not hot enough to melt any rock and only certain types of metals but hot enough to vaporize most everything else. If memory serves, Venus is so scorching with such high pressure that no liquid exists anywhere on the planet\u0027s surface. Misty liquid sulpheric acid in the atmosphere though. At a whopping 92 bar though, it sure would feel like swimming if you attempted to \u0027walk\u0027 around on the surface. There weren\u0027t Earth-like explosive volcanoes ejecting matter for that reason... they all just sort of oozed out and around which accounts for the impressively weird topography of Venus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[EDIT] Looking through the elements, I suspect iodine is the most likely candidate with a melting point of \u003Cstrong\u003E114C\u003C/strong\u003E and a boiling point of \u003Cstrong\u003E184C\u003C/strong\u003E. Eve\u0027s surface of \u003Cstrong\u003E150C\u003C/strong\u003E is just hot enough for it to be liquid but not hot enough to boil away. That\u0027s if the surface temp is at a constant max of \u003Cstrong\u003E150C\u003C/strong\u003E though, the wiki says the surface low is \u003Cstrong\u003E-40C\u003C/strong\u003E which complicates things a bit since the oceans seem to not be centralized to a specific area and, that I know of, we don\u0027t have a heat map of Eve nor yearly temperature variations so not too much can be assumed. It\u0027s possible, but unseen because of KSP\u0027s limited nature, that the oceans freeze over constantly but we don\u0027t know much about the planet to speculate too much.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-28T22:52:46Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2013 10:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Good_Apollo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WhiteWeasel","CreatedById":59171,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-28T22:26:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMercury?
