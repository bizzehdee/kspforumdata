I\u0027m sure all of us here are well aware that the Shuttle program was based on some ill-conceived notions, both with respect to the demand for flights as well as the capability of NASA to execute rapid Shuttle turnaround. The Shuttle had some neat capabilities (launching payload along with service crew, e.g. Hubble) and promised abilities (sat recovery), but it was never really used like it could have been. And the flight rate was so low that reuse cost more than it saved.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut what if they had been right about the demand for the Shuttle\u0027s abilities? What if the market demanded a launch vehicle that could sent up large payloads along with crew, as well as occasionally retrieving sensitive cargo from orbit? What if the market was so saturated with demand that economies of scale were in full swing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s clear that even under those circumstances, the Shuttle\u0027s high refurbishment cost and lengthy turnaround time wouldn\u0027t have been the best fit (even ignoring its safety record). But what might have been better? If you were designing a launch vehicle with these sorts of target capabilities, how would you go about it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-24T03:13:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022rombus04.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/images/surfaceorbit/rombus04.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bono.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i94.photobucket.com/albums/l103/Raventree442000/bono.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would need a return aeroshell for bringing stuff down, I suppose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-24T03:14:11Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2017 03:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by tater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-24T03:21:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223032439\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022159683\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221493003603\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022119411\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tater\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 minutes ago, tater said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would need a return aeroshell for bringing stuff down, I suppose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRhombus was always a nice concept -- beats out SERV handedly by using recoverable drop tanks and not worrying about the landing turbojets.

The extant commercial crew vehicles can do taxi service to LEO. Heavy payloads should be lifted with heavy lifters. 450 tons means that you build what you need, and you don\u0027t need to mess around with 200 launches of 20 tons, you send it all up in one go, or maybe 2 if volume is an issue.
