Ever since I found KSP in 0.8 I have always loved space, and I now want to become a Aerospace Engineer. I know many of you in our community are experienced with Space mechanics and know much about the topic, So I was wondering if any of you could give me some ideas for a really educational and fun Aerospace/Aerodynamics Topic for science Fair \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJr6150x\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mushroomman","CreatedById":236,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-02T03:58:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMake a 2 stage bottle rocket.

You could try pressurizing a 2-litre bottle and filling it first with water as a control group, and then replacing the water with different reaction masses, possibly trying flour, dirt, or any other kinds of things that you could propel out of the back of the bottle. Time your launches to see which stays in the air the longest, and that would be your \u0022height traveled\u0022 which in turn could tell you which of the propellants you tested is the most optimal. Obviously you would need multiple launches per propellant, and you would have to explain your predictions. /Why/ do you think one propellant would be the best or worst? What sets it apart from the others? Determine what factors from the environment around you could pose a problem to perfectly accurate data, for example, the wind blowing may create slight bits of lift on the bottle and slightly skew the descent time, or parallax caused by your reaction time on the stopwatch. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps you could also factor in aerodynamics, try making different nose cones and doing launches with each propellant, seeing which nosecone would yield the longest amount of time in the air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a starter, the bottle with the closest body to the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sears%E2%80%93Haack_body\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESears-Haack Body\u003C/a\u003E will likely get the furthest in an aerodynamics test. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, moving this thread over to the science labs, the people over there live for threads like this. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jr6150x","CreatedById":61112,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-02T04:26:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk thanks!
