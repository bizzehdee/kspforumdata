Above 50km it\u0027s safe to discard your fairings, no need to drag those along to orbit. Exact numbers in the above are somewhat variable depending on how you design your rockets, how quick you are with the controls, etc, but it\u0027s a good starting point. At every flight, notice what could be better and adjust your checkpoints for that.

to launch 7 astronauts as many times as they could, and using crewed flights to launch satellites was a way to get Congress to fund more and more crewed missions.\u00A0 As far as I know (and this might only be with the latest revision of electronics), the only thing really required for an uncrewed shuttle launch/landing was an extra long cable (and presumably quite a bit of software, I doubt NASA was willing to let anyone write it without an act of Congress).\u00A0 This made every satellite/probe proposal have to think whether or not such a mission was worth risking 7 lives just to get it in space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t forget that the computers NASA had on the ground were unlikely to be all that spectacular.\u00A0 The birth of supercomputing can be traced to CDC shipping the CDC6600 in 1964, but early models typically went to intelligence services (who paid a hefty premium for serial #0001 or whatever special model CDC was selling).\u00A0 They may have been able to check the Apollo trajectories on one of these, but recent history implies that they\u0027d prefer hand/sliderule calculations (it didn\u0027t help that Seymour Cray didn\u0027t like parity memory either).\u00A0 64 bit floating point calculations were an afterthought in computing before the CDC6600, and tend to be rather important in computing for spaceflight (KSP uses 32 bit floats, and this leads to all sorts of issues most notably the \u0022Kraken\u0022 of yore that simply deleted ships going too fast or too far from Kerbin.\u00A0 Havester was so impressed by his work-around to prevent this that he named his next company after the
