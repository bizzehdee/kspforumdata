What they mean by \u0022unpredictable\u0022 is that it\u0027s always changing because of Charon\u0027s and Pluto\u0027s orbital motions around the common baricenter. As there is no resonance between Charon/Pluto and Nix, for example, at one point in the orbit Nix might have a certain inclination, and then a full, exact orbit later it might have a completely different inclination. Sure, it\u0027s physics, so once you know the various forces etc. at work you can predict anything, so \u0022unpredictable\u0022 is kinda misleading, although not 100% in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus, the interactions with Kerberos and Styx should be pretty meaningful, since the system is so tiny and squeezed.

Now this example I just made is kinda stupid but you can easily see how things get dramatically complex very quickly as you need to consider 5/6 bodies and you have to know a lot about each of them (position, rotation, period, mass, momentum etc). I suspect that even New Horizons\u0027 great data won\u0027t be enough to allow us to predict Nix\u0027s rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"epoca","CreatedById":136475,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T22:29:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat makes sense, thank you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frida Space","CreatedById":60943,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T22:48:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, I was making an updated plot for the trajectory of New Horizons through the Pluto system and things are a bit out of my reach.

My main source in this case is an email conversation I had with the atmospheric studies lead scientist for New Horizons. This is what he told me regarding timing (I didn\u0027t directly ask him for timing, I just asked him about the occultation science). In \u003Cstrong\u003Ebold\u003C/strong\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9 I wrote my comment:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(please note we had this conversation between Feb-March 2015, so it\u0027s very recent)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The solar and radio occultations mostly overlap in time (since the Earth and Sun are very close together as seen from Pluto); the Pluto occultations are about an hour after closest approach (e.g., we will observe the solar ingress at Pluto from 12:16-12:49 UT on July 14th, and expect the Sun to set at about 12:47 UT; closest approach to Pluto is expected at 11:50 UT). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAccording to most sources (see 1st plot above \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.planetary.org/multimedia/space-images/charts/new_horizons_pluto_closest_approach_geometry_112007_3_lg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eand this other one\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E), the encounter will be at 11:47 and not at 11:50 (I know it\u0027s not a huge difference, but as the flyby will be extremely quick it kinda is). For the occultation I decided, for the sake of semplicity, to consider only egress, so: Pluto-Sun occultation is 12:47 according to him, and 12:48 according to the first plot, which is acceptable. Not really sure when the Pluto-Earth radio occultation is, the 12:49 on the first plot seems realistic.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther sources (both are NASA documents):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s21.postimg.org/8u6bc6813/graph2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022graph2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s21.postimg.org/ptf9rfj8n/graph.png\u0022 alt=\u0022graph.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my preliminary design.
