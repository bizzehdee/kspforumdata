Today is the 42nd Earth day since I arrived on the moon. I\u0027ve got some good news, and a piece of bad news. Which would you like to hear first?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first good news is: After 42 days of hard work, I\u0027ve rolled over 100 metres across the moon! All the equipment that I\u0027ve brought along -- ground-penetrating radar, stereo cameras, alpha particle X-ray spectrometer and infrared spectrometer -- have collected lots of useful data... When going on a long trip, it would be such a shame if the equipment you brought along couldn\u0027t be put to good use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second bit of good news is: the day before yesterday, at dawn, I spoke with the lander over 20 metres away. I did this all by myself, without shi-fu\u0027s help, using my UHF antenna! Even though she can\u0027t respond, I\u0027m sure she\u0027s really happy. Well, what I whispered to her is a secret, so please don\u0027t ask me what I told her... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third piece of good news is: yesterday morning, the lander has fallen asleep, all prepared to welcome the next lunar night.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bad news is: I should have fallen asleep this morning. But before going to sleep, my shi-fus found an abnormality in my control mechanisms. Some parts of my body aren\u0027t listening to my shi-fus. Now, my shi-fus are racking their brains and forgoing sleep, trying to come up with a solution. I hear that their eyes have become as red as a rabbit\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven so, I know it\u0027s possible that I won\u0027t survive the night. Before we set off, the lander and I learned the history of mankind\u0027s lunar exploration. In over 130 lunar exploration activities, about half succeeded, and half failed. Some didn\u0027t land, some lost contact with Earth after landing, some rovers got lost, and some rovers didn\u0027t take their first step. Such is space exploration, as dangerous as it is beautiful. And here I am, a tiny speck in the vast map of space exploration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis time, I landed together with Third elder sister Chang\u0027E, and sent back so much data. We\u0027ve completed the mission our shi-fus tasked us with. I hoped to romp around here for three months, and tell all of you about the rocks and boulders I found, the secrets hiding beneath the moon\u0027s surface, the story of Chang\u0027E and me... but even if this trip has to be cut short, I\u0027m not afraid. Regardless whether I can be repaired, my failure will give my shi-fus valuable information and experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t worry. In 2017, Chang\u0027E 5 will come here, and continue telling the story where I left off. Right now, the lander is working fine, and will continue to work on the moon for at least 1 year. But she still doesn\u0027t know about my problem... I hope that shi-fu will help me recover. But if I don\u0027t get better, please help me comfort her.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe sun has set here on the moon, and it\u0027s getting very cold very quickly. I\u0027ve already said so much today, but it never feels like it\u0027s enough. I\u0027ll let you in on a secret. Actually, I don\u0027t feel very sad. Like all protagonists, in the story of my own adventure, I\u0027ve just hit a little problem.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGoodnight, Earth.
