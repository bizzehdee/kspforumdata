It was about a guy who hopes to build a complete, working model of a human brain in a computer. He claims that, if it works, it will be a fully intelligent, sentient, self-aware intelligence. I thought to myself, \u0022Nah, you can\u0027t have real intelligence in a computer. The only thing computers can do is follow strict instruction!\u0022 But then I began thinking, and started to get pretty existential. What exactly is intelligence? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s say that this model of a brain does work. It gets every single neuron right, and every connection between them right. If it gets everything right, then one can reasonably assume that it would function like a human brain and be intelligent. But what would that mean for us? Simple: It would mean that every single one of our thoughts, feelings, actions, ideas, etc. is governed, on some level, by simple, inescapable commands: When neuron A pulses\u003Csup\u003E1\u003C/sup\u003E, neuron B does, too. When neuron D pulses\u003Csup\u003E1\u003C/sup\u003E, neuron a synapse\u003Csup\u003E1\u003C/sup\u003E forms between it and neuron C. So then, what is free will?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut on the other hand, consider this: Thousands of man-hours are spent writing the most complex code ever written, on the largest supercomputer ever built, and when it\u0027s turned on, nothing happens.\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E Every detail is perfect, every neuron, every synapse, everything.

If we decide that intelligence is the salient property, then it would be unethical to treat any \u0022sentient\u0022 computer system in a way we would not so treat ourselves, even if we knew for certain that that system were incapable of feeling pain. While I am firmly in the latter camp as regards the basis of morality, there does not appear to be any a priori reason why one choice would be more appropriate than the other. Indeed, evolution tends to suggest that picking the former is the superior option (insofar as species which choose the latter might quickly cease to be species when confronted with entities which chose the former); although as an aside I should note that thinking similar to the former choice has been used to justify some truly horrible events in our past.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Csup\u003E1-6\u003C/sup\u003EI was going to build a footnote labyrinth here, a la XKCD, but, as it turns out, I\u0027m far too lazy to actually put in that much effort.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-05T01:43:29Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2013 01:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Stochasty\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jheriko","CreatedById":67666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-05T01:40:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, there are a few things I\u0027d like to say about this... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly in a strictly purist sense I do not believe that there is anything particularly special to distinguish the laws of nature that apply to me over, say, this chair I am sitting on. Life is basically unmeasurable and unquantifiable if you are looking for anything beyond a certain accuracy, and so I believe is sentience as a property of life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts a very useful label - the example that springs to mind is the pile of sand. As we add grains one by one we can never say when they become a pile - we can conclude (wrongly) that therefore the pile doesn\u0027t exist. It does infact exist, but it is a useful approximation to reality that we employ because stating precise numbers of sand is impossible - we have some ballpark idea that we call a pile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same is so with life and its many properties. Some are defined \u0027precisely\u0027 in terms of chemistry or other criteria, but even those can be challenged in this way... right the way down to constituent parts and even the logic and background for our theories. I\u0027ve seen very reasonable arguments that any complete theory of everything (with some assumptions about how good GR and QFT are...) has no precise concept of \u0027vacuum\u0027 or \u0027state\u0027, that measurements become meaningless at the tiny scale, things like space and time lose meaning and are emergent from something else - or even the concept of countability being unusable (and hence lots of axiomatic set theory, on which we base almost all of our mathematics and science).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there is the question of what we think of as life in concrete examples... What about prions, which are tiny protein fragments which will replicate in vivo displaying a key property of what we consider life - to reproduce? Virions which are essentially giant molecules and do the same, maybe more by encoding for genes that affect their hosts... or viruses which are the same but happen to be encapsulated in protein that their RNA/DNA encodes the genes for assembling... and what about bacteria and so on? There are also stranger things like Spiegelman\u0027s monster... a strange result of forced evolution containing \u0027merely\u0027 a few hundred atoms, but able to replicate itself in the presence of RNA replicase? Where do we draw the line? What about software? By some measures computer viruses can be considered alive - and thanks to radiation, error tolerances and various other quirks of nature they are now evolving, live, in an artificial ecosystem. \u0027Artificial\u0027 is another one of those words though - where do we draw the line? How is my house or a factory any less natural than an ant hill or a beehive? How derived does a tool need to be before it stops being natural? On the flipside how can we justify not considering prions, virions, Spiegelman monsters or computer viruses to be life? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAside from this I don\u0027t think you really know how the brain works - lets be honest here. No offence, its just that whilst neural networks are certainly capable of learning and are powerful tools for this, they are not the only functionality in the brain - there are many functions which are poorly understood on the cellular level involving the ion channels and their self-regulation which have effects on the neuron firings. The glial cells are also less well understood than the neurons, but are known to be important and at least partly responsible for brain function. I think the best neuroscientists will even deny having a good or near complete understanding of the matter and medicine is one of the more \u0027dangerous\u0027 of sciences for constant changing its mind and not being able to easily carry out good quality of experiments to pin things down (not always such a bad thing...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are plenty of people working on artificial neural networks and machine learning in general btw, and making things that can be considered intelligent has already happened, arguably going right back to the perceptron. In fact I believe the human neural summing function is known (or at least some generalisation or approximation of it) but being the result of chemical processes which come out of messier math than we have even invented yet it is a monsterous thing to calculate using classical computing resources. I wish I could quote a source for this because a figure here would really help pin down exactly how feasible it will ever be to build a \u0027true\u0027 replica of the neural network in the brain using classical computers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not subscribe to free will or any interpretations of quantum mechanics (including those which claim to have uncovered the magic of free will) - I prefer the \u0022it just works and the abstractions I use in my daily life are as useful for describing this as \u0027pile\u0027 is when discussing sand\u0022 interpretation.
