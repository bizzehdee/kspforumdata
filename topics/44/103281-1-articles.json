However, CG change only results in a gentle control moment - what it does quite a lot of is reduce or increase aircraft stability margins. If someone actively pushed the nose down and everyone moved to the back of the plane, all that would happen is the plane would become rather more twitchy as it was forced to the ground, if the pilot was truly determined - or if just pushing down gently, and not trying to keep the plane under control, then you might overpower the controls, but you would then very quickly push the aircraft into a stall and lose control altogether."},{"CreatedByName":"Armchair Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":76165,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T03:35:59Z","Content":"One thing not mentioned: airliners are narrow enough that you couldn\u0027t control roll with this method.

Sometimes the pilot has to pull dangerous measure like hard landing on water, and if the system thought it is sabotage, it could cause further problem, like trying to pull up and perhaps hit a building on the way.\n\nI think it would be better if we have more reliable communication system that can reach across the world in a short time. If the system detect strange trajectory/movement, it will send a signal back to the nearest ground control responsible for the plane, and ground control can see what is going on, and perhaps talk the pilot out of it.

There is a point (usually when a plane exceeds its critical AOA and stalls) that the autopilot shuts off. This is done as a safety feature to prevent the autopilot from flying the plane into a deep stall.
