Its a histogram comparing the number of rockets to payload inserted on LEO in metric tonnes, subdivided based on the four extant rocket fuel types (Yellow-orange for solid rockets, sickly reddish-brown for hypergolic, smoggy dark grey for kerosene and O2, and etherial lavender for O2 and H2)\n\nBlock IB System, Falcon Heavy are included because I think they are very likely to fly, and because they make up a unique payload class. Oh and Long March 5 in its various configurations is also included. Since some rockets are configurable to to multiple payload classes (like Angara, Delta II, Delta IV, or Long March 2/3/4) I included multiple data points for each configuration with a fairly significant payload difference. For example in the Atlas V family there are data points for each number of SRMs from naught to five, while the fairing diameter and whether its SEC or DEC doesn\u0027t much change payload class. Plus IIRC, DEC has never flown.\n\n![CdWZwTph.png](http://i.imgur.com/CdWZwTph.png)\n\nI think it shows some interesting trends - some fairly apparent, like how high-energy rocket fuel is reserved for large payloads, and solid fuel rockets are limited to very small payloads. Some other interesting facts I learned - about 16% of all extant rocket families use RD-170 (and direct derivatives) as primary propulsion, and more than *half* of all kerosene-fuel rockets use RD-170 as primary propulsion.\n\nThanks for looking at this thing I made! I think its pretty interesting, and I hope some of you guys do too. Which is likely because this is a forum for a game about launching rockets."},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T08:07:30Z","Content":"Would love names on the rockets too ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nNote that both ariane and the shuttle are basically solid fuel first stage, core has an TWR less than 1 on launch."},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T21:35:56Z","Content":"What does the X axis represent?

For GSLV Mk III since the core does most of the work, even though it ignites just before booster sep, I called it hypergolic rather than solid."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T23:28:24Z","Content":"What program did you use?\n\nMaybe a bunch of people could work on all rockets throughout history that have the data?"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T23:37:45Z","Content":"Hydrazine?
