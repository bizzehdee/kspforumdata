And then you\u0027d need a lot of dV to get into Pluto orbit, and almost as much to get into an orbit within the Kuiper Belt. If you did enter a kuiper belt orbit, it could be another 50 years before you encountered another really interesting object.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew Horizons is pretty light by interplanetary probe standards, and launched on the heaviest Atlas V variant, so I don\u0027t think it would have been possible to get much more dV out of it. To perform a Pluto mission that didn\u0027t end in solar escape in a reasonable timeframe would be HARD. I don\u0027t know the exact dV requirements, but I would guess that with chemical propulsion only, you\u0027d need a launcher on the scale of Saturn V or SLS to deliver a reasonable payload. With any other propulsion, you\u0027d probably need a nuclear reactor, either for a NTR or to power some kind of electric engine. Either way, it would be an extremely ambitious mission for a very small target. With the same budget, you could probably put a submarine on Europa, a Curiosity-sized rover (or boat) on Titan, or a permanently flying airplane or balloon on Venus or Titan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I wanted to study a KBO in detail, I\u0027d probably go for Triton.
