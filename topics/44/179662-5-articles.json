(At least that\u0027s true on the bigger Boeings that were my purview.) The\u00A0 mechanism brings the door in and then down onto the stops on the fuselage. Pressurization loads are resisted by the stops, not by the latches and, those pressurization loads push the doors closed more tightly.\u00A0 The doors are rigged so that all the stops are loaded equally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoeing has built a lot of doors on a lot of airplanes over the decades.

The AD doesn\u0027t specify what inspections should be done, but I expect that they\u0027ll remove the plug, do some NDT inspections on the stops and then double check the rigging and that the plug is properly retained when it is unpressurized. (Because, again, the ones I am familiar with are designed to seat more firmly as the aircraft is pressurized, and if they\u0027re properly positioned, they wont go anywhere once loaded). The mandate may also require repetitive inspections at some interval that can be done in the course of normal maintenance (e.g. A-check intervals) once the first round of \u0022before further flight\u0022 inspections are completed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-07T07:14:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://news.alaskaair.com/alaska-airlines/operations/as-1282/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://news.alaskaair.com/alaska-airlines/operations/as-1282/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(I\u0027m cutting out a bit of marketing and corporate speak, so check full text)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[...]Alaska made the decision to temporarily ground its 737-9 MAX fleet pending inspections which began early this morning.\u00A0[...]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[...]Today, the FAA issued an emergency airworthiness directive (EAD), requiring all operators of the 737-9 MAX aircraft to conduct specific inspections before returning the aircraft to service.[...]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[...]Our voluntary temporary grounding of our 737-9 MAX fleet and ongoing work to comply with the FAA\u2019s EAD\u00A0[...]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[...]Eighteen of Alaska\u2019s 737-9 MAX aircraft received in-depth inspections as part of heavy maintenance checks and continued in service today until we received the FAA\u2019s EAD.

The inspections required will depend on what they think the failure mode might be. They might cast a wide netand look at lots of things while they have it open, or they may have a good idea of the failure mode and focus on just that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThey might also call for a progressive inspection where if you find A, you have to do B, but if you don\u0027t find A you can close it back up. And if it is something that might recurr, crop up over time or get worse over time, then they\u0027ll call for a repeat inspection too.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"darthgently","CreatedById":204885,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-07T17:42:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom a layman\u0027s view, looks like the entire door frame pulled free?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedOther\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed4251431537\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026amp;module=system\u0026amp;controller=embed\u0026amp;url=https://twitter.com/Kyrinker/status/1743470896638300339?t=b9lIH6A8dkF6_Kq_OSF1wA%26s=19\u0022 style=\u0022height:188px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-07T18:14:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224356764\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022179662\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221704649338\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204885\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022darthgently\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n27 minutes ago, darthgently said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom a layman\u0027s view, looks like the entire door frame pulled free?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo. Watch the vid I posted above about the mid-cabin exit doors.
