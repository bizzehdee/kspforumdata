If you have 2 masses at infinite distance of one another their relative velocity for an orbit would be 0. This makes sense if you look at the equations for (newtonian) gravity:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EF = G*M*m/r^2. If you move 2 objects apart the upper term would stay the same but the lower term would quickly become huge. At infinite distance you get:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EF = x/infinite = 0. So there is no pull between the objects. Without pull you can\u0027t make an orbit with a speed above 0.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-29T14:11:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nachtwind\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nachtwind\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs there even a point where relative speed can drop to 0 at all?
