When this is the case any forces on the wheels are infinitesimal.\n\nIt takes no force from the belt to rotate the wheels freely or to speed them up or slow them down and there is no resistance from the wheel hub. The wheels spin freely to match whatever speed the belt is moving completely decoupled from the plane. The plane doesn\u0027t care what the wheels are doing it sees no force through the wheel hub.\n\nNow add wheel mass/inertia. The force of the belt on the wheels is not a couple, or pure torque. It exerts a moment so that when the belt is accelerating it spins up the wheels. But the force at the rim must be matched by a force at the hub in order to hold the wheel stationary relative to the plane (Resolving forces). This force does act as a drag on the plane, but it\u0027s tiny relative to the forces the plane\u0027s engines are capable of exerting because it takes very little force to spin a wheel compared to moving a plane, so inertialess is a good first approximation. And this force only acts whilst the belt is accelerating relative to the plane. At constant speed no force is required to change the wheels\u0027 velocity. \n\nNow add wheel hub friction. A resistive torque at the wheel hub is opposed by a force from the belt creating a torque that holds the wheel to the speed of the belt. But as we\u0027ve previously established, force from the belt is not a pure torque. So the force of the belt on the wheel rim is reacted at the wheel hub. It acts as a constant drag on the plane. But wheel hubs are built to have very low coefficients of friction. This rolling resistance is tiny compared to the force required to accelerate a whole plane. Therefore frictionless wheel hubs are a very good first approximation.\n\nThe belt is capable of exerting tiny drag forces on the plane. The plane\u0027s engines are massively more capable of exerting force on the plane. Therefore for any reasonable speed of belt it doesn\u0027t matter what the belt is doing. The plane can just apply thrust to overcome it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-05-16T08:10:21Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2018 08:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by RCgothic**"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-16T08:31:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 12 hours ago, DAL59 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E But\uFEFF, the plane\u0027s wheels need to spin in order for the plane to move forward.  \uFEFF\n\u003E \n\nA Paddle Steamer can get up to the river head against the river current and the paddle is still spinning.\n\nAnd that\u0027s something that powers the \u0022wheel\u0022 directly.

Think a long flat, but moving, river.  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The water creates drag on the pontoons, but the engines have enough power to overcome that drag, accelerate to take off speed, and lift off. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E This is identical to a plane on a treadmill, but with more drag applied.\n\u003E \n\nNo, because fluid drag is proportional to the square of velocity.\n\nIn practice, seaplanes typically take off pointing upstream, because the downstream flow of water creates a headwind. But imagine that the air at the water surface is stationary with respect to the bank. In order to accelerate to takeoff speed, your engine needs to overcome the fluid drag on your pontoons produced when you move through the water. Suppose that a plane typically takes off at 40 knots. If the water is moving downstream at 10 knots, then it will need to accelerate to 50 knots relative to the water surface, and the drag produced on the pontoons just before liftoff will actually be 156% of normal drag. If the water is moving downstream at 20 knots, the plane will need to accelerate to 60 knots relative to the water, and the drag will go up to 225%. If the water is moving at 40 knots, then drag will go up to 400%.\n\nContrast this with the airplane on the treadmill. Suppose the airplane\u0027s takeoff speed is 40 knots and normal rolling drag on a flat runway inhibits the airplane\u0027s progress by a force of 100 Arbitrary-Force-Units (AFU). If we move the airplane from the runway to a treadmill and do not turn the treadmill on, then rolling drag will still be 100 AFU. If we turn the treadmill on to operate at a constant 10 knots, rolling drag...will still be 100 AFU. If the treadmill is turned on to 50 knots, rolling drag will still be 100 AFU. If the treadmill runs at 100 knots or 200 knots or 500 knots, rolling drag will still be 100 AFU. The speed of the conveyor belt does not change the forces acting on the plane.\n\nIf you want the pontoon example to match,  you\u0027d need to say that the pontoons are coated in some kind of nearly-frictionless oil that has a set amount of drag and doesn\u0027t get more draggy matter how fast it goes.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 19 minutes ago, cubinator said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E 1 hour ago, DAL59 said:\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \u003E 10 hours ago, cubinator said:\n\u003E \u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \u003E \u003E Quote\n\u003E \u003E \u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \u003E \u003E The treadmill is equivilent to brakes.\n\u003E \u003E \u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \u003E If that were so, then you couldn\u0027t drive a car on a treadmill.\n\u003E \u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E You can, but it won\u0027t get anywhere.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E True - for a car, the treadmill can prevent it from moving because the rotation of the wheels is a determinant of how fast the car can go.
