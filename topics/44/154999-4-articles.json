No, you said words to the effect that a recruitment policy which takes gender into account is a demonstration of widespread female privilege. 2. I can\u0027t quote it directly because you have deleted the original remarks and substituted something entirely new above my response.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Treating people equally is a nonsense goal. 4. Working towards equality of opportunity in broader society is a much more rational approach but we are not talking about that here.\u00A05.\u00A0NASA is working towards a particular \u003Cem\u003Eoutcome\u003C/em\u003E. 6. What you are asking is that NASA implement a recruitment policy which pays attention to, and only to, the particular criteria which you think are important and has as its only goal the outcome which you prefer. 7. Gender balance, quite obviously, not being one of those criteria in either methodology nor desired outcome. 8.\u00A0NASA, equally obviously, completely disagrees with your preferences. 9.\u00A0Either way, it is obvious that \u0022No women would volunteer\u0022 is simply wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n10.

I am not going to get into a full-on debate about entitlement vs desert here nor about the ethical status of inclusivity policies or the myths of meritocracy, the KSP forums are emphatically not the place for that. 13. We have, I believe, quite clearly established that the idea that any component or aspect of space exploration or colonization would or should just naturally or statistically be one hundred percent male is flatly incorrect. 14. If you need a more complete explanation of why it is also pernicious and offensive another venue would be more appropriate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. If a recruitment policy discriminates based on gender it is systematic sexism (as one of the few actual examples of such things)\u00A0and if it is discrimination against men and picking women over men, solely on the basis of their gender it is female privilege.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. And I stick to it...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. So you are in favor of discrimination?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. You are not arguing in favor of equality of opportunity, you are arguing for equality of outcome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn regards to NASA\u0027s astronaut application, there is equality of opportunity, since both genders can apply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever if you combine NASA\u0027s astronaut stats and combine it with CSA\u0027s numbers, then there is not equality of outcome for the individual, since women are preferentially selected, which is discrimination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Yes, the outcome of nice equal graphs, while apparently simultaniously exhibiting sexist discrimination towards men. That\u0027s not a step forwards... that is step backward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. No, I have never said NASA should implement a recruitment policy, which pays attention to criteria I think are important.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m saying that putting the criteria of gender into the recruitment policy is sexist and it is... per definition.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the goal of eliminating gender from recruitment policy is for NASA to not be sexist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7. It can be a criteria, but not by perpetuating sexist policies against the individuals applying... If you want gender balance, you\u0027ll need for more women to want to become astronauts and I don\u0027t think\u00A0that\u0027s NASA\u0027s responsibility.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally I think gender balance for the sake of genderbalance is a silly goal. Gender balance is only about having a graph look nicely balanced for people with a weird\u00A0need for graphs to look nicely balanced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaking sure individuals can apply for eg. becomming an astronaut and be selected to do so, irregardless of gender... Now that is fighting sexism and being universally fair in regards to gender.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8. And apparently supporting sexist hiring practices.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n9. And that is why noone said that, but you strawmanning others. The original statement, that women, on\u00A0average,\u00A0are less inclined to risky behaviour and men, on average,\u00A0are more inclined to risky behaviour, is supported by the CSA application numbers and eg. how many young\u00A0men die in traffic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n10. Because, if all applicants, on average, are equal and we have no reason not to think so, then it suggest that women are preferentially selected to become astronauts, solely because they are women.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n11. It is an irrelevant point, without compairing those numbers to the number of male applicants.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n12. You are right, the KSP forums are not... but you brought it up, by misreading and misrepresenting someones post.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n13. Once again... Noone said that it should be like that... A person mentioned that men are more likely to engage in risky behaviour, which is backed up by numerous surveys and statistics and applied it to colonizing mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n14. It\u0027s not offensive, unless people have a problem with accepting objective reality, that one average, men and women do exhibit differences. What is offensive... is if NASA preferentially hires one gender (men or women) over the other gender (men or women), solely because of gender. Which is sexist hiring practices and something we should have left behind in the 50\u0027s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I would think it equally offensive, if in some\u00A0other area, there would be 70 percent female applicants, 30 percent male applicants and, if everything else is equal, 50 percent men were hired, solely because they were men... and everyone genuinely wanting equality for individuals, rather than pie charts in the sky, would agree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-08T12:47:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat offensive for girls would be in the assumption that girls are just too clever to be like them? :\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022kermans.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/158/370/kermans.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-08T13:02:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222948672\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022154999\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221486556742\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002297559\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u002278stonewobble\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n35 minutes ago, 78stonewobble said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.

This is an issue that comes up frequently in regards to racism, sexism, multiculturalism and\u00A0\u003Cem\u003E \u003C/em\u003Esimilar areas, this notion of \u0022all discrimination is always bad\u0022, the idea (for example) that making a distinction based, to whatever degree, upon gender is therefore sexism. This is simply not true. As I mentioned earlier and as Nibb31 touched upon there is much more going on in something like the astronaut selection process or a university admissions program than some sort of blind, strictly score-based meritocratic filter. Clearly those people who would most likely triumph in a blind, strictly score-based selection process would prefer that that was how these things were done but the problem is that you don\u0027t get to dictate such things. A process isn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Ewrong \u003C/em\u003Ejust because it addresses more than one goal or because it addresses a goal that you don\u0027t care about. Obviously a university admissions program that only pays attention to your grades is very appealing to someone who has had excellent nutrition since infancy, a safe and stable home environment and easy admittance to all the finest schools. But just because you \u003Cem\u003Ecould \u003C/em\u003Equalify if that were the university\u0027s admission program doesn\u0027t mean that therefore the the university \u003Cem\u003Eshould \u003C/em\u003Euse that standard. The fact that you have privileges doesn\u0027t mean you deserve them. I have absolutely no problem (in general) with programs that take a broader view, seek to ameliorate imbalance and to eventually make themselves unnecessary. So am I in favour of discrimination \u003Cstrong\u003Ein the sense of the inclusion of consideration of the group, class or circumstance a person falls into when apportioning such opportunities\u003C/strong\u003E? Yes, \u003Cem\u003Esometimes\u003C/em\u003E I am.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis kind of \u0022Gotcha!\u0022 over a word is sophomoric. Discrimination which, in the vernacular, \u0022punches down\u0022 is to be abhorred. The old boy\u0027s networks, legacy admission scams and glass ceilings are not \u0022bad\u0022 simply because they are examples of discrimination, they are bad policies and institutions because they employ discrimination in order to promote and entrench imbalance and unfairness or in such a way that the end result is the promotion and continuation of existing imbalance and injustice. In short, they do substantial harm throughout broader society in addition to whatever direct and immediate effect they may have. Programs and policies which seek to undo such pernicious states of affairs are not necessarily rendered \u003Cem\u003Eautomatically\u003C/em\u003E bad merely because they (in the strict and narrow sense of the word I am using here) discriminate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope that has made my general position clearer to you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-09T14:08:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222949490\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022154999\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221486604902\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022127797\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bill Phil\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 hours ago, Bill Phil said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSlave labor became uneconomical over a century ago.
