The actual mission would have been AS204, but the accident occured during a ground test among many others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first actual flights were AS201, AS202, and AS203, which were unmanned tests of the CSM and S-IVB launched with a S-1B.

The S-V flights were supposed to be numbered AS5xx.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey changed the numbering system for AS501 (the first unmanned flight of the Saturn V) to Apollo 4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that, Apollo 5 to 6 were unmanned tests, Apollo 7 to 10 were the first manned flight tests in LEO and around the Moon, and Apollo 11 to 17 are the well-documented lunar landings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESaturn V is just the name of the rocket chosen by Von Braun. There were lots of iterations in the development of the Saturn family, with S-I, S-IB and S-V being actual rockets, and S-IC and S-II being rocket stages and the S-IVB being the TLI stage... I\u0027m not sure how those numbers came up, but they are probably a mix of design iterations and variants.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the Mercury program, the official names of the missions were Mercury-Redston (MR-x) and Mercury-Atlas (MA-x). The astronauts each named their capsules with callsigns such as \u003Cem\u003EFaith-7\u003C/em\u003E, \u003Cem\u003EFreedom-7\u003C/em\u003E or \u003Cem\u003ESigma-7\u003C/em\u003E. The 7 was because there were 7 astronauts in the space program at the time. The tradition of the astronauts naming their spacecraft ended with Gemini, but resumed with Apollo (with names like \u003Cem\u003ESpider \u003C/em\u003Eand \u003Cem\u003EGumdrop\u003C/em\u003E, or \u003Cem\u003ESnoopy \u003C/em\u003Eand \u003Cem\u003ECharlie Brown\u003C/em\u003E, and of course \u003Cem\u003EEagle \u003C/em\u003Eand \u003Cem\u003EColumbia\u003C/em\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Gemini missions were simply numbered from 1 to 12 (officially from I to XII).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-26T09:52:07Z\u0022 title=\u002207/26/2013 09:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 26, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pingonaut","CreatedById":15723,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T00:46:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, thanks Nibb.
