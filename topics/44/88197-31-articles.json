On massive objects like the earth its effect is always relative minor. Its effect accumulates over the vast emptyness of space. if you can imagine a hihgly eccentric orbit, the sweep area per time is uniform, then at apogee those particles are traveling real slow, and thus they spend most of their time closer to their apogees, and a small amount of time whizzing through \u0027earths\u0027 and shortly out of the sokar system again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
