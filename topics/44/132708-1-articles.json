But there\u0027s a catch - the tracks the particles follow do not always behave as one would expect from \u0022realistic\u0022 trajectories, but often in a fashion that has been termed \u0022surrealistic.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0px;padding:0px 1em 1em 0px;font-family:Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:.8em;line-height:1.5;border:0px;font-style:normal;vertical-align:baseline;color:rgb(51,51,51);letter-spacing:.02em;font-variant:normal;text-align:left;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\nIn a new version of an old experiment, CIFAR Senior Fellow Aephraim Steinberg (University of Toronto) and colleagues tracked the trajectories of photons as the particles traced a path through one of two slits and onto a screen. But the researchers went further, and observed the \u0022nonlocal\u0022 influence of another photon that the first photon had been entangled with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0px;padding:0px 1em 1em 0px;font-family:Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:.8em;line-height:1.5;border:0px;font-style:normal;vertical-align:baseline;color:rgb(51,51,51);letter-spacing:.02em;font-variant:normal;text-align:left;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\nOn phone atm so excuse my formatting.

And only what, 80 years late to the party?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yes, the fact that equating photon\u0027s electric field to its wave function only works for a case of single particle is nothing new, either. Correct wave function description lives in a product space for the two entangled particles. Adding yet another interpretation to \u0022help explain\u0022 this is not needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a tendency lately, and by lately I mean for the past few decades, to keep creating new interpretations of QM to fit prejudices of this or that research group. This is absolutely unnecessary. New interpretations do not provide additional clarity. Some interpretations have utility in simplifying formalism, and they have right to exist. But absolutely no interpretation ever gives better or worse explanation of Quantum Mechanics than any other. Because it\u0027s the same exact physics regardless of the interpretation. If any of them actually suggested new phenomena, they would be experimentally distinguishable from Quantum Mechanics, and would cease being interpretations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the only reason you are coming up with a new interpretation is to \u0022explain\u0022 something in Quantum Mechanics, do us all a favor and keep it to yourself. If you really think your interpretation opens up new truths about Quantum Mechanics, then you\u0027ve understood nothing about Quantum Mechanics. If, on the other hand, it\u0027s merely a better teaching tool, making it easier to explain QM to someone new to the field, then by all means, write a textbook.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
