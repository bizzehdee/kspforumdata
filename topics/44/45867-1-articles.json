Uranus was a Greek god whereas all the other planets were named after Roman gods. Why is this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. In Latin, when you call someone by name, you use something called the vocative case. So calling the god Neptunus by name would give you \u0022Neptune\u0022. Wikipedia tell me Greek has a similar rule, yet Uranus appears to be in the nominative (standard form). Why? And if it\u0027s for no particular reason, could we just solve the whole \u0022Uranus\u0022 issue by changing it to Urane?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShare your thoughts and, as always, any response is appreciated. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T23:41:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know what\u0027s up with the rules.

Maybe the person who named it liked Greek gods better than Roman ones? I think Uranus was one of the planets with naming problems too so that might be part of it.

After Saturn was discovered it was named after the father of Jupiter (Zeus), who in Greek mythology is the Titan Cronus. Thus, when Uranus was discovered they chose to name it after the father of Saturn, which in Greek mythology is Uranus. The Roman equivalent of Uranus is Caelus. It may be that they simply didn\u0027t want to call the planet Caelus and chose to use the Greek equivalent. It is also interesting to note that in Greece, according to the Wikipedia articles on the planets, the planets go by their Greek equivalents: Hermes, Aphrodite, Gaia, Ares, Zeus, Cronus, Uranus, Poseidon, and Hades.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
