The Mars Orbiter Mission is the India\u0027s first Mars mission and is slated to be launched from Sriharikota, India. the launch date is 5th November and Mars orbital insertion by 21st September 2014. They are calling it a \u0027Technology Demonstrator\u0027 and will serve as a test bed for future missions. NASA is cooperating with ISRO and the mission will use the Deep Space Network in addition to ISRO\u0027s own network. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMars Orbiter Mission Spacecraft attached to the 4th stage of PSLV-C25 \u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.isro.org/pslv-c25/Imagegallery/satellite/mars14.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mars14.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T09:49:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDang \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E If we keep this up, Mars will start developing its own Kessler Syndrome \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Cool news nonetheless.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tech Support","CreatedById":89874,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T09:54:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eha ha, the price of progress I Guess \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Will Fawkes","CreatedById":85847,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T12:12:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s hoping they don\u0027t have the same problems America and Russia have had with things just going poof and not making it there.
