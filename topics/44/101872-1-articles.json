We live in exciting times!\n\nMe too. There are quite likely to be Earth life forms that could actually live in some of these conditions, and if not, an Earth life form could probably be engineered that could survive using current or near future technologies.\n\nHowever, while we have a decent grasp on what constitutes habitability, we still don\u0027t know under what conditions life could arise. For all we know, conditions under the surface of those moons are very hostile to the *formation* of life. Martian life could conceivably have a common origin with Earth life, but the outer solar system moons almost certainly cannot be seeded via meteorites. They sit at the bottom of huge gravity wells, so meteors impact at very high speeds, and with the exception of Titan, they do not have atmospheres to cushion their impacts. All outer solar system moons have surface conditions that are lethal to all forms of life as we know it. Add to that, they are very far away, so materials blasted off of Earth (or Mars) has an extremely, incredibly low probability of impacting into, say, Europa, and even if a Earth/Mars meteoriod were so lucky, it would still most likely happen only after it had been floating around in space so long that all the biologicals it was carrying had died. So if we find anything living out there, it will almost assuredly be the result of a separate genesis of life.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-13T14:15:55Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2015 02:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|**"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T14:40:06Z","Content":"If you have a body large enough to establish a decent hydrostatic equilibrium to turn itself into a proper ball, and it\u0027s far away making it possess ancient nebula H2O, chances are very high (I\u0027d say 100% for all intents and purposes) there will be at least one pocket of liquid water at some depth where the heat is trapped and pressure is high enough.

We have no idea how favorable the conditions are to the formation of life.\n\nAt any rate, Europa and Enceledus are both much better targets. While Ganymede may have a subsurface ocean, it has a much thicker crust, and it seems there has been no recent interaction between the surface and the ocean underneath\n\nEnceledus on the other hand has liquid water much much closer to the surface, with frequent cryovolcano eruptions. Europa also seems to have areas of this crust where much more heat escapes, and perhaps cryocolcanism too.\n\nWhile there may be other bodies with subsurface liquid water... these are the only two that seem to be doing the hard job of getting samples from that subsurface ocean to the surface or even to space where they are much more accessible.\n\nIt also means that panspermia would be easier. If a microbe laden rock crashed on ganymede, and something survived the impact... it would still be very far from the liquid water, and would die/not be viable long before it ever got close to water.\n\nIn contrast, if something impacted at one of these three fissures (the \u0022tiger stripes\u0022 of enceledus), maybe, just maybe, a microbial population would make it to the subsurface ocean, and maybe a few of them would be able to survive.\n\n![800px-Jet_Spots_in_Tiger_Stripes_PIA10361.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Jet_Spots_in_Tiger_Stripes_PIA10361.jpg/800px-Jet_Spots_in_Tiger_Stripes_PIA10361.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Cirocco","CreatedById":100285,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T11:08:14Z","Content":"my two cents on the whole \u0022search for life\u0022 thing:\n\nthe fact that there\u0027s liquid water 100km under the crust of ganymede doesn\u0027t necessarily mean that there is (or could be) life on Ganymede.
