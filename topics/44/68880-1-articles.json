The exact value can depend on the orbit a little. For a spherical planet, the equation is T = 2\u00C3\u00E2\u201A\u00AC Sqrt(r\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B3/(GM)), where r is distance from planet\u0027s center, M is planet\u0027s mass, and G is gravitational constant. Real planets aren\u0027t perfect spheres, however, so there will be some corrections. I\u0027ve taken r to be Mars\u0027 mean radius \u002B 100km. But that\u0027s sort of an average. Can be a few minutes more or less for a particular orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T11:34:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood luck with the book!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Transits","CreatedById":104718,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T19:32:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for the info and the support!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
