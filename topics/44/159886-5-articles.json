Especially comparing the US space programs to the US military. Why? Well, for starters, the worldwide space programs would not exist without the military. Second, at the height of space program spending, everything had direct military significance. Does putting a man on the moon have military strategy? No, but all of the technology developed to do so did. Does the Space Shuttle building and servicing a continuously manned laboratory have a military advantage? No, but the Space Shuttle itself wasn\u0027t designed only for that purpose and was specifically designed for military payloads, hence DoD dollars going directly to the development.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the flip side, congress and the military aren\u0027t stupid.

Congress knows this and the military knows this.\u00A0 But this capability is not just for domestic R\u0026amp;D and production\u00A0but also for export capability.

Suffice it to say, comparing NASA\u0027s budget to the DoD budget is like comparing apples and oranges.

As far as NASA\u0027s Mars budget goes;\u00A0sure, they could they could do something crazy and inspiring like spending all of their money on a manned Mars mission. But they would have to sacrifice many other things that offset the cost of pure science missions.
