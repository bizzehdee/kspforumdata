An earth world with 3 atmospheric pressures. Wind storms would wreck everything.

Worlds with high oxygen would probably effect science and technology development. Never mind the constant fires... unless a lot of plants and creatures were adapted for fire resistance. That could work. Also you would think cancer and disease rates would be higher due to oxidation, and yet I honestly think if life was adapted for it they may be just fine.
