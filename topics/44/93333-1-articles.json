It has been operating there since April 2006, an almost 6.5 times longer mission duration than originally planned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoon, however, Venus will no longer have a spacecraft in orbit around it. Venus Express has exhausted itself down to the last droplet of propellant, and will eventually be pulled in by the planet. Already, communication has been lost, as not even the RCS thrusters have anything left in them with which to keep the antenna pointed towards Earth. ESA has now officially declared end of operations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts final science experiment was performed earlier this year, when the probe was tasked to perform aerobraking at various heights to study the feasibility of such maneuvers in Venus\u0027 aggressive, highly turbulent atmosphere.
