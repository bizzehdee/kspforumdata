Mars would never have a trade economy with Earth, it\u0027s a fairly silly idea short of SF spaceships that pop back and forth in hours, at costs below rail or sea shipping on earth.

As a reality check that\u0027s just about what the entire wind-generated supply of the planet is---add the current number of windmills on earth to the earth, every single year. Beaming solar power from space would be far better that covering the planet with ugly windmills to harvest secondary solar energy, and unlike Mars, there is a nonzero chance that this might actually be feasible as an economy (note I say \u0022might,\u0022 it might not be, but Mars \u003Cem\u003Ecertainly\u003C/em\u003E has no possible economic rationale).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-14T17:18:11Z\u0022 title=\u002209/14/2015 05:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-14T17:31:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nibb31\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nibb31\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETherefore, the only use for Mars resources is local consumption to build a Mars colony, which means that the only reason to colonize Mars is to colonize Mars.
