I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m aware of other projects using Aluminum, like AlIce: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALICE_(propellant)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALICE_(propellant)\u003C/a\u003E But I just want to talk about theoretical ideas with this thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInitially the Energy Density of LH2 of 141.86 MJ/Kg versus Aluminums 31 MJ/Kg seems like an obvious winner except that for a rocket the Oxidizer must also be carried on board and should also be included into that equation. For every 2 atoms of H we need one atom of O; 2*H \u002B O = H2O : 2*1 \u002B 16 = ~18 molecular weight, so for each Kg of LH2 we need 8Kg of LOX. 141.86 / 9 = 15.762 MJ/Kg when the LOX is included in the weight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterestingly Aluminum being reduced to AL2O3 smaller Oxygen requirement; 2*AL \u002B 3O = Al2O3 : 2*27 \u002B 3*16 = ~102 molecular weight, so for each Kg of aluminum only .889 Kg of LOX is needed. Which means 31/1.88 = 16.41MJ/kg is the energy density per Kg of fuel \u002B LOX, which is higher than LH2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at these numbers I assume that I made a mistake somewhere in the math or science somewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other Thing I find interesting is that Aluminum is almost 40 times denser than LH2, so that when you consider an equal amount of energy, say 10,000 MJ (about 1 cubic Meter of LH2). LH2 would take 70.85 Kg and 566.8Kg of LOX, LOX is 1141 Kg/cubic meters, so 566/1141 = ~.5. The total LH2\u002BLOX fuel has a volume of 1.5 cubic meters. Aluminum needs 323 Kg to create that amount of energy, at 2700 Kg/cubic meter that is a volume of 0.12 cubic meters; it also requires 287Kg of LOX, giving an additional .251 cubic meters for a total of .371 cubic meters. Which gives us a ratio of 1.5 to .371 gives us a total of 4 times as much volume in fuel for LH2 as for Aluminum. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am sure there are huge technical hurdles to making Aluminum a Rocket Fuel, but if it has the same energy density as LH2 but \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BC the volume I would expect it to be under more significant development. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy current conclusion is that I have missed something or done some math incorrectly or else we would see more research into making rockets powered by Aluminum. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are your thoughts on this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf my logic and Math is correct, what do you think are the technical hurdles that would make Aluminum non-viable?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-21T20:05:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe much higher weight of aluminium oxide relative to water means you end with lower exhaust velocity, and thus ISP, despite the higher theoretical density.
