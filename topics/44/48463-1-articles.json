Basics are a third or fourth generation Generation ship ends up parking in orbit around a star to top off on water, minerals, etc etc.... and finds another ship from a similar era though not built at the same time it was. Cue celebrations, dusting off old \u0027this language will be preserved because we realized societies would drift in hundreds or thousands of years and want ships that spawn from this program to have a way to talk\u0027 protocols.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately I haven\u0027t had much luck getting feedback. I know it\u0027s been done storywise since basically EVERYTHING has been done. Plus there\u0027s lots of room for things ranging from silly (one of the ships is full of genetically modified cat people) to Horror (robot servants took over and are now prepping to expand by cannibalizing the newly discovered craft) to... well anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is my original notes listed these things as roughly the size of texas in terms of total area with a much smaller habitable/people friendly zone. Thing is that just seems kind of off. I know a lot of area would be needed for things like intakes for scooping hydrogen gas, fuel storage and processing, random machinery needed when you come into resources (oort cloud, orphaned planet, whatever...) but that just can\u0027t be right, especially since I don\u0027t know the math and was just sort of spitballing a random guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso notes list safe cruising speed at 0.2c with a theoretical upper limit at as high as 0.25c, but the fuel/energy requirements would be... Insane even if you had some kind of exotic propulsion system. The concept was more a prop/window dressing for a D20 game that never got off the ground due to no playerbase.

There is an intresting concept for an interstellar round-trip capable ship. Called VARIES, it creates antimatter from the vacuum of space by using high energy lasers, powered by ginormous solar pannels.

For the nearer stars, this would work out to a maximum velocity of around .1-.2 c for the ship in question. I would also recommend a small crew (~200) with a sizeable gene bank as an insurance against inbreeding, with room aboard the ship to grow. Don\u0027t count on the ship\u0027s livable space being very large - a cylinder roughly 100 m across and 500 m long \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E be sufficient, given the travel time (I\u0027m doing a quick-and-dirty calculation here, so check against the above sources for better numbers). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m personally against the idea of \u0022uploading\u0022 - whether or not the result is sentient and self-aware, I\u0027d rather see flesh-and-blood humans seeded across the stars to evolve and diverge into a million new civilizations, than have something that remembers being human and perhaps decides to discard its heritage wholesale. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal note for now: many world-ships in story and film make the assumption of on-board cultures and governments that make concentration camps seem like vacation spots. I would caution against such an approach - if we want people to travel aboard world-ships, they should be appealing to some extent. We\u0027ve had some sea-faring cultures in our past - I\u0027m thinking of the Vikings and Polynesians in particular - and I would expect that future world-ship cultures might be similiar.

It might be biological creatures that most want to expand. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt CAN be dangerous to create a race of intelligent machines, capable of self-improvement and reproduction, that can survive in space, just mining asteroids to reproduce. However, it should be relatively safe, if the machines are given a strong set of morals, that perhaps includes, some kind of moral inhibition against further expansion that starts kicking in once they expand outward to a large enough degree to ensure long-term survival. We don\u0027t want to make any other civilizations feel threatened we might try to start expanding into their territory, and it also seems fair to leave a large number of unsettled places for new civilizations to settle into. I know we would feel pretty bummed out to get all ready to go expanding across the stars only to find out that all the good spots are already taken. Why do you really need to try to expand across the whole galaxy? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome might say that expansion is a biological imperative, but the whole point of civilization is to rise above our biological imperatives! Survival of the fittest and maximizing the spread of your genes means raping every woman you can find, stealing from and/or killing those competing against you, infanticide against any baby that is not yours, etc. Civilization is about telling natural selection and our biological impulses to go take a hike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I know this is all highly speculative, but I tell you what is MUCH MORE speculative: trying to imagine interstellar travel and colonization using TODAY\u0027S technology and societal norms. That\u0027s exactly what you are doing when you imagine this giant colony ship with like 1000 humans on it that need to survive for a few hundred years and a dozen generations before they reach their destination. It\u0027s unrealistic. We can\u0027t even make a manned spacecraft that goes to Mars yet, only like 50 million km away. To make a manned spacecraft that can go to the nearest stars, we need to go about ONE MILLION TIMES more distant than Mars. It is going to take a LONG TIME before we reach that technology threshold. To imagine such a ship, but using the computer technology, biology, nanotechnology, genetics, and societal norms we know today, is absolutely ludicrous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, if you want your predicted future to have a chance at being at least CLOSE to the mark, you need to do what I did- look at what technologies today have the most room for further development, and make crude projections as to what will be possible when those technologies become mature. With those potential developments in mind, then completely re-evaluate what a colony ship could look like. What you end up is something close to what I project- a small ship, tended by very smart machine intelligences, that simply grow the biological beings when they finally arrive at the system targeted for colonization, and the targeted system is ready for the biologicals. It simply makes the most sense, it is the most efficient, and it is the option that most takes into account likely future technological breakthroughs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe unstated assumption in what I say above is that the biological beings will want to expand, and the machines will be willing to help. If we stay as racist and elitist as we are right now (which I find unlikely, though) and treat the machines like inferior, slave laborers, they might have no interest in helping biological beings. Certainly, we will always have \u0022slave\u0022 machines, but at some point, as a machine intelligence gets smarter and more independent, you should stop treating it like a slave and start treating it like a person, or there could be trouble.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-17T17:55:32Z\u0022 title=\u002210/17/2013 05:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Will Fawkes","CreatedById":85847,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T07:38:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo be fair while you will get a large segment of the population with racist/speciest attitudes towards new life (either genmodded/uplifted or synthetic) there will also be large chunks of the population that will want them to have the same standing anybody else does.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DJEN","CreatedById":61378,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T08:35:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEven after 30,000 years of civilization, we haven\u0027t changed that much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, with the invention of human rights and its application, many things have changed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, there are many who are treated as machines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat can we expect of the future?
