Is it going to saturate its market, and go belly up?

Ultimately an \u0022electric car\u0022 is powered by whatever fuel the local power grid gets its electricity from, and in the U.S. my understanding is that, at this point, most of that is natural gas, with\u00A0small amounts of coal,\u00A0nuclear, and hydrodynamic,\u00A0and tiny fractions of other (solar, biofuel, aeolian etc.).

We don\u2019t think that is likely this time around, but we are definitely going to have to take precautions against that in the future. We looked at who would want to blow up a SpaceX rocket.
