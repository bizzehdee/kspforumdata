Or if something else takes priority.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSay you have a thruster and a long set of rods out the back that then collect the thrust material away from the back of the thrust rear opening. This could be designed to catch thrust like a net but in a way that doesn\u0027t produce a lot of counter thrust as it\u0027s collecting looser material away from the nossel. If it\u0027s designed to efficiently collect a some types of matter but let most thrust go through can you get more fuel and stop less thrust to get a positive outcome by recycling it back through in some manner. even if you expend another type of fuel or other energy source to reuse it. could other sacrifices be made to not add too much weight to gain?

Or some sort of limit to adding/adjusting fuel storage space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne idea could be like a solar sail but made to not impede thrust(like being porous or similar) while collecting materials from the thrust. Maybe the material naturally draws in the thrust material while not stopping the push back producing thrust. Not sure if there is a distance where the thrust material stops producing meaningful push. Of where the collection would not produce enough pull. Are there any odd material combos that can produce this in any way. Would the slowing of the potential material or a limit of collection make this worthwhile? Would ion or anything weird do this. What about plasmas? Or types of fuel with multiple fuel types and you only recollect one type as the other may be in greater amount or near infinite. Then you might be collecting less mass. Maybe it requires a special type of thrust/fuel combo and certain materials to collect in the correct way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe it would have to be part of an engine where the thruster is not primarily thrust and has another purpose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe it\u0027s good for balance in a design and making new designs workable. Any gain whatsoever could be used to shrink tanks. Or redirect them even at a loss of efficiency so some of the fuel is kept in another location for balancing or other reasons. I\u0027m assuming this exists in fuel loop system or similar, but his could extend the loop to out of the spacecraft farther. Maybe the thrust catching could give variable balance modes also. Then it wouldn\u0027t just be with pumps or gravity base fuel lines. complexity aside(assuming).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was assuming the effects of the thrust happened close to the nozzle. This could then allow something farther back acting as a collector to some extent. Then to avoid adding mass to the craft you could stick the thrusters near the middle to front with open air/space between and simply adjust the geometry a bit. Maybe thrusting into large cone shapes in the hull. And with or without another whole in the rear to more propulsion via squeezing the thrust into a small space over a long hull shape. This could then be the primary/secondary thrust with a lot of collectors and maybe a balancer in the middle or end.

They could be combustion or any other type of vehicle by design. You could also combine thrust and engine torque or other methods together in a more complex system. The primary fuel could be oxygen with all other things besides electricity being mandatory. I would assume it could use a variable concept with compressing air at minimum to adjust during various speeds or performance marks if needed to propel itself and whatever systems are in it.

It might cost energy(hopefully without adding mass) but it could make the collection not impede completely in the same direction to reduce the effect. Maybe with passive collection materials. and in a system with other forces using the rest of the thrust material to produce more thrust at the end of a collection chamber. I think this is done in aircraft basically. Why not space craft? Just a matter of efficiency.

Say if you go beyond a certain distance and it ceases to produce as much thrust. Or can be collected with angular momentum to limit the counter effect. It might be possible. Especially if you are collecting one of multiple fuels. Or if you use the angular momentum somehow like gravity production or something. It could excuse or use the loss of thrust as a secondary product. If collecting fuel for fuel maybe it can help regain a single very small thrust producing fuel to in essence extend a very small tank to a very large effective size. Say there is an additive that is used in a fuel that is added at something like 0.01% of the total fuel and this lets it\u0027s fuel last for the entirety of the other fuel types relative to it\u0027s small size and have very little. Or a stored vs a produced fuel. The 0.01% fuel is stored and the other produced from something like a fission or fusion batter source that is nearly limitless. Might be good for probes. This lets the 0.01% fuel additive work closer to the time the fission/fusion battery does. Not sure on the other fuels but maybe they don\u0027t need to be collected. That or go oddball and say the collected fuel is light and it\u0027s collected from solar panels or heat collecting panels across the surface(or from a surface that naturally does it.) this could be used to various effects depending on what is at play.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think conceptually this is the equivlant of x=y where x is the total thrust vs a more complex formula where you view x in more complexity and only replace part of x giving more room to do things. Hence not taking up all of x as counterforce. I\u0027m still not convinced you can\u0027t find a way to reduce the effect of collected gases to some small amount with tricks that don\u0027t have a complete conterpull. If you use angular momentum around a sphere, with other factors why can\u0027t you to some extend reduce the counterpulls effect. Or if you did something weird like fly in a spiral and collect along the edge that is helping or is pushing the spiral correctly it should count reduce the effect. Then you just have to have a reason to fly in a spiral. There should be oddities in practice where it is applicable one way or the other. It just have to have a reason to excuse the other losses. Which is normal. There are uses for additive that are not fully a matter of thrust. It\u0027s easy for other things to be more important and it at minimum part of a system to make up for some other needed functions. And with straight thrust, if anything about it is not perfectly linear then there is a use. Assuming you can get the efficiency. I read something about someone saying if it\u0027s not a scientific issue but an engineering issue it can be done ultimately. If there are any nuances in the formula to play off of then it might be possible. Just a matter of when and how. Then you might be able to make some cool stuff out of it. Maybe with specialized fuel combinations or something else that works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis might work with ships made in space. I had and idea for using ships that can go to space to print other ships in order to make space ships. If you can get an oxygen using plasma ship to near orbit and get it in orbit you can take up small amounts of material for varied space oriented manufacturing. Preferably that make very light weight but orientationally strong material layouts. like composites that are make of lattices of small angular materials or similar printed on a small scale to form what looks like firm material. Then you can use methods to spray material on it for coatings for mirrors or protective layers if needed. Maybe even for electrical signals or other things to be sent. Then you give it a propulsion means and have much lighter weight probes and printers for research and exploration. All of these methods exist currently and basically just need to be applied. The only limit I assume exists is having enough power. You might get more unusual circumstances with these or be able to make ships needing such things. Maybe it would be good for satellites first. Even if you can eak out the smallest thrust or as part of angular controls to go with existing methods it might have a purpose. what if it helps power another function even if it has net 0 gains in thrust or movement in itself. Maybe translation of force via materials while doing other things to aid in overall ship design. Temperatures maybe. cold plasma is useful but could also control temps for various reasons. Who knows what oddities coudl come into play with different long term material uses. Any other quality is usable. And it might work well with long use things like antimatter or fusion/fusion like the one I showed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould it act as a stabilizing force to avoid or create an existing counterforce for engines to stop or stop loss of rotation? If you have a certain thrust it could give a collectible fuel used in rotation or to give a force to fight against to stop rotation giving room for other thrusters to not effect as much during manoeuvring potentially. Or if it could gain even the smallest gains it could be upscaled and be recyclable fuel source to counter needed thrust from forward fireing engines. If the collection is only part of the thrust and you only gather back one fuel type then you have positive gains. It then extends the fuel type(maybe needed to fire the other one like an oxidizer), but is not totally needed for thrust. Maybe this could collect needed things to help produce more oxidizer for longer trips. could be part of a longer fuel system keeping oxygen for crew and the thrusters. Maybe part of a system to produce oxidizer or something more exotic where loss of thrust is acceptable. The burning could be part of a system producing heat and using the thrusters heat to do something and then collecting some of the material back. Thrusters that are more than just thrusters. The ability to collect in space or stop at planets and collect materials for on site production without a standing station might outweight the loss. Maybe for colonization ships or whatnot. Could you collect any part of an antimatter system with such a setup.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy smallest gains I don\u0027t mean actual gains. I mean not loosing the entirety of x in x=y. (IE, using nuances of it that previously weren\u0027t. Assuming x=y equals all potentials.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe above example could work if are recollecting/recycling/remaking oxidizer for extending fuel tank size/etc. Then you could use magnetics at the end after initial ignition for then propel with another means to produce secondary thrust from a different balance location. Placement would obviously depend on the exact design, but it\u0027s doable if needed. It\u0027s just a compound engine system. Maybe that would work better with ion or something weird and recollect some exotics put through it that effect more than just thrust. Then it\u0027s propelled afterwords and as greater thrust with directional thrust abilities where the initial is only straight forward. Maybe the exotic or additive is for temperature or other controls as part of another system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf not maybe it could work as a part of an atmospheric thrust effect where gases moving from thrust could be used to play on the variable of the medium it\u0027s thrusting against to recollect some fuel of some sort. Maybe if the thrusters create a void area in the thrust that then collects fuel at that point while still maintaining thrust against the other points with heavier gas to push against. At which point why not do the same with magnetics or other things in low-0 atmosphere. They would just be specialized engines. If it\u0027s thrusting it\u0027s pushing off of something. This means it\u0027s variable or could be made to be variable enough to collect with less loss of thrust. this might not be the exact correct method to do this, but the principle is there if you can create any variation. which you can if there is anything there to use to thrust against hypothetically. You are never playing with a perfect medium(or perfectly or even remotely efficiently). So, you are not currently thrusting off of a 100% efficient surface. This means there is room to play off of in one direction or another. It\u0027s just a matter of understanding it and using it. If it already does something to loose effiency and the thrust material slows down from it\u0027s point of most momentum creating push wouldn\u0027t the collection of material be less if it looses momentum after pushing against the medium it\u0027s pushing against. It can\u0027t be as simple as just x=y. Nothing ever works that way or you are not accounting for the how between x and y. Even when converted into the ship movement there still should be room to do something. Even if it\u0027s just collected angularly or as part of an inefficient system as above. There is likely some wiggle room to do something. Especially the longer the thrusters have to be active because of build up of gains from the fuel system. Even if from very small gains somewhere else. Say overall tank size of balance of the ship. The more complex the functions the more room there should be for odd systems. I\u0027m not assuming this would work in the most straight forward and simple rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd going from resting mass from the idea of lights true mass vs momentum.(IE mass technically currently including some momentum or other things as a force when measured.) Does anything else share similar qualities?(assuming not everything.) If resting mass is just the reality of movement adding massive thrust via movement and is true mass. The variable nature of other materials could allow this between fuel types if it\u0027s slowed down by a medium not effecting the ships momentum. It would simply be using another medium in an existing system before collecting the fuel or matter. Just have to keep it off the ship at that point. Complex variation in atmosphere could do this naturally as it\u0027s in play in various ways potentially. And if it can be done in a dense medium like the atmosphere it could be done in space as it\u0027s technically the same thing. Just a matter of how and how much energy has to be used to do it and where the energy comes from. Basically it\u0027s translation with an outside system. Therefore not screwing up x=y. Just scaling it outside one ships systems and to a larger perspective. I think the problem is considering the current variables are simpler than they might be. If there is more too them there is more wiggle room potentially. We live in something that has lots of unknowns that could be played upon. Or current knowns not used for various reasons. Antimatter may add enough power to play on such things to start. Maybe using the explosion to shoot against the current medium and breaking it down as thrust then only collecting a small part of it. Or something far more exotic. Obviously that is getting very sci fi potentially. Maybe there are current things that could be used.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore rambling: 8)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould you in essence create enough angular turbulence to then collect with a more efficient means like magnetics or simple redirection. Energy itself can move things to save energy with more efficiency systems. Can this be done otherwise? Could some be bounced back at the ship so the collection happens in the direction of the ships momentum? Not sure how that would work though in detail. Basically the effect of ground or other surface turbulence using space or atmosphere as the medium instead of harder matter like ground or water. Maybe this could be focused on a single set of things like oxygen particles(or to collect/redirect such particles). Could it be done in a way with variable efficiencies of materials?(a translation system) If it\u0027s not all equal and currently simplified. I assume you have to bounce it off the medium in a way as to use the same energy overall without bouncing off the ship prior to collection but making the medium do the work for you and going into the greater system. I\u0027m guessing this would require massive thrust or something more delicate. I\u0027m assuming that would take some very specialize thrusters made to play off of a very light medium. Possibly by very efficiency thrust targeted at hitting the medium efficiently somehow. Either hitting small particles or bouncing with nets of thrust material like using some particle that catches as many counter materials to bounce off of somehow without loosing sufficient efficiency or function.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if the smallest differences exist in the medium you are pushing off of or the using to push you can use it\u0027s energy hypothetically as a source to collect matter. It\u0027s just a matter of knowledge. IE, and engineering problem. Each molecule is different. If it\u0027s usable it\u0027s usable. Even if it\u0027s not currently usable. We might even already know it but can\u0027t use it for various reasons like energy. Anti matter might make up for that. Especially if engines like the one I posted can exist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/213.web.stuff/Scott%20Kircher/fissionfusion.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/213.web.stuff/Scott Kircher/fissionfusion.html\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould you make a variable engine that created thrust and combine it with something that uses a \u0022lazer\u0022 like the other ones that hit matter and in the process redirect or make it bounce back for collection via the above or a combination of destroying the particle to some degree. If it it\u0027s just bouncing ions back for collection. You could even do it if a certain combination makes it efficient for collect some stuff back while not being efficient for thrust overall. As long as it collects something important enough to use the extra energy. Especially if that energy isn\u0027t using up something significantly enough or significant enough proportionally(If it already exists as waist or with waist remaining as one example). Solar sails could be fun if combined with an engine pushing stuff at the solar sails. Maybe something long burning that helps use solar sales in deep space to create artificial sources.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould you push with one medium to create an artificial source(that could produce thrust itself off material in space then push off that material with something like electricity or magnetism or other sources to create a ground effect and bounce some material back for collection? Any combination could be used potentially if you can find a way to do this. This could increase collection of ions for sales or oxidizer materials or be used to push off a turbulent material to reduce momentum without effecting the ship for the ship to collect hypothetically. As long as the energy is spent in the medium without directly effecting the ships momentum. Not sure what energy is spent getting it to do this or loss of overall thrust. But if you can get the effect by carefully direct it and there is existing waste it might be possible. Maybe it\u0027s possible to play off space like playing pool and get more efficient than current to not loose overall thrust. There has to be lots of waist in current thrusters.

Could you then build a cheap generator or battery producer near the sun using it to start a cheap fission or other battery type to then be put in a space ship at some variable efficiency if the ship provides the means to maintain the reaction? Or is that not usable. Maybe it would help with the making of the fission/fusion anti matter concept or similar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf that could be done you could even do none rigid body ships that move like living organisms.\u00A0 Space amoeba ships? You could make them big enough to protect things by reducing the odds of being hit while also using other parts of the ship to protect more important parts as needed via moving them(out of the way or in the way for protection) or even producing them or other things. Depending on time and ability. You could even have multi purpose parts that float in the ship doing various tasks(especially if they are easily producable) and then have them move to the rear or other sides to jet out material as thrust of similar. Assuming they use thrust or can\u0027t use forces from inside the ship to produce momentum. A lot is doable if you can use momentum combined with other forces. You could translate with forces produced inside the ship and momentum from the body to produce thrust potentially. Therefore never loosing mass for thrust. At least not directly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBTW, if the ship has internal gel it could also protect things inside via slowing other things momentum. Then you have basically a spaceplane that can push it\u0027s momentum vs other things to move and take hits via constant thrust production potentially. At least on demand. It could also be used to collect things in space like space debri in case of the worst case scenario. It just needs a means to repair itself and replace any potential lost materials. Assuming it\u0027s not constantly gaining materials. Could be a fun way to mine in space. You literally eat the roids and can use any materials that hit the ship. As long as you can keep repairing it\u0027s outside and whatnot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo idea how much momentum can be taken out of objects in that way though. It might need a combination of forces to protect the ship given potential velocities in space. Maybe if the hull can quickly enough put things in the way along the edge to let the objects hit and slow down on top of anything else. A variety of methods could be used to slow things down.

And yes the formula has nuances. If you expand the one side to display all variables possible you have smaller areas to play off of.\u00A0 That is where design plays in and yes you can catch some things(or a lot depending on chosen design.). And there are lots of inefficiencies to utilize potentially...(or just plane old tradeoffs.) What you are saying is not how real formulas work vs real life. BTW, pure simple efficiency is often or normally over ridden by other things. The efficiencies you are normally talking about either don\u0027t apply or are a part of other unstated considerations making up the current circumstance and within it. Which often contradict other generic efficiencies which are also other limited considerations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIE, you are not looking at the thrust in relationship to the rest of the system(s). And not looking at how you can sacrifice things to produce functions. That is literally as oversimplified as you can get it. It\u0027s not an argument in real life. It is not a scientific issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are basically only considering the simplest of rockets(And none of the inefficiencies.). IE there is nothing inherently inefficient about the existing design. And not considering things about the thrusters and more advanced complex designs utilizing those things we don\u0027t bother with atm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can expand the sides of the formula to consider/represent nuances. Plus when your thrust system engages in an, \u0022outside,\u0022 system as part of the formula, etc. Which is technically already a part of it. There is no end of things you can do if you want to. There is, but that is the actual limit of reality.\u00A0 Which is not that simple. Any single small unconsidered factor of that thrust, or it\u0027s accompanying systems, means you can do more. You are assuming your thrust takes into account all things possible. That is not the case as you do not know enough about it to see what the current consideration fully is. It\u0027s just the limits of your current understanding. Not the actual limits. Yes, the formula technically represents thrust\u00A0 as it\u0027s a simple formula. but it does not represent all the things that formula represents in the real world if you expand the formula to it\u0027s natural actual entirety.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCase in point. The current thrust is virtually unguided particles flying against a disorganized(assuming) medium(large mass to hit other small mass in space because of lack of guidance(like WW2 bombs vs modern munitions). If those factors are changed you can produce more or less thrust(IE different). You are literally assuming no inefficiencies or variables. Which means you are flat out wrong. The very design of a bell shooting matter at air or space is by design very disorganized and inefficient. It\u0027s sort of the point.(literally simplicity of design and manufacturing over complexity.) There are many factors that could then be used to do this relative to an existing design. Especially as your current design is only a set of inputs. And in a limited variation/consideration of the formula. It\u0027s that simple! Else you could literally never produce more efficient engines or any other designs period! This is not complicated. That is apart of the formula by nature. This is how the real world works. If there is more than one efficiency you are wrong. There are more efficiencies than one design. Simple as that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if you follow this logic you are also assuming your understanding of mass is correct(Or endless other things.). That is why I brought up or expanded on what someone else said about light and resting mass(or I should say made a point of). If other things have different resting mass than the current measurement you have potential room to utilize it(assuming I\u0027m using resting mass correctly.). Therefore it is an engineering issue. As things are currently constantly in motion when measured if their existing mass measurements includes some other factors including things like/producing momentum. This means anything not using true mass could be utilized to do better. That means your current understanding is simply flawed along with your proposition. Very deeply might I add. You are literally assuming everything as simply stated is as complicated as it gets. That is not the case and never to be assumed to be the case. Particularly as the human brain uses partial sets of data collected over time via sensory information to produce thought. This means the base presumptions is always limited as we are designed physical weak and incapable of holding all information for efficiency reasons by design(This used to be better understood in academic areas and is the natural basis of everything in the world in relationship to our understanding. IE science.). Therefore it\u0027s incorrect to argue except as a potential argument. Just like everything else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIE, if the current measurements are not singular things but the product of multiple variables(or even multiple things/objects/forces by whatever definition that is.) then your viewpoint is completely mistaken on it\u0027s face. It\u0027s then potentially correct if things happen to line up that way. But they are potentially/literally incorrect if they don\u0027t. which given the relative simplicity vs reality naturally inherent in ideas could also appear or exist as one thing at one point and another at a different. And taken farther, if all measurements just happen to be when it is in that form it could have another unmeasured form when it\u0027s not we don\u0027t know of or haven\u0027t measured(Which could still be the produce of one or more things in any variation we can\u0027t consider or know about in any variation to the natural extent of the most generic extreme logic(IE, an unkown.).). That is always the case in real world application and the basis of proper logic. IE, accuracy and considering the situation of the idea(IE our brain as a machine processing as the type of machine does.) and our unknowns in it as and any other extremity or circumstance that we can or can\u0027t conceive of. Proper logic/science is we don\u0027t actually know if matter or anything else even exists. It could be a product of many other things that just happen to do x and y time when measuring and always fit the criteria. No statistic is logical to say x amount of measurements overrides this either as we naturally have no perspective to the extremities to say what it is set against. Any attempt to do so is logically flawed. This is proper, \u0022science.\u0022 At most we can say we keep doing x and this registered as y. nothing more. Anything could be under the hood.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRealistically, you are looking for if those complex things can be done simply from a human perspective. The more you know the more likely you will find a method fitting those other circumstances. The things we use most are often things that are complex but are made simple as things around us do the hard parts for us.(We live off this concept in the form of plants and animals and all thing making our environment. which are factories that are far more complex than things we produce as humans.) It\u0027s not about potential/complexity in the generic sense as it is making something do the work for us sufficiently making it relatively simple. Or within our criteria as other machines(IE, interfacing). This includes materials and all other existing objects/forces/etc and how much we have to do to make them do what we want. This bleeds into economy and it\u0027s basis is the knowledge collected by what we gain in sensory data as it produces rarity via things like relative ability and many other factors. Although there are a bunch of nuances no longer understood well that are parts of other formal subjects you have to stick together sufficiently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if thrust is not pushing off any medium in space, but the ship itself, you still have the efficiency of it from the space ship to use. There should be lots of inefficiencies there to improve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBTW, if you are just collecting materials from burnt oxydizer to recycle which could be ignited in a small chamber to start with to produce other thrust why is that problematic. The majority of thrust can be from the other materials. Your just basically filtering out materials to reuse some. It could avoid interfering with most if not all thrust potentially. And obviously ion can go through glass(might be thinking the wrong thing.). So, you could burn something and collect it where not collecting ion. It would just have to burn with insufficient thrust to not override the ion thrust. This could be done and so could other combinations. Or if I\u0027m thinking that out wrong light could be produced with expent, \u0022thrust,\u0022 and collected for secondary reasons and the light could pass through gas to generate(translation of energy) a second thrusters with more thrust. It\u0027s a matter of proportions. This can be done with magnetism and other factors as well. I\u0027m assuming this is more useful if you have a reason to produce a ship that does not adjust mass from thrust. Or to minimize it. Having massively increased production of oxidizer on board could be useful. Does anything allow you to do something simple like burn and oxidizer store it in a solid/burnt state and then recreate it from the mass? can anything collect it that easily or would a low? thrust engine be useful where the collection forces from what is hopefully a small amount of oxidizer be collected and reconverted?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if you are talking bells and inner chambers you can always design them better and then do more with them like recycling materials instead of increasing thrust. Simplest. This could also be used to control the explosive medium to get better thrust potentially like the concept of using ground turbulance or something. No idea on the lifespace of the microchanels or whatever used. If you could redo them between bursts. Maybe with a coating method using vacuum and some very small materials between thrusts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m assuming the more exotic things won\u0027t be useful without more powerful energy sources to power them. Unless we can do it efficiently now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd maybe the amoeba concept uses magnetics or light or something to push off of. Maybe an inner solar system ship? Even very low thrust would work if unmanned. Maybe using the idea of those toys your rock back and forth onto build momentum. And maybe it\u0027s filled with gases instead of gels. Maybe the shell is like a giant solar sail or similar and the motions tries to play off of it. Using multiple types would allow you to stop as you don\u0027t always move in one direction. I wonder how scale of the ship to the materials matter. What is the most optimal scale based on the limit of the materials. Would small be better or does increasing size help to reduce relative thickness for less overall mass compared to engines or other thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt that point can you use stuff to mess with the explosion in the chamber? Maybe using magnetics or ion or a combination drive. Maybe at lower thrust? If it\u0027s all going out the same hole... Or do soemthing stupid like hold ionic gas in the amoeba like a blimp and use motion to push it against things on the wall to produce thrust or make it escape.. Maybe translate it into something else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould you take the concept of lightweight production I mentioned previously(if anyone can find it.) and make a \u003Cs\u003Efission\u003C/s\u003E fusion or other manufacturing plant around the sun using it\u0027s magnetic field and resources to simplify it and then produce antimatter?

But let\u2019s use your bullet example because it might get you closer to where you are trying to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOver and over you keep talking about trying to capture the gases or some parts of the particles, only somehow without preventing the thrust. This doesn\u2019t work, of course, because the exhaust gas IS the thrust, in any meaningful sense. However, with the bullet example, you have two different components, right? You have the bullet itself and you also have the escaping gas, and they both contribute to recoil. Is there something you can do there? Let\u2019s find out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA 5.56x45\u00A0mm NATO round fired from an AR-15 uses two grams of powder and fires a four-gram bullet. I have a feeling we will get tripped up if we try to talk about force, so instead let\u2019s just focus on momentum. The bullet, escaping from the barrel at 950 m/s, has a momentum of 0.004 kg * 950 m/s = 3.8 kg*m/s. The recoil momentum imparted to the rifle is -3.8 kg*m/s. But, just as implied, we aren\u2019t done yet. We haven\u2019t factored in the exhaust gases from the propellant. The exhaust gases are also escaping from the barrel at 950 m/s and they mass 2 grams, so they have a momentum of 1.9 kg*m/s, making the total recoil momentum imparted to the rifle -5.7 kg*m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut let\u0027s say we now want to capture that escaping gas and recycle it somehow, so we put some sort of balloon structure around the muzzle that will allow the bullet to escape but will trap the gases. Let\u2019s say it can trap 100% of the gases. The gases exit the barrel at 950 m/s, but they are immediately slowed down and stopped\u00A0by the balloon structure. That stop imparts -1.9 kg*m/s to the gases, and their equal and opposite force on the balloon imparts \u002B1.9 kg*m/s on the balloon and the entire rifle. So the gas is trapped, but the total impulse on the rifle is -5.7 kg*m/s \u002B 1.9 kg*m/s = -3.8 kg*m/s, just the same as if the bullet had been fired but the exhaust gases had never escaped at all. So yes, you can capture part of the propellant, but that only makes it as if the propellant had never existed in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DBut what if you added a muzzle brake or a silencer that redirected the exhaust gases out at an angle to make them easier to capture?\u201D And sure, you can do that. Let\u2019s say your muzzle brake directs the gases out to the side at a 45 degree angle. That way, the balloon can expand outward radially instead of expanding backward and half of the forces will cancel out. Good, right? The problem is that directing the gas out at a 45 degree angle also reduces the impulse provided to the rifle by half. So in the end, the recoil imparted to the rifle is still just -3.8 kg*m/s, no matter how the gas is captured.\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223872122\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022197661\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221603550080\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022197504\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spacescifi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n22 minutes ago, Spacescifi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGravity more or less would be such a thing...\u00A0if we had portals...or warp drive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we had a machine that violated the conservation of energy then we would have a machine that violated the conservation of energy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-24T18:35:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe the mistake being made here is assuming that the expelled propellant loses its momentum to the environment, leaving it slowed and therefore ready to be collected again for a net gain of momentum for the ship.
