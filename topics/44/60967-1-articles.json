I must ask, if It is going to be a top secret object discovered by public type thing why not make it an L3 orbit where such an object would be nearly impossible to see where such a discovery would be fairly hard? Lastly, as for the question over the magnetic field, of course it can have one. Magnetic fields do not depend on mass or gravity. Hell, Earth has a stronger magnetosphere than Saturn. In fact, I would say that the fact that you are making it high density makes a magnetic field all the more likely as it would mean that there are a lot of heavy elements decaying, possibly causing some large fission reactions, to keep the core hot, and that iron and nickel and other metals would be in the center of that core, likely spinning, and creating a magnetic field.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MC.STEEL","CreatedById":89456,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-24T22:07:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with the other L points is that the object has to be dead center in order to stay there so thats why i chose the L5/L4,wouldt want a runaway planet now would whe. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tntristan12","CreatedById":7005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-24T22:11:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might want to do some research into the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_trojan\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETrojan Asteroids\u003C/a\u003E that \u0022hang out\u0022 in Jupiter\u0027s L4 and L5 zones.

It\u0027s well-studied fact. Possibility of proto-planetary body forming at such points is also a well-studied fact. That\u0027s what we are talking about. Whether such an object actually existed is besides the point. The reason the hypothesis exists is because it is physically viable.

Two objects of equal mass at each other\u0027s L3. Introduce a third object which is in 1:2 resonance with one of these. It is, obviously, in the 1:2 with the other body as well. This means that any drift of one of the two bodies results in interaction with the resonating body, which both restores the original perturbation and adjusts the second body to match it. Now, all you have to do is make sure that stabilizing effect of the 1:2 is greater than de-stabilizing of 1:1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, it\u0027s entirely possible that I jumped the gun on 8:13 being capable of stabilizing an object in Earth\u0027s L3.
