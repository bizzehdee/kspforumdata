The stuff on Eeloo would be called regolith. In any case, the statement that the formation of regolith requires water is dead wrong. It is found on nearly all solid bodies in the solar system, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/25143_Itokawa\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eincluding those as small as 500m long\u003C/a\u003E. This is thought to be due to mostly micrometeoroid impacts breaking up the surface, but thermal cycling and other factors may also play a role.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, Eeloo is basically Europa, but orbiting Kerbol (its orbit resembles Pluto, but its temperature is close to that of Jool). Given its temperature and composition, the brown cover likely comes from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tholin\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Etholins\u003C/a\u003E, or whatever makes the crevasses on Europa dark. Given its smoothness, the surface must be fairly young, although it hasn\u0027t had an art pass like Duna or the Mun. This implies that Eeloo is geologically active. Radioactive heating for a body its size would be too weak, so it will likely eventually get a large moon or parent planet providing some tidal heating.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
