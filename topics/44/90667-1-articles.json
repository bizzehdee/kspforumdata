The universe can have a low temperature while having a high entropy. The entropy is dependent on the number of possible ways a system could be arranged. This has only an indirect connection to temperatur.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is true that a perfect crystal at zero kelvin would have zero entropy, but this is irrelevant, since nothing can ever have zero kelvin temperature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good way to picture entropy: Imagine a set of ten normal dices. The are all showing the \u00221\u0022 face. They add up to a sum of 10 eyes. That is the only possible way to get 10 eyes, so the number of possible ways to arrange a \u002210-eye\u0022 system is very low. If you change one dice at random, it may show a \u00222\u0022 face. The sum of all dices is now 11 eyes. There are 10 possible ways to get 11 eyes (each dice could have the two), so the \u002211-eye\u0022 system has a \u0022higher entropy\u0022 (in the sense of this games rules).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you shake your dices for quite some time, you may get a \u002235-eye\u0022 system. This has a giant number of possible ways to be arranged. In fact, the \u002235-eye\u0022 system has the maximum amount of possible arrangements, hence the highest \u0022entropy\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy slowly rolling one of your dices after the other in a random order, any system will tend to become a \u002235-eye\u0022 system. This is purly by chance, because there simply are more possible ways to arrange the 35-system. Getting a 10-system (or a 60-system) by chance is highly unlikely, because it has only one possible way to arrange it: only ones (or only sixes for the 60-system).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this explains entropy: The entropy rises simpy because of statistical reasons. The entropy is a measure of the possible ways to arrange a particular system. If there are many ways to arrange a particular system to A, and only few ways to arrange the system to B, then it is simply more likely that you will end up with A (the higher entropy state).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-18T22:58:12Z\u0022 title=\u002211/18/2014 10:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by N_las\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GregA","CreatedById":126788,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-18T22:51:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pyrosheep\u0022 data-cite=\u0022pyrosheep\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI just started learning about Entropy in chemistry and there has been one question bugging me.\u003Cp\u003EThe second law of thermodynamics states that Entropy must increase in thermodynamic processes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third law states that the entropy of a perfect crystal is equal to zero at absolute zero kelvin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo as time passes and matter inevitably becomes smaller and further apart in accordance with the second law, the temperature in the system must at some point approach absolute zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point the entropy must also be approaching zero, in accordance with the third law.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this is the case, then surely the second law is violated, as Entropy must have decreased in the system to be approaching zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhat am i missing? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: sorry if this question seems stupid, i\u0027m much more a chemist than a physicist (and a second rate one at that -you wouldn\u0027t believe how many times i wrote enthalpy instead of entropy \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny mathematical system is merely an approximation of reality.

We can reduce this low-entropy state to a high entropy state (where each dice shows a different number) easily enough by rolling them all once. But if we want to get that ordered state of all 1\u0027s again, we need to either roll each individual dice until we get a 1, then repeat with all the others, or roll ALL the dice until that combination of 10 1\u0027s shows up once more. Both methods consume energy and time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother analogy would be to consider the rack of balls on a pool table. If memory serves there are 15 balls all arranged in a triangular state, with each numbered ball in a specific location - a very ordered, low entropy state. To increase the entropy of the rack, you just have to hit it with a cue ball. But to restore the rack, you need to hit each ball with the cue ball at a certain direction and a certain amount of force to get all of those balls back into place - or pick the balls up and put them back into order manually. Again, both methods to reduce the pool table\u0027s entropy take energy and time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth the above analogies follow certain \u003Cstrong\u003Erules\u003C/strong\u003E: to change the number on a dice you have to roll the dice; to change the position of a pool ball you have to nudge it with a cue ball and a cue stick. Those rules don\u0027t change. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe universe is the same. The laws of physics dictate how particles interact via the four basic forces. Opposite charges attract, masses attract each other, and the more mass the more the attractive force (gravity), and so on. But, the universe at the beginning has a LOT of energy, and not a lot of space for that energy (and mass) to spread out in, though that\u0027s changing as the universe expands. So the early universe is a FRENZY of particle-particle interactions, all obeying the laws of physics. Particles join together, atoms form, atoms combine into molecules, molecules are attracted to each other via electromagnetism or gravity, forming bigger masses still. These in turn start forming stars, then planets as more heavier elements come into play. And so on and so forth, all the way to forming life, intelligence, civilization. Each of these steps takes time - and consumes energy. And as energy is consumed, the total entropy of the universe increases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, when all energy sources reach equilibrium, the ability to maintain ordered conditions like living things, planetary systems, even crystalline structures, fades. No new stars are formed because you can no longer gather together enough hydrogen in one spot for a star to coalesce and ignite. Existing stars die and disperse. Existing planets grow cold - those not consumed by their stars as the stars die. Eventually things will just... stop, and if anything remains \u0022ordered\u0022 as we call it today, it will not have a chance to become more ordered. You might have a tiny salt crystal floating around, for example, but it will never get the chance to grow into a bigger salt crystal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes this make things a little clearer?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-19T05:08:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELets start with the fact that entropy is a conserved quantity.
