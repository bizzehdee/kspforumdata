I found one video that really got my attention: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/s1q4YXIbEcs?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is about curing cancer with a deactivated version of HIV and reprogramming RNA. This is simply an amazing discovery, and holds great promise. Yet.. The cure for cancer is a pretty big deal, right? Even if it was an experimental test given out for the first time, it worked. Meaning that there is a good chance that it is will work again. So why didn\u0027t I hear anything about it prior to my digging up this video?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy theory is that the media, if they got ahold of it, would cover this story. They would overdo it, spamming it out every hour, because it\u0027s what the news channels do. And people would begin to protest- maybe it would be a small fraction of the population, but they would still protest it. And why would they do that? Misinformation spread by news coverage and speculation, or them being too stupid to fully comprehend what was happening with the research. Just like stem cells and cloning, this would be deemed \u0022immoral\u0022. People would be outraged that this was used on a little girl. \u0022It cured her? No, that was a fluke. You need more research to prove it but you can\u0027t test it on humans until it\u0027s been proven safe without a doubt.\u0022 And so human testing is gone. Animal testing begins and is just as quickly stomped as \u0022inhumane\u0022 and \u0022violating animal rights\u0022. So now how do we test this without a living subject? Investors may have pulled out, not wanting to deal with such insanity. And this is just an example of one way it might go down if the media found out about this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo are they keeping this from news outlets for the time being, until it\u0027s proven safe? That\u0027s what I think is going on. And I doubt this is the first time. What do you all think? Is the media being kept in the dark? Would a controversial research method for something that will change the world be protested at all?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T16:33:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dominatus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dominatus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is about curing cancer with a deactivated version of HIV and reprogramming RNA.
