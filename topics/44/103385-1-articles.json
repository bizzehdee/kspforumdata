It would probably be better to use that to your advantage. However, printing is rather slow and expensive when compared to mass produced materials, so often it makes sense to start from there.\n\nBy the looks of it ucl3D use pretty run of the mill 3D printers.

Moving parts are not a prerequisite. They obviously can make simple or high volume parts too, but in those cases other manufacturing techniques quickly overtake 3D printers in regard to cost and speed.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-04T15:33:11Z\u0022 title=\u002204/04/2015 03:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha**"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T15:51:16Z","Content":"[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_microlattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_microlattice)\n\nVery strong for its weight but vulnerable corrosion and fragile if hit by something. \n\nThis is less an issue in space where stiffness and low weight is priority while corrosion and someone bumping into it is low chance. \n\nIts made by an simple 3d printing like technique."},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T06:40:46Z","Content":"i think subtractive techniques would work better for foams. cool thing about foams its fairly easy to use that as a base structure for application of carbon fiber composite. i know scaled composites does this to make filler cores for carbon fiber composite aircraft parts. i once used a power drill and some sandpaper to form a bock of foam into a nosecone for a model rocket, after a bit of epoxy and fabric had a fairly decent front end.\n\ni know there are a few processes for converting the waste that this would create back into new foam stock for later machining."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T06:59:16Z","Content":"Depends on the foam.
