The only thing we know for sure is that the universe exists. If we spend all of energy trying to figure out why, then we will never do anything worthwhile. Of course that also raises the question. If we can\u0027t figure out the purpose then why do anything at all? All of our actions would be meaningless and inconsequential, right? Hardly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the thing. At any given moment, we are presented with a literally infinite swath of choices. Some of these choices are admittedly inconsequential but more often than not our choices could result in damages to the property of ourselves in others, death of ourselves and others, or swing to the other side and our choices could solve a major world problem or keep someone else from taking the short way out with the latter options I mentioned. A lot of our choices are intertwined, even sometimes codependent with the lives of other people and indeed the very nature of the universe. By making each choice, we are condensing the theoretically infinite realities of our world down to one. We do this thousands of times a second...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is this BS about humans not having the power? I change the entirety of our reality with just one choice and I make thousands of choices per second. With that kind of power alone, I would say life\u0027s pretty worth living for. Who cares where it all came from?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The thing about the laws of nature is that the only reason they appear to exist is because things appear to follow them. There is a codependency / tautology here. The laws of nature exist must exist because most everything we observe adhere to them closely and things adhere to the laws of nature because they apparently exist. When you start thinking about the circular logic, you begin to realize that there is not really any reason for the relationship between the behavior of objects and the physical precepts supposedly guiding their behavior. Therefore it is entirely reasonable in my mind that we get things that seemingly disobey the laws of nature like black holes, white holes, singularities, dark matter, dark energy, and the idea of changing constants. Whose to say that the laws of physics are laws at all? Why can\u0027t they change over time? The answers to these questions are simple; no one, no reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. A simple analysis of the universe\u0027s composition (which ultimately turns out to be fundamentally unobservable particles called quarks) would point to a Hindu or Taoist perspective of a god (sorry to bring religion in but I am at a lost for how else to describe this). That is there is an eternal essence that composes the universe but that is only made to look different. Therefore, a god wouldn\u0027t be removed from the universe - a god is the universe which would make us humans part of that god. So the end, yes the universe is a goddlike being\u0027s personal plaything. We just make the mistake that something else is holding the brush.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. People call me crazy for this but I think its hardly far fetched that the universe is actually just the product of an alien civilization\u0027s computer simulation of the universe they live in or that the universe was created by a Type 4 or 5 Kardashev civilization (transcendent race; complete mastery of energy and spacetime). Actually some of the things in our universe such as the Planck Length or the varying constants conundrum already point to the computer simulation theory. Quantization is characteristic of computers which cannot render continuously varying systems and must instead iterate them in infinitesimally small ticks. Floating point losses could also account for thousandth-of-a-percent errors required in the fine structure constant to make light arriving at Earth from the first stars obey the laws of relativity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Consciousness is a funny thing. The brain is an organ trying to understand itself. It is indeed too complex and paradoxical in issue to really determine for sure whether or not there is some special purpose for it. I guess that from an evolutionary standpoint, intelligence is one of the more useful traits to an organism. This is why the average mammalian brain has been getting larger over the years. Self-awareness is a logical progression of intelligence that allows for deeper analysis of a situation, weighting of selfish vs selfless impulses, a sense of personal space, etc and therefore an enhanced ability to survive. Consciousness runs into a problem though because once its clever enough meet its needs in less time than is actually alotted, it starts to wonder it existed in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MBobrik","CreatedById":59889,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-15T23:58:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn order to know why the universe exists, we would have to know what is outside and what outside process created it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"3_bit","CreatedById":52836,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T22:40:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is quite a good question.

The universe can only be fully simulated on a computer at least as complex as the universe itself. We can\u0027t even get close to that level of complexity, and we never could- the speed of light limit, for example, would make really large computers run extremely slowly, and we simply can\u0027t utilize enough particles to make a computer that complex (we would basically have to utilize the entire universe). So, at best, we can make a computer maybe something like 1/10^15 as complex as the universe itself, MAYBE after a billion years of advancement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat does not mean that we are not capable of creating a computer simulation that could include intelligent beings, but their universe will be, by necessity, much more simple than ours. As you go down the chain, eventually you get a universe that is too simple for intelligences smart enough create computers to exist. Clearly, reality cannot be an infinite series of nested computer simulations, unless we are VERY near the bottom, and it is \u0022simulations all the way up\u0022- which is impossible. There must be a \u0022real\u0022 universe \u0022up there\u0022 somewhere to get the ball rolling. And even if you somehow discount this, and claim that it can be \u0022simulations all the way up\u0022 we find ourselves very near the \u0022bottom\u0022, which is just about infinitely unlikely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd you claim that the simulations just run more slowly in each nested universe. Again, impossible. Regardless of the simulation speed, you still need memory to store all the particle positions, velocities, states, etc. Your computer is still at least as complex as the universe it is simulating (in reality, your computer must of course be at least many times more complex). For example, consider that if you install a video game on a dual core, 2 GHz computer, it is the same installed size as on a eight core, 4 GHz beast. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother reason it is impossible, besides the fact that running the simulation more slowly doesn\u0027t really save you in computer complexity, is that as you go up the chain, the simulations must run for a longer and longer and longer and longer time period. At some point, you get to the point where you have to run the computer for longer than the age of the simulated universe, just so your lowest universe can live long enough to evolve to the point where they can create a simulated universe. But the simulated the universe they create cannot even live long enough to create a simulated universe of its own, so the chain has to end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in the end, the idea that reality is some kind of huge or infinite chain of simulated universes just does not stand to reason. At best, there could be a couple nested simulated universes. The most simple explanation is that we are not a simulation and the universe is, in fact, \u0022real\u0022- that there is no \u0022higher\u0022 law of physics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T21:37:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ea few simple words: Weak Anthropic Principal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monkeh","CreatedById":72122,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T20:43:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust want to say thank you to everyone that has taken the time to throw a few words down in this thread, I wanted to get some interesting things to read about this and you\u0027ve all certainly delivered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou guys have some amazing and fascinating brains, this little delve inside was very interesting and informative, so cheers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T07:06:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022|Velocity|\u0022 data-cite=\u0022|Velocity|\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s simply not possible.

Tell any small child to do some task that they do not want to do and it is not unlikely that they will respond with a surprisingly deep cycle of paradoxical why\u0027s. Why is unanswerable, but how is not. Why is a personal question implying motive. It is unapplicable to situations in which motive is undefined, and especially not in a universe like ours where such a motive is indeterminate. (Perhaps a limit can be taken? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E ) my answer used a postulate based on taking the limit of 0/0 as a standard. The limit on one side is infinity, and on the other, negative infinity, but the limit as approached from either side can be derived to be 0 and thus infinity is only one side of nothing, and so is its opposite. Nothing is not truly absence, only the difference between boundless entities to either side of it in a sense, though that interpretation does not reveal the extent of the implications of such a system\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-22T19:55:26Z\u0022 title=\u002212/22/2013 07:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by TheGatesofLogic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T22:52:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022comicbstudeo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022comicbstudeo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ein an infinite amount of time the probability of the universe existing is 100%.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like your thinking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
