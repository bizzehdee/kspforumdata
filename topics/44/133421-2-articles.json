Whilst Skylon and SABRE are going through all sorts of tests and research and scale-ups, Elon Musk is bouncing rockets all over the show, doing tricks, showboating. etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, Elon\u0027s rockets can land and take off from pretty much any flat, tidy place\u00A0already. Skylon will most likely require specially reinforced runways to be built.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut at this state of the game, i think there is everything still to play for. One advantage of Skylon is that the air-breathing engine technology can be adapted for use in a number of projects (eg: an airliner).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, it\u0027s basically that staging is a lot more effective than 0 staging, which is what Skylon uses, to becoming economical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222439976\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022133421\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221457028371\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002298962\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, Streetwind said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main thing that makes me dismiss Skylon is its roadmap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom what the latest plans look like, the SABRE engine is scheduled to have a working prototype no sooner than 2020. And there\u0027ll be another 2 years or so from a working prototype to a production ready engine, and another year after that to get a set of four to six of them tested and flight certified.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd all that is before they even \u003Cem\u003Estart\u003C/em\u003E on Skylon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou need to understand that Reaction Engines is, as their name says, first and foremost an engine manufacturer. Skylon is a concept study that they are considering to produce, eventually, but their main focus is likely going to market the SABRE engine once they\u0027ve finished it. There are other entities interested in using it for their own stuff, primarily various militaries who wish for faster airplanes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll in all, I consider Skylon to start to become interesting to talk about around the time SpaceX establishes their Mars colony. It may happen by 2025... or it may happen sometime after 2030. Maybe it won\u0027t happen at all, who knows. The point is, it\u0027s not something happening in the near future.
