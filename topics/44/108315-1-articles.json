Now with a new mission overview!","CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T00:44:48Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T00:44:48Z","Content":"I\u0027ve made a new plan. And it\u0027s a 6-month stay now!\n\nSo, over the past few weeks I\u0027ve been working on a reasonable process for a SpaceX and Bigelow Aerospace-manufactured lunar landing by or in 2019. The destination? The lunar south pole/Aitken basin. It\u0027s called Artemis.\n\nIt involves 5 Falcon Heavy launches, and it would accomplish the following goals:\n\n    [I]1. Analyze the water ice content of Aitken and see if a colony could be established there.2. Demonstrate in-orbit rendezvous spacecraft technology.3. Demonstrate the full capability of the Raptor engine.4. Set up a permanent outpost that can be visited by future missions.5. Prove that the Dragon V2 can be used beyond Earth Orbit.6. Prove that long-duration lunar missions can take place safely.7. Use minimal non-existent hardware.8. Prove that a deep-space habitat can be re-used, whether for the same or different purposes.[/I]\n\nSo far, the plan is to have the first two Falcon Heavies to launch to assemble the *Gazelle* spacecraft, which is composed of two modules: A BA-300 and the service module, which is composed of a fuel tank and a Raptor engine. It will be used as a transit habitat and an Earth Departure Stage throughout the mission.\n\nThe next Heavy launch would be for the Re-Usable Ovoid Lunar Outpost Module (RULOM). It would be a surface version of the BA-330.\n\nThe fourth Heavy would launch a Dragon-L. It\u0027s a Dragon filled with supplies and experiments with the trunk replaced with a new module: The Lunar Deceleration Stage (LDS). The LDS\u0027 purpose is to slow down the Dragon or Dragon V2 spacecraft to the point where it\u0027s main landing engines will be able to land it safely.\n\nThe Dragon-L would then land close to the RULOM.\n\nA few days later, the final Falcon Heavy, carrying a Dragon V2-L (Just a V2 version of the Dragon-L carrying 3 or 4 people) named Artemis I would launch. The V2-L would dock with *Gazelle* and then the two docked spacecraft would proceed to lunar orbit. The Gazelle would be placed in a very low parking orbit that will only last about a year, but it won\u0027t stay there for that long. The purpose of the extremely low orbit is because the V2-L\u0027s main landing engines still don\u0027t have the Delta-V to get to a normal lunar orbit.\n\nThe V2-L would then land in a similar fashion to the V1-L, near the RULOM and V1-L. The crew would then exit the V2-L and live in the RULOM for the next six months.\n\nAfter six months have passed, the crew would board the V2-L, ascend to low lunar orbit, and then depart for Earth. *Gazelle* would be placed into a stable LEO orbit to be converted into a space station or re-used for another Artemis mission. Artemis I would re-enter and recover safely.\n\nSo what does everyone think of this new plan?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T16:00:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 04:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by \\_Augustus\\_**\n  \nRe-did plan."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T02:19:32Z","Content":"No. Unless they have a secret program we don\u0027t know about.

Elon Musk has stated that Dragon V2 is already capable of landing on the moon; all it takes are minor modifications. SpaceX could definitely land something on the moon by 2019, just not people.

SpaceX manufactures many types of payload; Dragon, Dragon V2 and now also satellites. They are a payload-to-destination provider as well as a launch provider. With current SpaceX architecture you don\u0027t need an EDS to get to the moon or Mars, merely improved and hardened avionics and electronics, maybe extra instruments.

All SpaceX has to do is copy their designs, not mentioning the manufacturing of the required parts would be easier because we have 3D printing and stuff now. Four years is a bit of a stretch, though. I voted Maybe.\n\nWhy would you bother replicating Apollo hardware when you can put a slightly modified Dragon V2 on the surface of the moon, launched atop a Falcon Heavy. The question is not one of feasibility, but of desire, and for anyone who isn\u0027t Elon Musk or at top of the SpaceX hierarchy, it\u0027s pure speculation."},{"CreatedByName":"Jonboy","CreatedById":134111,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T15:46:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Falcon Heavy will be flying next year.\n\nIf everything goes perfectly.
