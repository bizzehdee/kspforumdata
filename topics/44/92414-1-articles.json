We\u0027ve yet to exhaust even what is possible using our biochemical and cellular setup. I love when we find things like the black smokers because a lot of people who thought they had the limits figured out and claim things impossible have to eat their hats. (In that case biochemistry working well in excess of boiling temperature, multicellular, and thriving!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, the way we do things on Earth could be incredibly efficient and really the \u0022best\u0022 way so you\u0027ll see life everywhere trend in that direction regardless of their chemistries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat if that life is using a genetic molecule different than ours? What if this molecule self replicates differently? What if it\u0027s manner of randomness is different (rather than the process of meiosis it does something different)? What kind of reproductive necessities would come about in the creature\u0027s behavior because of those differences?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn example would be that in plants an individual possessing multiple genomes can be hugely beneficial where as in animals that is absolutely deadly. Just because multiple genomes present in an animal will kill them well before birth, doesn\u0027t mean in every organism that must be true.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs long as physics allows it and the chemistry is reasonably efficient. Life could try it somewhere that something else that is efficient, like what we do, hasn\u0027t already taken hold.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt must also be remembered that you see highly conserved features among large swaths of the tree of life because there was one organism that started going down that path, and all the life after it shares traits with that one organism. That doesn\u0027t mean all those traits are required, some were, but not all. Example is bony fish and sharks. There\u0027s no reason that sharks couldn\u0027t have went the direction the bony fish did and ended up evolving traits needed to live on land and we\u0027d all have properties derived from shark bodies rather than bony fish. (Neil Shubin\u0027s Inner Fish explains this idea really well)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain though the plausibility comes back to the demands of the biochemistry. Like a genetic molecule with more than 2 strands. There would be no point in 3 or 4 and would needlessly complicate the organism\u0027s metabolism and reproduction. Error correction could occur via some sort of parity rather than proof reading proteins, but how would that work chemically using very weak bonds and how would that correction occur spontaneously? In a low population situation you don\u0027t want to require more than 2 individuals needed to make offspring, preferably as many as possible to replicate those genes as much as possible. Kerbiloid posted about the Selfish Gene, that\u0027s the idea here. Each gene, each idea, wants to replicate as much as possible. Successful ones do and become nearly ubiquitous in the population and deleterious ones exist in low concentration. Neutral ones are often common but as they don\u0027t hurt or hinder can flux in concentration in the population. Anything that defeats this dynamic in the function of reproduction will itself be out-competed by a method of reproduction that obeys this idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T08:01:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RainDreamer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RainDreamer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENot to prove/disprove this point, but I would like to point out an interesting species on earth: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://curiouscox.wordpress.com/2012/01/11/the-spotted-hyenas-she-...../\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://curiouscox.wordpress.com/2012/01/11/the-spotted-hyenas-she-...../\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe from the outside, a female spotted hyena looks almost exactly the same as a male, even down to their genital.

Males give sperm cells with small mass and make practically no contribution to the developing organism other than DNA.

Furthermore, females in our species have to carry that egg around for nine months as it drains her nutrients, while the father gets to sit around, eat, and watch TV.

DNA or not, sexual reproduction would not likely be a function of alien life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Sexual reproduction assumes that this form of life replicates it self thru the exact same means we use, which would be unlikely. Perhaps other organism build copies of themselves intelligently, like a race of robots. Perhaps the organisms reproduce by simple splitting in half, the way cellular life does. Perhaps all organisms of a \u0022species\u0022 descend from a single queen organism that does not require ... or fertilization of eggs. Perhaps other life never reproduces at all, perhaps whatever event caused the initial life to exist sometimes reoccurs, and new life is added to their \u0022eternal\u0022 ecosystem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Just because our evolutionary strategies work, does not mean that the same outcome is not achievable thru different means.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I see people arguing that sexual reproduction would be likely simple because it work to accomplish \u0022some goal\u0022. I agree that genetic diversity and the other goals listed are an important part of evolution, I just disagree that using the exact same strategy we use is the most likely in an independent system with different operating perameters. I would argue that other roads to the same goals exist even on our own earth, and would especially exist on a world with a different set of conditions to drive said evolution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease remember that evolution is the only known force that can create increasing complexity out of simplicity. This likely seems counter intuitive but this is possible by taking \u0022steps\u0022. Take what exists, add \u00221 step\u0022 of complexity, throw it against the wall and see if it survives, repeat. The way evolution accomplishes these goals is not necessarily the most simple or most efficient method available, and as the goals of survivability change (change in environment), an organism is \u0022trapped\u0022 with changing what it already posses into what it needs thru evolution, fin into leg, leg into wing.

At least explain why you make that assertion, and yes, I will then produce a list of possible caveats that might satisfy whatever your concerns are. Thats the difference between talking about fantasy aliens and talking about earth biology from the past/future. If you want to talk facts, the fact is there are no aliens that we know of. We are starting this conversation with bad presuppositions and following from there, and I think considering the bad presuppositions we start with (assuming aliens with evolution from planet X) you have to question the idea that these lifeforms will even have cells, you have to question if they will even have DNA. I can agree that is these aliens were our \u0022space cousins\u0022 thru panspermia, or were the most coincidental organisms to ever exists then everything you say is true, I just think both of those are highly unlikely unless the OP adds them in as a presupposition to our discussion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWe have seen many different ways of circumventing Muller\u0027s ratchet evolve on Earth, some convergently arrive at the same solution (sexual reproduction)\u003Cp\u003EIt is likely that an independent genesis that leads to a diverse biosphere would also have many lineages arrive at this solution as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, the \u0022independent\u0022 \u0022convergent\u0022 development of sexual reproduction, as well as other convergent developments (eyes have developed \u0022independently\u0022 over and over and over for many different organisms) are not independent at all. You forget that both plants and animals are the descendents of the same great grandmother organism. They share dna, and even though they develop new information, they can only derive that new information from variations of the old information they possess. Also, remember that all these creatures are responding to the same planetary environment, which is the driving factor of this convergence. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea of aliens presupposes a likely lack of cellular structure, DNA, and maybe even biology as a whole. Thats why you call them aliens, because they aren\u0027t like you, they\u0027re alien in composition and physiology. Sexual reproduction is the go to solution for cellular life who utilizes DNA for heredity. No one disputes that, I just dispute that cellular life that utilizes DNA would hardly even be worth considering an alien, more like just another \u0022kingdom\u0022 in the biological classification system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
