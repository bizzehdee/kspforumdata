I don\u0027t know the payload capacity of a reusable one, but Musk once stated that the impact on the payload capacity will be about 30 percent for a reusable falcon 9. However, the middle core needs more fuel to return than the booster cores because it will be going both further and faster before it returns, resulting in more fuel needed for the return. I think that we can expect something like a 40-60% impact on the payload capacity for a reusable falcon heavy vs an expendable falcon heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-05T13:00:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t count on a fully reusable F9H any time soon. The F9-R first stage can only be recovered because it\u0027s a first stage booster that is jettisoned at a lower altitude than the non-reusable F9. It then uses part of its dV potential to perform the throwback burn, which puts it on an RTLS trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the heavy, the lateral boosters will probably use a similar profile. But I wouldn\u0027t count on ever returning the core stage, because it will be flying much higher and faster. It would need some serious dV to bring it back as well as some kind of TPS. This would all seriously cut into the payload capacity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-05T17:43:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOuch - 60% would be quite a hit.
