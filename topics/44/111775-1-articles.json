The structure needed to be redone, plumbing had to be rearranged, and equipment to add an upper stage was added. \n\nJust because the engines are the same doesn\u0027t mean anything. SLS required they be moved to the core.

To turn it into the SLS.\n\nIt\u0027s barely shuttle derived.\n\nAtlas III used balloon tanks just like all atlases before it, used a centaur, and was reengineed. The reengining required the stage tanks to be resized.
