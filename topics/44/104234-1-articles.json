We\u0027ve been around for a while and I wanted to share our project with my favourite forums. \n\nI\u0027m a Boston University student and since the beginning of the year have been part of the school\u0027s Rocket Propulsion Group. We specialise in hybrid rockets and have built a 30-ft tall rocket, a testing hybrid to practice working with thrust vectoring technologies, and all the ground support electronics, hardware and software to ensure our launch is the safest it can be. We aim to be the first amateur, college-student group to get to space, and with a hybrid rocket no less. Our team has some incredible people on it and their work really deserves to be mentioned. So please, check out our website and look around. I\u0027ll hang around this thread to answer any questions I can.\n\n[**Enjoy our site at your leisure!**](http://www.burocket.org)\n\n![infographicweb-1024x620.png](http://www.burocket.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/infographicweb-1024x620.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-16T04:37:15Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2015 04:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Budgie**"},{"CreatedByName":"architeuthis","CreatedById":57137,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T05:10:24Z","Content":"Kudos!
