But something interesting dawned on me. It\u0027s very potentialy convenient for one things important and possibly annoying in Egypt. Grinding! If it\u0027s 75 feet down it could be to stop winds. If so maybe it\u0027s not unfinished but purposely capped to slow down wind and possibly add lesser structures for wind power or animal power along with lots of possible animal drawn mechanical rope type rigging with buckets/baskets for getting stuff out easy. It also looks like a modern makeup thing in the middle. So, maybe not even grain. They could go through the expense for either mass constant grain grinding or for something more valuable like dyes or other things they wanted mass amounts of or could sell. It could be stone based mass production. If you take this farther and the great pyramid was something like the worlds largest hopper and grinder maybe that explains why nobody seems to be upset for the most part and why they helped. If they were all farmers they could have been helping make a massive town/city mill they could all send their stuff to to grind down for the populous. If you take into animal labor for trnasport and possible pay for services later, this would be a nice setup for something they are very dependent on. What if all those fancy stone traps in the pyramid or for weather purposes or something so it doesn\u0027t get flooded in rare rainy times to keep stuff dry. Those whole could all be for hopper activities to a main grinding chamber or rope for rigging animal power or something odd. Maybe the odd temperature control or other features potential to the pyramid were useful for some industrial activity. Including potential electric lights or helping dry grains if water was used in the grinding. It\u0027s possible the overly large stone structures were a basic necessity for long term sights given sand movements and other changes normal in the desert. I\u0027m hinting this could both storage or other grinding technology and potentially amortar and pestle. If it was for something like massive storage for very valuable purple/red dyes for royalty or or other industry it could make sense. He also says some of the blocks are rose granite instead of normal. Is this useful for any type of similar activity over the other materials? It makes a path from the center container to the stairs. What could this have been useful for?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn top of this, if you take into account the idea of the Nile moving it might make sense if these were all practical constructs. If it went right up to the great pyramids it could have been very convenient in it\u0027s time. And later constructs could be for other purposes or re-purposing of other things. Cellar technology is as old as time if I\u0027m not mistaken and the know how of how to use similar things is very old and primitive in nature. It\u0027s not unreasonable to have it translate to as many uses and styles as possible. Along with anything derived from it or similar. Especially if it\u0027s important for things like drying grains or produce which is also old and potentially annoying in a desert, windy, sandy environment. Maybe the great pyramid was only partially done at one point and then built up. Or built in a way needing more complete construction or protection. Let along a tall smooth object with the potenial to drop things into it from shafts. Shafts also related to astronomy which is related to farming. Those shafts could be to watch seasons like a clock and then the building used to also deal with grain grinding on a larger scale for city folk, selling to other nations, storage on top of other means. Underground and it\u0027s relation to water reserves could be for different type of grinding methods. maybe even for a lot of different substances. There is the story in the bible related to similar. Might not be far fetched. It doesn\u0027t necessarily go into a lot of detail about more than storing a lot of grain for the 7 year famine. It could even create a line of logic to where they got the pyramid design if it lines up time wise. Jews(Abraham etc) came from Babylon that had ziggurats. Pyramids are basically different styles of those buildings in a way. No idea about the timing though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziggurat_of_Ur\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziggurat_of_Ur\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbraham came from Ur according to the bible. These stories, before the bible goes into it\u0027s major subjects and time periods, has almost nothing else to go over subject wise. It\u0027s really narrowed in scope and a bit focused. If it has significance it would make sense. Why is it so important he came from UR etc...? It doesn\u0027t focus on much besides, Abraham leaves Ur, wanders, has kids/descendants. One kid gets dropped in a well by his brothers and saves Egypt from famine after becoming a leader just below the pharaoh himself. Later I think it jumps to Moses(who is thought to be Ramses by some) after a long period of time who brings them out of Egypt after having grown into a larger population or something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z58CQ9JBk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z58CQ9JBk\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/d7z58CQ9JBk?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe are forgetting the most important potential thing related to cellars and grain.. BEER! ;d What if it was part of beer production on a mass scale! Who wouldn\u0027t help make the biggest beer brewery in history(could explain how it was built in 20 years!!). Beer is considered liquid grain in the ancient world(even modern history). Less prone to disease and preserves nutrients.. Think about it! If the pyramids have pure spring water underneath and god knows what else. In alcohol making the stuff you loose is considered the angels portions. Possibly similar to the idea that the pharaohs sole going to heaven potentially!! \u003Cspan\u003E;d\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EMind you, alcohols can be aged for a very long time. If they had the ability to fill the pyramid or something and need to store beer for the long run the doorways closing could have to do with sealing in areas or stopping airflow for the aging process or some odd things. It seals off the center area almost completely at the tunnels and bottom shaft. But leaves the main opening.. Does this logically stop any action like air flow given the known designs?\u003C/span\u003E Can anything obvious be deduced given the way it\u0027s sealed off? Even if part of the aging process left beer aging in the pyramid before another stage or transport to another area it could be logical to locally store it for a period. Maybe there was a need to very thoroughly seal it temporarily for things related to this or other activities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then all those rumors of underground pathways between everything. That screams cellar storage. Both books and food potentially. I wonder what conditions stored ancient paper best.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe they should put things like the paper used for scrolls and old fashion beer containers of various sorts in the pyramid in different locations and see how they are affected long term(without making a mess obviously).
