Despite the effort to transition away from fossil fuels, they\u0027re not going away anytime soon, and oil is needed not just for energy, but as feedstock for industry to make a myriad of products. I recognize the economic need for pipelines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know that a lot\u00A0of the \u0022oil\u0022 that Alberta\u00A0produces is bitumen mined from the tar sands. And they want to get that to the markets. But do they have to pump diluted bitumen (\u0022dilbit\u0022; to make it pumpable) through the pipes? If dilbit spills, the diluent (natural-gas condensates\u00A0such as\u00A0naphtha)\u00A0will quickly evaporate, causing health effects to anyone exposed to the vapors. The toxic bitumen, being heavier than water, will sink out of sight (and out of mind)\u00A0and be pretty much impossible to clean up. Affected environments will take ages to recover.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan\u0027t they crack bitumen into something lighter, that will float on water and make it possible to recover and clean up spills? These pipeline companies say they will\u00A0do\u00A0everything possible to protect the environment. If that\u0027s the case, why won\u0027t they crack the bitumen into something that is, in my view, somewhat more environmentally friendly?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can only think it depends on what the end customer wants to do with it. Bitumen is the main ingredient in asphalt, IIRC. I assume it\u0027s easier to crack a big molecule into smaller ones than it is to build up a longer chain, but is it that much of a showstopper? They don\u0027t want to build a plant to crack bitumen for the pipeline? But that would create more jobs (always touted as a reason to build the pipeline) and presumably create a value-added product.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI ask this question here hoping to get some answers before I (attempt to) bring this question to the attention of the powers that be. There are a lot of scientific minds here, so I\u0027m hoping one of them can answer this question. If Kinder Morgan switched to pumping a lighter oil through their expanded Trans Mountain pipeline, it may mollify at least some of the environmental and native groups dead set against the project. I\u0027m not against expanding the pipeline that currently pumps crude less than 500m from my house. I just don\u0027t understand why they have to pump dilbit, aside from the fact that that\u0027s what they\u0027re extracting in Alberta. If customers specifically want bitumen, they can ship it by rail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-26T05:54:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPipes are the cheapest way to transport lots of liquid, its even done at sea if volume is large enough.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nOther option is rail who is more expensive and also use a lot of the rail capacity.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHealth effect from evaporation is not an major issue if someone detect an leak they stop the pumping and clean up.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nMain issue is an leak underground who might go on over time polluting\u00A0the ground before anybody notice, however as its thick should stop it from spreading to much.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn the other hand the thick oil would also make it hard to pump, might make as much sense to crack it before pumping it. at least if you could use the gas localy and I guess they use plenty of power.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-26T07:43:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow long is an oil deposit lifespan?\u003Cbr\u003E\nHow often they would rebuild new\u00A0refineries\u00A0from scratch while\u00A0the deposits get depleted?\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, they found a large refinery in a constant place more or less close to the deposits cluster and pipe the pulp from deposits to the refinery.

You don\u0027t need to make points about how \u0022if a lighter fraction floats, it would be easier to clean up\u0022, you need to make points about how you have found a method which you can show is a better fit than what is currently being done.
