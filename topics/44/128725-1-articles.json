With 100% first stage reusability, the same factory has to build only 2.5 first stages and 72.5 engines. The result is that due to lower procurement volumes and higher\u00A0fixed costs,\u00A0those reusable stages are going to cost a lot more than the disposable ones. Enough to seriously cut into the reduction induced by reusing the stages in the first place. Instead of saving 95% on the manufacturing cost of the first stage, for the same amount of flights, the real cost reduction might\u00A0only be 50%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:20.3636px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\nSo in the end, what sounded like a 95% (of 30%) reduction of launch cost might only turn out to be a 15% reduction, which\u00A0has the potential to bring the cost of a Falcon 9 launch from $60 million down to $45 million. It\u0027s a nice perk to pass on to your customers, but it\u0027s not a game changer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:20.3636px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\nNow,\u00A0from the customer\u0027s point of view,\u00A0the actual launch is only a small part of the total cost of a typical project. Maybe, again, 20%. The rest is the satellite itself (the biggest part of the budget), the ground stations, the insurance, and the actual operations. This means that in the grand scheme of things, the total saving\u00A0that a customer can expect when they put a satellite in service is 15%\u00A0of 20%, which is only 3%. On a $200 million comsat project, that\u0027s a whopping $6 million saving on their total expenses.\u00A0Again, it\u0027s a nice saving, but it\u0027s not a revolution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:20.3636px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\nNote: The above figures are educated guesses, but I believe the orders of magnitude are pretty close.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-28T10:59:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFalcon has only \u003Cstrong\u003Elanded\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\nStill no proved re-\u003Cstrong\u003Elaunched\u003C/strong\u003E liquid-fuel rocket exists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-28T11:12:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222338872\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022128725\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221451279835\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022143381\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022fredinno\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, fredinno said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nULA is not really any \u0022older\u0022 than SpaceX- ULA was founded in 2006.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcept Lockheed has been around since the thirties or even before.
