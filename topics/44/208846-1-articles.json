Those are limited by properties of superconductors. Superconductors have certain maximum filed strength. Above that Cooper pairs are broken and material lose superconductivity. I think practical limit is around 20 T in continuous use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are no resistive losses in superconductors. You have to put in certain energy to create magnetic field but after that you have to only keep superconductors cold. You have to also dump that energy when you want to turn off the magnet. Uncontrolled quenching (loss of superconductivity) may cause damage. You have also to be very careful if you operate near maximum field. For example piece of ferromagnetic material near the magnet may cause local exceed of max field and quenching.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeSchmuckatelli","CreatedById":154477,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-13T14:41:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224154402\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208846\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221657698895\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154334\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hannu2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, Hannu2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example piece of ferromagnetic material near the magnet may cause local exceed of max field and quenching\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhelp...
