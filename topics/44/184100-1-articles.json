It\u0027s fascinating stuff.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere have been some good, well-reasoned comments already, but just to ensure people have a good enough understanding of vaccines, here\u0027s a brief (and pretty basic, but still accurate) rundown of how they work, why, and the effect they have on the body (regardless of age).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, let\u0027s think about what happens when you get infected by a virus for which you\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ehave not\u003C/em\u003E been vaccinated. There are certain types of cells called \u0022antigen-presenting cells\u0022\u00A0(primarily B cells)\u00A0running around in your body which are specifically trying to find anything that they recognize as \u0022foreign\u0022, or \u0022non-self\u0022. The term \u0022antigen\u0022 refers to anything that the immune system will react to. If one of them finds a viral particle (our antigen in this case), it will process it and present the antigen to a T cell. When a T cell binds to the antigen, it does a whole slew of things, the important one for this discussion is activating the B cell. When a B cell is activated, it is basically taking that antigen and calling dibs on any instances of the antigen it finds. It will primarily produce antibodies for that particular antigen, and it will split into a bunch of daughter cells which will be on the lookout specifically for any more of that antigen. I think I might be getting too detailed here, so I\u0027ll tone it down a bit. After the first B cell is activated, whenever antigens are found, cytokines are released. These chemicals do a lot of things, but some of their main functions include initiating inflammatory responses, attracting white blood cells (the ones that try to eat bad stuff). There is also an increase of B cell production (specific to that antigen), which helps find more antigens. The goal is to remove all traces of non-self.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically what\u0027s happening here is: you\u0027re getting sick! Throwing up when you have the flu is not a direct result of the flu virus, it\u0027s a result of your immune system trying to get rid of it. But, I can hear you ask, why do some viruses cause a stronger reaction, or even kill people? Well, the reaction depends on what types of cells they infect. The flu, for example, primarily infects skin cells. This includes the respiratory and intestinal tracts! HIV/AIDS, you probably know, infects immune cells themselves. When viruses replicate, it usually involves killing the host cell, so if it takes awhile for the B cells to find them, potentially you could lose many cells in a particular area, which of course will be detrimental to your health (Incidentally, without your immune system, you\u0027d die of losing too many cells from your body). In addition to cell types, rapidity of replication is another factor (if more antigens are being created, there\u0027s more for B cells to react with, leading to enhanced immunological response). If too high of an immunological response occurs, you could die.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, let\u0027s move on to vaccines. Vaccines are generally either a weakened version of a harmful virus\u00A0or a dead virus (dead == physiologically inactive). But they cause a reaction in the body just like a fully active virus would do! But, since they are dead or weakened, it takes much less time to isolate and destroy them than live ones, and there will be fewer viral particles overall, so the obvious immunological\u00A0effects are minimal.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, is there any danger in giving vaccines to someone? Well, if someone has an autoimmune or immunodeficiency disease, administering a weakened virus could still be very harmful. But, assuming they have a nominally functional immune system, the quantity of viral particles injected into the body is minuscule, well within the capability of the even a baby\u0027s body to handle. But what about multiple vaccines at once? If more viral particles means a stronger immune response, couldn\u0027t that cause problems? We have to keep things in perspective. Virus replication, unchecked, is \u003Cem\u003Eexponential\u003C/em\u003E. The body can catch and stop a\u00A0major infection!
