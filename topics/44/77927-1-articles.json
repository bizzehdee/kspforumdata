That is a pipe dream no matter who you take into account right now, as noone: literally noone has the capacity to pull it off right now nor secured funding to complete this mission. This whole topic is about estimations, plans, ideas, future capacities. So let\u0027s stick to that, as if we\u0027d actually try to do the reality checks on everyone - conclusion would be that noone is going to make a moon landing in any foreseeable future as noone is secure enough to tell when and that for sure they\u0027ll do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, back to the topic:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kryten\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kryten\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EProton could push cargo from Plesetsk as well, with the \u003Cstrong\u003Eapproiate launchpad\u003C/strong\u003E;\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T16:48:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sky_walker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sky_walker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHighlighted you the important part.
