It fits into the main body and is equipped with multiple high-thrust hypergolic engines which also act as the OMS and RCS system. These allow the crew cabin to eject during launch abort.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E For crew transfer only, the payload bay is fitted with an additional internal tank and a disposable strap-on tank, allowing SSTO with the loss of the external tank alone. For unmanned flights, the crew cabin module is replaced with an autonomous control module with an auxiliary fuel tank but the same hypergolic engines. For manned flights including payload, or for higher-dV unmanned missions, 2-4 strap-on FH-style boosters are attached with propellant crossfeed; these detach at fairly low speed to return autonomously.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Re-entry will be...exciting. The aerospike already has to be able to handle very high heat fluxes and will probably already be actively cooled, so the orbiter enters tail-first and upside down to burn off most of its speed, with active use of the RCS system for stabilization. As soon as enough speed has dropped off, the orbiter begins to rotate forward, exposing more and more of its underside. The lower speed at this point means that the heat shield on its underside can be constructed of a lightweight, non-ablative, lower-performing, highly reusable material rather than requiring the tiles that the Shuttle used. Active RCS stabilization continues as speed decreases, ultimately entering a low-L/D gliding flight:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![re_entry_profile.png](http://s28.postimg.org/ukh4pqsel/re_entry_profile.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The orbiter does not make a very good glider and cannot manage a level approach, which is all the better because it doesn\u0027t have heavy landing gear. Instead, the RCS system returns the craft to a high angle of attack, and the aerospike engines are ignited, killing terminal velocity in a near-suicide burn. Then, the RCS system reduces power, allowing the angle of attack to drop until the orbiter is horizontal, and both the RCS system and the aerospike engines in combination fire to lower the orbiter to the ground:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![Landing_approach.png](http://s29.postimg.org/v3zopba8n/Landing_approach.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If the aerospike cannot be directed downward enough to execute such a landing, then additional RCS thrusters can be incorporated in the aft portion of the orbiter.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Ambitious? Perhaps...but it seems like the best possible combination of geometry to allow for the capabilities of the shuttle with next-generation technology.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The amount of hypergolic fuel, internal fuel, and the number of strap-on boosters can be adapted to each mission. By using in-orbit staging and/or refueling, the orbiter could easily manage a lunar transfer. Depending on the fuel capacity of the crew cabin, it could manage a landing on its own on hypergolics, or lunar-orbit refueling could allow the entire orbiter to make the descent to the lunar surface and return to refuel and make the transfer to LEO again. The ability to take off and land vertically in a horizontal attitude reduces the instabilities and risks of vertical landings and allows far simpler crew egress.\n\u003E \n\nI love this design, but as cool as the crew cabin is, it\u0027l have to go.I still like a multiple interchangeable booster design,and think that serv without the cargo bay is best.Why doesn\u0027t anyone consider that?"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-10T22:11:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Just now, fredinno said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E When did I say the ladning burn would not be done by the main propulsive engines?

And it will definitely do SSTO.\n\nThe engines (not shown) are linear aerospikes, mounted on the sidewalls of the center body and the inside of the cowlings. Main fuel tanks are held in the cowlings. The engines on the central body point down and back; the engines on the cowlings point up and back.\n\n![rear_view.png](http://s21.postimg.org/sx4mmypmf/rear_view.png)\n\nThere\u0027s an additional ring of aerospike engines around the inner cowling at the rear which point backward.\n\n![side_view.png](http://s21.postimg.org/o9ykl729j/side_view.png)\n\nTakeoff and landing are both in a horizontal attitude. The engines mounted on the central sidewalls fire at full throttle, pulling air down over the upper fuselage and mixing inside the cowling before being ejected downward through the bottom of the cowling. RCS thrusters at the front of the fuselage (also not shown) fire to compensate for the slight forward push, and the spaceship rises vertically.\n\nOnce the ascent begins, the ship starts to nose up and all engines are ignited simultaneously.\n\n![front_view.png](http://s21.postimg.org/stat6pk53/front_view.png)\n\nThe engines on the bottom of the inner cowling suck air in from below and thrust it backward, while the engines on the upper sidewalls of the central body suck air in from above and thrust it backward. This produces a highly-compressed vortex flow through the two openings at the back. As the ship accelerates, ram effect begins to contribute, as shockwaves entering the cowling are focused, heated by the side-mounted engines, and ejected out the back in a ramrocket configuration.\n\nDue to the open cowling, the airflow is dramatically higher than for any ducted rocket ever conceived, allowing the craft to reach hypersonic speeds with only a fraction of the normal fuel costs. The transition to hypersonic speeds marks the end of air-augmented advantages, so this is timed to coincide with around 100 km of altitude. At this point, the side-mounted engines are throttled down to reduce acceleration and the rear engines provide the remaining orbital insertion burn.\n\nRe-entry is a dream due to the high number of surface areas with which to dissipate heat. The side-mounted thrusters fire on approach to kill terminal velocity and make a soft touchdown on extensible landing legs.\n\nFor higher cargo requirements, launch can be vertically-positioned with strap-on boosters."},{"CreatedByName":"fredinno","CreatedById":143381,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-11T01:40:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, sevenperforce said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E A vertical tail-first landing is inherently unstable and egress is made highly difficult, which is why I\u0027m aiming for a horizontal-attitude tail-first landing.\n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, sevenperforce said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![perspective_view.png](http://s21.postimg.org/3ojstakon/perspective_view.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Yes, it looks unlike anything we\u0027ve ever launched.

I *think* this form factor can manage SSTO...it\u0027s got maximum internal volume, minimal ascent cross-section, and maximum re-entry cross-section.\n\nI don\u0027t like the idea of landing a crew module tail-first, which is why I had the notion for a tail-first suicide burn followed by a controlled nose-down to horizontal attitude on the forward SuperDraco-style thrusters. Extensible landing legs are all that would be required; once down, the ground crew can easily put wheels under the legs.\n\nA primary advantage of the forward removable crew module with really powerful thrusters is that it offers unparalleled abort capabilities. Catastrophic launch abort? No problem; the thrusters blast you away from the exploding orbiter and then land propulsively well clear of the fireball. Meteor or debris strike in orbit that renders the orbiter unsuitable for re-entry (e.g, *Columbia* scenario)? Again, no problem; the crew module can detach and re-enter alone, using its underbelly shielding to aerobrake (ablatively, but at this point reuse is no longer the main concern) and touch down again on its thrusters.\n\nAnd autonomous-return FH-style liquid-fueled boosters would be preferred to SRBs, but that\u0027s beside the point.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-11T17:28:11Z\u0022 title=\u002202/11/2016 05:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by sevenperforce**"},{"CreatedByName":"Emperor of the Titan Squid","CreatedById":158183,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-11T22:13:43Z","Content":"I like this design more,But have you considered using a catupult? also, if you have horizontal landing, you need wings, maybe folding.I suggest that this thread should have 3 phases, phase A which is now, and phase B, where the field will be narowed down and certain designs will be selected.Finally, in phase C we will build them in game."},{"CreatedByName":"fredinno","CreatedById":143381,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-12T18:37:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On February 11, 2016 at 6:06 AM, sevenperforce said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E With the high number of heat-resistant surfaces, re-entry should be easy.
