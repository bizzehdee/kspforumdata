NASA wants fuel depots in space, and the ability to easily and robotically transfer LOX and LH2 from ship to ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart of that is getting rid of all the other normally required consumables, like hydrazine for RCS, helium to maintain pressure in fuel tanks, and loads of batteries. That\u0027s the IVF part; coming up with ways to make LOX/LH2 do those other jobs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELOX/LH2 RCS thruster have been built before, so no big problem. You can recycle waste gasses to manage pressure in the tanks. But for electricity would you believe a generator hooked to a six-cylinder gasoline-style engine running gaseous hydrogen \u0026amp; oxygen? I\u0027d have expected a fuel cell, but...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe ICE is cooled regeneratively by the incoming cold hydrogen gas from the main vehicle ullage spaces. This gas \u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewould be vented as waste boiloff in a traditional system. The exhaust gases from the ICE are used to produce \u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Esettling thrust. Using waste propellants to produce power and settling results in a major mass reduction. The lower \u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eenergy conversion efficiency of an internal combustion engine as compared to traditional fuel cell systems is more \u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethan compensated for by the use of this waste thermal energy to settle the vehicle and store energy for tank \u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Epressurization. In effect IVF is a cogeneration system where lower energy gases are put to beneficial use. Because \u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eof this the utility of the energy released approaches 100% and ancillary cooling systems are not required. \u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...so I guess not. Anyway, ULA\u0027s thinking they can shave 10% off the dry weight of their upper stages so we gain advantages even before fuel depots are available. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELots of info here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.ulalaunch.com/uploads/docs/Published_Papers/Extended_Duration/Integrated_Vehicle_Propulsion_and_Power_System_for_Long_Duration_Cyrogenic_Spaceflight_2011.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.ulalaunch.com/uploads/docs/Published_Papers/Extended_Duration/Integrated_Vehicle_Propulsion_and_Power_System_for_Long_Duration_Cyrogenic_Spaceflight_2011.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.ulalaunch.com/uploads/docs/Published_Papers/Supporting_Technologies/Space_Access_Society_2012.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.ulalaunch.com/uploads/docs/Published_Papers/Supporting_Technologies/Space_Access_Society_2012.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
