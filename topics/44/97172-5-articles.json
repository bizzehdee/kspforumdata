Other than for the high resolving power (if focus remain fixed), a large apperture provides large FOV (as there (should) only a CCD, a large CCD is also necessary). Also a larger apperture allows more light to be gathered. It means less amount of image capturing and less time required for each image. Equal to this thinking are star survey telescopes - they don\u0027t need large magnification, what they need are high resolving power and fast light gathering. Opposite (so high f/D and relatively small apperture) are ground-based planetary telescopes, which needs to reduce the brightness of the planets (in order to resolve more features). Regarding shape and arrangement, it doesn\u0027t need to be regular - look up Gaia\u0027s optics. That\u0027s not a common design at all...
