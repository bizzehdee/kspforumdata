For example, as you scale up a vehicle its mass increases by the cube of the scale factor, but any area-related value (such as wing area, cross-sectional area) only increases by the square of the scale factor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDrag is proportional to cross-sectional area, so larger vehicles need can fly faster with a given thrust-weight ratio. This is great for rockets, because it reduces their drag losses. However, the lift generated by a wing is also proportional to its area, so a larger aircraft needs to fly faster to generate enough lift. A higher stall speed means faster landings and takeoff, which means longer runways and more stress on the landing gear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe result? Only two aircraft ever built - the Airbus A380 and the Antonov An-225 - have been heavier than a fully fueled Falcon 9 v 1.1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure how large an aircraft could theoretically be built, but a good bet is that your vehicle must absolutely be less than 1,000 tons - and that\u0027s a monster aircraft which needs purpose-built runways and costs billions of dollars. More likely it would only be a couple hundred tons, which severely limits its payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, subsonic air-launch is the easiest to pull off, but its absolutely worthless in terms of saving delta-v. Supersonic launch saves a bit more delta-v, but now that the carrier aircraft has to operate in radically different flight regimes both with and without its bulky payload, the design becomes even harder. Staging at supersonic speeds would also be tricky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I\u0027ve heard that Skylon\u0027s payload could potentially be doubled by using an expendable second stage. Presumably, Skylon would put itself on a very fast suborbital trajectory which allowed to to release the relatively small second stage and payload above the atmosphere. The second stage could probably be made reusable and still get more payload than an SSTO flight, but wings wouldn\u0027t fit well in a cargo bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother idea is to use flyback boosters - boosters on a multi-stage rocket that can glide back to the launch site. These would give you a payload hit compared to a multi-stage vehicle that used airbreathing engines, but would be cheaper and potentially actually usable payloads over a few tons. On the other hand, I\u0027m not sure how they stack up compared to propulsive landing. This method could also result in a very large upper stage that had to be heat-shielded for an orbital return, or a \u0022middle stage\u0022 placed on an awkward trajectory like the center core of a Falcon Heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"11of10","CreatedById":90592,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-14T06:15:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, to be honest, the idea came when I first installed RSS \u002B FAR and tried to play career, with all stock parts.
