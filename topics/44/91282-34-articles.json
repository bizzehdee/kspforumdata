This is why solid rocket boosters have granules of oxidizer in poly matrix. Hybrid rockets tend to have a very similar matrix, but with no oxidizer embedded. This still works, because you still have a material resistant to cracking. But if you were to take a typical oxidizer and try to build a hybrid with a liquid fuel, under typical rocket engine mechanical stress, the solid portion is going to develop cracks, at which point, the whole thing goes kablamo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn contrast, everything you\u0027d use as a matrix to resolve this is either a fuel or wasted weight. Making a hybrid with oxidizer in poly matrix would probably work, but then it\u0027s going to combust even if you turn off the fuel flow, which defeats the purpose. Even just throttling back a little is going to cost you performance.

Suppose, you pitched slightly forward. There is no immediate change to lift, but you start accelerating forward. That results in advancing blade having a slightly higher lift due to higher relative wind velocity. If advancing blade gets more lift, gyroscopic effect causes the helicopter to start pitching backwards. So once you have a bit of altitude, hover is actually self-stabilizing. If the flight stick is slightly displaced from center, this will result in a constant air speed in that direction. This is very easy to get used to, so hover at altitude tends to be straight forward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow lets look at the same situation in ground effect. Again, we start with a small tilt forward. Before helicopter even started picking up speed, the forward blade already has more lift. And due to gyroscopic effect, this will cause a tilt to a side. Which side, depends on the rotor rotation direction. As you are tilting to the side, you are also picking up forward speed. That will result in maximum lift shifting a bit towards advancing side, and this will still correct the forward tilt, but by this point, you are tilted to the side, picking up lift on that side, and are starting to accelerate in that direction. Now you are tilting to the back, and the cycle repeats. This is inherently unstable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause the self-righting mechanism from high hover is still there, the level attitude point is still nominally stable, but it is not dynamically stable, and that\u0027s what you really care about. Instead of stabilizing, the helicopter starts to gyrate, building up more and more deflection from center. Worst part is, the inexperienced pilot will try to correct for the immediate tilt, which is going to be corrected by increased lift on the advancing blade anyways, instead of correcting for the ground-effect. So there is a 90\u00B0 phase lag between what\u0027s happening to helicopter and pilot\u0027s corrections, making it very difficult to keep helicopter put and could actually make the situation worse. This is why an inexperienced pilot should never try to hover in the first place except for learning how to do it under instruction. If you have to fly a rotor in a simulation or in case of emergency, do takeoffs vertically up, then build up forward speed. Once moving, helicopter isn\u0027t that different from fixed wing.\u00A0For landings, come in with forward speed, as if you were landing an airplane. You can come down with much greater slope, though.\u00A0If you flare to a stop, you\u0027ll have much better chances of putting the machine down gently than if you tried to come in vertically and land from hover. You\u0027ll also be that much less likely to encounter the other great enemy of rotor, settling with power.
