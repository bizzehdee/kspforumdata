For the sake of discussion, we will allow the the ability to defy a planet\u0027s gravity only (still will feel acceleration from engine thrust). Also has the ability to toggle this on or off, the weightlessness inside gravity wells.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImplications of gravity defiance: You do not need orbital velocity to reach space, and your escape velocity is literally however fast you wanna go and however long you want it to take with a given rocket engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat I am not sure about is the optimal shape for a spacecraft that can defy gravity like the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221. Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it. 2. Overpowered. A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShapes available:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nCylinder: Classic rocket shape would still work, although the urgency to reach space is not longer as much, given the fact that gravity cannot pull you back down so long your gravity defiance is on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSaucer: This has one advantage, namely for reentry, it slows the ship down faster, and when used in combination with gravity defiance, you can slow down on reentry even FASTER.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSphere: You can rotate faster than any shape in space or in atmosphere. I am not sure what advantage this really serves unless you need a spacecraft that is exceptionally maneuverable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExtra: The gravity defiance is a free resource, the rocket engine and spacecraft parts are real using real rocketry and thus not free. So given the costs and resources involved, what would be the most optimal spacecraft shape for escaping a planet and then traveling in space and also for reentry?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like the saucer shape, but I have a hard time seeing a guy at NASA letting it through because his superiors will say they save money with the rocket shape due to less drag. But a NASA guy who was a Star Trek fan would push for the saucer shape and may either get demoted or lose his job in the process.
