Now here is the interesting part, if you were moving already at 1000 mph and you fired the gun and the bullet began to move at an additional 1000 mph relative to you and the train, then relative to the ground the bullet would be moving at 2000 mph. Then I got to thinking about scaling it up to something bigger, for example, if I were to have a rocket that could house two other rockets, like Russian dolls, that could propel themselves progressively faster as their size and weight decreases, now lets work this out from things we know, rockets that leave our atmosphere reach up to 25,000 Mph so lets say once this speed is achieved we initiate the launch of the next rocket from within, lets say to the reduced size and weight, this rocket can reach 30,000 Mph on its own, launching within the other rocket would give the second rocket a starting speed of 25,000 Mph before it has even took off, so it fires out and reaches a speed of 55,000 Mph then the next rocket, that\u0027s max speed would be further still, lets say 40,000 Mph due to its smaller size and weight, through this method it seems to me it would be completely possible to reach nearly 100,000 Mph. Now if you scaled this up further still then you could plausibly reach any speed you wanted to by just working out how many ships you would need at at what speed each of them would need to project themselves, and because this would all be happening in space these speeds could be easily sustained for long periods of time, making it a plausible and effective means of space travel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell guys there is my idea, poke some holes in it if you can because I really hope I haven\u0027t just figured out a real way of reaching these speeds, I\u0027m far to dumb for that haha\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-03T15:45:42Z\u0022 title=\u002201/03/2014 03:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by adam1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dharak1","CreatedById":61137,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T15:45:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe size of the rockets would be massive.

And it runs into the same sort of problem. If each earlier stage has to be 20 times or even more larger than than the next one, you plausibly can only ever have a few stages. Eventually, you still run into the same problem as with a single stage. The faster you want your final speed to be, the exponentially larger the rocket and amount of fuel needed has to be. Staging simply lets you drop heavy engines you no longer need to carry a smaller rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, of course, as you near the speed of light, speeds no longer add the same way they normally do, so you\u0027ll never get past speed of light.

But that is only true when the speeds are not relativistic ones.\u003C/span\u003E Actually s is the speed of the object relatively to a static point of reference, v the speed of the frame of reference the speed is measured according to, and u the speed of the moving object measured in the frame of reference u. So in a rocket going at 1000m/s, a bullet fired at a speed of 1000m/s in the ship would be going at 2000m/s on a static point of reference. But this is false at relativistic speed (near the speed of light)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn reality, the real equation is this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/0/3/2035aab1ba5af2e1ff296512b6a57779.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/0/3/2035aab1ba5af2e1ff296512b6a57779.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere s is your final speed, u the speed of the moving point of reference, v is the mesured speed, and c is the speed of light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat means the faster you would end up going, the slower you will actually end up going, because of relativity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo no, won\u0027t work because of relativity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an example: if you are originally going 1000m/s and want to go 1000m/s faster, your final speed would be (1000 \u002B 1000) / (1 \u002B 1000*1000/299792458\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2) = 1999.99999997774699887917m/s (only showing the first 20 decimals here, it\u0027s so close to 2000 I had to use an online precision calculator)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if you are originally going 299 792 000m/s and fire a bullet at 1000m/s, you would end up with this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(299792000 \u002B 1000) / (1 \u002B 299792000*1000/299792458\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2) = 299792000.00305543458625864747m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means, when looked at from a static point of reference, the rocket and the bullet inside it would appear to be moving in slow motion. This is actual time compression for the people aboard. So a ship moving at 99% of the speed of light could take 100 000 years to cross the milky way, while the people aboard it would only age 80 years aboard it because time is slowed within it (gross approximation fo the time they would age, not accurate).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep, I was going to say basically that but much more simplified. It is NOT possible, by any means, to travel at the speed of light. Furthermore, \u0022c\u0022 is a constant, that means the speed of light is always the same, regardless of the relative speed of the object you are moving on with anything, \u0027cause for example the Earth itself is rotating around the Sun at incredibly high speeds, but that does not make us any closer to the speed of light.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brooklyn666","CreatedById":88321,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-04T13:12:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESpecial relativity tells us that locally, nothing can travel faster than C.
