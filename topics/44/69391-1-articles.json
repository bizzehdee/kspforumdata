The magnitude voltage induced on a coil is equal to rate of change of the magnetic flux passing through the coil, times the number of turns of the coil. Let\u0027s say you were in a low polar orbit, so you were orbiting every 90 minutes, and you managed to keep your coil oriented in one direction. You might see something approaching a sinusoidally-varying magnetic field of strength ~40 uT with a period of ~90 minutes. The equation for this field would be-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB(t) = 4X10^-5*sin(2*pi*(1/(90*60))*t).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2*pi*1/(90*60) = w (omega) )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay your coil had N = 100 turns and an area A = 1 m^2.

That\u0027s not a lot of current. Additionally, in case you\u0027re curious, you\u0027re generating (4.7 x 10^-7)^2*10/2 = 1.1 pW (1.1x10^-12 W) of power.

While 1 T is very strong, it well within the range of remnant flux densities offered by NdFeB and SmCo rare-earth magnets. More common and cheap hard magnetic materials have much lower remnant flux densities, like 0.3 or 0.5 T. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, I will be graduating with a Ph.D. in electrical engineering in around a year, and my research specialties are electromagnetics and MEMS. I did my master\u0027s thesis on soft magnetic materials. Last month I presented a paper at a conference about a silicon MEMS device I created that utilizes a 1.5 mm X 0.5 mm X 0.5 mm NdFeB rare-earth magnet. The remnant flux density of the rare-earth magnet we used is around 1 T, probably a bit greater (like 1.1 T). We never measured the exact value, which isn\u0027t exactly an easy thing to do... we just trusted our magnet manufacturer to deliver the quoted magnetization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s hard to get much above 1.2 T in permanent magnets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo please, don\u0027t lecture me on electromagnetics \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, it\u0027s really cool to play with those little tiny NdFeB magnets. They are so strongly magnetized, and small enough, that they automatically point north if you set them on just about any surface- the torque induced upon by them by the angular difference between their magnetization direction and the direction of Earth\u0027s magnetic field is strong enough to overcome static friction!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso cool: Running a (larger) NdFeB magnet over a block of non-ferromagnetic metal rapidly. It induces eddy currents in the block of metal which oppose the motion of the magnet.
