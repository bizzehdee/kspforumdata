It\u0027d be terribly inefficient. Solar collectors will keep fixed orbits at a location tugs come to visit and refuel at. The solar collector will break water into oxygen and hydrogen. These will either be used by tugs directly as fuel, or be used to synthesize a more convenient fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternatively, keep oxygen for the life support, and use hydrogen with\u00A0NTRs on tugs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-01T21:44:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEh, CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E scrubbers are simple enough.
