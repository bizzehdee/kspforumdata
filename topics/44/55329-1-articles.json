Most of oxygen comes out of engine unburnt.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA turbojet is going to burn through about half of the available oxygen, and afterburner will burn through almost all of the rest. For example, Concorde\u0027s Olympus 593 Mk 610 pulls 186kg of air per second. In dry cruise, it will inject 4.7kg of Jet A per second into that. So out of the 42.8kg of O\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E, 18.8kg will be consumed every second in the dry stage. That\u0027s nearly half. With afterburner engaged, fuel consumption more than doubles, taking care of the remaining oxygen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe purpose of the turbojet is to operate at high speeds, and if your overall exhaust velocity is low, you start losing efficiency at high speeds. To increase exhaust velocity, you have to increase the fuel-to-air ratio. This means that even on a commercial airliner, which is all about efficiency, even the dry stage will consume a lot more than a \u0022small fraction\u0022 in cruise setting. While punching through the transonic region, the engine will run almost stoichiometric ratio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERunning a turbojet very lean is just pointless. A lean mixture will have a much lower combustion temperature, reducing the overall efficiency of the turbine. You are much, much better off having a turbofan design and simply allow the air to bypass the combustion chamber. That allows you to maintain high temperatures and increase reaction mass. The only reason a turbojet typically runs a bit lean is because you need a lot more thrust punching through the transonic and because temperatures the turbine can take are limited. So it makes more sense, both from perspective of engine longevity and fuel efficiency, to have an afterburner which lets you run a stoichiometric mix when you need it, at a cost of a slightly reduced thermodynamic efficiency of both stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you go to even higher speeds, even that provision no longer applies, and you are looking at engines that run close to stoichiometric mix even in cruise.
