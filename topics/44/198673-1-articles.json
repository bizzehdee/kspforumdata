Their prototype, the Celera\u00A0500L, portends to be a vision of commercial aviation to come.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022primary.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002266.67\u0022 height=\u0022800\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.boldmethod.com/images/blog/lists/2020/08/celera-500l-revolutionary-plane/primary.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Celera is not very unusual from a strictly technical configuration: lightweight monocoque single engine prop aircraft for 6 passengers and one pilot. However it\u0027s the details that really make it a weird and forward-thinking design,\u00A0 and business case.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe composite egg/torpedo shaped circular fuselage and thin trailing empenage are designed to take advantage of laminar flow, keeping the whole form as aerodynamic as possible. This thing is ultra fuel efficient and \u003Cem\u003Efast, \u003C/em\u003Ecapable of top speeds of 460mph(!) (740kph) and a range of 4500 nautical miles (8300km)[1]. Because it can go so far and consumes fuel so efficiently (allegedly better than 20 miles per gallon, or 11.7L per 100km) it has significantly reduced operating costs compared to equivalently capable aircraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously this would have a market for people who use business jets and care about their bottom line. But Otto has their sights on a much bigger opportunity,\u00A0 created in part by the disruption of Covid: demand for smaller aircraft, making more frequent and less common trips over medium ranges or less. The aircraft itself is more like a taxi or van than the traditional bus- or train- scaled big commercial jets with hub-and-spoke network models.\u00A0With a small size, they are able to service more airports. Otto is already looking at mini cargo services, electric and hybrid engines, and even drone versions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI personally think this is a fantastic idea,\u00A0 increasing the versatility of aviation as transport,\u00A0 while also making it quieter, less manufacturing-intensive, and greener. I look forward to seeing how they develop, and hope other companies copy some of their ideas.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd of course I\u0027m going to try and model the plane in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022tt8kw0oy40331.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.redd.it/tt8kw0oy40331.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[1] Otto Aviation \u0022Celera 500L\u0022,\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.ottoaviation.com/celera-500l\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.ottoaviation.com/celera-500l\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0retrieved 2020-12-12\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spica","CreatedById":65153,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-13T05:01:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile I can believe the range numbers stated by Otto aviation are\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Epossible\u003C/em\u003E, I doubt they will ever be relied on in practice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLong natural laminar flow runs are really quite delicate.

Most of the \u0022carbon calculators\u0022 assign a multiplier to airplane CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E of 2x-4x as much as they actually produce, supposedly to account for non-CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0climate effects.

It does not include a multiplier for non-CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E effects, but of course if you want to add on your own, that\u0027s easy enough to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/Carbonoffset/Pages/default.aspx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/Carbonoffset/Pages/default.aspx\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-12-13T09:13:42Z\u0022 title=\u002212/13/2020 09:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 13, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by mikegarrison\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-15T17:24:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223893087\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022198673\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221607845756\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107202\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Piscator\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 12/13/2020 at 2:49 AM, Piscator said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould it in fact be greener, though?
