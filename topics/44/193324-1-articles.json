well adjusted to growing in space or on a centrifuge, disease resistant, effective co2 scrubbers, and with a high crop yield and very compatible with hydroponics. you may very well be eating foods that don\u0027t exist yet. bioreactors might handle decomposition of waste into useful nutrients for farming. the food cycle would need to be as closed a system as possible. the fewer consumables the better. on earth we use a lot of open ended processes because the environment is big enough where it can handle it (for the most part, were still probing the limits of how much abuse it can take). its not necessary to completely recycle sewage as simply treating it so its safe enough to dump where the environment can handle most of the break down processes. but in space a barrel of poop might be precious material and open cycles are a good way to run out of things.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyou will need to produce something of value that can be traded. maybe you are sitting

you need.\u00A0\u00A0the second law of thermodynamics is what it is and you will need to replenish essential consumables as stockpiles can only go so far. finding a body with a lot of resource diversity might mean you can make or recycle everything you need. this is where a good power supply comes in handy as it greatly increases the number of industrial processes you have access
