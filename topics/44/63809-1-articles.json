Hypothetically, a similar device could be expanded and flown to this Moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would likely need an more extensive solar array or an RTG, as cubesats aren\u0027t designed to get much power, even in LEO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a lot of problems with sending a cubesat to Uranus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: The only reason Juno is bothering to use solar panels out at Jupiter is because there\u0027s a shortage of Plutionium-238. Otherwise, they\u0027d use RTGs. Now consider the fact that there\u0027s less than 10% as much sunlight at Uranus as at Jupiter. Basically, you need RTGs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Instrumentation designed to work on a cubesat in LEO for 1 year won\u0027t necessarily work in interplanetary space for 20\u002B years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: You\u0027re gonna need a lot of power. At launch, the Voyager probes generated 470 W, Cassini 880, and New Horizons 228. I\u0027m guessing a large part part of that is because you need a big antenna to transmit a useful amount of data all the way to Earth. If you\u0027re using an ion drive, that requires even more power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: Uranus takes a lot of dV to reach. A hohmann transfer might be doable with a small probe like New Horizons, but the journey to Uranus would take 17 years. Most likely any mission would involve at the very least a gravity assist from Jupiter, and possibly flybys of Earth and Venus as well, similar to Cassini. To reduce the transit time to something practical like 10 years, the probe would need to take a trajectory which caused it to encounter Uranus at very high speeds. This means a big orbital insertion burn, and not much time to do it. Ion engines would likely not be suitable for such a mission. Therefore, you need relatively large tanks of monopropellant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll told, it would probably be difficult to go much smaller than New Horizons for a Uranus mission; a probe of that size could probably be launched on an Atlas, Ariane 5, Proton, or similar vehicle. However, by the time we\u0027re actually ready for a mission like that, F9H and Angara 7 will almost certainly be operational.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
