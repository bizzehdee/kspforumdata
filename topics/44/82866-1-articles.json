Even under \u0022ideal\u0022 or \u0022optimistic\u0022 projections of power output for fusion ractors (like say... 1 gigawat reactor with a 3m diameter core) would be far worse, and would struggle to acheive orbit (either too little thrust, or increasing thrust lowers ISP too much, or chemical power would need to be used, like a LOX Augmented Nuclear Thermal Rocket - where the nuclear we\u0027re refering to is Fusion reactions).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to go interstellar with long burn times, out to significant fractions of the speed of light, fusion is what you want...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it seems fission is the way for getting to and from orbit... its a shame we can only launch from 1 inhabited planet where the dangers of flighing fission reactors around is so great.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-26T07:39:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe precooler that makes the SABRE so special is simply an air intake designed for hypersonic speeds. It could easily work with a thermal turbojet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is though, while gas turbines are some of the most lightweight engines we have, nuclear thermal engines on the other hand are probably the heaviest by a large margin. This isn\u0027t something you can engineer away, either - it\u0027s the simple fact that any supercritical amount of uranium is heavy, and the radiation shielding is even moreso. You may be running with better Isp, but your whole spaceplane would have to be constructed differently than Skylon is, with higher structural masses for rigidity, which in turn requires more wing area, which weighs more and creates more drag... How much of the higher efficiency is lost to that?

It was shut down after an audit was conducted on it, which is probably a telltale sign that something wasn\u0027t quite right under the hood. Also, the engine stats given for these Timberwind engines are paper stats at best, pure speculation at worst. No engine in flight configuration was built, to my knowledge, and there are no sources cited by this website... nor by Wikipedia, which is in my opinion the bigger indication that there\u0027s little to no substance to them. Wikipedia isn\u0027t always correct, but they tend to make every effort to cite sources. When they don\u0027t, that probably means there is no source in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Checking the SNTP (Timberwind followup program) final report cited on Wikipedia, as far as I can tell the SNTP program was canceled in the middle of qualifying the technologies required to build a NTR of the desired specifications. In other words, they weren\u0027t even ready to built a NTR yet, they were still researching how to build parts sturdy enough for the job. The report did say that it was believed the challenges would be solvable, but does so in a kind of petulant tone, never missing to complain about funding cuts in the same breath. Also, it seems that the specs given for the Timberwind engines were a project goals wishlist, much in the same way the politicians handed NASA a wishlist of \u0022build us a 130 ton payload rocket using only 40 year old parts and manufacturing technologies\u0022. Except that the SLS is still a more realistic proposition than a 30 TWR nuclear engine, because all the congress-prescribed cost insanity aside, the technology has already been proven.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the executive summary, it is suggested that the closest the project came to a real NTR test article was a paper draft for an engine believed to be potentially possible, with an Isp of 930 and a TWR of 20 (as opposed to the Isp 1000 and TWR of 30 of the Timberwind engines). They didn\u0027t get around to actually trying to make it happen though, and thus we don\u0027t know if it would actually have been feasible. At the time of cancellation, they were still an estimated five years away from being ready to build it, and that\u0027s assuming no unexpected delays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe detailed portion of the document probably has more info, but it\u0027s also very long and I don\u0027t have that much time right now while at work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-26T08:04:56Z\u0022 title=\u002208/26/2014 08:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-26T08:04:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIons are much heavier than NTR.

Mass flow of the scooped up air, and mass flow of the fuel. As with rockets, you have the specific impulse. In SI, specific impulse is impulse the rocket acquires per unit of fuel mass. That\u0027s I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E = dp/dm. Using chain rule, we can obtain: dp/dm = (dp/dt)/(dm/dt) = F/m\u0027.

You can use specific thrust with respect to mass flow of the air through turbine. You still get F/m\u0027. Because there are two different mass flows in a turbine, the two terms are used to differentiate between impulse per mass of fuel and impulse per mass of air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, with rocket, there is only one mass flow, so I did not expect this sort of confusion to arise.
