Yay! But I\u0027ve started to turn my attention to candidates around larger stars. For this Daily Roundup, I\u0027ll be listing some of the candidates I\u0027VE found around larger stars from spectral types K through F. In addition, enjoy some of the weirdest star\u0027s I\u0027ve ever found!\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEPIC 212157262 System:\u003C/strong\u003E I found this just today, and it is a GREAT find. Both candidates are incredibly likely yet inhospitable to life as we know it. The first is a 3.08 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E planet taking about a week to orbit the parent star. As a result it is being roasted at 815*K (1,007.3*F). The next candidate - which I actually found first - is possibly a \u0022Water Giant\u0022 like Gliese 1214b, with 2.25 times the radius of Earth and a year of 13.7 days. Its temperature is calculated to be around 656*K (721.1*F), which would result in a VERY steamy planet. Both are likely to be tidally locked with the host star.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEPIC 220395236b:\u003C/strong\u003E I hate this thing. Why? Because it makes my brain melt. the 3.2 Re ice giant orbits an F-type main sequence star with a \u0022year\u0022 just 11.7 hours long. This thing is literally skimming right above the surface of the star! As a result it has the greatest temperature of any candidate I\u0027ve ever come across - FORTY-SIX HUNDRED DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. This is so horrifically hot that I wonder whether this thing could exist or not. If it\u0027s real, then it may not be an ice giant...but rather an enormous rocky core leftover from a dead Hot Jupiter. As such it could either be the largest rocky planet in the Universe, or a pure black ice giant literally glowing a vibrant blood red. For months I\u0027ve been looking for a planet truly suitable for the name \u0022Tartarus\u0022, the Hell\u0027s Hell of Greek Mythology and the pit of absolute evil and terror. I think, after all this time, I\u0027ve finally found a planet hellish enough to be worthy of such a name.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEPIC 212516905:\u003C/strong\u003E A very, very, VERY tiny ultracool dwarf star. It\u0027s quite small, even by TRAPPIST-1\u0027s standards. At 0.099 solar radii it\u0027s smaller than Jupiter! Oddly, it\u0027s more massive than TRAPPIST-1, having about 0.146 times the mass of the Sun. Its temperature is only around 2279*K (3,642.5*F), which - believe it or not - is nearly 1,000*F COOLER than Tartarus. Please, give me a break. On the bring side this star may have a planet similar to good old TRAPPIST-1g.

The host star is similar in size, mass and temperature as Kepler-62. Meanwhile, the planet is more similar to Neptune than any of the Kepler-62 planets, with 4.03 times the radius of Earth orbiting every 14.7108 days with a temperature of 515*K (467*F). Not a terrible place in the grand scheme of things.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEPIC 201578486:\u003C/strong\u003E The Deoxys Star (as I call it) has a bizarre double-helix light curve. It almost looks like a strand of DNA, hence its name. But believe it or not there are more of this weird \u0022Helix Variables\u0022 running amok in the K2 data. Deoxys just happens to be the only one I\u0027ve found. The parameters of the star may shed light onto why it produces such weird light fluctuations. It is quite large - 2.67 R\u003Csub\u003ESol\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0and 1.888 M\u003Csub\u003ESol\u003C/sub\u003E. On first glance it may seem like your rather typical orange sub-giant star (which are quite common in the K2 data, surprisingly), but it isn\u0027t. Deoxys is VERY hot - 7,273*K to be exact. This means the star is an A-Class Main Sequence star, which are a rather rare find in the entirety of the Kepler/K2 data. It\u0027s possible that certain sized A-class stars undergo the variations seen with Deoxys, but I will have to search more to fin out.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEPIC 212679181b and EPIC 201205683b:\u003C/strong\u003E Okay, I said that I won\u0027t do any red dwarf candidates this time...but I can\u0027t NOT talk about these two candidates. They belong to a rare group of very short-period Earth-sized to Super Earth-sized planets orbiting their red dwarf parents with years less than two days. As such there are incredibly hot (duh), much more hellish than most M-dwarf planets. The first of the two is a rather small 0.82 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E planet taking just 1.0547 days (25.313 hours) to orbit its star, resulting in a temperature in excess of 824*K (1,023.5*F). Now that we\u0027ve got the most extreme one out of the way, it\u0027s time to move onto the next. It\u0027s even smaller (0.774 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E) and has a quicker year (0.57806 days/13.87 hours) than the first, but has a lower temperature of 782*K (947.9*F). That\u0027s because the host star is smaller as well, only around 21% the radius and 20% the mass of the Sun.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEPIC 211087003b:\u003C/strong\u003E I went crazy over this star a few months back due to the possibility of up to four ice giants around it. While a single planet is more likely, this is one of my best candidates EVER. The 4.42 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0candidate orbits the F-class host star once every 28.29789 days, resulting in a temperature of 687*K (776.9*F). As noted before, more planets are possible due to an unexplained large dip in the ExoFOP data not associated with this planet. If an actual candidate, it\u0027s a whopping 10.238 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0(based on a transit depth around 5625 ppm), but as of right now I am unable to figure out its orbital period and by extension its temperature and climate.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEPIC 211319617b:\u003C/strong\u003E Another planet that should not exist. The K-dwarf host star seems normal enough at 0.643 R\u003Csub\u003ESol\u003C/sub\u003E, 0.676 M\u003Csub\u003ESol\u003C/sub\u003E, and 5354*K. At first glance the only odd thing about the star is its unusually high temperature compared to that of other similar sized stars. However, everything falls apart when you read that it\u0027s metal content is a near-impossible -1.00 [Fe/H], with a huge error bar reaching as low as -1.57 [Fe/H]. A star this metal poor should NOT have ANY planets around it at all; there would be too little heavy material to form them. But here we have a 2.276 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0Mini-Neptune orbiting the star every 8.8674 days. And this is no \u0022possible candidate\u0022 - oh no, its transits are so obvious even the blind can see that they\u0027re caused by a planet! Okay, that\u0027s quite a stretch...but you get the gist. It\u0027s obvious that a planet orbits the star, even though it makes no sense whatsoever.

After an analysis done by Jessie Cristiansen in May, and another one done by shutcheon a few weeks later, it appeared to be that the star had just three planets. However, it turned out that the candidate once thought as noise was actually most likely a planet. Only a few days ago Vidar managed to find a fifth candidate. And just today, I did the most in-depth analysis of the planets\u0027 radius values done so far and put higher constraints on their sizes. These five planets are 0.907, 0.915, 1.22, 1.195, and 1.38 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E, orbit every 2.2314, 4.194, 6.6775, 9.721, and 13.624 days, and have equilibrium temperatures calculated to be at 544, 441, 377, 333, and 298\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003EK. The outermost planet appears to be potentially habitable, but with a rather high equilibrium temperature it is likely to be an \u0022eyeball planet\u0022 with a twilight zone ocean trapped between deserts of sand and ice.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEPIC 210696763:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0Another well-known red dwarf multiple candidate system, this time having four planets. The star is not so much larger than EPIC 220221272, which makes this system an interesting opportunity to see how planetary systems evolve around very similar hosts. This system was thought to be a five-planet system with a large habitable zone Super-Earth, but for some reason the obvious transits seen on EE were never in the SFF or Everest 2 light curve data for EPIC 210696763. Maybe they screwed up the designation. So that just leaves four planets. The first one is a 0.976 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0rocky planet with a year of 2.624 days, but is actually the oddball of the system. All the other three planets are triplets. The three are 1.26278, 1.274, and 1.27083 times the size of Earth and have very similar orbital periods - 3.649, 5.767, and 7.984 days. The system represents another interesting opportunity, this time to see how three triplet planets can turn out as completely different worlds.

I theorize that this planet could be a bizarre world with seas of liquid metals, maybe something like Gallium or Mercury. The next planet is smaller at 0.6624 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0and takes just 2.187 days to orbit its star. Unlike the others in the system, this one was found by me. The other two were found by shutcheon; they are 0.70467 and 0.65583 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0and complete their orbits in 4.966 and 6.2606 days. There could be a fifth planet with a year somewhere around 22 days, which would place it in the inner portion of the system\u0027s habitable zone. However, there is not enough evidence to support this claim. It is entirely possible that other planets are present in the system.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEPIC 201528828:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0This is my first three-planet system I\u0027ve ever found! Also designated TYC-281-875-1, this is a rather hot orange dwarf around 76% the radius and 82% the mass of the Sun. Two Super-Earths and one Mini-Neptune were found to orbit the star. The first two planets are likely rocky, with radii of 1.52 and 1.20 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E. However, they are also orbiting very close to the mother star, with short orbital periods of 2.636 and 4.719 days. I have no idea why but planets with years around 2, 4, and/or 6 days are INCREDIBLY common in the K2 data. Whatever the case, these two rocky planets have high surface temperatures of 1,084\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003EK and 893\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003EK, meaning that their surfaces will either be dotted in lava lakes or be composed of rather squishy rock, similar to that of Venus. The final planet of the system is a 2.60 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0Mini-Neptune orbiting every 14.091 days with an equilibrium temperature at 620\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003EK.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEPIC 228801451:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EOne of my newest multi-planet systems. There are two very obvious planets and a possible third planet. The first one is quite a horrific abomination of nature. This 1.24 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0rocky planet takes a mere 14 hours to orbit a star with around 53% the luminosity of the Sun. The result? A charbroiled, molten hellscape with temperatures soaring to 1,892\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003EK (about 2,946\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003EF). FUN! At least the next planet isn\u0027t as bad. It\u0027s a 2.11 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0Super-Earth with a much longer orbital period of 8.3259 days, resulting in an average temperature of 780\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003EK (944\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003EF). Okay, that\u0027s hotter than Venus...but still an improvement!

The first planet, a known candidate, was spotted by Cabbink and was first thought to be a Mini-Neptune. There also appeared to be a long-period transit from a possible Super-Venus. However, using the transits of the first planet, I was able to refine the star\u0027s parameters and figure out the true nature of these planets. The first one is a possible Steam Giant, which is essentially a gas dwarf with a giant rocky core and where all the hydrogen is water vapor. I shudder to think about the greenhouse effect on this planet. It is 1.929 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E, orbits every 6.3265 days, and has an equilibrium temperature of a pleasant 908\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003EK, similar to Mu Arae c (Dulcinea).

I\u0027ve done some more analysis on it a few weeks back and found that it is most likely a single planet in a 14.4-day orbit. I was also able to re-calculate stellar parameters, discovering that the host star is more likely to be around 94% the size of the Sun and with a temperature around 5500 Kelvin. This is supported by Ian Crossfield\u0027s observations with the Keck Telescope, suggesting that EPIC 212525618 is a much larger and hotter star than a measly red dwarf. That makes Iona a hot Water Giant like GJ 1214 b. It is 2.557 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0and has a temperature of 690\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003EK.

It is also quite similar in temperature - this new candidate has an equilibrium temperature of 298\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003EK, the same as the fifth planet of 220221272. However, the host stars are quite different. EPIC 220364502 b orbits a larger red dwarf closer to 1/3rd the size of the Sun, compared to the 0.25 solar radii size of EPIC 220221272.

Everest 2 data shows a horde of likely transit events, which I have interpreted into two signals. The first is a 1.46 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0planet orbiting every 28.1042 days, sigma 8. While within the inner limit of the habitable zone, its large size and rather high equilibrium temperature of 303\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003EK lead me to believe it is more likely a Super-Venus. The second signal is quite dubious with a sigma of 3.5. That\u0027s because it only has two transits. Candidate 2 is 1.21 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0and has an orbital period of 42.958 days, placing it within a more conservative habitable zone. I doubt that this candidate would be in any threat of a runaway greenhouse. However, due to the iffy nature of both candidates and the plethora of extra transit events in the light curve, I believe that these two habitable zone planets may actually be a single, sorter period candidate. But that doesn\u0027t diminish the possibility of life in the system. A possible long-period candidate of 1.89 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0with a 7.356-hour transit and a sigma of 6.07 holds promise.

I mentioned in a status update last week that this system was the one giving me so much trouble and was partially responsible for the delay of this Daily Roundup. Well, it\u0027s complicated. What I can say without a doubt is that there are more than just two planets in this system. When I first reported EPIC 212157262 last month, I had found two large candidate planets of 3.08 and 2.25 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0orbiting a somewhat small yellow dwarf every 7.151 and 13.615 days. Seems simple enough. However, a new update with LcViewer enabled me to access the Everest 2 data for all stars in K2 campaigns 0 through 8. The Everest 2 data is the best-corrected of any K2 data in existence and is free of any glitch contamination that the unprocessed data has. With it, an absolutely enormous amount of transit events I had not seen before emerged. I was quickly able to pick out an additional FOUR candidates, bringing the total up to 6. However, some of them were rather dubious, and thanks to Shutcheon\u0027s help I managed to find the two most likely. These new candidates orbit every 2.8727 and 30.180 days, and are both Super-Earths of 1.43 and 1.71 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E. But even with two new well-constrained signals, many more transits were left with unclear origins. This time I managed to find FOUR MORE CANDIDATES in the data, which would bring the planet total of EPIC 212157262 up to 8 - second only to HD 10180 with its nine planets. This system has proven to be incredibly difficult to analyze, so I assume that these are either the correct or wrong signals.

There have been many things limiting my exoplanet research over the summer. My schedule was kinda crazy, Exoplanet Explorers is glitched (too many simulated transits are popping up, which means little to no real finds), and more. However, a new beta version for LcViewer is in development, and me along with two other EE users have been able to test it out. I mentioned this version in a status update a few days back. This beta test-version adds a very useful feature into the application: an Automatic Candidate Search using the MLS code/algorithm. We just call it the MLS search. Basically, what it does is it activates the code to search the entire light curve for a periodic signal. For a K2 mission lightcurve, this takes just a few seconds. If the code can find a signal, it appears in a small window where you can phase fold it, highlight it, or search for another. Many signals that the MLS search finds are caused by cyclic stellar variability, but a good amount are likely legitimate planets. Over the last several days I\u0027ve found a handful of interesting and likely worlds using this new feature.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEPIC 212157262:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EThe MLS search has finally solved the mystery of this system! It turns out the system has a grand total of....5 planets. The reason why I thought there were up to 8 planets was due to a VERY quickly orbiting world that has a year of about 0.775 days (~18 hours). It\u0027s a rather Earth-sized planet of 1.05 Re with an equilibrium temperature of over 1,700 Kelvin! The better-looking transits of this world were mistaken for many candidates, including the likely 30.18 day signal that shutcheon found. The next new candidate is another Super-Earth of 1.39 Re. It orbits every 21.788 days and has an equilibrium temperature of 567*K. The other three planets with the 2.87, 7.151, and 13.615 day orbits still are great candidates. These new results reveal a very stable, evenly spaced system of five completely different planets: one molten Earth-sized world, one half melted Super-Earth, one hot Mini-Neptune, a steamy \u0022Water Giant\u0022, and a hot rocky Super-Earth.

It is an 18-sigma Super Earth with a radius of 1.54 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E. However, what makes this system special is that the planet candidate is one of the best potentially habitable worlds I\u0027ve found. Orbiting every 32.343 days in the outer part of the habitable zone with a temperature of 220*K, it is cold enough where a thick atmosphere would not doom the planet\u0027s habitability. Let\u0027s say its greenhouse effect is twice that of Earth - which would result in a temperature increase of 66*K. On Earth, that would raise the planet\u0027s temperature to 321*K (118*F). That would be enough the evaporate most water and doom the chances for life. However, that same magnitude greenhouse effect on EPIC 216876207.01 would result in an average temperature of 286*K (55*F), just a tad lower than Earth\u0027s average temperature.

While the MLS search found no periodic signals, there was something else of interest: one large, lone transit-like event in the first half of the data. This potential transit lasts a whopping 19 hours and appears to be from a 0.82 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0long-period planet. This large transit is odd, as the planet orbits a red dwarf only 28% the Sun\u0027s radius. As such any transits should be 1-4 hours long for most planets, or 5-10 hours for longer period planets. This can be explained by one of two ways: either the star is much larger than originally estimated, or the long-period candidate has an expansive ring system.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEPIC 217742774:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0This is one candidate that I\u0027m VERY unsure about.

If you remember from the last DR, this four-planet system was found to host two additional planets. Now it seems like it has a SEVENTH planet. Vidar87 found what appeared to be a likely transit event at epoch 2924.838339 from an object over twice the size of Earth. He suggested that this could be from an object with an orbital period of 19.152 days, which would continue the chain of 2:3 mean-motion resonances of the inner five planets. I tested this out with LcViewer. Using the epoch and period Vidar87 provided, I was able to find out that it is associated with a statistically significant signal, with a sigma of 6.942 - even though most of this candidate\u0027s transits overlapped those of other planets. Finally, shutcheon used the Titus-Bode law to see if such an object should even exist. Short answer: yes, it should. Welcome EE-1h! However, shutcheon found that there should be a planet with a period of about 25-29 days to continue the chain of 2:3 resonances. If not, then the whole system would destabilize. Since there are two data gaps in the lightcurve of EE-1, some transits could easily be lost. Shutcheon found that a planet with a period between 25.941 days and 26.254 days could fit into the missing 2:3 resonance slot and explain this one odd lone transit even while all its other transits were taken out by data gaps. He did some analysis that is rather confusing to describe in simpler terms, so I\u0027ll just link his results here:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/ianc2/exoplanet-explorers/talk/821/429557?comment=718070\u0026amp;page=1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.zooniverse.org/projects/ianc2/exoplanet-explorers/talk/821/429557?comment=718070\u0026amp;page=1\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ESo, basically, EE-1 now is likely to be an EIGHT-planet system, just like our own!

Originally, it was a red dwarf less than a third the size of our Sun with a likely rocky planet nicknamed Natalie orbiting within the habitable zone every 31 days. After the initial discovery, Ian Crossfield said that the Exoplanet Explorers team would use the Keck Telescopes to take a closer look at the system in late summer to figure out how large the host is. This would, as a result, enable us to determine how large Natalie is and whether it is promising or not for life. On September 10th, 2017, the data and images gathered were uploaded to ExoFOP by David Ciardi. This is the image of EPIC 210693462:\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022210693462I-dc20170820K.fits.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu/k2/files/210693462/Image/210693462I-dc20170820K.fits.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022768\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EWhoops, I forgot to say \u0022stars\u0022, plural. It turns out that EPIC 210693462 is something none of us on Exoplanet Explorers ever expected: a binary system. Libmar96 was the first to stumble across the results, and he was initially quite pessimistic about the results. The problem with transiting planets in binary systems is that the planets are ALWAYS somewhat larger than initially expected, as the planet would need to block more light from the single star to produce the dip seen in the light curve. Libmar suggested that Natalie would not be a rocky planet, but instead a gas dwarf. However, that does not appear to be the case. The EPIC 210693462 binary is nearly equal in size, which would mean that any planet orbiting the primary would be 30-50% larger than initially determined with single-star data. This means that, taking into account the original radius value of 1.278 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E, Natalie would be between 1.66 and 1.92 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0if it orbits the primary star, a size range most probable if the planet has a significant amount of water in its composition. Instead of being a terrestrial Earth-like world or a hostile Mini-Neptune, Natalie could instead be like the Star Wars planet Mon Calamari - a life-friendly ocean planet with twin suns. But what if the stars aren\u0027t red dwarfs? That actually seems unlikely. Look at the scale in arcseconds. Both stars are incredibly tiny, and they\u0027re only separated by 0.84 arsec. This, along with the spectroscopic data gathered by multiple observations, suggests that the two stars are most likely M-dwarfs. They may even be much smaller than the original 0.312 R\u003Csub\u003ESun\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0size estimate given by Huber et al.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKEPLER-90:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0I also teased new findings about this system over the last week or two. If you\u0027re not familiar, Kepler-90 is the first (and only) 7-planet system found by the Kepler mission. It is like a more compact version of our Solar System - inner rocky planets, mid-range Mini Neptunes, outer Gas Giants - orbiting a star around 20% larger in radius and mass than our Sun. Using a new beta version of LcViewer and an improved BLS Search, shutcheon did an analysis on the system...and found THREE likely new inner planets! These new worlds are 0.80, 1.24, and 1.20 times the size of Earth and orbit every 3.0351, 14.4481, and 18.7855 days. All of them are perfectly in resonance with each other and the other two inner planets, Kepler-90b and Kepler-90c. Things eventually got even MORE complicated, as I managed to find TEN MORE SIGNALS within the group of inner worlds. Most of them are either randomly aligned stellar noise or artifacts from the other planets. However, a few signals hold promise. The most likely of the bunch are, as of now, designated KOI-351.13 and KOI-351.14. Candidate 13 is around 0.77 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0and takes 6.760 days to orbit Kepler-90. The other potential planet, Candidate 14, is around the same size at 0.79 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0but takes 8.454 days to orbit the central star. If real, this would mean that Kepler-90 has a total of TWELVE planets, even higher than our Solar System and the HD 10180 system! Because all 5 of the new candidates are so small, it\u0027s probably going to take a while before any of them get confirmed. It\u0027s also possible that some of these are false positives, while some of the other possibilities I\u0027ve found are real planets.

Originally, it was a red dwarf less than a third the size of our Sun with a likely rocky planet nicknamed Natalie orbiting within the habitable zone every 31 days. After the initial discovery, Ian Crossfield said that the Exoplanet Explorers team would use the Keck Telescopes to take a closer look at the system in late summer to figure out how large the host is. This would, as a result, enable us to determine how large Natalie is and whether it is promising or not for life. On September 10th, 2017, the data and images gathered were uploaded to ExoFOP by David Ciardi.

It turns out that EPIC 210693462 is something none of us on Exoplanet Explorers ever expected: a binary system. Libmar96 was the first to stumble across the results, and he was initially quite pessimistic about the results. The problem with transiting planets in binary systems is that the planets are ALWAYS somewhat larger than initially expected, as the planet would need to block more light from the single star to produce the dip seen in the light curve. Libmar suggested that Natalie would not be a rocky planet, but instead a gas dwarf. However, that does not appear to be the case. The EPIC 210693462 binary is nearly equal in size, which would mean that any planet orbiting the primary would be 30-50% larger than initially determined with single-star data. This means that, taking into account the original radius value of 1.278 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E, Natalie would be between 1.66 and 1.92 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0if it orbits the primary star, a size range most probable if the planet has a significant amount of water in its composition. Instead of being a terrestrial Earth-like world or a hostile Mini-Neptune, Natalie could instead be like the Star Wars planet Mon Calamari - a life-friendly ocean planet with twin suns. But what if the stars aren\u0027t red dwarfs? That actually seems unlikely. Look at the scale in arcseconds. Both stars are incredibly tiny, and they\u0027re only separated by 0.84 arsec. This, along with the spectroscopic data gathered by multiple observations, suggests that the two stars are most likely M-dwarfs. They may even be much smaller than the original 0.312 R\u003Csub\u003ESun\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0size estimate given by Huber et al.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKEPLER-90:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0I also teased new findings about this system over the last week or two. If you\u0027re not familiar, Kepler-90 is the first (and only) 7-planet system found by the Kepler mission. It is like a more compact version of our Solar System - inner rocky planets, mid-range Mini Neptunes, outer Gas Giants - orbiting a star around 20% larger in radius and mass than our Sun. Using a new beta version of LcViewer and an improved BLS Search, shutcheon did an analysis on the system...and found THREE likely new inner planets! These new worlds are 0.80, 1.24, and 1.20 times the size of Earth and orbit every 3.0351, 14.4481, and 18.7855 days. All of them are perfectly in resonance with each other and the other two inner planets, Kepler-90b and Kepler-90c. Things eventually got even MORE complicated, as I managed to find TEN MORE SIGNALS within the group of inner worlds. Most of them are either randomly aligned stellar noise or artifacts from the other planets. However, a few signals hold promise. The most likely of the bunch are, as of now, designated KOI-351.13 and KOI-351.14. Candidate 13 is around 0.77 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0and takes 6.760 days to orbit Kepler-90.

Originally, it was a red dwarf less than a third the size of our Sun with a likely rocky planet nicknamed Natalie orbiting within the habitable zone every 31 days. After the initial discovery, Ian Crossfield said that the Exoplanet Explorers team would use the Keck Telescopes to take a closer look at the system in late summer to figure out how large the host is. This would, as a result, enable us to determine how large Natalie is and whether it is promising or not for life. On September 10th, 2017, the data and images gathered were uploaded to ExoFOP by David Ciardi.

It turns out that EPIC 210693462 is something none of us on Exoplanet Explorers ever expected: a binary system. Libmar96 was the first to stumble across the results, and he was initially quite pessimistic about the results. The problem with transiting planets in binary systems is that the planets are ALWAYS somewhat larger than initially expected, as the planet would need to block more light from the single star to produce the dip seen in the light curve. Libmar suggested that Natalie would not be a rocky planet, but instead a gas dwarf. However, that does not appear to be the case. The EPIC 210693462 binary is nearly equal in size, which would mean that any planet orbiting the primary would be 30-50% larger than initially determined with single-star data. This means that, taking into account the original radius value of 1.278 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E, Natalie would be between 1.66 and 1.92 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0if it orbits the primary star, a size range most probable if the planet has a significant amount of water in its composition. Instead of being a terrestrial Earth-like world or a hostile Mini-Neptune, Natalie could instead be like the Star Wars planet Mon Calamari - a life-friendly ocean planet with twin suns. But what if the stars aren\u0027t red dwarfs? That actually seems unlikely. Look at the scale in arcseconds. Both stars are incredibly tiny, and they\u0027re only separated by 0.84 arsec. This, along with the spectroscopic data gathered by multiple observations, suggests that the two stars are most likely M-dwarfs. They may even be much smaller than the original 0.312 R\u003Csub\u003ESun\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0size estimate given by Huber et al.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKEPLER-90:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0I also teased new findings about this system over the last week or two. If you\u0027re not familiar, Kepler-90 is the first (and only) 7-planet system found by the Kepler mission. It is like a more compact version of our Solar System - inner rocky planets, mid-range Mini Neptunes, outer Gas Giants - orbiting a star around 20% larger in radius and mass than our Sun. Using a new beta version of LcViewer and an improved BLS Search, shutcheon did an analysis on the system...and found THREE likely new inner planets! These new worlds are 0.80, 1.24, and 1.20 times the size of Earth and orbit every 3.0351, 14.4481, and 18.7855 days. All of them are perfectly in resonance with each other and the other two inner planets, Kepler-90b and Kepler-90c. Things eventually got even MORE complicated, as I managed to find TEN MORE SIGNALS within the group of inner worlds. Most of them are either randomly aligned stellar noise or artifacts from the other planets. However, a few signals hold promise. The most likely of the bunch are, as of now, designated KOI-351.13 and KOI-351.14. Candidate 13 is around 0.77 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0and takes 6.760 days to orbit Kepler-90. The other potential planet, Candidate 14, is around the same size at 0.79 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0but takes 8.454 days to orbit the central star. If real, this would mean that Kepler-90 has a total of TWELVE planets, even higher than our Solar System and the HD 10180 system! Because all 5 of the new candidates are so small, it\u0027s probably going to take a while before any of them get confirmed. It\u0027s also possible that some of these are false positives, while some of the other possibilities I\u0027ve found are real planets.

It has 6 confirmed planets, 5 transiting and one that is not. Two of the planets were the first Earth-sized planets found by Kepler, while 20b is one of the very few \u0022Mega-Earths\u0022. Shutcheon managed to find a potential seventh planet, this time a tiny 0.26 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0object orbiting every 0.403727 days, Think of it as The Moon from Hell. However, closer analysis revealed that this object may have a longer orbital period of about 1.232102 days, putting it in a 3:1 resonance with Kepler-20b.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEPIC 210897587:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0A new find by Vidar87.

All of the three planets are most likely real, and would\u0027ve been confirmed by now if scientists had access to this data earlier. Plus, that final planet is one of the best candidates for potential habitability ever found by Exoplanet Explorers users. Its longer orbital period puts it smack within the habitable zone, giving it just about the same amount of stellar flux Earth receives. It is only a tad larger than Earth, and may be freely rotating if its orbit is eccentric enough. Based on its radius and estimated stellar flux of ~1.00, EPIC 210897587.03 has an Earth Similarity Index value of 0.95!!!\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEPIC 210736056:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0Another multi-planet system found by Vidar87 with a potentially habitable candidate world. The host star is significantly smaller than the previous star at about a quarter the radius and mass of the Sun. There are only two planets in this system, but both are quite unique. The first, EPIC 210736056.02, is the smallest at just 0.88 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E, not that much smaller than Venus. It is also likely similar to Venus, as its orbit of 9.944 days places it at 0.057162 AU, within the \u0022Venus Zone\u0022 of the system. The equilibrium temperature of 333\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003EK suggests a stellar flux around twice that of Earth, which would evaporate any water and lead to a terrible runaway greenhouse effect. The second planet, EPIC 210736056.01, is significantly more promising. At 1.32 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E, it\u0027s exactly 50% larger than C02, and orbits significantly further out at 0.11675 AU with a year of 29.024 days. This puts C01 within the outer part of the habitable zone and give it an equilibrium temperature of 233\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003EK. This is just about the same as Proxima b and TRAPPIST-1e, indicating a stellar flux 2/3rds that of Earth. The calculated ESI value for this planet is 0.83 - not as good as EPIC 210897587.03, but still VERY good and indicates a potentially life-friendly planet.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow, these are some very good findings!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:o\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon2.png\u0022 title=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, what telescopes do you have access to over on Exoplanet Explorers?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ProtoJeb21","CreatedById":153551,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-22T23:29:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223178227\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022145502\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221506122312\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022169181\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022EricL\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 minutes ago, EricL said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow, these are some very good findings!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:o\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon2.png\u0022 title=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, what telescopes do you have access to over on Exoplanet Explorers?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are no telescopes.
