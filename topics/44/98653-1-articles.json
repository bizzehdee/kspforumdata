As to whether or not it is superior to propulsive is something that takes a lot of study, as it is just going to come down to mass and performance: is it more efficient to carry big heavy wings up with you so you can use all or most of your propellant on ascent, or is it more efficient to save a little fuel for boost-back burns.

However, the major difference comes in functionality - propulsive landers can land on little more fuel than would have been spare anyway, but they can only land in a very small area near their initial ballistic landing site. Landing any distance back towards land requires a huge fuel addition, plus as they are only lifted actively, would not be allowed near any populated area to begin with. Gliders, however, can fly a very long distance back on their own, and may be able to RTLS using only their spare fuel, or no fuel at all, depending on the design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis allows the booster to return itself to its reuse point with no additional operational cost, and as it can glide, it is allowed near minor population centres, as it has the ability to avoid them without relying on engines that may or may not restart. It is assumed the controls will continue working, as they had to operate to begin with to turn the booster around. A gliding booster is then also sitting on wheels, ready to be dragged very cheaply back to the VAB or equivalent for whatever refurbishment is required, as well as leaving it in a more convenient configuration for most maintenance tasks (horizontal, rather than vertical).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe end result is that a glide-back booster may be more complex to design, but could quite likely be a lot cheaper operationally, faster to reuse, and face less wear, as its engines only face a single firing per launch. As boosters themselves are very light once dry, the wings would not have to be a significant mass penalty - they do not have to provide lift during launch, and airliner wings (that are much longer and heavier than usually proposed for boosters) are only around 10% of their maximum load mass - which would be negligible compared to a fully fuelled booster. For reference, this would be under 2 tonnes to make the Falcon 9 first stage a flyback booster - and it can be assumed that the additional mass for landing gear and such would fit in the excess from the 10% estimate, in addition to the removal of its vertical landing equipment. SpaceX may prefer to try a vertical approach for its relative development simplicity, as a conventional rocket can theoretically achieve it, but even on their own booster wings may be more effective.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Launch Director","CreatedById":211443,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-02T16:36:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni hope someone will make a mod for this it\u0027s looking epic\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
