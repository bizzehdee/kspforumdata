radioactives, and a detonator can built a dirty bomb that will render a small portion of a city uninhabitable until either a very expensive cleanup is completed, enough time elapses (\u003Csup\u003E60\u003C/sup\u003ECo has a long half life and emits neutrons, making everything around it radioactive as well), or people just forget living there is a death sentence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaking an actual nuclear fission bomb -- the kind that could \u0022destroy\u0022 Sarajevo -- is a good bit harder, as noted in the \u0022medieval nuke\u0022 question up thread a bit.\u00A0 IFF one had access to enriched uranium, a gun type bomb is relatively easy -- easy enough that the United States military didn\u0027t bother to make and detonate a test article before dropping Little Boy on Hiroshima.\u00A0 They were that sure it would work.\u00A0 All that\u0027s needed is suitably shaped uranium slugs, explosive propellant (reloading powder would work, they used cordite in Little Boy), and tampers to keep the uranium together long enough to get an acceptable level of reaction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaking a plutonium bomb is harder still -- you can\u0027t assemble the critical mass fast enough to get a reasonable reaction level with a gun type device (likely because plutonium is all fissionable, where only the \u003Csup\u003E235\u003C/sup\u003EU part of uranium is -- around 3% in bomb metal), so you need some kind of implosion trigger, and those are far more difficult to build.\u00A0 Implosion was tricky enough that the the original builders -- including some pretty danged smart people, Fermi, Oppenheimer, and so forth -- felt it necessary to explode a test unit to be sure they had it right.\u00A0 If you had a modern nuclear physicist on your team, and access to something that will pass for a supercomputer (Bitcoin mining rig, maybe?), it might be possible to be reasonably confident in building an implosion device without a test article.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurther, either way, you need suitable bomb metal.\u00A0 3% enriched uranium required a national effort (in 1944) to get enough to make \u003Cem\u003Eone\u003C/em\u003E bomb.\u00A0 It\u0027s not something you\u0027ll do in hiding from the world, not in today\u0027s world.\u00A0 Reactor fuel, of either type, would require extensive reprocessing to turn into bomb metal.\u00A0 In fact, the most likely source of bomb metal for a terrorist bomb is, well, a bomb.\u00A0 There are (after 70\u002B years of the nuclear age) a number of \u0022missing\u0022 nuclear devices that could potentially come into the possession of folks who, even if they couldn\u0027t resurrect the electronics to be able to fire the bomb as it stands (or couldn\u0027t depend on the fusion core due to age), could use the bomb metal to make another bomb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr were you referring to the \u0022total surveillance
