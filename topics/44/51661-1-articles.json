Although there are some massive holes in the plot (Hubble being right next door to the ISS) I thought it captured the tone of space perfectly. It is a harsh environment that requires very specialized equipment to exist in. When things go bad they go VERY bad, often leaving you dead, hopelessly stranded in space, or both. To relate to Kerbal Space Program, I once had an accidental high speed collision during a docking attempt that split my space station in half, throwing the only re-entry capable capsule flying away. It was only thanks to a undamaged engine and a few tanks of fuel that the crew was able to board and re-enter with no casualties.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESPOILERS BELOW!!!

I think the worst way to die in space is to be left adrift and alone while you slowly suffocate to death on your own used breath. My third favorite scene in the movie is when he is drifting away and he comments on how beautiful the sunrise is over the mountains (my second favorite scene being when Sandra Bullock turn off the oxygen in the capsule and starts to drift off to sleep and my first favorite being when she is floating in the lake at the end).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat where your thoughts on the movie?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T06:01:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, I think it would be a pretty forgetable movie if it were not for the visuals.

The distance they put between the stations, the crippled Soyuz could have made on maneuvering thrusters.

Basically, almost anything to do with physics of actual flight or navigation was wrong. But they still managed zero-G better than almost any other movie, so big props to them on that.

Third, if we really must manufacture rationals for plot points\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 as she is grappling with the Tiangong, it is clearly undergoing re-entry with some atmospheric drag (because, um\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 that would happen. Somehow. Maybe magic).

And Tiangong shouldn\u0027t have been deorbiting anyway. And the relative closing velocity would have killed her. And the off-axis thrust from a fire extinguisher (a pressurized fire extinguisher on the ISS?) would lead to even worse yaw/pitch issues than shown. And hypervelocity impacts would have a *terrible* time coupling in that much angular momentum to a system like the Shuttle or even the Canadarm. And the lack of blog when a guys head was essentially drilled through. The fire on-board the ISS would have generated internal pressures more than sufficient to do structural damage without impacts (remember Apollo 1?). ISS and Hubble aren\u0027t even remotely close (wildly different inclination\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 and from KSP, we all know different inclination are easy to transfer between, especially from a \u0022low\u0022 orbit, right?), and Tiangong isn\u0027t there either.

My son asked me while watching the movie \u0022would this happen?\u0022, and I had to answer with a firm \u0022No, but\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u0022. Yes, you can get to a state where the debris multiply rapidly (exponentially)\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 and that\u0027s a serious concern... but that doesn\u0027t mean anything like instantly. The movie seems to imply everything going to kibbles and bits in a single orbital period or so - not even the right order of magnitude. An orbital debris cascade would take many multiples (as in \u0022hundreds\u0022 or more like \u0022thousands\u0022) of the orbital period. And it wouldn\u0027t change spacecraft communication in the least\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 not unless such a debris cascade in LEO would impact Geo-sync orbit, which is where the multiple (yes, they have back-ups) TDR Satellites are located.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother significant goof here is if the debris stream (from a recent break-up) encountered the shuttle one orbit #1, the chances are incredibly remote that it would encounter it on orbit #2, #3, etc. After all, if the break-up was in the same orbit as the shuttle, it wouldn\u0027t have a velocity relative to it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 and if it was in a different orbit than the shuttle, they only intersect in two places. So unless you have the break-up event occur in an orbit inclined to the shuttles, but with an identical period, this is not a regularly once-an-orbit repeating phenomenon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill bigger problem?

No chance\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 especially since anything on-coming to you at those speeds would have nearly zero drift velocity across your field of view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, the fire in space bit bothered me - because while you *do* get fires in space (Mir had some *serious* issues in this regard), they do not apparently look like that.
