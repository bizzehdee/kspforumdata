Suppose i wnat to send an encypted message to someone, but i need to create a code each time. I can send/give entangled particles to that person in advance and then interact with those particles exactly when i send the message, then only two people could know the cipher.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-10T14:20:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHopefully we will get an actual quantum computer at one point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
