Current launch costs (on the order of tens of thousands of dollars per kilogram) are too damn high for national governments to justify spending money on space programs (though if the US government would spend more than 0.5% of its annual budget on NASA [i\u0027m thinking the Department of Defense could use some cuts], we\u0027d probably be a lot further than we are now). That\u0027s actually kind of why I\u0027m anxious to see the Skylon project come to fruition, because having a reusable, low-turnaround-time SSTO would revolutionize space travel across the board. And Skylon is being designed, from the ground up, to be low-turnaround - for instance, it follows a much shallower re-entry path than the Shuttle, so it experiences less compressive heating, which means it can use simpler (and more robust, and lighter) thermal protection on the underside, for significant savings in pre-launch turnaround time and maintenance costs. But I digress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current problem is that any solution for decreasing launch costs, given our current technology level, would require a large number of launches to bring to fruition. Consider, for instance, the space elevator: assuming we had sufficient manufacturing capacity for carbon nanotubes, we would still have to send up enough cable to reach geosynchronous orbit, AND either send up or bring from somewhere else a sufficiently massive object to act as a tether (for instance, an asteroid). Either way, we\u0027re talking about hundreds, if not thousands, of groundside launches before the elevator is operational.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a few proposed options that wouldn\u0027t require any space launches to build, but would be just (exorbitantly) expensive - for instance, consider the proposal for a mass driver. It accelerates you almost all the way to orbital velocity, and then you give yourself a little bump with rockets at your apoapsis to circularize. Problem is, to build a sufficiently large and powerful mass driver to send a spacecraft of any appreciable mass to LEO would cost on the order of tens or even hundreds of billions - double that if you want it to be safe for passengers (limited acceleration).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not saying this stuff is impossible, but unless the governments (or corporations) of Earth get their priorities straight (why the hell would any country need enough nuclear weapons to annihalate the world 100 times over?), it\u0027s not happening anytime soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T19:01:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, such a mass drive would likely be on the order of billions.
