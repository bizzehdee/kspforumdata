They had to place it within a few km of target while tracking it from distances on the order of 10 light minutes. Time after time. Compared to that, a few meters from 20km is peanuts. Oh, and they do have GPS. That\u0027s basically what CONSERT data is.

Philae did have an at least double redundant landing \u0022grappling\u0022 system (i.e. the harpoon and the combination of the thruster and the screws). Unfortunately, the harpoon and thruster didn\u0027t fire so the screws couldn\u0027t have worked either. How much redundancy should they have built in to a mission where every kilogram costs thousands and thousands of dollars and could ultimately affect the probability of success? It is easy to say in hindsight that they should have had more redundant localization systems, but those also cost power. Power that, as it turned out, was at a premium. Soon enough, they will find Philae in images taken by Rosetta. Hopefully that will help them determine the likelihood that Philae can be brought out of hibernation.

This allow provide insight on a few things. Firstly, the scientists will discover the mean permittivity of the comet nucleus (air has a dielectric constant of 1 in a perfect vacuum and I believe water is near 80 - correct me if I am wrong). We should learn some interesting things about the make up of the comet through this tomography. Additionally, they will discover the mean absorption of the nucleus and identify the refractory material make up of the comet. Should be interesting compare with the results from the drilling sample. Subsurface irregularities or \u0022anomalies\u0022 may appear in radargrams or by examining changes in velocity of the radio waves.
