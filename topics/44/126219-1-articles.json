In KSP career mode, your first craft probably consists of a Mk1 Command Pod, a parachute, and a flea booster, but no stack decoupler. If you notice, the center of mass is actually quite high when the fuel is expended, giving the rocket a tendency to dive nose-first on decent which the parachute in its semi-deployed state cannot counteract.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThus, if you don\u0026#39;t use the (extremely) overpowered reaction wheels on the capsule, you\u0026#39;ll end up with this situation:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/8gXMIPO.png[/img]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFollowed by this situation:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/PkAjtIB.png[/img]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI can only imagine this is extremely uncomfortable to the occupant.

I found some videos where the camera is mounted to the rocket, and there always seems to be a violent flip when the parachute opens.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T01:34:25Z","Content":"\nReal capsules are built so that they automatically orient themselves with the flat side down.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xavven","CreatedById":100398,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T01:41:36Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027SargeRho\u0027]Real capsules are built so that they automatically orient themselves with the flat side down.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks!

If a vehicle is aerodynamically stable flying nose-first, then it will be travelling nose-first when the parachute deploys, and subsequently have to \u0022flip\u0022 around. There are only two ways to \u0022fix\u0022 this.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. Deploy the parachute from somewhere other than the nose, resulting in an \u0022on-its-side\u0022 descent attitude. This is similar to the \u0022rogallo wing\u0022 concepts for Gemini, as well as ballistic chutes for airplanes. For a capsule, you\u0026#39;re lying on your back in normal flight, so with the capsule on its side you\u0026#39;re sitting upright. For an airplane, the vehicle is in close to its level flight attitude. You can also deploy the chute from the tail, but for a manned vehicle you\u0026#39;d be hanging upside down for the descent so this is usually avoided.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Make the vehicle aerodynamically stable flying tail-first. This is what all \u0022capsule-style\u0022 manned spacecraft do: during a normal reentry and descent, when the parachute deploys the spacecraft has already jettisoned the launch vehicle, service module, etc. and is already falling with the heat shield pointing downward.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe only time something like this could come up in manned flight is during a launch abort scenario.

The parachute deployment causes additional rocking and swaying. However, while it might be uncomfortable, this is definitely survivable, and would only occur in a launch abort scenario where crew discomfort and minor injuries are acceptable.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xavven","CreatedById":100398,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T05:13:21Z","Content":"\nGreat!

I did some reading on John Glenn\u0026#39;s re-entry and watched that video.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the end, it seems like a safer bet in KSP to do launchpad \u0022science\u0022 first to unlock decouplers before doing a first launch.

The timing for the parachute ejections is most commonly done by delayed fuse in the motor itself, and more sophisticated devices are employed only on larger rockets. This timing is not ideal, because engine manufacturers can\u0026#39;t know how your rocket will perform, so they take a guess. Ideally the parachute would deploy at apoapsis, but this blind guess makes it unlikely to happen then.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMore advanced hobby rockets use apoapsis detector mechanisms to deploy the chute more accurately, and the jerking is less pronounced.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor KSP, don\u0026#39;t put the parachutes on the SRB, put them on the pod, as high as possible.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T07:01:47Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027SargeRho\u0027]None that were done with capsules.
