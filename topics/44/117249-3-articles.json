Its a part that is too valuable to disappear like that. I don\u0027t know for sure, but I bet it was insured too. There are less than 2000 of these in existence.\n\nWhat are you talking about? These planes are scrapped. This means that some parts will be recycled into the aircraft industry (which is highly profitable, which is why relatively new aircraft are scrapped), parts will recycled and parts will be sold off to people using the parts for other purposes. There will be no registration or anything on that - if you are lucky, you will find something about the part being sold.\n\nBits and pieces will wander the Earth without any central registration whatsoever.
