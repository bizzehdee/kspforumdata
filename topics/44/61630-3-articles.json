(Liquified Natural Gas, also known as methane, or CH4.) It\u0027s exhaust is just steam and CO2. Their in-development LNG/LOX motor is called \u0022Raptor.\u0022 LNG has higher specific energy, higher exhaust velocity, higher oxidizer ratio, and slightly less energy density than RP1. The only reason RP1 was developed as a fuel instead of using LNG was a military decision before NASA existed. Since Goddard, American rockets had used petroleum-based fuel propellants. There was already a supply chain for it. However there is no such petroleum infrastructure on Mars, whereas methane can be synthesized from the ambient atmosphere. Russia, China, and NASA are all trying to develop a rocket motor that uses it.

It\u0027s energy density is tiny, and energy density is more important in a first-stage engine than ISP. LH2 has such low energy density, and RP1 (and LNG for that matter) have such high energy density, they can store a lot more energy in the same volume pressure-vessel. At a certain point, the size of the vessel necessary to store the same mass of LH2 fuel literally outweighs the gain in exhaust velocity. You also have issues with LH2 being kept at 20 K and being so lightweight they \u0022boil off\u0022 from whatever pressure-vessel you put them in. That is why many rockets use RP1/LOX first-stage and LH2/LOX second stage.\u003Cp\u003EYou can look at the math in \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19860018652\u0026amp;hterms=tripropellant\u0026amp;qs=N%3D0%26Ntk%3DAll%26Ntt%3Dtripropellant%26Ntx%3Dmode%2520matchallpartial%26Nm%3D17%7CCollection%7CNACA%7C%7C123%7CCollection%7CNASA%2520STI\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E NASA study. It is about energy density of propellant and its effect on the payload mass fraction of the rocket being just as important as the exhaust velocity of the propellant. Specifically, it\u0027s about tripropellants, which is a wonderful way of explaining how important energy density is, because both ISP and energy density are taken to extremes in tripropellant rockets. It\u0027s got math, derivation, porkchops, and is readable. Fascinating stuff, like how adding aluminum to LH2/LOX rockets increases ISP but decreases payload mass fraction because adding aluminum precipitously decreases energy density.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-06T06:47:34Z\u0022 title=\u002202/06/2014 06:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by fireflower\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Emerged posts\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-06T05:10:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo clarify, they\u0027re replacing RP-1 with LNG for the \u003Cem\u003Eupper stage only\u003C/em\u003E, as it has energy-density advantages and requires less specialised infrastructure than LH2 .
