The profitable extraction of resource will almost certainly come from asteroids, not planets. Some asteroids have volatiles in the form of hydrated clays, so you can extract water ice (to make O2, H2, and H2O2 for rocket fuel, H2O for drinking, O2 for breathing, and H2 for sabatiers, etc) and ammonia ice (to make N2O4 and NH3 for rocket fuel). There are a significant number of metallic asteroids as well, so you can extract all kinds of metals (especially valuable aluminum!), all without having to touch the surface of Mars or Venus, deep in their respective gravity wells.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there are also several reasons to park asteroids on orbit of planets, where you can use the Oberth effect for easy capture, and easy access (because small bodies on orbit of a massive body are extremely accessible), and so they wouldn\u0027t be on unstable, often inclined and eccentric, solar orbits. It also simplifies the logistics of supplying piloted bases if they are in the same neighborhood. There are only a few reasons not to park asteroids on orbit around Earth, but those reasons are very strong (and hopefully very apparent).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was just making a case for centering space infrastructure around Venus because of its many benefits over Mars for the aforementioned purposes.

It\u0027s only a few days away compared to the 5\u002B month Mars and 3 month Venus and is just as useless to put humans on.
