There is also the issue that these stars only live for a few tens of millions of years, and stars tend to get brighter as they age, so the life zone, and indeed the zone where planets can survive, shifts rather rapidly. Assuming that you can get around all of that, the life zone for these sorts of stars is centred more than 200 AU out (which means the star, as seen from there, is probably little more than a point). Even at that distance, UV is going to be a MAJOR issue, because these stars are 25000 to 30000 times brighter than the sun, and far more of their output is above the visual range.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deathsoul097","CreatedById":77396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T07:47:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwwwwww, It would have been so cool to have a planet orbiting a Blue Supergiant really close up.

Earlier stars could not be formed accretion around dust, they only formed in superdense bodies of gas and were very difficult to form.\u00A0 But when they spontaneously formed they typical did so creating new galaxies, and their collapse probably initiated GBH formation and allowed similar blue stars (2nd generation) in their wake. Because these stars were so difficult to form the situation of binary formation was all the more difficult. Unlike Spiza this star is 14.46 \u00B1 0.8 billion years in age. I think consideration of Spiza as a life bringing star is not worthy of any discussion. The star is no-longer in its main sequence is very unstable it has an eliptoid shape and as it expands it will begin stripping gas from its companion star with a catastrophic out come. Such a system could never sustain life. Rather than having complex life stopping situation HD 140283 could have planets that could sustain life, such as at the bottom of an ocean.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are two primary problems. First the first generation or stars (population III stars) unlikely had planets and certainly no rocky planets. So on this account life comparable to that on earth could not exist. The second problem is that the energies in these stars suffices to erode the atmospheres of smaller planets (as might have been the case with venus). Such a planet would have to be further out relative to luminosity than the earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe early second generation of stars has largely the same problem, gassy planets and smaller rocky planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the most part the blue star phase of our universe is over, yes a few younger galaxies have active blue star formation. The the bulk of accreted mass in our universe lies in large galaxies with lots of red stars. There are very short lived and unstable blue stars that appear now, but its not like looking at a galaxy and seeing all blue stars. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDFy-38135539\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDFy-38135539\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
