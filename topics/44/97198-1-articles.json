With the Milky Way alone containing probably billions of planets, how is it possible that no other civilization has yet contacted us?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[...] But in the intervening decades, humanity has recognized that our own climb up the ladder of technological sophistication comes with a heavy price. From climate change to resource depletion, our evolution into a globe-spanning industrial culture is forcing us through the narrow bottleneck of a sustainability crisis. [...]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re not the only ones to hit a sustainability bottleneck.

[...] From the vantage point of this relatively new field, astrobiology, our current sustainability crisis may be neither politically contingent nor unique, but a natural consequence of laws governing how planets and life of any kind, anywhere, must interact. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[...] Human civilization currently harvests around 100 billion megawatt hours of energy each year and dumps 36 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the planetary system, which is why the atmosphere is holding more heat and the oceans are acidifying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[...] Can we generalize this kind of planetary hijacking to other worlds? The long history of Earth provides a clue. The oxygen you are breathing right now was not part of our original atmosphere. It was the so-called Great Oxidation Event, two billion years after the formation of the planet, that drove Earth\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s atmospheric content of oxygen up by a factor of 10,000. What cosmic force could so drastically change an entire planet\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s atmosphere? Nothing more than the respiratory excretions of anaerobic bacteria then dominating our world. The one gas we most need to survive originated as deadly pollution to our planet\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s then-leading species: a simple bacterium. The Great Oxidation Event alone shows that when life (intelligent or otherwise) becomes highly successful, it can dramatically change its host planet. And what is true here is likely to be true on other planets as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[...] By studying these nearby planets, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve discovered general rules for both climate and climate change. These rules, based in physics and chemistry, must apply to any species, anywhere, taking up energy-harvesting and civilization-building in a big way. For example, any species climbing up the technological ladder by harvesting energy through combustion must alter the chemical makeup of its atmosphere to some degree. Combustion always produces chemical byproducts, and those byproducts can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t just disappear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[...] Depending on initial conditions and choices made by the species (such as the mode of energy harvesting), some trajectories will lead to an unrecoverable sustainability crisis and eventual population collapse. Others, however, may lead to long-lived, sustainable civilizations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[...] One answer to the Fermi paradox is that nobody makes it through \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC that climate change is fate, that nothing we do today matters because civilization inevitably leads to catastrophic planetary changes.

The pessimistic view is about a billion years after the planet formed, there\u0027s evidence for it 200 million years before that, and it could have been earlier.

It seems that most environments are not like that, most creatures do just fine being thick as two short planks. Relatedly, you need a species with a body plan that can evolve to make good use of that intelligence. Primates for example can easily use our arms to manipulate objects, signal to others in our group, and so on; most other land animals need all their limbs for standing or walking most of the time. And that intelligent, capable species needs to be able to survive in a low-technology, low-civilization world for a pretty long time, without evolutionary pressures changing to push it away from intelligence, before some other factor leads it to develop a more complex civilization.

I mean, if one in a million stars has a planet that is fit for developing life, and off those million planets, only one in a thousand would at some point develop life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat means the chance for life on a planet is already one in a billion. A one in a billion chance leaves just 100-400 planets in the entire Milky Way (the milky way is estimated to have between 100 and 400 billion stars). 100-400 planets that contain life... including just bacterial life, including planets with just animal life. Considering it took nearly 3,5 billion years for life to form here, and 1 billion years to go from the earliest lifeforms to using radio-waves for communication, considering the universe is only 13.8 billion years old... Those 4,5 billion years it took for our star to develop a semi-spacefaring civilisation suddenly don\u0027t look all that short. In fact, if we assume life can only form around main-sequence starts (stars like our sun).... we\u0027re suddenly with an age restriction on the stars. Because older main-sequence stars are more likely to host advanced civilisations... but the problem with that is that there\u0027s only a 2 or 3 billion year variance possible before the parent star CEASES to support life...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsidering we literally have ALL possible stages of life possible in 100-400 planets...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s say half of that develops sentient life --\u0026gt; 50-200 planets\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s say half of that has sentient life that\u0027s pre-radio communication --\u0026gt; 25-100 planets\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow many civilisations that are post industrial age of those 25-100 civilisations would develop interstellar travel? Maybe one? None at all?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the chances greatly increase for intergalactic travel... but then the thing against finding us is that there\u0027s a LOT of possible travel destinations. If you haven\u0027t been near earth (about 110 light year radius is the farthest our earliest radiosignals have traveled, that\u0027s roughly 1/1000th of the diameter of just our own Galaxy) there\u0027s simply no (known or predicted) way of knowing we\u0027re here! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy haven\u0027t we been visited on any detectable scale? Probably because the total number of travellers is too low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem really is with the probability, this is wild guessing, but they are educated guesses. This entire theorizing would change massively if for example we found life or traces of it on Europa or Mars. Hence why those are the focus of the \u0027search for life\u0027. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso a thing to consider: If we have people thinking up ethics for first contacts for our sci-fi series, it\u0027s likely that humanity would indeed NOT visit pre-interstellar species on an ethical basis... and that the same is a likely cause for them not visiting us if they find us. And since I believe intelligent races generally have \u0027empathy\u0027 as a prerequisite evolutionary trait, I also sort of believe (but that\u0027s an opinion) that a truly \u0027evil\u0027 intelligent race cannot exist on principle. Because non-empathic species simply wouldn\u0027t survive well enough to develop said intelligence. But that\u0027s a personal belief. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, that\u0027s my thoughts on the Fermi-paradox...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the natural disasters: humanity has survived multiple \u0027cataclysmic\u0027 natural disasters. Including several ice ages. And life has pretty much survived multiple instances of a total planet freeze, a total planet scorching, and quite a bunch of atmospheric changes... Not to mention, even nuclear mishaps don\u0027t seem to be deterring life all that thoroughly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with human induced climate change on top of natural climate change is that we don\u0027t know HOW MUCH we throw the natural balance out of whack. Scientifically, as we speak, the general consensus seems to lean towards \u0027more than expected\u0027 rather than \u0027less than expected\u0027... but natural disasters have occurred extensively in the past; and none managed to wipe out humanity (as a species, we have a few ice ages on our name already). The biggest threat seems to be in triggering a new Ice Age, which obviously won\u0027t happen instantly. Anyway, I do not believe the continued survival of the human race is decided by natural disasters. Sure, a lot of misery would happen, but as long as we are able to maintain our knowledge base and at least a part of our number, we\u0027re pretty much guaranteed to survive. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest concern on modern industry is that it\u0027s not sustainable and fairly inefficient. To put it in more economic terms, we can produce more by using less, so for the life of me, I don\u0027t understand the reluctance to put some effort in moving towards that goal. And I\u0027ve also never for the life of me understood why large corporations are so hell bent on short-term profit opposed to long-term.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-20T14:38:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, you must be talking about anthropogenic global warming.\u003Cp\u003EThe consensus is that Earth has less than half a billion years before the sun\u0027s increased output leads to a runaway greenhouse, and we end up very much like Venus - long before the Sun goes into a red giant phase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy point was more general - that a climate change can be worse for everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps more relevant, would be the case of the Permian extinction - the most severe extinction since there have been animals... it seems to have been caused by global warming due to CO2 output and melting of methane hydrates.
