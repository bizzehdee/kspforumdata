Its even worse for DNA viruses which need their DNA to be transcribed and then the resulting RNA to find a ribosome. The cytoplasm is not one homegenous soup. Those ribosomes, when the viral RNA reaches them, will have plenty of the modified tRNAs around to screw things up. We can screw things up even more by modifying the shine delgarno sequence of prokaryotic mRNAs, and the complementary rRNA in a manned similar to the mRNA codon/tRNA anticodon changes. Now that viral mRNA isn\u0027t likely to even latch on the the ribosome in the first place. (similar changes for the Kozak sequence of Eukaryotes)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost viruses are DNA viruses. Even then, the virus is going to have to add a whole bunch of tRNA encoding genes to keep things going. Some viruses encode a few, but this is exceptional. I\u0027m not aware of any virus that comes close to encoding a full set of tRNAs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) again, as in #1, that\u0027s not going to allow for an infection. The amounts you can fit in/on a virus vs what is in a cell is far too different\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) ok, they exist, but they are very rare. There\u0027s also a nomenclature issue. Since Archea are not bacteria (or Eubacteria), the viruses that infect them shouldn\u0027t be known as bacteriophages. That lowers those 5 \u0022groups\u0022 to just 2: Cystoviridae and Plasmaviridae containing only 2 known species (although the latter has some more tentative species, and I\u0027m sure there are more).\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe virus will have to simultaneously develop a system to bring in tons of tRNA, protect that RNA from degredation, acquire dozens of tRNA encoding genes, and develop a system to shut down host cell tRNA synthesis (I\u0027m not aware of any virus that does this, even the ones that do happen to encode a few tRNA of their own)... or simultaneously change nearly every codon in its genome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we throw in the Kozak/shine delgarno sequence/rRNA sequence changes at the same time, it gets even worse (although that wasn\u0027t discussed in this article/paper). If you now have your own tRNA and your own ribosomes... you\u0027re not a virus, you\u0027ve got a full set of protein translation machinery, and you\u0027re a parasitic bacteria/archea/whatever like mycoplasma.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t see how an intermediate is going to work to infect the reencoded organisms, and it will be much worse than its competitors at infecting non-encoded cells.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really really really doubt that it would work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, they started in 2013 with just a single codon change, and that wasn\u0027t enough... they were more resistant to infection, but not immune, and if we purposefully made such stepwise changes, then sure, the viruses could probably keep up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven conceeding its not strictly impossible, the time frame for sucha\u00A0 huge evolutionary change is long enough for human purposes that when these new viruses evolve, we can just change the encodings again.... not to mention the proteins involved in packing a ton of tRNA onto the capsid are probably going to be easy for immune systems to spot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yes, if we can reencode bacterial or eukaryotic genomes, then it would be trivial to reencode a viral genome to infect the new GROs... and I\u0027m sure someone would do it just like some people make computer viruses..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-19T17:35:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi KerikBalm,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure if you were looking for pre 2006 references in the scientific literature but if you\u0027ll settle for a sci-fi reference, it\u0027s mentioned (in a re-encoded human context) on Greg Egan\u0027s \u0027Distress\u0027 - published in 1996.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-19T17:53:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t suppose you could provide any further details, the wikipedia page doesn\u0027t suggest anything of that sort being contained within the novel, when I\u0027d think humans that are immune to viruses that the rest of humanity may suffer, and whom can\u0027t interbreed with normal humans, would be a major plot point\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distress_(novel)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distress_(novel)\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWere there specific mentioned of tRNA anticodon-mRNA codons being correspondingly changed?
