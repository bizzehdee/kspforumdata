And I\u0027m pretty sure there\u0027s more stuff to look at to figure out the worth of a single fund in Kerbal dollars.\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the things we know the cost of specifically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The value of one unit of Solid Fuel: 0.6 funds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The value of one unit of Liquid Fuel: 0.8 funds\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The value of one unit of Oxidizer: 0.18 funds\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The value of one unit of Monopropellant: 1.2 funds\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The value of one unit of XenonGas: 4 funds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The value of each building\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The value of each part\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The value of a Kerbal Life. (Kerbal Rescue Contracts)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe can compare to what the fuels probably are in real life based upon the stats of the engines. We have to average LiquidFuel and Oxidizer because all the engines have different stats that could be any number of fuels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolid Fuel = Ammonium Perchlorate composite\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiquidFuel = LiquidHydrogen, Kerosene (Presumably RP-1 if it\u0027s in a high-thrust engine like the Mainsail.) It\u0027s probably not Hydrazine, because LF is much less costly than Monoprop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOxidizer = Almost certainly Liquid Oxygen, because of how inefficient other oxidizers are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMonopropellant = Hydrazine, judging from the engine stats.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EXenonGas = Xenon Gas. And it turns out that a unit of Xenon is much more expensive than any other fuel, so it all depends on what the ratio of other fuels are to see if Xenon is much more common.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA unit of a resource, according to the wiki, is 1 liter. People have said this makes no sense. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/49124-What-is-the-unit-of-measure-for-rocket-fuel-It-does-NOT-appear-to-be-liters%21?p=638784\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post638784\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis person\u003C/a\u003E says one unit equals five liters, so we\u0027ll go with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EXenon costs about 1.2 dollars per gram, weighing around 5 grams per liter in a fuel tank. So that\u0027s 6 dollars per unit of XenonGas in the real world. We need to find the cost of another fuel as well to compare to see if it\u0027s around the same scale. A nuclear rocket motor can only possibly function with an Isp as high as the one in game if it\u0027s fuel is Hydrogen, so we\u0027ll assume LiquidFuel is Hydrogen. Liquid Hydrogen is about 2 dollars per unit. (5 liters)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6/2=ratio of Xenon to Hydrogen cost in dollars in real life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4/0.8=ratio of XenonGas to LiquidFuel cost in funds in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese do not match up. 6/2=3. 4/0.8=5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll try Liquid Fuel being Kerosene. I found it\u0027s about 3.9 dollars per unit. This makes the ratio even worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow about trying Xenon to Liquid Oxygen? Liquid Oxygen is about 1 dollar per unit, so 6/1=6; 4/0.18=22.2? AAAAAAAAA!
