This is the simplest way to block stuff, with easy way to bypass too. To make it harder to bypass, sometime they either block alternate DNS server, like my school, or they redirect alternate DNS server, like my ISP, which in this way can be fixed by using dnscrypt, which encrypts the DNS traffic so no one can mess with it.\n\nThe stronger way filters works is to use deep packet inspection, which as the name suggests, it inspects all packets to see if they contain prohibited information or not. This is more stronger as the only way to circumvent this is to use some sort of proxy like web proxy or VPN, but this is more heavy, so this is used if the people/organization really don\u0027t want that information to be received, like enterprises and China. \n\nCountermeasure to this is to use VPN and proxy, which encrypts the traffic so the DPI filter doesn\u0027t know it contains the banned information, and it goes to a server in a free internet zone where it gets decrypted and go back to its original server. This is called tunneling. HTTPS also works similarly.\n\nCounter-countermeasure to this is to block VPN and proxy traffic\n\nBut the most powerful way to bypass all of that filters is to use other internet completely, like using 3G/LTE connection or piggybacking free wifi.\n\nCountermeasure to this is to jam other radios, either by spamming trash radio signals or by impersonating other wifi and sending disconnect command to it. Needless to say that this requires some enterprise grade stuff.\n\nThen there is MAC filtering that prevents unauthorized devices on the network, but home routers typically only implement this on the wifi side and not the ethernet side, and MAC spoofing defeats this entirely.\n\nRemember that the internet interprets censorship as damage and routes around it, and information want to be free. I\u0027m fine with they blocking facebook and steam in my school, or my ISP blocks pornographic websites, but I\u0027m not fine with my ISP to block reddit and imgur.\n\ntl;dr: good luck blocking internet traffic without some serious enterprise grade routers\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-15T12:41:58Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2015 12:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Aghanim**"},{"CreatedByName":"shynung","CreatedById":101096,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T15:24:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m fine with they blocking facebook and steam in my school, or my ISP blocks pornographic websites, but I\u0027m not fine with my ISP to block reddit and imgur.\n\nAh, I know this one. \u0027Internet Sehat\u0027, right?
