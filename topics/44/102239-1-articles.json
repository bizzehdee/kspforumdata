Doesn\u0027t this sound strikingly similar to moving a sailboat by pointing a fan at the sail?"},{"CreatedByName":"Tommygun","CreatedById":41293,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T02:23:59Z","Content":"Pilot: \u0022Huston, we have a problem.

The props on a plane push air back while a wing pushes air down to push the plane up, and additional airspeed from a prop does help with this - it\u0027s a well-observed effect that props consistently have slightly lower takeoff speed than jets, and there\u0027s various experimental features like blown flaps to try exploit such effects in various ways. So no, they\u0027re not crazy for getting more lift by using lots of props, that\u0027s a known and well documented effect. Whether it\u0027ll help more than they lose from all the interactions between having so many separate propellers ... that\u0027s another question that remains to be answered."}]}
