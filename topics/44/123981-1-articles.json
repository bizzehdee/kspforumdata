To get gravity assist from Earth, you need a speed differential with Earth in Sun\u0027s orbit. The only practical way to do that is to get into a slightly elipitical orbit around the Sun that lets Earth catch up with you almost exactly a year later. That gives you enough of a boost to lower perhilion to bellow Venus\u0027 orbit, and aphelion to above Mars\u0027. You then have an option to get a proper assist from Venus or Mars to go to wherever. Or, go for capture if these are your final destinations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoon is a different matter.
