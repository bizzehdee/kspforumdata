His phrasing there is not the best since a chemical propulsion system, such as the Starship is, couldn\u0027t make such a flight. But many different proposals have been offered over the years to accomplish it. Surprisingly, one method that of using a fusion drive may be possible near term. The reason why I say it may be possible near term, within decades, is because of how rapidly the various different approaches to fusion power are progressing. Practical fusion power might be reached within a decade. For the fusion drive, it would then have to be made lightweight enough for a space propulsion system. That\u0027s not a guarantee but I think it should be doable within decades of the fusion power being reached.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0See one proposal discussed here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ABVYrVghBwc?feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022Update!!
