You see this all the time in the industry.\n\nAriane 5 is scheduled to be retired in a couple of years. Arianespace\u0027s strategy was to counter SpaceX with Ariane 6, which is basically a \u0022low-cost Ariane 5\u0022:\n\n- Replacement for both Ariane 5 and Soyuz\n- Synergy with Vega (same boosters)\n- Better flexibility\n- Half the cost\n\nThe Ariane 6 project was started when SpaceX hadn\u0027t even landed a booster. At the time, it mades sense to be cautious about SpaceX. Today, SpaceX still hasn\u0027t proven that reusability will be profitable in the long run and that the market will support high launch rates.\n\nSo Ariane 6 today is probably going to be an interim launcher, to keep Arianespace relevant while they develop the next generation launcher, which is likely to be based on a combination of the Ariane 6 infrastructure, the Prometheus engine, and the Callisto reusable launcher project.\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/atMrN6Iufsk?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-05-31T12:14:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2018 12:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31**"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-31T12:59:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 5/30/2018 at 1:32 PM, Scotius said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So, in a nutshell: CNES underestimated SpaceX abilities and thought their reusability plan laughable.

I would also add second stage reuse as an option for smaller payloads.   \n\nThis would be an totaly new design, you would probably have to even replace the engines and making it expensive. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-05-31T13:41:50Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2018 01:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by magnemoe**"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-31T16:59:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 5/30/2018 at 8:32 AM, Scotius said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So, in a nutshell: CNES underestimated SpaceX abilities and thought their reusability plan laughable.

This was considered a major coup for the programme as Intelsat was viewed as heavily committed to using the rival Space Shuttle launcher for a large number of its satellites at that point.[10] One week later, ESA announced its commitment to a production run of 10 Ariane 1 launchers.[11]\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_1)\n\u003E \n\nDesigning Ariane 1 to be reusable would have also been a pretty pointless endeavour, as it only ever flew 11 times (including 2 failures)."},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-31T17:54:14Z","Content":"Ariane 5 was meant to be the launcher stage for European shuttle \u0022Hermes\u0022.
