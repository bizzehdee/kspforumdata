Dawn provided the first measurements of the moment of inertia and the first confirmation that the dwarf planet is in hydrostatical equilibrium - two conditions that allow scientists to simulate its internal structure. The results are that Ceres is differentiated (although the boundaries between layers are not so clear as on Earth), with\u00A0a rocky core (the temperatures were never high enough for the silicates to melt) surrounded by a volatile-rich shell. The density, as predicted, is quite low (lower than Vesta). The lighter materials, such as water ice, probably separated from the rock and migrated towards the surface early on in Ceres\u0027 history. Furthermore, there isn\u0027t a big difference in the gravitational field intensity between mountains and depressions, which suggests that mountains are able to move away the mass in the mantle underneath them, thus evening out the gravitational field, a bit like a boat floating because of the water moved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/what-s-inside-ceres-new-findings-from-gravity-data/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewww.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/what-s-inside-ceres-new-findings-from-gravity-data\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/pia20867.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022pia20867.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frida Space","CreatedById":60943,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-31T17:19:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn two days\u0027 time, Dawn will move to a new orbit at 1460 km (910 miles) from Ceres.

I read the five papers published just now on Science magazine and here are my highlights:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nAhuna Mons, the 4 km tall, 17 km wide mountain, is probably a \u003Cstrong\u003Ecryovulcano\u003C/strong\u003E. This would explain the troughs and the crests at its feet and the landslides on its sides. It would have been formed by extrusion of a viscous, molten material, which would have been present along with some hydrated salts with low eutectic temperatures and low thermal conductivity. Ahuna Mons is surprisingly crater-free; this suggests its last activity took place as recently as\u00A0180-240 million years ago.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCeres\u0027s low density (2162 kg\u00A0per cube metre) implies\u00A0an abundance of water; this could be proven by the detection of hydroxyl (OH)\u00A0and hydrated (H2O) minerals, like clays, carbonates and various salts. Indeed, Dawn has found hydroxyls; however, the news (not really new actually) is that it has seen all three absorption bands (1.28, 1.65 and 2.0 micrometres) typical of \u003Cstrong\u003Ewater \u003C/strong\u003Ein Oxo Crater, which is 10 km wide. Its high latitude, 44\u00B0, means it is in the shadow for most of the day, which is good for stabilising water. Several water transport and formation\u00A0mechanisms have been proposed. From the most likely to the least: excavation of underground water (either through impacts or landslides or both), sublimation, extra-Cerean contamination and interaction with the solar wind.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA six day-long acceleration in the solar wind\u0027s electrons could be explained by a transient\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eatmosphere\u003C/strong\u003E. I couldn\u0027t find an actual paper on this, but the NASA press release mentioned it, so here it is.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPhillosilicates\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0are very abundant. Their composition is the same all over Ceres; however, their abundance\u00A0varies a bit. Low density regions, such as Yalode crater, are both smooth and rugged; high density regions, such as Kerwan, on the other hand, are only smooth.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe depth-diameter ratio of several\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Efloor-fractured craters\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0(FFCs) reveals that they are anomalously shallow; hence, scientists propose the terrain was uplifted following cryomagmatic intrusion.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe crater morphology allowed scientists to study the relaxation of the surface, which appears to be impact-driven rather than internal/endogenic. The scientists conclude that Ceres\u0027s\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ecrust\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0is nor pure ice nor pure rock, but rather a mix of the two which allows limited relaxation.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOverall, all the studies imply \u003Cb\u003Eacqueous alteration\u003C/b\u003E\u00A0has been one of the main mechanisms that shaped Ceres.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting stuff!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-01T23:03:40Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2016 11:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Frida Space\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VaPaL","CreatedById":150974,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-15T19:44:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDawn reached its final orbit with perigee of 35km\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://spaceflightnow.com/2018/06/15/dawn-spacecraft-flying-low-over-ceres/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://spaceflightnow.com/2018/06/15/dawn-spacecraft-flying-low-over-ceres/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022PIA22526_hires-678x678.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022https://mk0spaceflightnoa02a.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PIA22526_hires-678x678.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-06-15T19:45:22Z\u0022 title=\u002206/15/2018 07:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJune 15, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by VaPaL\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ESpelling\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-15T21:13:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n35 kilometers above the surface.
