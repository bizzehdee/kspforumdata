The ground might as well not be there as far as upper atmosphere is concerned, and so the absolute wind speed is completely irrelevant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn Earth, we\u0027re used to high turbulence, shear, and wind gusts to come with high wind speeds, because there is interaction with static terrain as well as temperature variations across it. Even on global weather scale, mountains and shapes of continents make an impact on how weather systems develop. You don\u0027t have any of that on Venus. The atmosphere is opaque, so the heat energy received by atmosphere is exceptionally uniform, and mountains are all lost in that thick, viscous part of the atmosphere, so they make absolutely no impact. The \u0022weather\u0022 in upper Venusian atmosphere is exceptionally \u0022calm\u0022. There is very little shear, turbulence, or gusts. Movement of atmosphere tends to be very uniform over large distances.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s still a huge challenge in docking at hypersonic speeds.

I still think recovery vehicle should be a space plane even if it has to be staged, but it would certainly mean your recovery vehicle is larger and payload you can retrieve is smaller, which is a shame. But in any case, the absolute speed of wind with respect to terrain isn\u0027t going to matter. Conditions are going to be much better than they would have been on Earth at similar pressure altitude.

A particle doesn\u0027t just sit in excited state, then suddenly decides to decay. The physical process of decay is gradual transition of particle from it\u0027s excited to its decayed state. You just can\u0027t observe a superposition. It\u0027s Schrodinger\u0027s cat all over again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the most crucial thing to understand here. The biggest mistake in how\u00A0quantum mechanics is popularized\u00A0is right there in the name. Nothing is actually quantized. Nothing is actually discrete. All quantum processes and all physical quantities are inherently continuous. The things that are discrete are the eigen states of measurement operators, which is purely a mathematical quirk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn chemistry class, they tell you that an atom can only absorb a photon of exactly the right wavelength and in the exact quantum of energy, and that the electron will instantly jump to a new energy state. But that\u0027s such a bad oversimplification, it might as well be a lie. If you spend some time studying Magnetic Resonsance, for example, you\u0027ll quickly learn that a short pulse at\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eroughly\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the right frequency will get the system part of the way to excited state. What does it look like for an atom that absorbed a portion of the energy required for transition? Well, it\u0027s a superposition of the orbital states you learn in the chemistry class, which are nothing but eigen states of the energy operator. If this wasn\u0027t the case, photons with the \u0022wrong\u0022 energy wouldn\u0027t interact at all, and then glass wouldn\u0027t be refractive. The reason glass has index of refraction is because there are atoms whose absorption spectra are\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enear\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0visible light, and they absorb and re-emit light as it passes through the medium. If an atom would be unable to absorb a portion of a photon with the wrong energy, glass would be visually indistinguishable from vacuum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn atom in a half-excited state has half the energy required for a single photon of a given frequency, and it will emit that energy over time as an electromagnetic wave with half the total intensity, and if that wave encounters a detector, that detector itself will be taken into a superposition state. And if a\u00A0scientist takes the measurement from the detector, that scientist is now in a superposition state. There\u0027s a big question of how far down the chain you should care. The idea of decoherence, much like idea of coarse-grained entropy, lets you cut this chain and just start treating the picture classically. If you chose to interpret experiment in such a way, then you would compute probabilities, but it\u0027s an interpretation choice to substitute one unknown with another that results in a probabilistic outcome and not anything in the underlying physics. The other choice is to keep it Many Worlds, and then there are no probabilities. Just two timelines with their own outcomes. Either way, the system\u0027s entirely deterministic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeSchmuckatelli","CreatedById":154477,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-09T03:27:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuick question (as I formulate my response);\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EIs it fair to say that a particle has three states:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EUndecayed (which gives no information about when it will decay)\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDecaying (which gives information about the rate and progress), and\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDecayed (which gives no information about when it decayed?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Or am I fully exposing ignorance by even asking the question???)\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223922561\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002291282\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221612826557\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s not how decay works, though.
