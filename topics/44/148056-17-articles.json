I don\u0027t see much distortion in the picture, at least less than before. The blowups from the far edge show only a very slight coma. So maybe a few millimeters more and you are fine ?

From the information gathered on CN getting closer softens the coma but gives less FoV.

It\u0027s very cheap compared to an apo and has more aperture, which is good for a light polluted sky. Collimating will be an issue and not an issue: my c11 seems to have a rock solid collimation. In 4 years I have never touched it and I am scared of doing so. Probably working the collimation of the newtonian will give me a knowledge that every amateur astronomer should have :). My mount is a workhorse and I have a 1kg guide scope that together with the guide cam will somewhat balance the filter/wheel camera train at the side of the scope. And who knows.. .maybe i can find a way to use its coma\u00A0corrector on my SCT. And now that i think about it I just received today the ZWO ADC that I was planning to use for planetary. While it may not help with the coma matter, It may help me in reaching the right distance from the reducer since I lack\u00A0a true extension.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-23T17:43:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBought a 75-200mm lens for my Pentax P30T today at a thrift store for $20.

It\u0027s a toy, literally, but that\u0027s a pro and a con. I already bought some stuff (gaskets, springs) to reinforce the primary mirror cell. While collimation may hold while it\u0027s on the mount it goes off for sure while taking it down or putting it up. I already scratched a bit of paint while\u00A0clamping/unclamping and moving the OTA to find balance.. and by the way it is very well balanced and it\u0027s very light I needed just one counterweight and it is all way up on the bar, my mount is gonna be very happy I believe.\u00A0 Another thing that i noticed are light leaks from the back.. i had to put some black tape there and later on gaskets should do the job. So my verdict till now is that is sucks compared to my c11 but it may have potential. I have also read about chip illumination\u00A0problems with the GSO imaging newtonian but that was a 5 years old post and this is sold by TS so we\u0027ll see about that...anyway if true I will also need to move secondary and focuser further up on the tube and that will be a more\u00A0serious trouble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: So I did collimation for the first time ever, lol... and I was so scared about it. I will probably use the collimator on the SCT too and see what happens. I tried to slew the scope in various positions and the collimation didn\u0027t change as well it didn\u0027t change in a couple of hours of time.. .if think that is not so bad that little space between the tube and the mirror, it probably won\u0027t be affected by the metal tube shifting for temperature change. And the chip is fully illuminated.. so I can say that the telescope it\u0027s maybe good enough to do something interesting as it is.

In my case collimation must be done when the OTA is on the mount so it\u0027s basically impossible to have the gravity to assists you in putting the collimator perfectly horizontal in the focuser. So what i did was pushing the collimator very firmly against the focuser while locking it and after\u00A0leaving it be is quite easy to tell\u00A0if it moved or not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom what I could see, my favorite method is to\u00A0and loose all the screws/knobs of the primary a bit,\u00A0start with the secondary mirror, put the ray in the center of the primary, start aligning the primary by tightening the collimation screws until they are completely tightened and the scope alligned. Then a second round, recenter the ray into the primary\u00A0with the secondary screws, put the ray back into the center and then start tightening the locking screws of the primary\u00A0until collimation is reached and the screws tightened at max. Then a third round of collimation will require a minimal adjustment of the secondary and then the primary by a very-minimal loosening of the lock screws.

If you stretch (histogram gamma curve) a single dark or a single light frame, does it show stripes as well ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n43 Lights, 25 darks, no biases. Single frames are somewhat noisily with comma around the edges of the photos. Lights are fine.

I made a sort of cheshire drilling a hole on a old diagonal cover cap and I noticed a slight offset of the secondary.\u00A0While I was adjusting the screws I felt that one was very hard so I took some calipers.... and I ended up bending one arm a little.. fortunately and with enough obsession I managed to undo the bending, loose the screw and solve the offset of the secondary. So I did collimate the scope with the cheshire and did a counter test with the laser.. which seems to confirm the correct collimation only when the collimator\u0027s 45\u0027 inclined surface was parallel to the secondary mirror surface. \u00A0(\u00A0/ \u00A0 ----\u0026gt; \u00A0 / ). Could be high-precision or slight offset of the collimator, this I don\u0027t know, but I\u0027m happy I figured it out. Another thing to fix is a light leak from the focuser, I spent more than 1 hours trying to take darks but always seeing a leak, in the end I understood it was the focuser, where the locking screws are, that\u0027s normal I guess.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo overall I like the scope, the optics are good, the focuser is very good, the build is poor but from what I\u0027ve seen It holds collimation and I still have to improve that aspect by installing new springs, which of course I won\u0027t do until I find it necessary. Also a dew shield is incoming for protection from stray light.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLOL! I Just realized that I was 21,6 mm from the coma corrector and not 51,6!
