Multiple organizations have declared it their goal to enable it by 2100, we have serious attempts at testing both solar electric propulsion and solar sails underway, and some people at NASA are not getting fired despite spending their time and budget on researching warp drives and quantum thrusters. Nevermind the flurry of exoplanet discoveries lately. And, of course, fusion power is only 20 years away, as we all know. Cough, cough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOthers have said this is madness, we haven\u0027t even gone manned beyond lunar orbit yet, and some of the most tantalizing locations in our own solar systems have yet to be probed. Several nations and agencies (and even commercial companies) have firm intents to visit Moon, Mars or both of them in the near future, both robotic and manned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for myself, I like to ponder the step in between.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of you may have heard of 90377 Sedna, a trans-neptunian object about half the size of Pluto. This means we\u0027re not talking about a comet or asteroid here, but rather a distant dwarf planet. Of which our sun seems to have a surprising amount of, largely courtesy of Neptune which seems to have gone bowling with all the elegance of a drunken elephant and shot well over 40 of these fellas way out there. But Sedna is a little special: it doesn\u0027t really come close enough to Neptune to have been bowled around by it. In fact, Sedna\u0027s perihelion is more than twice that of Neptune\u0027s aphelion, meaning that it\u0027s impossible for Sedna to come closer to Neptune than Neptune\u0027s maximum possible distance from the sun. Sedna\u0027s own aphelion, meanwhile, sits at a comfortable 937 AU. For those that don\u0027t immediately grasp this utterly mind-boggling number, here\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/Sedna_orbit.svg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ean image showing Sedna\u0027s orbit\u003C/a\u003E compared to the rest of the solar system\u0027s planets (\u002BPluto).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis makes some people think that Sedna is not like the other dwarf planets and TNOs. They think it might be either a member of the Oort cloud - the only one we know of, so far - or that it was captured from interstellar space. Whatever it is, though, Sedna is thought to be one of the most scientifically valuable celestial objects currently known. What stories it might tell about its own origin and that of our solar system, we can only surmise. It bears tales from regions eight times as far from the sun as Voyager 1 has traveled... if not more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrough an incredible stroke of luck, Sedna is currently falling towards perihelion at a pace that seems almost deliberately set up to still give us time. It will reach its \u0022closest\u0022 point to the sun in 2076, at over 76.1 AU. Afterwards, it will swing out again, well beyond the Kuiper belt... and will not return to us for some \u003Cem\u003E11,400 years\u003C/em\u003E. This is literally a singular chance that the cosmos is begging us to grasp. If we miss that window, we will either have ceased to exist as a species by the time of its return, or we will have evolved to the point where we can visit it at any point on its orbit at our leisure (albeit hundreds, if not thousands of years later).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith an orbit as eccentric as that, Sedna will be screaming past us some scant 62 years from now at close to solar escape velocity, out at twice the distance of Pluto\u0027s orbit. By that moment in time, we would already have to be out there for the rendezvous. There will be no second chance, ever. So the question is... can we catch Sedna? And if so, how would we do it?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-04T15:05:17Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2014 03:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Horn Brain","CreatedById":49626,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T05:28:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think a New Horizons-style mission would be pretty easily within our grasp even now.

By the time we are ready to launch this mission, however, we will hopefully have some much more exciting options. Maybe we can send a nuclear electric driven craft out there with enough dv to actually orbit Sedna, or even bring a lander to examine the surface. The dv to return to Earth from Sedna would be something like 4 km/s - not actually too crazy when your Isp is 5000 s. I would think that a sample return would be a goal worth aiming for by this time.

I\u0027d say that for a unique opportunity as this, and the effort potentially required, a mere flyby isn\u0027t really proper. Landing and sample return would of course be sweet, but that would greatly complicate the mission. Already there are a number of technical challenges to be solved:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- At that distance from the sun, solar power doesn\u0027t exist.

No replacement is in the budget anytime soon, and the project to develop a newer, better RTG type was canned for budget reasons many years ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- At the same time, we\u0027ll be pretty much limited to electric propulsion for Isp and tech readiness reasons, so we need electric power. It\u0027ll likely have to come from a small brayton cycle fission reactor like the one proposed for the JIMO. Which doesn\u0027t exist yet either. Thankfully there\u0027s some time yet before such a mission would need to be launched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If we\u0027re going nuclear, we have some interesting propulsion options in development right now: Ad Astra\u0027s VF-200 magnetoplasma rocket is rated at 5N thrust, 5,000s specific impulse at 200kW power consumption. It can also be set to deliver more Isp at the expense of lower thrust (but I don\u0027t know it\u0027s limits or scaling behavior). Another option in roughly the same power envelope would be ESA\u0027s dual-stage 4-grid ion thruster, expected to consume 250kW of power to offer 2.5N thrust at nearly 20,000 Isp (!). Both of these engines have been tested in the lab already (the DS4G in a downsized prototype variant) and will probably be flight ready by the time we need them - maybe even succeeded by newer variants.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The systems on that probe would need to display Voyager levels of reliability, especially if there\u0027s a return planned in addition to the 20\u002B year one-way trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, I\u0027d say that the need to create a fission reactor suitable for mounting on a spacecraft is one of the biggest hurdles right now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SuperFastJellyfish","CreatedById":57985,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T15:48:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wonder what you would see when you look towards the Sun from Sedna when it is ~550 AU away.

Okay, it probably won\u0027t work out to that in space, since the first order approximation assumes flying in a straight line, which is obviously silly in space. But hey, even if it took twice as long, it should have the dV to make it - provided the reactor lives long enough. This isn\u0027t bad at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs mentioned before in post #3, we nowadays have propulsion technology significantly better than needing a 20-cluster for 2N of thrust at 3,000s Isp costing 40kW. Both the VASIMR and the DS4G blow these figures out of the water (although they require quite a bit more power). So giving it a couple extra decades of electric propulsion advances would more or less guarantee that propulsion technology is a non-issue. We could likely even do a realworld 6 year intercept by brute forcing it with whatever we have available then. This bodes well for larger science payloads and even for sample return. Heck, it might even allow for two missions - first a probe arriving a few years before perihelion, and then a return capable lander launched shortly after the probe arrival and itself arriving a few years after perihelion. An extra AU or two isn\u0027t going to break the bank if you can hit it that fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat leaves once again the reactor as the prime unknown, as I suspected. The SAFE-400 itself is too small (100kW) for a VASIMR (200kW) or DS4G (250kW), but a 1200 class variant (or a trio of 400\u0027s) should manage. Of course, that is 1.5 tons in reactor mass alone. Perfectly doable with the higher thust and Isp of the mentioned engines, but not entirely ideal. Additionally, the SAFE project isn\u0027t even all that serious (it\u0027s done on the side with leftover funds and volunteer hours of that particular lab). And then there\u0027s the concerns of lifetime, which I know nothing about. This just shows that we really need a more serious look into power production for deep space missions in the coming decades.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-06T11:36:29Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2014 11:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"indroth","CreatedById":115621,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-06T18:04:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHowever, considering how much larger Sedna\u0027s orbit is than that of earth, it would be fairly trivial to find a suitable launch window.

The Mars rovers have what, a few hundred kg of science instruments? Curiosity in total weighs just 900kg, including the heavy RTG, drive system and suspension, computers, batteries etc. If the nuclear reactor ends up at 1.5 tons, and an extra 500kg is provisioned for the VASIMR... I don\u0027t know how heavy the VF-200 is, but half a ton sounds quite generous. That leaves more than an entire Curiosity\u0027s worth of payload just for science and control systems. Very nice.

Not sure where they got that number from, but I do know that Sedna\u0027s size and mass hasn\u0027t been exactly determined. So let\u0027s give it a safety margin and provision a dedicated landing system with around 1000 m/s. The electric propulsion system won\u0027t be landing anything anywhere, and storing cryogenics for 10\u002B years is kind of an issue, so we\u0027ll assume hypergolic engines. ESA is currently developing a N2O4/MMH engine specified for 340s Isp, most others are around 320. Provisioning 1 ton of hypergolic propellant for a 3 ton spacecraft yields just over 900m/s with 320s Isp, or barely 960m/s with 340. That sounds reasonable; the entire spacecraft will be able to land, perform experiments/sample collection and take off again. Surely a few kg can be found in the mass budget for landing struts capable of handling a gravity not much in excess of that of Ceres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course that bumps the initial payload from 3 to 4 tons, and the tyranny of the rocket equation makes everything much heavier. And then the successfully orbiting spacecraft is stuck there with the surface samples because we don\u0027t have a return stage yet. I simplified and decided to have the entire spacecraft aldn and take off because I\u0027m not sure of the difficulty of performing a fully robotic orbital rendezvous and docking maneuver without human guidance (the communications lag will make interaction with the craft during docking utterly impossible). But potentially this approach might be preferrable, if it means we can leave the spacecraft with its heavy reactor and propulsion/fuel in orbit and just land something maybe the size/weight of a Mars rover. Likely not a rover itself, but rather something that will take off again after a couple weeks of surface science and re-dock with the spacecraft.

Thing is though, Sedna is crazy far away. Twice as far as Pluto at bare minimum. At that point, travel time becomes a significant factor, because you need an onboard fission reactor to drive the high powered electric propulsion necessary to take you there. And you cannot refuel that reactor in flight. You must complete the mission before the energy output drops too far from fuel poisoning by fission products. How much time a modern reactor like the SAFE-400 affords us, we don\u0027t know. But asking it to go 10-20 years one-way, and then possibly even come back, that\u0027s a very tall order.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny gravity assist you do means you\u0027re spending time not flying towards your destination. And if you\u0027re required to loop around the Sun, that can take a huge amount of time. Look at Rosetta, how it slingshotted itself into a trajectory similar to that of its target over 10 years without spending much in the way of fuel. A prime example of this strategy, and a prime example of exactly what will \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E work for Sedna. Not only is there no planetary body available to kick us into a similar orbit - even Neptune is closer to the Sun than it is to Sedna\u0027s perihelion - but Sedna has an orbital period of 11,400 years. Even an orbit a fraction of this size would last well beyond anything the spacecraft could support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mission will need a trajectory more akin to that of a cannonball shot at Sedna, not a graceful orbital ballet like Rosetta performed. Fly in a line as straight as possible, burning for years without pausing, then flipping over near the end and burning for another half eternity to slow down in time. On a trajectory like this, you can pick yourself one single target and slingshot around that. That\u0027s why Mr. Shifty pointed out that it\u0027s Jupiter\u0027s orbit that will determine the launch window. As the second heaviest object in the solar system by far, it really is the only sensible choice. Maybe, by sheer luck, Uranus or Neptune may line up on the way out to give another boost; but that\u0027s just a bonus, and it won\u0027t be nearly as helpful as a full-on slingshot that loops you around the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mr Shifty\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mr Shifty\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUsing Arrowstar\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022http://orbiter-forum.com/showthread.php?t=24053\u0026amp;highlight=trajectory\u002Boptimization\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETrajectory Optimization Tool\u003C/a\u003E for Orbiter, I was able to find a relatively low energy trajectory with a Jupiter assist.
