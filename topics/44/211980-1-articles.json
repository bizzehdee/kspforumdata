The liquid H2 keeps it cool enough that the kiloamps of current passing through the resistor heating elements do not melt it down, but I don\u0027t know how prone to arcing it is. You could control it well enough by limiting the electricity flowing and the amount of gas coming through for a great range of throttleability.
