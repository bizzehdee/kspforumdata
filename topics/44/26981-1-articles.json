If the closest distance from your pebble to your object is called x1, the point mass approach is only valid when x is approximately equal to x1, i.e. very far away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe correct way to solve this problem (in 1D) is to split up your long block into infinitesimal slices of a given density and then integrate over the possible values of x. Since your block has mass 2 and length 4, it has 0.5 mass per unit length. The problem you are then solving is the integral G\u00C3\u00C2/(x^2) between 4 and 2. -0.5G/4 \u002B 0.5G/2 = 1/4G.
