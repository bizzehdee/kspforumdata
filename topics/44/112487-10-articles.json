Most kitchen fluids have about the same density as water (or are close enough for kitchen applications), so if I do not have anything that measures volume I can use weight and vice versa. I know one litre of water weighs a kilo and measures 10x10x10 cm. The conversions are ridiculously easy.\n\nI can give you the volume of an egg by weighing it, and the weight by putting it in a measuring cup with some water with only a minor margin of error. Cups just as cups, on the other hand, come in all shapes and sizes and will produce a wild variety of results."},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T14:06:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Do all European households have a little electric food scales?
