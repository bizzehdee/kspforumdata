Much of it would come in the form of the aeroshells and the ascent vehicle (I didn\u0027t see what they would do with it, but I would imagine deorbit), but even so. It seems strange that for what would likely be several landings you\u0027d end up with over 3x that in debris crashed into the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously I can understand that the debris is more or less unavoidable as Constellation was designed, but I\u0027m curious as to what NASA\u0027s policy actually is in regards to debris when it comes to places like the Moon, Mars, etc. Do they actively minimize it? Do they try to control where it actually ends up so that potential science! isn\u0027t destroyed or otherwise inaccessible? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know during Apollo they initially ejected the S-IVB\u0027s out of the system and then moved towards turning them into impactors for seismic readings, so in that case I can see why the debris was acceptable.
