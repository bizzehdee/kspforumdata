As Showalter said, \u0022if you had an estate on Nix north\u0027s pole, you could suddenly find yourself at the south pole. You would never know when the Sun would rise and set: one day it could rise from the west and set on the north, and the following day it might not rise at all\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Nix \u0026amp; Hydra reflect 40% of the incoming light (did I hear that correctly?), so they\u0027re like dirty snowballs, whilst Kerberos is very different, as it reflects only 4% and is much more similar to charcoal. That suggests it could be a fragment produced during the Charon-forming collision, although \u0022that\u0027s just pure speculation\u0022, as Showalter said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- New Horizons should be safe: there is physically no space in between the moons to add any other objects in stable orbits. (although, if I may add, we already knew that, and the real hazard isn\u0027t an undiscovered moon, but rather a debris cloud/stream/material exchange between moons and Pluto)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Nix, Styx \u0026amp; Hydra are in an orbital resonance: \u0022If you were sitting on Nix, you would see that Styx orbits Pluto twice for every three orbits made by Hydra,\u0022 to quote Hamilton. Orbital resonances greatly prevent collisions (see Pluto itself and Neptune\u0027s resonance), so that\u0027s probably why a tiny world like Pluto has so many moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Refined sizes: Nix (35 x 16 miles), Kerberos (19 miles), Hydra (36x21 miles), Styx (too small to tell with Hubble\u0027s vision).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn animation of Nix\u0027s rotation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://media.giphy.com/media/3oEduKGeEjxtOD2IuI/giphy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022giphy.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-03T18:30:14Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2015 06:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Frida Space\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mitchz95","CreatedById":82292,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T20:33:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, that\u0027s really interesting.
