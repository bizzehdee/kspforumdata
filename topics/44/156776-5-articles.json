Take a look at the K2-3 system. The star is metal-poor, yet has a planet made of 90% iron. But the Trappist-1 system has planets on both sides of the scales while being just a tad more metal rich than Sol. The twin-like desert planets of 1b (Theros) and 1c (Auxo) are the two extremes in the system. Theros is the same density as Mars, which would imply a composition made of about 20% water. But with an atmosphere that could be similar to Venus\u0027 and with a temperature of 400*K, liquid water on Theros is close to impossible. So what options are left? How about no core at all! Theros is so close to Trappist-1 that tidal forces from the host star could\u0027ve prevented iron and silicates from differentiating, created a conglomerate interior where the two types of materials are mixed together. While Theros is the first coreless planet, Auxo is an Iron Planet. It\u0027s unusually high density for an Earth-sized planet points to a composition taken up by 50% iron and other metals. The planets\u0027 densities also imply about how much water they have. 1d (Thallo) also has a large iron core, taking up about 30% of its volume, hinting that water is not a dominant part of this world\u0027s composition. 1f and 1g have similar densities and are evidence for worlds covered in oceans. However, 1f (Irene) is about 1/4 water, while 1g (Carphos) is probably like a refrigerated Kamino - kinda cool with a thick ocean, but no thick enough where there\u0027s no reachable sea floor. Trappist-1e is the only world who has an internal composition nearly exactly like that of Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been hard at work revamping and re-doing the Trappist-1 system in KSP.

Anyways, I\u0027ve been creating custom height maps in Space Engine and using PQSMods and Kittopia to create color and normal maps. I have used NASA\u0027s renditions of the planets for major inspiration, as I\u0027m trying to make those designs with Kittopia. But I\u0027m also adding a few extra features - like forests on Thallo, because of its insanely high Earth Similarity Index of 0.90.

It is the least massive planet in the system (1h/Cheimon may be less massive), and many have argued that the planets likely don\u0027t have atmospheres. But what irks me is that Theros and Auxo are CONFIRMED to have atmospheres. On Star Wars Day 2016 (May 4th), Hubble was able to take spectroscopic observations of Trappist-1 as Theros and Auxo both transited at the same time. It discovered that both worlds have compact, terrestrial atmospheres, not huge hydrogen/helium envelopes. Theros having an atmosphere proves that the other planets - even Thallo - have some as well. Why? Because Theros has probably the least atmosphere-friendly environment in the whole system. It has the second-lowest gravitational pull (as far as we know) and is exposed to much more UV light and X-Rays than the other planets. If it can hold onto an atmosphere thick enough to be detected from Earth, than the other planets are likely to have some as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have to agree with what \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/81207-peadar1987/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002281207\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/81207-peadar1987/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@peadar1987\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0says about the planets having magnetic fields. Since they are so close to each other and the star, tidal friction would heat up their cores (if they have any) and provide a sloshing motion inside each world, generating a magnetosphere. The three likeliest planets to have such magnetic fields are Auxo, Thallo, and Eiar, as they have the largest cores in the system. Being tidally locked, they rotate every 2.422, 4.05, and 6.1 days, which may be fast enough to generate some convective motion without extra tidal heating. I wonder whether or not a strong magnetosphere would protect Thallo or make it undergo a huge(ish) greenhouse effect, similar to what happened with Venus and its magnetosphere. But it could be possible to tell with very faint radio waves coming from the planets as a sign of charged particles interacting with the fields.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"oguz","CreatedById":145037,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-25T02:05:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222966911\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022156776\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221487981821\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022168560\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022munlander1\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, munlander1 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/145037-oguz/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022145037\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/145037-oguz/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@oguz\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Neil Armstrong is not disappointed someone else named the moon.

Compared to the sun which gives off 502 nm light as its spectral peak (bluish-green, but looks yellow-white to us going through atmosphere and because emission from blue to red add up to white). Another way of looking at it is dividing the total luminosity of TRAPPIST-1 by its visible luminosity (\u003Cspan\u003E0.000525\u003C/span\u003E / 0.00000373) =\u00A0 140, this means that for a human standing on a world that gets the same amount of total light energy flux as here on the earth (a theoretical point between TRAPPIST-1d and\u00A0TRAPPIST-1e) would only see 1/140 as much light. \u003Cstrong\u003ESummary: these would be very dim worlds to us, full day light there would be the same a twilight to us and even more reddish.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInhabitants of the TRAPPIST-1 system would likely see into the IR, red light would likely be the furthest in visible light they could see or they would likely perceive all the colors we do simply as their hues of \u0022blue\u0022 and the other colors they would\u00A0perceive would be in the NIR.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBiochemically it would not be too hard for life to detect NIR, terrestrial life here on earth didn\u0027t probably because water absorbs NIR really well so aquatic life can\u0027t utilize it and because visible light is plentiful and stronger so why bother?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022WaterAbsorptionConstant.gif\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.thorlabs.com/images/TabImages/WaterAbsorptionConstant.gif\u0022 style=\u0022width:300px;height:auto;\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously that means aquatic life on TRAPPIST-1 is not going to see very well beyond 950 nm, this may hamper the chances there land life would see in NIR. Here on earth the mantis shrimps see 16 colors, many of which far into the UV, but it also sees further into the NIR, but only up to 750 nm. So either the land life of TRAPPIST system make do with seeing what they can off red light with big eyes that have little color distinction (like nocturnal life here on earth, or like the ancestors of mammals hence why most mammals only see 2 colors, red and blue and yellow sensitive rod cells only give them perception of light intensity rather than color), or they have evolved the ability to see deeper into the NIR unlike their aquatic ancestors. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Bigger problem is plants: Can photosynthesis utilize NIR?\u003C/strong\u003E The short answer is that in theory yes, but the efficiency of which would likely be much poorer. Here on earth water cracking, oxygen producing photosynthesis is what makes complex animal-intelligent life possible. Cracking water requires ~143 kj/mol to get 1/2 O2 and 2 H\u002B and 2 e- this converts to any photon of light below 837 nm has enough energy to crack water. In theory though it is perfectly possible to couple two photons of light of weaker energies to make up the difference (1674 nm), the problem is storing and adding up that photonic energy efficiently. We have done it artificially, but apparently no life on earth has evolved such a thing either because it is too hard biochemically or because visible light is plentiful enough or both. If using only the visible light an ecosystem in the TRAPPIST system would be 1/140th the size of our ecosystem per light input. If using NIR light as well the ecosystem potential is as high as earth life assuming the same photosynthetic efficiency, even a tenth the efficiency of earth life it would still be advantages to use NIR light compared to 0.7% efficiency of using only visible light from TRAPPIST-1. Again aquatic plants are not going to utilize NIR unless they are living in less than ~10 cm of water depth! Only land life would be most prone to evolve NIR photosynthesis. \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-26T20:24:26Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2017 08:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by RuBisCO\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-25T21:02:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222967655\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022156776\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221488054121\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002259540\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RuBisCO\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n41 minutes ago, RuBisCO said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbut apparently no life on earth has evolved such a thing either because it is too hard biochemically or because visible light is plentiful enough or both.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot necessarily.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll we know is that we have found no evidence that such a trait has appeared.
