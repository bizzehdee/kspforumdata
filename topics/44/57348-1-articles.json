According to the bank teller, Fry\u0027s original balance was $0.93, compounded at 2.5% for an undefined period for 1000 years, which gives him a current balance of $4.3 billion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust for fun, I decided to see if the creators actually bothered to make the numbers \u0022realistic\u0022 in the sense that the number of times compounded per year is a normal amount of money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did the math, but want somebody to check it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMATH: (by the way, \u0027tth root of (A)\u0027 is the same as \u0027A^(1/t)\u0027 in case the two t\u0027s in a row were confusing)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolving: A=p(1\u002Br)^nt for n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-tth root of (A)=p(1\u002Br)^n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-tth root of (A)/p=(1\u002Br)^n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-(log base 1\u002Br of (tth root of (A)))/p = n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I plug it all in to Wolfram Alpha as \u0022(log base (1\u002B0.025) of the one thousanth root of (4.3*10^9))/0.93\u0022, out pops 0.9659... which is probably close enough to 1 to count as it being yearly compounded if you ask me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T21:36:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESavings account compound on different terms, sometimes daily, sometimes yearly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E$0.93 with an APY of 2.5% for 1000 years:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompounded daily: 66 billion\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompounded yearly: 49 billion\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterestingly, things don\u0027t really start to snowball until more than halfway through the period.
