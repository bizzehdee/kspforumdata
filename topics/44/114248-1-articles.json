So 1/100th the air density means a force equivalent to 1/10th the velocity... that storm would have forces equal to about 40km/hour winds on Earth.... about 25 mph winds...\n\nGusty... but nothing catastrophic that is going to blow over a sitting rocket, and send stuff flying with enough force to impale a person\n\n#2) Perchlorates in the soil would likely cause lots of problems when trying to grow stuff\n\n#3) It shouldn\u0027t have been so hard to get water... it seems there is water ice not very far below the surface (as in... centimeters) in many places\n\nAnyone else got something to nitpick about the science of the novel?"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T13:53:28Z","Content":"Firstly there is already a sizeable [thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116406-The-Martian-by-Andy-Weir) for this.

I can\u0027t find any solid reference, but I seem to recall those great wind speeds only happen at higher lattitudes.\n\nYeah, but well, we dont know so much mars as earth, in earth we can have hurricanes of 350km/h, they are very rare, but happens.\n\nAnd you know how is this.. if in reality something is rare.. in movies happens all the time.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-26T20:59:20Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2015 08:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AngelLestat**"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T10:44:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I messed up the maths anyway. ISP doesn\u0027t matter,\n\nIt sure does. The change in dry mass needed will be less the higher Isp is.\n\nConsider a dry mass of 1.0, and a wet mass of 1.1. \n\nln 1.1/1 = 0.0953\n\nNow reduce dry mass by 10%\n\nLn 1.0/0.9 = 0.10536\n\nYou get .10536/.0953 = 10.5% more dV\n\nIf you needed 3,000 m/s, from a wet;dry mass of 1.1, your Isp would have to be pretty high \n\n3,000= 9.8\\* Isp \\* 0.0953 = 3211\n\nA 10% reduction in dry mass would get you ~337 m/s more\n\nNow if you had a much lower Isp, your wet mass may have been 10 tons, and your dry mass 2 tons.\n\nln 10/2 = 1.61\n\n3,000 = 9.8\\* Isp \\* 2.30\n\nIsp = 190 (ok, you can easily get better than this.. but anyway.\n\nNow, if you remove 10% of the dry mass, its now 9.8/1.8\n\nln 9.8/1.8 = 1.695\n\ndV difference = ln (10/1.8) / ln (10/2) = 1.053\n\nYou get 10.5% more dV if you reduce dry mass by 10% at an Isp of ~3200 (assuming original design specs were for 3km/s), but only 5.3% dV if you reduce dry mass by 10% at an Isp of ~190.\n\nAlso, it will be harder to reduce dry mass at lower Isps... because then more of the dry mass is tanks, and not things like seats and extra life support that you don\u0027t need because you\u0027re only sending 1 person, not a full crew.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Of course, if you just refuelled the descent stage, you effectively double your delta-V.\n\nNote really, because the descent stage would have had substantial aerobraking. All it would need is a deorbit burn, and then \u003C1,000 m/s for a retroburn because the parachutes being used are meant to be deployed at supersonic velocities.\n\nAlso, if they are using ISRU, it would likely already be in the design that the descent stage is refueled.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E in this case gravity and density doesn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t has nothing to do with wind speed. We already have the force that will be applied on the body (a 40km/h wind).\n\nGravity has nothing to do with the force of the wind, correct. Gravity does have to do with the force required to overcome friction, or to make something tip over.\n\nIf wind could push something along or tip it over at martian gravity, then it would take 2.66x the force to do the same thing in Earth gravity.\n\nSo the comparable \u0022Earth wind\u0022 must be stronger to tip something over or make it slide along the ground.\n\nThats why I\u0027m comparing a martian wind to a stronger wind on earth\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Also the OP takes that the martian atmosphere is 100 times less dense than earth, but nasa said it is only 61 times less dense (dont forget that is 95% co2)\n\u003E Mars atmosphere at surface, density: ~0.020 kg/m3\n\u003E \n\u003E Earth atmosphere at surface, density: 1.217 kg/m3\n\nThat\u0027s rather simplistic... as mars topology is more varied that Earth\u0027s. If you compare the bottom of Hellas planitis to the average, its about 2x the pressure... compare it to the top of olympus mons... whoah...\n\nAlso, atmospheric density at given pressure varies with temperature, and mars has a much larger surface temperature range than earth.\n\nCold air is denser than warm air. It gets \\*really\\* cold during martian nights. We should consider the density during martian days, near the equator.\n\nHere is the crater where this takes place in the story... far from the lowest spot on mars:\n\n![1535743_10103698477243783_7204504303837243009_n.jpg?oh=cf5c434d5b86965824b46e7fe8bc6345\u0026oe=55E86C3B](https://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/1535743_10103698477243783_7204504303837243009_n.jpg?oh=cf5c434d5b86965824b46e7fe8bc6345\u0026oe=55E86C3B)\n\nEven if it was 1/61 the density... instead of 1/100 -\u003E sqrt 100/61 = 1.28x the wind speed -\u003E 51km/h -\u003E \u003C32 mph wind force.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E But if a body does not touch the soil very often, then it does not lose inertia so often either.\n\nNo... but there is a very small area where there are objects to be blown around. Aside from there landing site... there is nothing else on the entire planet bigger than dust grains to get blown into them. If something 20 meters away comes loose, it won\u0027t have a lot of time to accelerate.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Rockets here on earth doest not take off with higher winds either, even a small change on angle of attack can cause severe dynamic pressure.\n\nEven more reason for them not to fly off during a dust storm, and leave the guy behind.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E if in reality something is rare.. in movies happens all the time.\n\nSo we can have another reason for the sudden abort... like a meteor shower... or him falling into a hole, \n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_lava_tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_lava_tube)\n\nmaybe he can fall into a tube, in the middle of a dust storm, and after the storm is over, they discover something is leaking on the MAV (may or may not even be related to the storm - a leaking seal, a line got hit by an object, or just moved around enough for a seal to become loose, or they wer doing something when the storm hit, and due to dust the thing didn\u0027t seal right... whatever).... and if they wait around too much (Oxidizer?) will have leaked, and they won\u0027t make orbit. So then they have to go then and there while the MAV can still make it... and they think the guy died anyway and because of the storm, they couldn\u0027t really tell where he disappeared.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T10:47:03Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 10:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerikBalm**"},{"CreatedByName":"Beowolf","CreatedById":48927,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T11:06:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Of course, if you just refuelled the descent stage, you effectively double your delta-V.\n\nI figured the descent stage had to be hydrazine-powered because LOX would boil off during the long trip."},{"CreatedByName":"peadar1987","CreatedById":81207,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T11:42:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It sure does.
