(but probably not the way you\u0026#039;re thinking)","CreatedByName":"Tripod27","CreatedById":68324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-24T07:16:50Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Tripod27","CreatedById":68324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-24T07:16:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMost people have thought of just using magnetic boots to walk around on space ships, with the boots sticking themselves to the metal floor like a really awkward substitute of gravity, but the idea is generally considered too clunky and uncomfortable, with steps taking a lot of effort or electromagnets powered by the wearer\u0027s suits being required. So I was wondering, what if you switch the idea around?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould it be possible to make the \u003Cem\u003Eceiling\u003C/em\u003E of the ship you\u0027re on have a relatively large magnetic field, and then wear clothing with magnetic plates in it that are set up to repel you from the ceiling, pushing you into the ground? I\u0027ve never really had a good idea of the power of magnets at range, other than the fact that they become ridiculously strong up close (which is why the mag-boots are frustrating to use) but I figured that the ceiling of a ship is a pretty big piece of metal, meaning it can be a pretty big magnet, whether it would be big enough to be useful without being too heavy, I have no idea. Obviously even if the ceiling worked, this would cause problems with any magnetic materials used within the ship and I have no idea if the magnetic plates worn in the clothing would have to be uncomfortably large for it to repel at decent ranges, but I figured I\u0027d throw the idea out and see if anyone else knows if it is or isn\u0027t a good idea or if it\u0027s even already been tried\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-24T07:37:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou know how gravity falls off with the square of the distance from the \u0022source?\u0022 Or electric fields? Well, magnetic fields don\u0027t do that. They\u0027re diploles, and thus their strength falls off with the \u003Cem\u003Ecube\u003C/em\u003E of the distance. So to have any real effect over the distance from the ceiling to your head, let alone the floor, is going to require some rediculously strong magnets. And strong magnetic fields play havoc with all kinds of stuff, even your body over the long term. Plus you have to ensure that the other magnets remain in opposition to the ceiling magnets, otherwise you\u0027ll flip over and get pulled into the ceiling. A magnet used for attraction can just pull on a piece of iron and the fields in the iron will automatically orient themselves in the correct way for attraction.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-24T07:40:20Z\u0022 title=\u002201/24/2015 07:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pincushionman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tripod27","CreatedById":68324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-24T08:22:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe thing you mentioned about the magnets in the suit getting turned around is a good point, because if the magnet\u0027s strong enough to repel at any reasonable distance, that means that it\u0027ll be very powerful when it comes to attraction, meaning that if you manage to get turned around at all (like laying down vertically or even just bending backwards) then the repulsive side will push even further away while the attractive side will pull up, meaning you\u0027ll end up being turned around pretty quickly and attracted to the massively strong magnet on the ceiling, which is getting stronger as you get closer, until you end up getting a good chunk of your body crushed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr if you\u0027re lucky, the stitching holding the plates in your suit fails before you get turned around and dragged up and they fly upwards dangerously close to your head as they go to the ceiling.
