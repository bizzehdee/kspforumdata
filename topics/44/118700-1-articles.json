Imagine a more peaceful Earth. This is due to one thing, virtual reality. Due to this, wars are never fought in reality. People don\u0027t die. Problems can be solved in games. How will wars work in this? Countries who fight in this game will have all their current technology. As the war progresses the tech they invent will be added into the game and supplied to their armies. Every time a soldier \u0022dies\u0022, he or her gets pulled out of the game and can not fight again until the next war, so that wars don\u0027t last forever. All current cities, countries, and continents exist to have a realistic geography. NPC civilians exist to make it more realistic. Every weapon can be used in the wars. Now the tech they use to fight this war is millions of millions of computers protected by the most secure anti-malware, anti-virus, anti-Trojan, anti anything bad really. The computers each country gets is dependent on their total army soldiers. The internet countries use will be the fastest fiber optic. The game they fight in will be as non buggy and glitchy as possible. All the laws of war are in effect. Do you think this is the solution for wars and peacekeeping?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-17T19:45:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERussia should challenge the US to a game of Quake.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vger","CreatedById":67603,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-17T19:46:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf such a thing were practical, long ago we would\u0027ve had kings deciding the fate of nations over a game of chess.
