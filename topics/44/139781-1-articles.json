As for why they haven\u0027t done any separate manned lunar missions, it\u0027s because everyone is hyping about Mars and life and Mars and water and Mars, and the Moon doesn\u0027t help that cause much. It can teach us how to live under low gravity, sure, but it\u0027s easier and less expensive to do that in Low Earth Orbit in a ring or something. Same goes for living sustainably. The only thing I can see us using the Moon for in the near future are mining operations for fusion plants (He-3) or tourism (historical sites, Earthview, etc.) I think that the Moon is going to have a largely tourism- and energy-based economy in the future, because it\u0027s close to Earth and material/population exchange between the two is relatively easy and much faster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-15T00:51:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPublic support.
