I understand different people do things differently. It will always be like that and we should accept that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am very much used to the metric system. Most people will be aware that this is very structured, making conversions easier. For fun, I started doing problems in imperial units. Even though I have some idea of what each one should roughly indicate (inches from construction shows, feet from feet, yards from watching football and miles from car shows) I find it utterly impossible to work with the system in a somewhat intuitive and efficient manner. I understand that it is very much a matter of what you are used to, but I can truly not imagine anyone would want to work with something like that voluntarily. I found myself seriously wondering whether this does not regularly lead to conversion problems and all sorts of mistakes and construction problems. I can imagine that processing units in computer systems can be a bit of a hassle too. However, I am simply not used to the system, so maybe all this is not a problem at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought it might be interesting to share what your experiences with the different systems are \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I am very curious about the implications of day to day use to the imperial system.

To whoever said that the imperial system is less confusing, because they don\u0027t look alike and therefore you have to remember all those prefixes, well I would advise that you check out all the measurements. It is one old cluster f*ck. Just look at feet for a second. You have the: International foot, US foot, Imperial foot and the pre-1959 foot (I kid you not.) Next to that we can also look at countries that use the foot in layman\u0027s language. That can vary anywhere from 274.1 mm to 349,2 mm. And I measured the 72 measurements they had on wikipedia. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a neat little test. Your foot is 314.858 mm and my foot is 287.0 mm, but both are feet are 1 foot. Where do we live?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the metric system you don\u0027t have to keep second guessing your values and converting this to that to there every 5 minutes. With the metric system, all you have to do is remember to use the right prefix. And if you are to lazy for that (and I most certainly am) you can just use x*10^y. That way you can keep the same prefix :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand (as I have been there) that if it is what you are used to, you don\u0027t want to change it. But I advise most people that still use imperial to try out metric at least once in daily life. You don\u0027t want to keep converting back to imperial, just keep with the metric and then you start to notice how easy it is. There are no 76 deviations of one measurement, just 1. And it is also nice that the lengths aren\u0027t based on arbitrary numbers. That they actually have meaning (or are in the process of obtaining one) that are based in physics and chemistry, making both subjects so much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-30T12:21:21Z\u0022 title=\u002212/30/2013 12:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Azivegu\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azivegu","CreatedById":50726,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T11:26:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ebtw, has anybody ever noticed that mileage is a really weird unit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ekm/l is really \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1*10^3m/1*10^-3m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10^3m/10^-3m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10^6m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E???\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eunit cancellation is weird...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-31T08:50:02Z\u0022 title=\u002212/31/2013 08:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 31, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Azivegu\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Efixed some values\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T11:39:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Brotoro\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Brotoro\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou wouldn\u0027t be doing anything as absurd as using 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day, or 7 days in a week would you?
