The bigger riddle though is what that \u0027double rim\u0027 on the right side of the planet is. Nobody really seems to know, initially it was even thought it might have been some sensor alignment problem, but that doesn\u0027t seem to be the case, it has shown up in several images and it seems to really be there. I think it has been suggested that it\u0027s a thin layer of Hydrogen, however, that shouldn\u0027t be there in such high quantities, and that doesn\u0027t explain why it\u0027s only seen on 1 side of the planet.

See I originally heard this riddle from my father when my age still measured in the single digits (that was some 4 decades ago), which is one of the reasons it caught my eye when it popped up again recently. My dad was a scientist himself (chemist) and always supported my curiosity for the various sciences, so he often came up with riddles like this to tickle my growing brain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe original riddle as he posed it to me way back then was a variation on the above, going something like: \u0022A bear walks 1 km South, ...\u0026lt;etc\u0026gt;... and ends up at the same place as where he started. What colour was the bear?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe answer of course is white, since it has to be a bear living near the poles. But polar bears only live at the North pole, not the South pole. So in the original version as I heard it, you had to figure out that the location was a pole, and that there was a bear there, so it had to be the North pole. By changing the riddle to not be about a bear, the infinite number of solutions around the South pole was created. Maybe this is why the press (at least as far as I\u0027ve seen) never comes up with the full correct answer. Perhaps along the way someone changed the wording of the riddle (removing the reference to the bear) without realizing this would change the valid answers. It\u0027s like a game of science-riddle-telephone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: to keep things simple, let\u0027s not get into the fact that polar bears are actually black skinned and the whiteness we see is just the effect of the light on their transparent hairs, that\u0027s another fun fact altogether \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E )\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-09-06T15:10:40Z\u0022 title=\u002209/06/2022 03:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 6, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Beamer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tomf","CreatedById":57809,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-09-06T18:23:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe whole polar bears are black thing is just people trying to appear superior by knowing something.

This means that it\u0027s transparent to thermal radiation as well as visible light.
