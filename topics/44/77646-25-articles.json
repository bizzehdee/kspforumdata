The requirements for such are minimal; assuming the CubeSat\u0027s is kept at a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius upon passing into the night side, has an aluminum exterior, and follows the roughly ninety-minute orbital cycle in LEO, only about 62 grams of water heated almost to boiling while in sunlight would be able to stave off heat loss entirely, while reducing cooling requirements. This is also the absolute worst-case scenario for the night side; I used the maximum values for aluminum emissivity and a probably unreasonably-low surface temperature for the cube.
