Even disconnected or debiased photovoltaic devices can be overwhelmed by photon flux, but if the structure (be it PN Junction, Barrier Junction, etc...) is designed to saturate at a point, you can prevent internal currents from burning out the device. I have seen cheap CMOS camera sensors get damaged when the sun entered their field of view, but I have seen more expensive sensors that weren\u0027t affected by it at all.

Having too much energy applied all at once will cause that photon to be lost as heat mainly. So even though you have shielded the PV panel from the heat, applying too much high frequency (and thus high energy) light will overheat your cell by itself. At least that is what my knowledge of solar cells would lead me to believe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut like K^2 and VirtualCLD said, an ideal cell is basically a diode capable of passing a constant current, so if you were able to cool your solar cell you would reach a maximum current of Isc by connecting the terminals or a maximum voltage Voc by simply applying light. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good site for studying PV cells is \u003Ca href=\u0022http://pveducation.org/pvcdrom/solar-cell-operation/solar-cell-structure\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis one\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-31T17:11:47Z\u0022 title=\u002201/31/2014 05:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 31, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by TheSandDuna\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-31T03:47:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eim pretty sure you can use them in such intense light that they would fail to ablation of material from the surface. but so long as you limit the current (and you can just use a resistor for that) they shouldnt burn out due to pushing too much current through them. a panel is really an array of smaller units, use a row of cells in series till you get a voltage that you want, then connect a bunch of rows in parallel till you get the current you want. then just keep the sun on it. put the output through a switch mode supply and onto the mains.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-31T03:52:45Z\u0022 title=\u002201/31/2014 03:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 31, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Nuke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Idobox","CreatedById":80299,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-31T17:42:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you shine ionizing radiation to solar cell, you could also cause damage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHigh energy photons like X-Ray and gamma can ionize several atoms in a row, or even knock some atoms out of the lattice.
