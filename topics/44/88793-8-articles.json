Just looked at some \u0022schematics\u0022 of a turbopump, and they seem decently fragile (relatively). On the other hand, in the HQ version of the launch, you can actually hear something properly pop. As i said, that pop, \u003Cem\u003Eif\u003C/em\u003E it was on the turbopump, should\u0027ve taken it out in my mind. Not to mention that a kerosine-leakage (or LOX, i\u0027m too dumb to figure out which of the pumps it was) would be visible, wouldn\u0027t it? You actually would see leakage/flames?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing that makes me wonder about the pump though, apart from the obvious thing that the rocket actually lifted pretty well to a certain degree - roughly 0.5 seconds before the antares exploded, there\u0027s a considerable jolt in the rocket, and the exhaustflame changes color/form. From light blueish to glaring golden (and it doesn\u0027t look like a blowtorch, but a flamethrower at that point). Couldn\u0027t that be due to a nozzel problem?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, i\u0027m the most basic layman there is, trying to wrap his head around things. Coming to think of it, the \u0022jolt\u0022 and colorchange could be because of a fuel not being injected but just burned \u0022on the outside\u0022 (english isn\u0027t my native language, i hope i made that point at least nearly understandable), no?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: nevermind. After watching the HQ version over and over, i\u0027m pretty sure it wasn\u0027t a turbopump blowing up. In the HQ version, if you look closely, you see/hear the pop, and something drops off (one of the tubes/cables). Also there appears to be darker smoke (can\u0027t tell if black, but not white). Now i don\u0027t know if those tubes would be \u0022popped off\u0022 via small explosive bolts or something (but i bet somebody here can help me there), but it certainly looks like it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-29T04:36:42Z\u0022 title=\u002210/29/2014 04:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by m4inbrain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Progressm","CreatedById":80659,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T04:30:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm.
