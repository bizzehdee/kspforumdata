A recent study utilizes a supercomputer to simulate X-ray production and behavior along the accretion disk of a black hole. Yes, a simulation, and it actually incorporates General Relativity...like...wow...how about that? This basically means, one day, we may be able to have games/simulations on desktop computers, than can actually handle realistic near-luminal spaceflight, without having to \u0022fake\u0022 it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Go7t2O4RlMA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rodion_herrera","CreatedById":66284,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-15T19:27:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOuch sorry, someone already posted about it...mods, I apologize for not reading right away, please close.
