I was wondering if LADEE\u0027s impact generated some moon-quake or something like that. A few considerations:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) LADEE had a mass of 383 kg and impacted the moon at 1700 m/s. If my calculations are correct, the kinetic energy released would be of about 553,435,000 J. On Earth, it would be just less than a 3 Richter magnitudine earthquake. Would it be the same on the moon, or would it be more/less powerful?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The impact occured on the far side of the moon for safety reasons. All of the Apollo seismographs lie on the opposite side. Do you think they could have registred a quake of some sort?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, something similar happened with Apollo 13\u0027s third stage, which crashed just 134 km from Apollo 12\u0027s seismograph. According to my calculations, the energy released was about 81 times the one of LADEE. Being so powerful and so close, the seismographs recorded something like a 3-hour-long moonquake, if I recall correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was also wondering what calculation is needed in order to determine the duration of the quake. Thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-30T20:55:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Apollo seismographs were all deactivated in 1977.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frida Space","CreatedById":60943,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-30T21:56:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kryten\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kryten\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe Apollo seismographs were all deactivated in 1977.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!

The moon also has a lower density so the energy wouldn\u0027t be able to move through the ground as easily. Just a guess though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
