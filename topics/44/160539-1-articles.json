They think it\u0027s the hormones and their argument was that the youth \u0022back in their days\u0022 (\u0026lt;- about 30 years ago) wasn\u0027t as tall as it is now. Now, because I live in Poland (which is a post-communist country) I made a connection with North Korea, where people live in much harder conditions and don\u0027t eat as much as they should, therefore, their average height has decreased (by about 8cm according to BBC website) since the peninsula got split by the DMZ.

In Jamestown, British American colonialists had the same basic statistics (height, weight, lifespan) as their European counterparts. By 1625, these statistics changed. Average lifespan of a man (in Jamestown) was 37, height was 5\u00273\u0022 ( 1.6002 m), and weighed about 128 pounds (58.05 Kg). Their European counterparts had a lifespan of 48, height and weight was roughly the same. By 1700, this shifted again - the American colonial average lifespan was 59 years, height was 5\u00277\u0022 (1.7018 m) and weight was roughly 145 pounds (65.77 Kg) while the average European male remained basically unchanged since 1625.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy were British Americans so much larger than their European counterparts? Diet. The American diet was rich in proteins, natural fibers from fresh fruits and vegetables, and very little grain-based foods (until around 1750). The European diet (for the average person, not the aristocracy or nobility) was high in fats, low in proteins, but high in grains. This was because hunting was considered as illegal, meat (such as chicken and pork) were expensive.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s been extensive research into the physical difference between British Americans and their British counterparts between 1625 and 1776.

On a short term variations in body height in local populations are caused by nutrition especially in the growth phase (too late for me :-)).

Isotopes from bones give hints to state of nutrition, their size indices are a hint to body height. Over longer term and across different populations there is of course a genetic base as well.

I pretty much doubt you can go to NK, store and buy comparatively wide array of products that you can find in any not - NK supermarket. Bananas, citrus fruits, grapes, coffee and countless other items we take for granted, all come from countries that do not trade with NK. Seasonal variety counts too: during winter you can only grow so much vegetables in climate - controlled greenhouses. Iif you want them widely available to help your population stay well fed and healthy, you must buy the rest from warmer countries, that can grow them year - round.
