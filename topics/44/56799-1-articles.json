Sucks Ive had been looking forward to this since the launch last month. Now i read about the cooling loop issue on the ISS when it first happened, but never thought to check up on the status of this launch and sure enough...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAt NASA\u0027s direction we have postponed the launch of our commercial cargo resupply mission to the International Space Station that was scheduled to occur on December 19, 2013 while the space agency proceeds with a series of spacewalks to replace a faulty pump module on the space station. The Antares rocket that is currently on the launch pad at Wallops Island, Virginia will be returned to a horizontal position and transported back to the Horizontal Integration Facility (HIF). At the HIF, the Antares payload fairing will be removed to allow the Cygnus team to open the payload module hatch and remove time-critical payloads for safekeeping until the next launch attempt, which will occur no earlier than mid-January.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.orbital.com/NewsInfo/MissionUpdates/Orb-1/MissionUpdate/index.shtml\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.orbital.com/NewsInfo/MissionUpdates/Orb-1/MissionUpdate/index.shtml\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts ashame this busted up my plans for tomorrow night lol. This is the first thing Ive read that\u0027s been significantly affected by the ISS issue. Have any other launches been canceled? I hope those EVA\u0027s go well.. and i hope the other pump doesn\u0027t shut down. How old are these things? Id think they would replace both just in case.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-19T03:47:46Z\u0022 title=\u002212/19/2013 03:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedKosmos","CreatedById":72690,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T03:55:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe russians are setting up the cameras for the spacewalk, cant remember who is doing the actual repairing.
