are a number of ways SpaceX could improve the efficiency of their plan:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(1) \u00A0Use a dedicated, reusable\u00A0lander instead of taking the ITS all the way from LEO to the surface of Mars, and back again, each mission. \u00A0This way the ITS won\u0027t need to carry enough fuel to both make it to Low Mars Orbit from the surface AND return to Earth in a single stage (the lander should carry crew down to the surface on each trip, and fuel back up to the ITS. \u00A0Possibly these two functions could be seperated into different specialized landers for each task to obtain greater efficiency.) \u00A0The lander or landers would transfer fuel to the ITS after each ascent, in a similar manner to the tanker refueling the ITS in LEO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAside from reducing the Delta-V the ITS needs to carry and\u00A0allowing the ITS to avoid the need to carry as much heatshielding \u00A0(the presentation by Musk shows that the most difficult re-entry with the most maximum G\u0027s will actually be on Mars, not Earth) this also benefits from the fact that smaller vessels have lower ballistic coefficients due to the Square-Cube Law (so the lander should experience fewer maximum G\u0027s during Mars re-entry), and avoids the need to accelerate any empty tank-mass (originally used to hold the fuel for Mars ascent)\u00A0from Low Mars Orbit back to Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(2) \u00A0Send the cargo seperately from the crew. \u00A0This will allow them to\u00A0to shrink the MCT and use\u00A0a smaller booster instead of a 42-engine behemoth, thus increasing their\u00A0launch-volume. \u00A0The closer you get to mass-producing your rockets and keeping your launchpads in constant use, the better your economics...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(3) \u00A0Send the cargo a transfer-window ahead of the crew, on a slower trajectory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe know the ITS\u00A0is already capable of a minimum of 5.4 km/s in order to finish its orbital insertion after booster separation, and most estimates put the transfer trajectory at about 6 km/s based on the 3-5 month table in Elon\u0027s presentation, plus they must have\u00A0additional Delta-V for orbital circularization after aerocapture ,and landing...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the determining\u00A0factor on the size of the spacecraft fuel tanks is the Delta-V needed for Mars insertion, capture, and landing- not for initial LEO insertion... \u00A0This means that if you developed a cargo-only variant of the ITS you could increase its payload, and send it on a slower transfer (we already know the launch stage is capable of handling a heavier upper stage than the crewed ITS, since the tanker variant weighs about 25 tons more on the launchpad...) since you wouldn\u0027t need as much Delta-V for TMI.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe slowest Mars transfers\u00A0possible take about 16-18 months and 3.1 km/s (minus gravity-assists from the Moon), so there\u0027s certainly room in the Delta-V budget for extra cargo, especially if you\u0027re willing to not return the cargo-only ITS to Earth for reloading until the NEXT transfer-window (transfer windows come every 26 months, \u00A0so otherwise you probably wouldn\u0027t want to take longer than about 7-8\u00A0months getting to Mars\u00A0so you\u0027d have plenty of time to unload cargo, head back to Earth a good\u00A0bit past the transfer-window, and load more cargo before the next transfer window...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime

reusable\u00A0lander instead of taking the ITS all the way from LEO to the surface of Mars, and back again, each mission. \u00A0This way the ITS won\u0027t need to carry enough fuel to both make it to Low Mars Orbit from the surface AND return to Earth in a single stage (the lander should carry crew down to the surface on each trip, and fuel back up to the ITS. \u00A0Possibly these two functions could be seperated into different specialized landers for each task to obtain greater efficiency.) \u00A0The lander or landers would transfer fuel to the ITS after each ascent, in a similar manner to the tanker refueling the ITS in LEO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAside from reducing the Delta-V the ITS needs to carry and\u00A0allowing the ITS to avoid the need to carry as much heatshielding \u00A0(the presentation by Musk shows that the most difficult re-entry with the most maximum G\u0027s will actually be on Mars, not Earth) this also benefits from the fact that smaller vessels have lower ballistic coefficients due to the Square-Cube Law (so the lander should experience fewer maximum G\u0027s during Mars re-entry), and avoids the need to accelerate any empty tank-mass (originally used to hold the fuel for Mars ascent)\u00A0from Low Mars Orbit back to Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(2) \u00A0Send the cargo seperately from the crew. \u00A0This will allow them to\u00A0to shrink the MCT and use\u00A0a smaller booster instead of a 42-engine behemoth, thus increasing their\u00A0launch-volume. \u00A0The closer you get to mass-producing your rockets and keeping your launchpads in constant use, the better your economics...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(3) \u00A0Send the cargo a transfer-window ahead of the crew, on a slower trajectory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe know the ITS\u00A0is already capable of a minimum of 5.4 km/s in order to finish its orbital insertion after booster separation, and most estimates put the transfer trajectory at about 6 km/s based on the 3-5 month table in Elon\u0027s presentation, plus they must have\u00A0additional Delta-V for orbital circularization after aerocapture ,and landing...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the determining\u00A0factor on the size of the spacecraft fuel tanks is the Delta-V needed for Mars insertion, capture, and landing- not for initial LEO insertion... \u00A0This means that if you developed a cargo-only variant of the ITS you could increase its payload, and send it on a slower transfer (we already know the launch stage is capable of handling a heavier upper stage than the crewed ITS, since the tanker variant weighs about 25 tons more on the launchpad...) since you wouldn\u0027t need as much Delta-V for TMI.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe slowest Mars transfers\u00A0possible take about 16-18 months and 3.1 km/s (minus gravity-assists from the Moon), so there\u0027s certainly room in the Delta-V budget for extra cargo, especially if you\u0027re willing to not return the cargo-only ITS to Earth for reloading until the NEXT transfer-window (transfer windows come every 26 months, \u00A0so otherwise you probably wouldn\u0027t want to take longer than about 7-8\u00A0months getting to Mars\u00A0so you\u0027d have plenty of time to unload cargo, head back to Earth a good\u00A0bit past the transfer-window, and load more cargo before the next transfer window...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRe-quoting because this got buried under newer posts surprisingly\u00A0quickly, \u00A0and my final list is actually to be about 5 or 6 items long. \u00A0Here\u0027s #4:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(4) \u00A0Instead of designing the ITS as a Mars transit vehicle that is responsible for supporting the crew all the way to the surface of Mars (or LMO if a dedicated lander were utilized instead of the plan Musk presented), design it as an interceptor-ship to meet up with an Aldrin\u00A0Cycler Ship to Mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe design for a good\u00A0interceptor is basically the same- a big spacecraft with a lot of Delta-V and a large crew capacity, which you can get to LEO by using it as its own upper-stage stage and refueling it in LEO before proceeding further. \u00A0 But instead of carrying lots of\u00A0living space for each crew member sufficient to last months, it should pack the crew in like sardines and only have enough life support for a few days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the Cycler ship swings by Earth, the interceptor ship would speed up to match velocity, and should easily be able to rendezvous within a few hours (although stretching that out to closer to 24 might reduce fuel consumption).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crew would then transfer over to the Cycler Ship (which would be about the mass\u00A0of the current ITS on the launchpad, but with slightly\u00A0more of that mass dedicated to crew accommodations and life support,\u00A0since it wouldn\u0027t need a heatshield or landing equipment, and it takes about the same mass to reach a Cycler Orbit as it does to make a 3-5 month transfer to Mars. \u00A0In fact, Musk may have selected the current trajectory-time for the ITS since it is almost exactly right to turn into a Cycler Orbit with a small course-correction and make a free return to Earth as a possible emergency abort-option...) and remain on the Cycler until shortly before passing by Mars. \u00A0At this point, they would board the interceptor again, and make a course-correction to aerocapture at Mars...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn interceptor-ship version of the ITS would obviously be a lot lighter than the current ITS due to its much more draconian crew accommodations. \u00A0The extra mass freed up that the booster is capable of lifting\u00A0could be used in a variety of ways, but the most useful to me would seem to be launching with full,\u00A0somewhat\u00A0larger fuel tanks (in its current form, the ITS launches with only a partial fuel-load,\u00A0since it would be too heavy for the booster if it launched fully-fueled).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would mean the ITS would reach orbit with fuel to spare, and reduce the number of tanker launches necessary to fully refuel it for its Mars injection-\u00A0thus saving money. \u00A0I would advocate shrinking the booster and fuel tanks and sticking with the current strategy of partially-loading and completely refueling instead, but the booster ought to be kept its current size to allow for the Cycler Ship to launch atop it the same way the ITS would (as the Cycler Ship would require about the same booster nominal capacity\u00A0as the current ITS, though the redesigned ITS would have a lower dry mass...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe transit-time to Mars on a Cycler Orbit is 146 days- almost *exactly* the same voyage and Delta-V as the 3-5 month journey the ITS is designed for. \u00A0In fact, when the Earth-Mars distance is such that the current ITS would make a 5-month journey, the only real difference between the current ITS trajectory and that of a Cycler Ship is that you intentionally miss Mars by a bit, so that its gravity doesn\u0027t change your orbital period too much...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimilarly, a Cycler Ship only needs to support crew for 5 months (the short leg of its orbit). \u00A0So the necessary crew accommodations\u00A0would be almost identical to the current ITS- except that not needing a heatshield or to carry any fuel aboard for a Mars capture or surface landing would give you a bit more mass to play around with for things like better radiation-shielding, a small greenhouse to reduce the demands on the life-support system and provide fresh food to improve crew morale, solar sails to reduce fuel consumption needed\u00A0for\u00A0station-keeping and small course-corrections, and even MORE crew living-space than you find in Musk\u0027s current ITS design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRealizing that the Delta-V needed to establish a Cycler Orbit, and the Delta-V needed for a 5 month Mars journey like in Musk\u0027s current plan are almost IDENTICAL kind of struck me dumb. \u00A0It\u0027s like finding a Christmas gift you missed opening-\u00A0in June.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt basically means that if Elon Musk wanted to switch to a Cycler Ship type mission-plan, he wouldn\u0027t even have to throw out the ITS design he is presumably already working on at SpaceX. \u00A0The company could just use THAT design, with its luxurious crew accommodations, as the Cycler Ship (ideally they\u0027d still shrink the fuel tanks a bit, remove the heatshield, lughten the structural reinforcement needed for re-entry and landing, and rededicate that mass to other things- but they wouldn\u0027t have to), and design another version of the ITS as an interceptor-ship with greatly reduced crew accommodations and slightly larger fuel tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth could launch atop the current behemoth booster design, and the only real change to their launch cycle would be an extra launch in the second transfer-window for the Cycler Ship (the current launch schedule calls for the launch of a cargo-only ITS a window ahead ofvthe first frewed mission to land the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E and test the design for safety/reliability). \u00A0The first time around they send crew to Mars they could even dock the interceptor and cycler-ship\u00A0together BEFORE their Mars injection in order to save fuel vs. a rendezvous is solar orbit... (they\u0027d even be able to fire their engines together with a bit of differential throttling between the two, since they\u0027d have very similar masses and probably even shapes when both fully-fueled).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003ERegards,\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003ENorthstar\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-30T17:24:09Z\u0022 title=\u002209/30/2016 05:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-30T17:24:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHopefully these little things will be done as steps.
