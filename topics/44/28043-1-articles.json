Now, I have a Basic (REALLY BASIC) understanding of Physics, math, space flight, and most of all science, as I prefer Biology and Geology to math and Physics. My argument was that it\u0027s impossible to do because you could never get enough energy (With the human race\u0027s current understanding of physics as I know it) to create the velocity needed to \u0022escape\u0022 the universe.

However these other alien universes with its own set of constants will have it\u0027s own laws of physics that are internally consistent and may give rise to intelligence, just not in ways familiar to us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo with these bubbles floating around they sometimes collide into each other to have two bubbles join together to form one bubble, and converse sometimes one bubble will split into two. Each of these kind of event is a big bang that generates a new universe. Each big bang scrambles the constants at random to generate a new universe with entirely new laws of physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur physics so far can only probe at the laws of physics within our own universe. We kinda sorta have a theory now (the Standard Model) which explains what causes 3 of the 4 fundamental forces of our universe. Once this theory is complete the next step will be a Theory of Everything which unifies gravity with the other three forces to arrive at a model that explains all interaction within our universe. But to understand the multiverse requires a theory even further than a Theory of Everything. An even more fundamental theory that explains how physics came to be and what governs the interactions between universes and how their physical constants are generated. We need to be armed with this theory before we can figure out a way to go to other universes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it\u0027s not simply about going faster than the speed of light or hopping on a ship and go through a wormhole. When you actually go to a different universe there\u0027s no telling what the speed of light will be on the other hand and how matters will exist. It could well be intelligence in a different universe can only exist in incorporeal ghost like forms, in which case going there is going to involve destroying our form in this universe and rebuilding a new, comparable form in the new universe according to the laws of physics over there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis about sums it up in it\u0027s entirety. However, keep in mind it\u0027s only one hypothesis out of many. Example, some believe the bubbles and the space between are expanding, meaning no bubbles will ever touch. Big bangs happening randomly like lightning. Leaving the universe is not a good idea unless we where able to some how locate the ones that had the same physics and such. They know there is only a set amount of constants, which means our set of rules will apply to many universes. It\u0027s just a matter of finding them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, that hypothesis I brought with an ever expanding space between universes might pose a serious problem and may make it literally impossible to travel to another universe, let alone leave ours.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Jedi Master","CreatedById":57348,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T17:45:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo. You would have to go many octotrillions times the speed of light, maybe even more.

Today the universe is typically defined as everything that is naturally observable. That is to say it is everything that we are capable of getting information from through observation. I think the first definition by Miriam Webster says \u0022the whole body of things and phenomena observed or postulated.\u0022 Oxford says \u0022all existing matter and space considered as a whole; the cosmos. The universe is believed to be at least 10 billion light years in diameter and contains a vast number of galaxies; it has been expanding since its creation in the Big Bang about 13 billion years ago.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if we go with that common definition, then any \u0022universe\u0022 that we could possibly observe or go to is really just an extension of our own universe. Even the idea of multiple universes gets a wrench thrown in it because of this. If we were ever able to definitively show through observation or experimentation that there is another universe beyond our own, which would be required for it to be a scientifically valid idea and not some form of metaphysics, then by definition it would be part of our own universe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow if you want to go with a different definition for a universe that is fine, but for that matter we could also just define anything warmer than absolute 0 as a plasma and throw out everything else. Such definitions can not be totally arbitrary, there needs to be a good scientific reason to make such a definition. So in response to the OP: No. You cannot escape the universe. Because if you ever left the physical 4d space that our universe occupies, you would be somewhere that is observable and obviously connected to our universe somehow (you got there did you not?), and thus it would be included in our own universe. It is kind of a catch 22 if you ask me.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-24T18:32:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2013 06:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by PringleMan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
