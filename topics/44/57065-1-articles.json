Someone had mentioned this discovery to me, but I had never seen any news on it myself, so I\u0027m glad I finally got to see a story on it. Pretty incredible that it all packs into 1 AU. This system seems too tightly packed and unstable, and if I had to bet, it will be losing some of its planets over the coming eons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat article is kind lame in that it doesn\u0027t mention what the star\u0027s characteristics are, unless I totally missed it twice.
