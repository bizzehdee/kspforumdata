Let\u0027s face it, as it stands now, computers are on a set path to outmatch man in everything from efficiency to capability to intelligence. Given the possibility of a technological singularity occurring, humanity may well be on the fast track to becoming obsolete in the wake of artificial intelligence. Let\u0027s look at reality here: Over the next century, about 8 in every 10 jobs will be replaced by mechanized workers. Most of these are in the military sector: Pilots, crew, infantry. In the private sector we have similar chop-block industries: vehicle operators (boats/planes/trains), clerks and other defining service-based duties. It\u0027s not that people can\u0027t do these things well, it\u0027s that machines can do it better at no pay, no sick days, 24/7, and they never cause arguments or fights. They\u0027re also faster - in the case of the military a drone air superiority aircraft can handle dozens the magnitude of G forces a human can. An automated system for trains will never miss a red signal and cause a train crash, and the assembly line machine doesn\u0027t need health insurance, retirement, or 3 weeks of leave every year. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf mechanized workers were to hit a technological singularity, they\u0027d also be able to invent and design better computers and buildings and technologies than our best scholars, with one computer matching the entire processing power of the entire human race.
