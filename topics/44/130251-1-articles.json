If the arc reactor can send muons through some sort of fiber-optic cable or superconducting magnetic channel (do muons have a magnetic moment?), then it can control (on a particle statistics basis, not on an individual basis) where those muons decay. A sufficiently intense stream of decaying muons would add a great deal of energy to air or even ionize the air,\u00A0apart from the Cherenkov radiation. This could explain how he can appear to violate conservation of momentum (e.g., hitting someone with a ton of force while not appearing to physically move himself); he can fire a highly energetic but low-impulse beam of muons which then decay and release their energy into a much larger mass of air just in front of their target. Alternately, the muons can be timed to decay just outside the repulsor, producing a wave of ionized air that pushes against the repulsor to produce thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222575008\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022130251\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462973644\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022164013\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Razorstrike\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n23 minutes ago, Razorstrike said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nactually there is cuz if the no way of telling the suit\u0027s power then y would marvel make the movie\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause most people will go see a movie if it looks cool without caring about whether the science works?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-11T13:57:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2016 01:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by sevenperforce\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-11T14:00:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince most main points have been covered, I\u0027ll go for whats left.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLets say you do have a hyper-compact power source and reactionless, hyper-compact thrusters and the ultra-strong, ultra-light alloys and the sentient AI program running it all.
