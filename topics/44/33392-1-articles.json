You also generally don\u0027t want heavier elements in your fuel because a high exhaust speed is more efficient, and lighter molecules give you higher exhaust speeds.

This has everything to do with the formation of aluminium oxide. We utilize it as a propellent not just because it\u0027s flammable, but because it has a MASSIVE enthalpy of formation, \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0H_\u00C3\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u2122. That is, when we form aluminium oxide from pure aluminium, the process of forming the product releases a whole lot of energy. Uranium was mentioned in previous pages as a propellent, but its efficiency and I_sp would be mitigated due to its intense mass and the fact that its enthalpy of formation is weaker than that of aluminium by several hundred kJ/mol. With that being said, using aluminium allows for a lighter fuel that releases more energy than would uranium. I really can\u0027t understate just how heavy and dense uranium is. Consider that you average golf ball weighs just over one and a half ounces. That same gold ball made out of uranium would weigh just over one and a half pounds. If we use a heavier material to generate thrust, we subsequently increase the amount of thrust needed to propel the rocket. By using a lighter material, we can produce that same amount of thrust and use the saved weight towards a spacecraft rather than fuel weight compensation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was mentioned that aluminium may, \u0022react violently\u0022. That\u0027s precisely what you want when making a rocket engine. A lightweight substance that combusts/oxidizes predictably. Remember that essentially, all rocket engines are doing is regulating a controlled explosion. (Which is why they\u0027re extremely dangerous to fly and operate.) You want your fuel to produce a violent reaction for thrust while maintaining a predictable nature. While other materials can be used, we should also think about that cost of those materials. Aluminium is hands-down one of the single most abundant elements on the planet. It also happens to make a decent rocket fuel. Think about it like this. You would be paying 90% more money for a 10% (or less) increase in propulsion/efficiency. The cost-benefit ratio tips towards the cheaper material.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"falofonos","CreatedById":57821,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-28T15:50:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAluminium reacts enthusiastically and exothermically when given the chance.
