It would be designed get out of such situations.\n\nWell, so would an unmanned rover. I\u0027m also betting that part of thy \u0022design to get out of such situations\u0022 will involve not driving too fast ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You should look at the speed part as getting things done now instead of 30 years down the road. Give me one example, besides robotic space exploration, where such an approach is acceptable.\n\nWell, most research takes time. Large fusion projects like ITER or things like LHC take decades to accomplish. We accept that.\n\nAnd what\u0027s wrong with getting things done in 30 years? Is there a race on? Is Mars going to vanish in 30 years? Are the geological processes that take millions of years going to suddenly stop any time soon?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The reason why we don\u0027t have fast driving robotic rovers on Mars is safety, you don\u0027t want it to tip over, run in a ditch, break something, etc. Time delay is an important factor here as you can\u0027t intervene in something which happened 14 minutes ago.\n\nNot only safety. It\u0027s mainly about power consumption (the faster you go, the more power you need, and that is an exponential curve). The power available to Curiosity or the MERs is tiny. Solar power is limited on Mars, and RTGs are designed to produce a low output over a long time. It\u0027s also because speed is simply not needed. It would actually be detrimental, because you would miss a lot of details if you were going faster. \n\n\u003E What are you envisioning what a Robonaut would look like? Would it be able to walk? Would it be a halve rover halve robonaut setup? What can a robonaut do what a human can\u0027t? You also have to consider that it would take a lot of extra money to development cost and time to create something with those capabilities.\n\nOff the top of my head, I would envision some sort of robotic lab with a sample return stage and a small fleet of semi-autonomous rovers, designed to be serviceable with packed spares and maybe to tow each other back to the base to provide some sort of rescue redundancy. It could have an RMS similar to the ISS Canadarm or DEXTRE, and a variety of tools (maybe a high pressure blower or a brush, fluid valves for refilling whatever needs refilling, and a manipulator for retreiving samples from the rovers or fixing things). You could have some instruments on the rovers, and other heavier ones on the lab module. You could even have the robotic equivalent of a pressurized multi-purpose manned lab with test tubes, bunsen burners, and microscopes if you really wanted to...\n\nAs for the Robonaut, you could stick it on the end of the Canadarm for the equivalent of teleoperated EVA activities. That is similar to what NASA is planning for the Robonaut that\u0027s on the ISS. Those are just possibilities of course, that I pulled out of my backside. There are plenty of robotic missions that you could fit on a 20 or 30-ton Mars lander if you had one, and by the time we have such a lander, robotics and AI will be much more advanced than they are now.\n\nIt would definitely be cheaper and faster to develop than a manned mission. You could even deploy several of these for the cost of a single manned expedition.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Their also slow because they need to assess each cm they travel, one false move and it\u0027s mission failed.\n\nYeah, which is good, so it can study the area more thoroughly at the same time.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E A larger, and thus more complex robotic mission, has a bigger chance of failing without the option to fix it.\n\nSure, which is why my proposal above is probably not 100% realistic and also why the MER program sent two separate rovers. It\u0027s just to demonstrate that there is nothing that humans can do that robots can\u0027t do for cheaper, as long as you design them to. The best way to do robotic missions is to multiply you chances and instead of doing a single large robotic mission, you do hundreds of them. Zerging the damned planet with small MERs will provide a much more thorough exploration than sending a manned mission to a single location for a short period.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Sure if it could travel faster, throwing caution in the win, then yes it could go back and visit previous sites. It couldn\u0027t do experiments it wasn\u0027t designed for.\n\nNeither can a manned mission. If you didn\u0027t bring a certain instrument with you, then tough luck. You could jury-rig a makeshift replacement, but there is no reason why a dexterious teleoperated robot couldn\u0027t do the same.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E They also don\u0027t send the next mission to the same place.\n\nBut they could. And that is not necessarily the best option for a manned mission either. You would probably also want to land further missions in different places, like Apollo.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Is a repair robotic rover really feasible? I could see it fixing a wheel. But what if electronic components break down or if it gets stuck in a ditch?\n\u003E \n\u003E What if the sample transfer part breaks? What if the rover position of it hinders the repair rover?\n\nWell, same is true for a manned rover, yet you said that it would be designed so that it couldn\u0027t get stuck. So design your unmanned rover in the same way. Serviceability needs to be built in. Astronauts could only fix hubble because it was designed to be serviced by EVA. You can\u0027t repair something that isn\u0027t designed to be repaired. Of course, there are tradeoffs here. Sometimes, you need to just write it off. If it\u0027s a robot, well, it\u0027s a shame but we can send another one. If it\u0027s 2 astronauts suffocating in a stranded rover, then it\u0027s a tragedy.\n\n\u003E Again, why is it taking \u0022ages\u0022 OK? Al those other things you mentioned don\u0027t require humans on site, but they require a certain amount of speed. You don\u0027t want status on a nuclear reactor core 2 years later. Collapsed building, underwater pipelines, they all require it to be done in time frame of days, maybe weeks, but not years.\n\nYes, but if we decided to send people to Mars today, it would still take 15 years before they launched. You seem to imagine that we could do it next week if we wanted to, but large aerospace projects don\u0027t work that way. It would take more than a decade, and billions of dollars, to simply design a man-rated Mars lander and ascent vehicle. This is why Mars has always been 20 years away since the 1900\u0027s. I\u0027m pretty confident that in 2030, we will still be aiming for a manned Mars landing in 2050.\n\nUltimately, what does it matter if it happens in 2025, 2050 or 2070 ? Humanity is over 200000 years old and billions of people have lived and died on this planet without seeing people land on Mars. Have they been better or worse from it? I\u0027d like to see a Mars landing in my lifetime as much as anyone here, but I doubt I will. Well, I\u0027ll get over it. Other than satisfying my selfish entertainment needs, it\u0027s no big deal if I\u0027m alive when it happens or not.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-09T13:16:08Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2015 01:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31**"},{"CreatedByName":"Albert VDS","CreatedById":74055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T15:14:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well, so would an unmanned rover.

Maybe those speed aren\u0027t desirable for safety. But it wont be 90 meters per hour or 3.8 cm per second.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Well, most research takes time. Large fusion projects like ITER or things like LHC take decades to accomplish. We accept that.\n\nITER is new grounds of technology, that takes time, also funding problems is slowing it down.

Is there are race on? Is Mars going to vanish in 30 years?

Or take a look at it from a business stand point, would a company pursue something if it would take them 30 years? A company would choose\n\nsomething which would get them to their goal in the fastest and most cost effective way possible. Cheap and safe does not equal cost effective to your goal. It costs SpaceX more money in the short term to develop a reusable\n\nrocket, but in the long term it could save them a lot of money. I know NASA isn\u0027t a company, but it still has a budget and a goal. Both should be looked at in that way, because your only throwing away money in the long run. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Not only safety.

It would actually be detrimental, because you would miss a lot of details if you were going faster.\n\nYou don\u0027t want the rover to fall over, so you use a [Rocker-bogie system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocker-bogie). This system only works by going slow. If the system would have called for a faster speeds then they would have used that.\n\nThe nav cams also have to be able to take coherent shots of it surroundings, no reason to go 10 km/h if you can\u0027t make heads or tails of the surrounds. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Off the top of my head, I would envision some sort of robotic lab with a sample return stage and a small fleet of semi-autonomous rovers, designed to be serviceable with packed spares and maybe to tow each other back to the base to provide some sort of rescue redundancy.

Have you followed Curiosity\u0027s mission, there\u0027s not a whole lot of drilling, sampling or analyzing compared to the days of driving.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Sure, which is why my proposal above is probably not 100% realistic. It\u0027s just to demonstrate that there is nothing that humans can do that robots can\u0027t do for cheaper, as long as you design them to.

How many people do you think you\u0027ll need to have hundreds of rovers being looked after?\n\nI wouldn\u0027t call 500 days a short period, considering they would be send to a differs terrain on each mission, if not exploring the outside then experimenting in the hab. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Neither can a manned mission.

Can\u0027t you think up backup plans for them if their rover is stranded? There are many ways to get out of a ditch. A broken wheel shouldn\u0027t hinder getting back to base.\n\nAnd what if the manned rover sprung a leak? How about emergency LS pack which could extend their travel capability.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Yes, but if we decided to send people to Mars today, it would still take 15 years before they launched.

Other than satisfying my selfish entertainment needs, It\u0027s no big deal.\n\nWhere did I say we can go next week? It would at least take 10 years if you get a capable booster, and that might even be optimistic. But this discussion is more about rover vs manned.\n\nIt all boils down to cost and goal effective. You want to know if Mars harbored life, has liquid water, what kind of effect low G has on the human body, if we can ever live beyond Eart, etc. etc. then you\u0027ll have to send humans.\n\nSo it\u0027s safer to send robots. Would that still be of a concern if space travel would be cheap and people would be lining up to go to Mars, know well that they are at risk?\n\nDo we really need to send people to the ISS? They are at risk every second they are on board of it. Why do we do it? Because we advance our knowledge. When we try to make working in space safer, we also invent safer work and living applications for use on Earth. Maybe we could discover a way to cure certain diseases concerning bone and muscle when we try to stay longer and longer in space. But the greatest thing is that we don\u0027t know what we\u0027ll achieve if we pursue such goals as landing people on Mars."},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T15:18:47Z","Content":"Using ground covered as a proxy for science is only useful if you\u0027re actually doing science observations every step, as MER and MSL have been doing."},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T17:21:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ITER is new grounds of technology, that takes time, also funding problems is slowing it down.

There isn\u0027t much ROI in extraplanetary research so there isn\u0027t much private money invested in it. It\u0027s not going to change any time soon. Nobody foresees any direct applications of Martian geological science that are going to change our lives over the next 30 years.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Do we already have the capability to create robots which have fine motor systems and are small enough(compared to assembling machines) to be sent to Mars?\n\nCuriosity has a pretty fine motor system in its robotic arm. There are impressive advances in robotics and AI all the time. There is no reason to believe robots are not going to get even better and smarter.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Are you guessing this whole cheaper part, because in your plan there is a lot of systems which needs to be developed.\n\nYes, but that vision is more of an extrapolation of existing technology. You\u0027re going to need much more development and even more robustness and reliability for a manned mission. It will always be cheaper to send people than to send robots.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Which brings us to cost effective again. How many people do you think you\u0027ll need to have hundreds of rovers being looked after?\n\nNo idea. As I said, I\u0027m not designing an actual mission. I was merely speculating over what might exist. I would imagine that advances in AI and factorisation of resources would reduce the number of people required to monitor each individual rover compared to today.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I wouldn\u0027t call 500 days a short period, considering they would be send to a differs terrain on each mission, if not exploring the outside then experimenting in the hab.\n\nBut in your previous post, you claimed that they would revisit the same site for some reason. You need to make up your mind.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I highly doubt geologist equipment would be forgotten on a manned mission. If you didn\u0027t bring a certain instrument then you just take a small sample.\n\nWhich is inherently true for a rover too. The reason you don\u0027t bring an instrument is due to payload margins, but if a robot is working with the same payload margins as a manned expedition, it can obviously bring more instruments. Manned missions will have their payload constraints too you know.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E A rover team wants to find new places and do the experiments it\u0027s designed for, going back to a area which it\u0027s not designed for and if it takes weeks of driving is just not efficient.\n\u003E \n\u003E A manned mission wouldn\u0027t need to be revisited because it\u0027s more versatile than any rover, you can pretty much explore any where you want in that area for 500 days.\n\u003E \n\u003E To get a mission approved, it needs to go up against other missions.

And again are their real world machines which can fix other machine and are mobile?\n\nWe send robots to fix pipelines or nuclear reactors. We have drones and teleoperated robots that can do microsurgery. There is no inherent barrier to imagining a robot that can do routine maintenance and easy swaps of equipment to prolong the life of another robot, especially if that other robot is designed to be serviced in that manner. Or you could design that robot from the start so that it is robust enough to survive 20 years on the surface without maintenance. It\u0027s just a matter of developing the hardware to fit the requirements. Current requirements are dictated by power production and weight, but if you increase those parameters to the same level as a manned mission would require, then none of that is inherently impossible.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t see why it needs to be doom and gloom for astronauts. Can\u0027t you think up backup plans for them if their rover is stranded? There are many ways to get out of a ditch.

Again, there is no inherent advantage to a manned rover here.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You want to know if Mars harbored life, has liquid water, what kind of effect low G has on the human body, if we can ever live beyond Eart, etc. etc. then you\u0027ll have to send humans.\n\nThis is pretty much the only valid argument for sending humans to Mars: biological effects on the human body. However, it is a bit circular if the only reason for sending people to Mars is to study how to send people to Mars.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-09T17:26:03Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2015 05:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31**"},{"CreatedByName":"Albert VDS","CreatedById":74055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T19:34:41Z","Content":"Tell me on thing Nibb, do you even believe that humans should leave Earth?"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T20:05:47Z","Content":"I don\u0027t know if we should or shouldn\u0027t.
