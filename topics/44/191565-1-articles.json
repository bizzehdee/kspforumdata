I sort of get the Oberth Effect.\u00A0 In my mind it boils down to \u201Cmaneuvers are more efficient when you perform them close to a gravity well\u201D. But once you reach interplanetary space, you\u0027ve removed the \u0022gravity well\u0022 part.\u00A0 The sun is pretty far away regardless of what point you consider (around Kerbin\u0027s orbit).\u00A0 Whether you end up at 12 or 13 billion meters above the sun, it\u0027s all roughly the same. So I imagined there wouldn\u0027t be much difference between leaving Kerbin, then burning towards Jool. Versus leaving Kerbin while also burning towards Jool.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI experimented with the maneuver node and found out it\u0027s not true at all.\u00A0 There is a huge difference between the two.\u00A0 In both cases, leaving Kerbin (from a Low circular orbit) costs around\u003Cstrong\u003E 940 m/s\u003C/strong\u003E. But then pushing a bit more until you hit Jool costs about \u003Cstrong\u003E1000 m/s\u003C/strong\u003E. Whereas heading towards Jool (from simply sitting in interplanetary space at Kerbin\u0027s altitude from the sun) costs an enormous \u003Cstrong\u003E2500 m/s\u003C/strong\u003E.

Kerbin is pulling against us, preventing us from leaving. Whereas the lone satellite in interplanetary space is just chilling.\u00A0 \u00A0But the satellite ends up at a disadvantage compared to the spacecraft that has to claw it\u0027s way out of a gravity well.\u00A0 Does someone have a more thorough explanation for how the oberth effect is not only applying here, but ends up producing a huge difference?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-02-12T02:27:22Z\u0022 title=\u002202/12/2020 02:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 12, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by PTNLemay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-12T02:37:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223739590\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022191565\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221581474296\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002230142\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PTNLemay\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 minutes ago, PTNLemay said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201Cmaneuvers are more efficient when you perform them close to a gravity well\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCloser is \u0022Prograde and retrograde maneuvers are more efficient the faster you\u0027re going.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKinetic energy is mass times speed squared.

But then pushing a bit more until you hit Jool costs about \u003Cstrong\u003E1000 m/s\u003C/strong\u003E. Whereas heading towards Jool (from simply sitting in interplanetary space at Kerbin\u0027s altitude from the sun) costs an enormous \u003Cstrong\u003E2500 m/s\u003C/strong\u003E. So my assumed scenario actually ends up costing \u003Cstrong\u003E3440 m/s\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0compared to just \u003Cstrong\u003E1940 m/s\u003C/strong\u003E in the optimal scenario.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn this instance I would have imagined the gravitational pull from Kerbin would have counteracted the Oberth effect. Kerbin is pulling against us, preventing us from leaving. Whereas the lone satellite in interplanetary space is just chilling.\u00A0 \u00A0But the satellite ends up at a disadvantage compared to the spacecraft that has to claw it\u0027s way out of a gravity well.\u00A0 Does someone have a more thorough explanation for how the oberth effect is not only applying here, but ends up producing a huge

the Oberth effect in play, when you\u0027re comparing to a vessel that\u0027s\u00A0 in Kerbin\u0027s orbit but not circling Kerbin - you also have the vessel\u0027s velocity around Kerbin itself.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThink about it this way - if you suddenly deleted Kerbin when you\u0027re making your prograde maneuver from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, assuming you\u0027re in a 0degree inclination orbit, you would not be at 9285m/s around the Sun.\u00A0 You\u0027d be at 9285m/s \u002B your Kerbin orbit velocity - so ~ 2300m/s = 11585m/s - enough by itself to do the Jool transfer.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen you make that comparison, you can see that it is still more expensive to depart for

gun that can impart a very specific amount of energy onto a bullet.\u00A0 \u00A0Say the bullet is 1 kg, and we impart 10000 joules of energy into it.\u00A0 The bullet starts at rest.\u00A0 By running the kinetic energy equation, we get afinal velocity of around 141 m/s.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut now we are on a train that is already going at 500 m/s (let\u0027s say it\u0027s on the moon or something with no air resistance).\u00A0 You have that same gun, imparting that same amount of kinetic energy.\u00A0 If we fire it while this train is moving,\u00A0I would imagine the bullet would leave the barrel of the gun travelling around 1141 m/s (relative to the side of the road).\u00A0 The speed of the train, plus the speed we added to it when it was at rest.\u00A0 But if we put those numbers in the kinetic energy equation from earlier, using final speed energy minus initial speed energy, we get an energy difference of over 80000 joules.\u00A0\u00A0Where did the extra energy come from?\u00A0 The bullet\u0027s gunpowder only had so much.\u00A0 I think this is the amount of energy that the bullet would release if it impacted the side of the road, but only the energy it gained from the gun, not the energy it gained from the train.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI see what the equations tell us, but it doesn\u0027t sit right in my

what it says in terms of numbers and see what we can figure out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe have a bullet, a train, 10,000 joules of energy on the bullet, a bullet velocity of 141.4214 m/s, and a train velocity of 500 m/s.\u00A0 The kinetic energy equation is (1/2)mv\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E, so if we run those numbers, then we get a 1 kg bullet--I will continue to call it a bullet and not a cannonball.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not certain about how you get 1141 m/s when you fire the gun from the moving train.\u00A0 I would expect 641.4124 m/s.\u00A0 In terms of reference frames, the bullet is still travelling 141.4214 m/s faster than the 500 m/s train.\u00A0 Things get more complicated at relativistic speeds, but this isn\u0027t anywhere near that amount of velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the bullet is now travelling at 641.4214 m/s, and to an observer on the surface of the moon (or otherwise at rest), it is, then its kinetic energy is now 205,711\u00A0joules.\u00A0 Before we fired the gun, the bullet was travelling at 500 m/s, which gives it a kinetic energy of 125,000 joules, for a difference of 80,711\u00A0joules, as you said.\u00A0 That\u0027s 70,711\u00A0joules more than you get when the bullet starts from rest.\u00A0 Where did it get the extra energy?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat if we change the speed and direction?\u00A0 Let\u0027s say that the train is travelling at 141.4214 m/s in the opposite direction and we fire the gun out the back.\u00A0 The bullet still leaves the barrel at 141.4214 m/s relative to the train, but relative to the Moon (and observers at rest), it has zero velocity, zero energy, and falls to the dust of the lunar surface.\u00A0 Where did the energy go?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClearly, we\u0027re missing something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe equation for kinetic energy is fairly straightforward to derive.\u00A0 We begin with

indicates that we can solve this equation by entering the final velocity, v\u003Csub\u003Ef\u003C/sub\u003E, and subtracting from it the initial velocity, v\u003Csub\u003Ei\u003C/sub\u003E, which

(and thus energy) is zero and the second term disappears.\u00A0 That\u0027s not the case here.\u00A0 Even so, although we can see that the extra energy is now accounted, it still doesn\u0027t tell us from where that energy came in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe can still look at this in new ways.\u00A0 For example, we know that energy is conserved.\u00A0 However, that energy can change forms, such as from potential to kinetic and vice versa.\u00A0 This exchange between forms is what causes spacecraft in elliptical orbits to change speed as they move from apoapsis to periapsis and back again.\u00A0 In the case of the train and the bullet, clearly there is an exchange of energy taking place.\u00A0 However, although the total energy in the system must be conserved, there is no law requiring the exchange of energy to be equally distributed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, conservation of momentum\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Edoes\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0require an equal exchange.\u00A0 We can look at this problem in terms of momentum, then, and see whether we get new insights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpecifically, conservation of momentum says that the momentum of the train-bullet combination must be the same after the bullet is fired as it was before the bullet was fired.\u00A0 In other words, no matter what the initial momentum was, if we take the train momentum and bullet momentum as separate quantities, where the train is initially mass \u003Cem\u003EM\u003C/em\u003E and velocity \u003Cem\u003EV\u003C/em\u003E, the bullet is initially mass \u003Cem\u003Em\u003C/em\u003E and velocity \u003Cem\u003EV\u003C/em\u003E, and the changes in velocity are \u003Cem\u003E\u0394V\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0and \u003Cem\u003E\u0394U\u003C/em\u003E respectively, then we get this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMV \u002B mV\u00A0= M (V \u002B\u00A0\u0394V) \u002B m (V\u00A0\u002B\u00A0\u0394U)\u003Cbr\u003E\nMV \u002B mV\u00A0= MV \u002B\u00A0M\u0394V \u002B mV \u002B m\u0394U\u003Cbr\u003E\nMV \u002B mV\u00A0= MV \u002B

used\u00A0\u003Cem\u003E\u0394U\u003C/em\u003E for the change in the bullet\u0027s velocity because its change is different from the train\u0027s.\u00A0 I could call the bullet\u0027s initial velocity

to the change in kinetic energy of the train added to the change in kinetic energy of the bullet, which we would expect.\u00A0 But attend very closely\u00A0to what else it says:\u00A0 there is no longer any reference to initial velocity, \u003Cem\u003EV\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 The energy change is the same whether the train is at rest or moving at speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, let\u0027s look at what the actual kinetic energy is before the bullet is fired.\u00A0 It is already travelling at 500 m/s; I won\u0027t detail the equation.\u00A0 The kinetic energy of a 500 m/s, 1 kg bullet is 125 kilojoules.\u00A0 If we add 10 kilojoules to that, then we get 135 kilojoules--but that results in a total velocity of 519.6 m/s.\u00A0 We need to account for the train again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis time, we need to know the train\u0027s mass.\u00A0 You did not give it, so I will assume a 1,000 tonne train.\u00A0 This may be inaccurate with respect to reality; I am unfamiliar with lunar rail freight systems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA 1,000,000 kg train travelling on the airless lunar surface over a straight, level track at a speed of 500 m/s has a kinetic energy of 125 gigajoules and a momentum of 5 x 10\u003Csup\u003E8\u003C/sup\u003E kg*m/s (There\u0027s no unit for momentum).\u00A0 The bullet\u0027s change in momentum is 141.4214 kg*m/s (from its 500 m/s initial state), so the train\u0027s change is the negative of that.\u00A0 This yields a total of 499.999858579\u00A0x 10\u003Csup\u003E8\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0kg*m/s, which,

Oberth Effect is that people look at the relationship between the spacecraft and the nearest planet.\u00A0 This is completely wrong.\u00A0 Orbital energy is certainly a factor if you happen to be near a gravitational body, but only insofar as orbital energy gives an easy conversion between potential and kinetic energy.\u00A0 The effect, itself, has to do with the way the kinetic energy is used, not how it is obtained, and so the really important relationship is between the rocket and its propellant, not the rocket and its orbit.\u00A0 Let\u0027s take your train analogy, but instead of a bullet, let\u0027s use a tennis ball.\u00A0 When the train is at rest, I can throw the ball some distance, x.\u00A0 This is a representation\u00A0of the chemical energy in the propellant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the train is in motion, I can throw the ball farther, x \u002B y--\u003Cem\u003Eprovided I throw the ball forwards\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Prograde motion is important here.\u00A0 If I stand next to the tracks and throw the ball at the oncoming train, then assuming no other velocity losses, the ball rebounds off the front of the train and goes a distance x \u002B y (from the point of impact), as well.\u00A0 Why does it do this?\u00A0 The collision between the ball and the train is perfectly elastic, which is to say that the kinetic energy in it is conserved.\u00A0 An inelastic collision is one where the ball enters the train and is lodged there--this is why I didn\u0027t continue to use the bullet analogy.\u00A0 A physical representation of an inelastic collision in rocketry would be when the engine combustion chamber ruptures.\u00A0 That is probably undesirable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe important point to see here is that it doesn\u0027t matter whether I\u0027m standing on the train or standing next to it; the train imparts energy to the ball at the instant the ball\u00A0contacts it, or more specifically, the ball has the gained energy at the instant it\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ebreaks\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0contact with the train (or my hand, which, when I\u0027m standing on the train, is part of the train).\u00A0 I certainly did nothing to make the ball go the extra \u002By distance.\u00A0 Since my arm (or the chemical energy in the rocket propellant) can only impart a fixed amount of energy, and that energy only can carry the ball x distance,\u00A0the energy to go farther \u003Cem\u003Emust\u003C/em\u003E have come from the train.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn exact like kind, the extra energy from the Oberth Effect\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emust\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0come from something other than the chemical energy in the rocket propellant.\u00A0 Unfortunately, our choices are very limited:\u00A0 we have the rocket itself, which receives the energy and therefore cannot supply it, and we have the rocket propellant again, examined outside of the context of its chemical energy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat, physically, happens when we burn propellant in a rocket engine?\u00A0 When we burn it, the propellant exhaust products bounce\u00A0about inside the combustion chamber, either off of the walls or off of other molecules of exhaust or propellant,\u00A0until they are forced out of the nozzle.\u00A0 By Newton\u0027s Third Law, the action of forcing the exhaust out the nozzle forces the rocket, with equal momentum, to move in the opposite direction.\u00A0 In a physical sense, the exhaust bounces off of the forward wall of the combustion chamber (or, more accurately, the propellant between the forward wall and the nozzle) and out.\u00A0 Efficiency can be increased with the engine bell, which directs exhaust moving at an angle to a more retrograde direction, again forcing the rocket to move in the opposite direction.\u00A0 I\u0027m certain that this is all elementary to you and I apologise for that, but consider, since the reaction in Newton\u0027s Third Law is equal, isn\u0027t it equally correct to say that the rocket bounces off of the exhaust?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNormally, one would not think of bouncing off of an exhaust plume so much as ploughing through it, because the exhaust, as a gas, is of course a fluid.\u00A0 But the fluid is confined and it is made of matter; even though it is not dense, it is there, and so the rocket bounces off of it.\u00A0 It is also true that this propellant exhaust begins by\u00A0initially moving at speed with the rocket.\u00A0 That much should be obvious; the propellant, until it exits the nozzle, is carried by the rocket.\u00A0 The fact that the propellant must accelerate itself as well as the rocket is what leads to the tyranny of the rocket equation, but in this case, it is a somewhat benevolent tyranny because that acceleration results in higher energies that we can usefully extract.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nParticularly, because the propellant does not stick to the engine or the rest of the rocket, the collision between it and the rocket is perfectly elastic.\u00A0 Since the propellant, being carried by the rocket, has greater kinetic energy when it and the rocket collide while in motion than it would have if the rocket were at rest, more energy can be exchanged between them in that collision.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is another common application of this that many people miss.\u00A0 Have you considered why we burn the propellant in the first place?\u00A0 Newton\u0027s Law only really requires that the momentum exchange be equal; there\u0027s nothing keeping you from, for example, venting the propellant out the back without burning it.\u00A0 If you take a good slingshot and a ready supply of stones, then you can even have a rocket with real rocks in it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the propellant is burned, the chemical bonds are broken, and this liberates a lot of energy.\u00A0 We see much of that energy\u00A0as heat and pressure, but heat is also represented as the kinetic energy of molecular motion, and pressure is energy applied per unit area.\u00A0 Pressure, in particular, can be increased by increasing the temperature of a confined gas or by forcing more molecules into a confined volume; rocket propellant mixtures\u00A0can be selected to do either or both of these.\u00A0 Combine combustion chamber pressure with a nozzle opening that has a cross-sectional area, and the kinetic energy bound up in the pressure can be liberated.\u00A0 Consider that the increased temperature of the molecules is\u00A0physically equivalent to the molecules moving faster, and you can begin to see that, when directed out the nozzle as exhaust, the burned\u00A0propellant\u00A0with\u00A0its faster-moving molecules\u00A0imparts more kinetic energy to the rocket than would cold, un-burned propellant that is vented more slowly.\u00A0 Does this mean that the Oberth Effect works inside rocket engines to increase their efficiency by extracting more useful energy from faster-moving combustion products than can be had simply from venting the propellant?\u00A0 Technically, yes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis also means that, technically,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eburning\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the propellant is not necessary; as I mentioned above, the important part is how you \u003Cem\u003Euse\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the energy, not how you obtain it.\u00A0 You can obtain\u00A0the kinetic energy simply by increasing the propellant temperature and pressure to levels normally seen in combustion, and it\u00A0will work equally well.\u00A0\u00A0That is exactly how nuclear thermal rockets work.\u00A0 It isn\u0027t even necessary to heat or pressurise the propellant:\u00A0 if we can increase the kinetic energy by increasing the velocity of the molecules directly, then that will also work, and that is how ion engines do it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing about the Oberth Effect is any more complicated than understanding that if I bounce a ball off of a moving train, then it will go farther than bouncing a ball off of a train at rest.\u00A0 If I bounce a ball off of a train moving even faster, then the ball will go even farther.\u00A0 The same is true whether I am on the train when I throw the ball or standing next to the train and bounce the ball off of the front.\u00A0 The misunderstanding that people have is, in essence, the same misunderstanding that leads people to try rendezvous in orbit by thrusting towards the target, or to attempt to raise orbital altitude by thrusting radial out:\u00A0 things in space work a little differently from what you have been led to expect from conditions on Earth, but the physics still \u003Cem\u003Ework\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022
