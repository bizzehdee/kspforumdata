And now imagine that happening to a nuke plant itself? Yeah lots of them have millions of powerfailure modes... But how good are they at shutting themselves down when every computer connected to them is dead and all wires coming going into the thing are getting crazy varying voltage spikes?) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven then since the event happened all across teh world, its not like all the oil suddenly disappeared. Canada would still have most of its oil, there\u0027d still be tons and tons of it sitting in the Gulf. I see you\u0027re from the UK, well you\u0027re kinda screwed on that. But even with all these debates, its not like all the machinery on say an oil platform would die off (only the computers... and last I checked, those weren\u0027t exactly the most integrated machines around, computer/electronic needs can be bypassed if given time to re-engineer) Also ships would still be floating. Yes their navigation systems might go down, but many of the older container and cargo ships engines could be brought online with some work, and navigation could be done again by the stars, the biggest factor in the age of sail was their lack of accurate timepieces, they could find out where they were north south, it was east/west that was the problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESaudi Arabia is probably having some serious problems during this time of apocalypse too (its not exactly a country that can support its population well without imports, and if all their supply routes are cut off many of their people would be starving. Given a generation goes by, could probably haul right into the coast with a couple ships and men, get to an oil field and set up camp. The oil platforms would have likely been abandoned years ago because they\u0027re kinda worthless now. Or you could always trade with them for the oil. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERefinery... well dunno about bringing old ones back on line myself but its not like they\u0027re particularly complex. They heat up the oil and give it time to separate, then they suction it off at different heights and thats the different types of fuel depending on height. Find a book and some plans that are likely at the plant, and now you\u0027re cookin. Also I dunno about your country, train tracks everywhere and we have lots of people who collect old steam engines, those things would be beasts during this intermediate time period at transporting goods and well son of a gun, they\u0027re depressingly simple machines aswell, and wood isn\u0027t lacking in supply. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only reason why fossil fuels really matter is because they give us unsurpassed power in material transport (and to an extent, materials gathering such as mining or harvesting) Forgoing the ability to move resources on a scale though, you\u0027d never have the chance to bounce back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd don\u0027t forget. You could possibly use an existing engine, replace the cam shaft so that you don\u0027t have a compression/power stroke anymore, although you might just leave it, compressing and expanding your steam once would just lower your efficiency a bit. And pump some high pressure steam into the intake manifold. What would normally be the intake stroke, the high pressure steam forces itself in and pushes the piston down. Seems like an interesting project... need to find an old small 2 cylinder engine that noone minds never working right again.

Even if the Earth is hit by a comet with a 15km radius, at 70 km/s (that\u0027s solar escape velocity at damned Mercury), at a dead-on angle of 90 degrees, immediately damage would be nearly 0 at the other side of the planet from where it hit (thank you person who shared that calculator!). The change of such a heavy impact event is practically 0, but still, for the same of argument, let\u0027s keep it in. If it hits in the south pacific ocean, the immediate damage to humans would be relative small, and basically all developed economies would be totally spared (apart from Oceania). It is likely organized society, at least in the West, would hold up quite OK in such an event. Sure, the first few years would be very grim, but if society holds, I think we can avoid the worst. If we have some warning, we might not be able to construct huge caves (and it\u0027d be unnecessary even, methinks) in the time available, but mass-producing greenhouses should be doable. A simple greenhouse consists of some plastic sheets, or even an inflatable bubble. Use the right crops, and you don\u0027t even need soil. Just water and dissolved nutrients. Yes, rations are going to be extremely tight, but the nuclear winter would be survivable for society itself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if large scale civilization ceases to exist, there are likely pockets of civilization and order that survive.

And if the gas runs out, we could turn to old-school peat burning. And even then, a society doesn\u0027t need to be rich or food-independent to sort of function. Just look at North Korea. It\u0027s a hell to live, poorest country on the planet, draconian government, nothing to eat. Hell on Earth.

Everyone who has lived in the good days will know numerous tiny things about technology, all of which will greatly speed up reinventing it. Our ancestors didn\u0027t have that luxury. It\u0027s not necessary to know exactly how something works; just a rough outline is enough to push one in the right direction. For instance, I \u003Cem\u003Eroughly\u003C/em\u003E know how to make a chemical battery. I don\u0027t remember the exact solutions, but I know it involves sticking two sticks in two vats of chemicals connected through some kind of membrane/bridge. Etc etc. Now, bring all those people who \u003Cem\u003Eroughly\u003C/em\u003E know something together, and you\u0027d probably get working stuff quite quickly. What I\u0027d worry most of is that the big leaps forward have to come from the first generation. Especially when books or other media are no longer widespread, it is going to be difficult to tell our children how our world looked like. How do you explain the workings of a phone, a computer, or even an oven to someone who\u0027s never seen anything more complex than a spade? Let alone abstract concepts like electromagnetism and so on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother aspect that I\u0027d worry about is communication. Our world generally uses highly standardized communication systems. E.g. the HTTP protocol, or government-sanctioned radio frequencies. If all these small city states reinvent mass communication, they probably all use a slightly (or not so slightly) different protocol. That\u0027s going to give some major headaches while communicating with other city states.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shynung","CreatedById":101096,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-06T05:55:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sndrtj\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sndrtj\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...literacy rates are near 100%...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should point out that literacy in North Korea is defined by the ability to write, in Korean, the name \u0027Kim Il Sung\u0027.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do agree, though, that knowledge about technology, even a little, can give us quite a head start compared to our ancestors if we are ever to rebuild society from scratch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SelectHalfling0","CreatedById":105051,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-07T00:03:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would probably take many generations, but eventually humans will learn how to use combustion engines and such again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThinkOutsideTheHangar","CreatedById":100722,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-07T17:41:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes.

Anything that is oil based would become rare, as well as food and other essential things that wouldn\u0027t be able to get transported to the stores. Electricity would stay on for a few days. During the months after this crisis, governments collapse, looting and murder become more common, and chaos ensues.

Survivors would band together into small factions in the wilderness, building new self-sustaining communities. After many many MANY years, we might rebuild society, and some of the technology we have today might resurface.
