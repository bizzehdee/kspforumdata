Very technical, very immersive. It\u0027s awesome, really. One thing that bugs me though is the very reason the hero was stranded on Mars. The MAV in the novel is qualified for up to 150kph wind speed, more than that and it starts tipping (it\u0027s not Saturn V heavy, but still, 10\u002B tons heavy). What I don\u0027t get is... how? Mars has what, 0.5, maybe 1% of Earth\u0027s pressure? Wouldn\u0027t this \u0022super storm\u0022 be 100 times less powerful than on Earth? I think I\u0027ve read somewhere that Opportunity withstand such \u0022storms\u0022 annually and most they can do is to clean its solar panels. Maybe there\u0027s some Beufort\u0027s scale analogue for Mars? Maybe I don\u0027t get it? In every other aspect the story seems plausible.

For the rocket to be so unstable that it can be thus blown over is a pretty serious engineering mistake, but then engineers do make mistakes.
