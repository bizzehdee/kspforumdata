In general lifeforms would be smaller and build bulkier (Thanks to the cube-square law).

To have liquid water on the surface you need an atmosphere and to have an atmosphere you need a certain minimum mass. I don\u0027t know what that mass limit is for a planet in the Goldilocks zone, but I suspect it is rather high. So I think it would be classified as a binary system instead of a planet - moon system (Just like Pluto and Charon). Then again, that\u0027s just a classification thing. It is perfectly possible for such a system to be stable. This will cause massive tides on both bodies if they aren\u0027t tidally locked, so stay away from the shores.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo note however that it is practically impossible to actually get to that moon from the main planet\u0027s surface using current day technology.

What we know about long term spaceflight suggests that exposure to higher gravity would cause the reverse effect, muscles and bones getting stronger to cope, and the circulatory system getting stronger as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for having a large moon/twin planet also capable of supporting life, that could work as well. A large planet like that would most likely carry a much stronger magnetic field, possibly allowing the twin planet to carry an atmosphere without being as large as it would otherwise need to be to carry an atmosphere. Remember that without our magnetosphere, Earth would have an atmosphere similar to Mars. Make the twin fairly close to it\u0027s big brother, and/or give it a magnetosphere of it\u0027s own, and I would say that atmosphere, oceans, and life would all be plausible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the next issue would be the tides. You have a few basic options: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Give them a tidally locked orbit to where they always have the same side facing one another (like Duna and Ike). In this scenario, the two planets would bulge slightly towards one another (not enough to cause major problems), and gravity on the side facing the other would be weaker. Rockets taking off from one planet could take advantage of this to get more efficient launches, potentially making space more accessible to the people on the big brother planet. The oceans would always be bulging in the same places, meaning there would be no tides (the oceans would always stay at more or less the same level everywhere).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. No tidal locking would mean that both planets would have extremely high tides. This would make life difficult near the shores, however still possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. One or the other could only show one face to the other.

The physical laws of this universe are solely up to the author. All resemblance to reality exists because the god of that universe wants it there. In the end, these planets were never \u0022formed\u0022, and the life here never \u0022evolved\u0022, they were all created, by you, the god of this universe. Maybe your characters are atheists, maybe not, in either case let \u003Cem\u003Ethem\u003C/em\u003E work out some way of explaining how their universe got there.

Food for thought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are trying to follow real physics as much as possible, the only major exception being how I have solved the speed of light barrier.(Basically, ripping a hole into another dimension and back again, but in a different relative location. I know that sounds OP, but it is balanced out by requiring an immense amount of power, and the further away the destination is, the more power it requires, so with even the biggest ships you can usually only jump 10 to 100 Light years at a time. Also the size of the ship doesn\u0027t matter, the portal consumes a marginal amount less if you were to open one a micrometre across than one a kilometre across, limiting smaller ships to jumping between a couple of star systems at a time, and waiting for a recharge to optimal power levels before jumping again.)
