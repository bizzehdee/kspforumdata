Unlike most carbon fiber composites which use thermosets like epoxy as matrix (the stuff that isn\u0027t the fibers) this one used PEEK thermoplastic. I very quickly fell in love with the stuff. It manages to be as light as most professional carbon fiber composites with a density of around 1.44 g/cc but it is also might be surprisingly strong. It was supposed to withstand 4000 N in compression but simulations indicated that it could go up to almost ten times that number. Overall, it manages to be superior to aluminum in most ways (again, this is according to simulation). To achieve this, we stacked sixteen layers of the material in four different directions. This can be seen below:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.rocketryforum.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=182355\u0026amp;d=1408910204\u0022 alt=\u0022attachment.php?attachmentid=182355\u0026amp;d=1408910204\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother great thing about it is that it rolls off the machine ready to go, only needing for the rough ends to be cut. The manufacturing process can sometimes take less than half a day. You can see the robot that is used to make it as well as a finished section below:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.rocketryforum.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=182356\u0026amp;d=1408910327\u0022 alt=\u0022attachment.php?attachmentid=182356\u0026amp;d=1408910327\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.rocketryforum.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=182358\u0026amp;d=1408910364\u0022 alt=\u0022attachment.php?attachmentid=182358\u0026amp;d=1408910364\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also has very good dimensional accuracy (mostly due to the fact that it was done by a robot). This means that couplers are a piece of cake. We made one for the rocket\u0027s payload bay and its fit was pretty much perfect:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.rocketryforum.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=182359\u0026amp;d=1408910496\u0022 alt=\u0022attachment.php?attachmentid=182359\u0026amp;d=1408910496\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre there any downsides to this material? Of course! The fact that it is made with a thermoplastic means that it is weaker than other composites at higher temperatures (it melts at around 343 C which is still higher than most thermoplastics). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest problem, however, was the cost. For us, it was about 950 CAD per meter, which puts it out of the range of most people. This is, of course, assuming that you can get access to one of the robots that does this. It is possible that the technology will become more accessible in the future, at which point I hope that its use will become more widespread in rocketry or space applications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, working with this material was a worthwhile experience and I hope that I\u0027ve imparted some of my love and interest for composite materials science to the reader.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mardlamock","CreatedById":38972,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-13T22:24:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThats some expensive stuff you ve got there\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-13T22:32:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECarbon composites are all the rage among rocket startups right now.
