Practically it is way too hard to deploy and way too easy to sabotage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou will need to deploy those buoys as a string, not a web. A web will be nearly impossible from a ship unless you connect buoys to each other afterwards. From a plane a web is out of the question.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBuoys are relatively easy to spot with radar. Since the buoys need to be physically be connected to each other you would only need to take out a single buoy or wire to cut large sections off the network.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo maintain such a network you would need absolute dominance in that area otherwise it will eat up too much manpower.
