This makes the satellite itself cheaper, and eliminates most insurance cost - as the insurance would be paying out for lost revenue and replacing the satellite, the former of which is drastically reduced, and the second of which is non-existent, though will re-emerge at much lower value if the second has to be launched.\n\n The problem with this argument is it doesn\u0027t fundamentally have anything to do with reuse-there\u0027s nothing stopping satellite operators from already purchasing cheaper sats and putting them on somewhat smaller, cheaper launchers like Zenit or Proton. They don\u0027t do it because smaller sats make little sense due to the cost of GEO slots and the cost of high-end transponders-a $200 million sat isn\u0027t going to match the capability of a $500 million one regardless of how much redundancy you remove."},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T17:15:26Z","Content":"No demand increase?

We have no idea about what the launch campaign will be, how long it\u0027ll take, or how it will be funded.

My point is, there is an upper limit to the number of satellites you can cram in a single launch, that being the number you want on each plane. And at 100-500kgs according to Musk, that means F9H as a launcher is out. Probably even F9 is overkill, but F9R might merit a dedicated launch.\n\nRune. Also offering great economies for multiple launches, I think it will be the baseline launcher, but you know, just IMO."},{"CreatedByName":"DiamondExcavater","CreatedById":72325,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-13T06:13:55Z","Content":"My own [craft](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entries/3754-Adeline-Rocket) I made using a few mods"},{"CreatedByName":"MajorTomtom","CreatedById":179540,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-30T09:44:04Z","Content":"Hi, sorry to dig old posts, but according to this : [https://satelliteobservation.net/2018/05/21/ariane-6-and-beyond/](https://satelliteobservation.net/2018/05/21/ariane-6-and-beyond/)\n\nAdeline concept is \u0022financially not interesting\u0022, so I guess it is abandonned"}]}
