Mild exposure can temporariy cure all sorts of pilosity, while at closer range they can permanently eradicate syndromes associated with excessively smooth and/or unblemished skin. There is no data available concerning their ability to cure warts, carbuncles or verrucas, but since there are thousands of cases each year where people are cured of the very presence of significant portions of skin (and in some cases, deep subcutaneous tissue and osseous structures), one might safely presume that cutaneous imperfections can be eliminated at the same time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, all these benefits of fireworks do come with a cost. Targets (when they survive, though the vast majority do and, indeed, manage to go on to lead only slightly curtailed lives with some semblance of normality) generally report some discomfort and many require further medical intervention to either correct or complete the surgeries initiated in such an overenthusiastic fashion by the fireworks themselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"monophonic","CreatedById":76902,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-04T17:49:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll too true \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/153264-plusck/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022153264\u0022 href=\u0022%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/153264-plusck/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Plusck\u003C/a\u003E, although in my case the eye surgery failed due to too fast reflexes.
