It burns ethanol and liquid oxygen. But part of the commercial crew contract is that the vehicle can stay on-orbit for the duration of the expedition, which is several months, and liquid oxygen is mildly cryogenic, and will boil off over time. That\u0027s why Cold War-era missiles (which had to be kept in silos for months at a time) quickly switched to (storable) solid or hypergolic fuel! Is the boil-off rate just low enough to be within tolerance for a deorbit burn following a nominal mission?"},{"CreatedByName":"SomeGuy12","CreatedById":103022,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T00:39:13Z","Content":"Why does the launch escape system need to function after launch? \n\nSpaceX uses the same engines and fuel used for launch escape for in orbit maneuvering and plans to use them for even landing. However, the old school way to do it, there\u0027s an escape rocket, and you jettison it after there\u0027s no more need for it. (it doesn\u0027t help you escape anything in orbit)\n\nAre you sure they plan to keep the rocket attached? It would make more sense that when they separate from the upper stage of the launch rocket, they would leave that pusher launch escape system behind as well."},{"CreatedByName":"sgt_flyer","CreatedById":57690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T05:46:35Z","Content":"@Someguy12\n\n\u0027Pusher\u0027 escape systems, if jetisonned at the end of the ascent phase would have been deadweight throughout the flight. as an escape system is a lot of delta-V by itself (they need it to propell at 5\u002B Gs a capsule above the rocket) - by keeping the escape system and throttling the engine down for OMS manoeuver, give you a big amount of delta-V for orbital manoeuver, without needing to add additionnal engines and tanks to your capsule\u0027s service module. (so either the rocket work and you make it almost to orbit - and then you use the pusher LES as a OMS for circularization / orbital manoeuver, or you use it as a launch escape system if there\u0027s a problem with the rocket during all the phases of ascent. (and if, at the end of the launcher\u0027s ascent, your LES engines don\u0027t work, as you have not circularized yet, you\u0027ll fall back on earth anyway, so they just detach from the service module and simply fall back to the ground.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T06:05:10Z","Content":"Engines can be throttled?"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T06:28:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Engines can be throttled?\n\nObviously dragons engines can throttledas its planned to be used both for escape, orbital operations I think and soft landings.
