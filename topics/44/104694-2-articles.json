Figuring out how to launch a rocket from the Moon would be a tremendous boon to society as a whole in space exploration. The moon can support bigger payloads with lighter gravity. The need for fairings or aerodynamics goes away. Launches can go directly into the gravity turn with no air resistance to stop them.\n\nUnless you are proposing hardcore ISRU - like fabrication of rockets and rocket fuel from ore found on the moon - then you\u0027re forgetting that launching from the moon first requires a launch from earth, then a landing on the moon. Why not just launch from earth right to the destination?"},{"CreatedByName":"Greenfire32","CreatedById":36705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T21:34:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E **Greenfire:** You read my answer?\n\nYep just took me a bit to type a reply:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The only way to discuss what has more science value is to look in the long term also. If we can not do that, then there is nothing to discuss.\n\nThat\u0027s a good way to look at it as well.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E We already take that baby step, this will be like support the apollo moon conspiracy, is like said.. we was there.. but we forget how to accomplish that. I need to hear a good objective before support this.\n\nWell for starters, we haven\u0027t been to the moon in over 40 years so I feel like the practice would be beneficial. But as I said, the only way to accurately learn the effects of Lunar (low) gravity on the human body is by putting one on the moon. We already know that micro gravity is harmful after extended periods of time, but what about low gravity? There\u0027s more gravity on the surface of the Moon than there is in LEO. \n\nThen there\u0027s the issue of lunar dust. If man were to have some kind of permanent settlement on the moon, what happens to the body when lunar dust is accidentely inhaled? What are the effects? What are the treatments? etc etc. \n\nLong story short: we can learn more about how to live in a hostile environment by just doing it. Not saying there shouldn\u0027t be robotic missions involved, just saying that\u0027s the only way we\u0027re going to master it.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E mmm I dont know.. is a valid point, at least for mars as the next step. But why we can not sent a robot missions direct to mars and experiment the best way to do ISRU directly in mars conditions. Of course this does not provide manned or colony experience.. But the colony experience in the moon is similar than in the ISS, without the mining possibilities or the dust issue.\n\nThere\u0027s nothing that says we can\u0027t do all that. All I\u0027m saying is that *when the time comes* for an off-world \u0022colony,\u0022 would you rather have at least *some* experience with the environment, or would you rather it all be a surprise?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Why? we need to build the spacecraft, reach LEO, go to the moon and land (which require deltav), just to fill our tanks and gain a little extra deltav? Plus the time lost and the risk added?\n\nNo, you\u0027re missing the point. The idea of a launchpad on the Moon is for rockets to be built, assembled and launched from the moon. First we have to determine the viability of such an en-devour (which is why a manned mission to determine these things would be necessary). Then we have to refine the techniques of doing something like that in a low gravity environment. And then we have to actually do it.\n\nThe idea is to make it completely self-sufficient over time. Which means that launching from the moon would cut dV requirements **tremendously**.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Name one NASA Venus or Mars mission with anything like that as an official objective.\n\n...there isn\u0027t one. Hence the topic of the thread. Should NASA continue its ARM or should it relocate its resources elsewhere.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E How about building something in LEO, infrastructure, that would allow NASA to do what it pleases?\n\nFor a while, yes. But then you run into the problem that AngelLestat pointed out. Launch materials to orbit costs money. Assembling in orbit costs money. Launching from orbit costs money.\n\nSo for the immediate future, that would be the way to do it. But in the long term, an off-world base (preferably with less gravity and no atmosphere like the Moon) would be ideal for launching crafts. Costs would be basically nill compared to what they are here since you wouldn\u0027t need HUGE rockets to fight against gravity and atmospheric drag.\n\nThis, of course, is assuming that the materials to not only build the rocket, but its fuel as well currently exist on the moon. Again, another reason why a Lunar mission would be of importance. Is this even feasible? Can this even be done? I don\u0027t know.

You\u0027ll need a rather large rocket to get something decently sized to the surface.\n\nLEO is just easier to do things in.\n\nBasically, everything in space costs money.

Doing this we have our fuel station right in our doors.\n\nSo, just to confirm, if we change LEO to Low lunar orbit, then we could move ore bearing asteroids to the moon which removes all the \u0022issues\u0022 of transporting materials up (if the dv requirement for moving the asteroids isn\u0027t absurd).

There is no other rationale for it. The scientific goals of the ARM can be reached without any manned presence for a fraction of the cost. Grabbing a small rock and moving it around is a stunt that has no real application in terms of mining or asteroid avoidance.\n\nOrion was designed for cislunar exploration, to support 4 crew members for 21 days and to reenter from the Moon. When Constellation was cancelled, NASA was specifically ordered not go to the Moon, so the only mission they can propose under the current administration is ARM. I suspect that this will change after the presidential election.\n\nI\u0027m personally in favor of a new series of Moon landings with some critical objectives:\n\n- Studying and developing techniques for closed loop habitats, hydroponics, and ISRU.\n\n- Studying and developing techniques for using and maintaining exploration equipment off-world.\n\n- Studying and developing mitigation techniques around the biological impact of partial gravity and cosmic radiation.\n\nThe idea of \u0022colonies\u0022 is stupid, but these objectives would probably benefit from some sort of semi-permanent lunar outpost or lab facility. Something equivalent to one or two ISS modules would allow long duration experiments to run unattended between manned visits.\n\nA lunar outpost would also benefit from some sort of supply-line infrastructure, with a reusable lander, a fuel depot, maybe commercially operated.\n\nThe Moon is the easiest and most obvious place we can get to.
