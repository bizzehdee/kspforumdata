The proposal that SpaceX put forth for the area calls for one single central landing pad (with surrounding emergency divert options) that will be for landing one single core only. As such, only one of the FH side boosters will be able to return. No future expansion proposals are in the works, and even this current one hasn\u0027t been approved yet (much less started any construction).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, the center core of the Falcon Heavy will, to quote Elon Musk himself, be \u0022hauling ass\u0022 at the time of burnout. It will be many times faster and many times further downrange than the other cores. It\u0027s extremely unlikely that it will ever fly a return to pad scenario. Even Elon thinks it\u0027s more realistic to have a barge way downrange in the middle of the ocean (instead of \u0022slightly off the coast\u0022 where they\u0027re currently trying to capture F9 first stages). And even that\u0027s going to be fiendishly difficult due to the vastly higher velocities and reentry heating effects. Nobody can tell yet if the stage won\u0027t simply break apart in that regime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, that video is pure marketing. Best SpaceX can do here is one side core returning to land, one side core aiming for a barge, and the center core getting discarded (due to lacking another barge). Much like the Falcon 9, advertised as \u0022the world\u0027s first fully reusable rocket\u0022, will actually never be fully reusable, because the Merlin engines don\u0027t have the Isp to maintain a useful payload fraction when trying for a returnable second stage. Perhaps a Raptor-powered successor can do it, but it\u0027s never going to happen with F9 (already confirmed by Elon in an interview).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m as much of a SpaceX fan as the next rocketry enthusiast, but do beware of their marketing department.

Elon said they considered going with a FH-style triple core but ultimately decided it\u0027s better to just have a single stage. Likely very much because landing all three cores back home will be extremely difficult, as mentioned above... and also, because of the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThree Raptors for a F9 replacement stage sounds pretty good from a basic numbers perspective. Problem is, such a \u0022Falcon 3\u0022 first stage is probably not returnable either. Right now the F9 fires a single of its 9 Merlin engines at absolute minimum throttle to land... and even then the TWR is well above 1.0, so it cannot hover. It must suicide burn for touchdown. The pintle style injector allows the Merlin engine to throttle fairly well for a main stage launch engine; SpaceX\u0027s statements on this are ambiguous, but it\u0027s either \u0022can throttle to 60%\u0022, or \u0022throttle 60% down\u0022 (i.e. to 40%). This is, as mentioned, a lot. With a hypothetical Falcon 3 running on Raptor engines three times as powerful, these Raptors would need a \u003Cem\u003Eridiculously\u003C/em\u003E deep throttle to make a landing viable. Can\u0027t just \u0022hit x\u0022 for a pulsed thrust approach either: these aren\u0027t hypergolic engines that can just turn on and off at will. The Merlin needs about four seconds to ignite and spool up its gas generator, and it has only a very limited number of restarts in it. The Raptor as a staged combustion methalox engine with a bigger turbopump is probably a little slower, and not hypergolic either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s not to say they can never do it, of course. Maybe the Raptor will be amazingly throttleable. Maybe they get so good at this suicide burn landing by 2020 that they can use the Raptor even if it cannot throttle as low. Maybe they\u0027ll have a smaller Raptor derivative and will fly a Falcon 5, 6 or 7 stage with it. After all, it appears the Raptor design can arbitrarily scale between 2 and 8 meganewtons already, why not scale it down? Who knows...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...but then, that is the far future.

Problem is, such a \u0022Falcon 3\u0022 first stage is probably not returnable either. Right now the F9 fires a single of its 9 Merlin engines at absolute minimum throttle to land... and even then the TWR is well above 1.0, so it cannot hover. It must suicide burn for touchdown. The pintle style injector allows the Merlin engine to throttle fairly well for a main stage launch engine; SpaceX\u0027s statements on this are ambiguous, but it\u0027s either \u0022can throttle to 60%\u0022, or \u0022throttle 60% down\u0022 (i.e. to 40%). This is, as mentioned, a lot. With a hypothetical Falcon 3 running on Raptor engines three times as powerful, these Raptors would need a \u003Cem\u003Eridiculously deep throttle to make a landing viable. Can\u0027t just \u0022hit x\u0022 for a pulsed thrust approach either: these aren\u0027t hypergolic engines that can just turn on and off at will. The Merlin needs about four seconds to ignite and spool up its gas generator, and it has only a very limited number of restarts in it. The Raptor as a staged combustion methalox engine with a bigger turbopump is probably a little slower, and not hypergolic either.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat why I suggested a 9 Raptor vehicle. It would match the Falcon Heavy in almost every way but only be a single core. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 9 Raptors means that a single centre one can be used to land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- As its only one core it would not be too far downrange to return to the launch site. The Falcon Heavy\u0027s main core is very hard to recover due to its separation speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The size of the vehicle, combined with the Raptors much higher ISP, would make 100% reusability much more feasible compared to the Falcon Heavy which cannot reuse the upper stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t think of a downside of this rocket in comparison to the Falcon Heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-27T22:06:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, the Falcon Heavy benefits from the booster staging, i.e. it looses dry mass early and thus gains extra dV.
