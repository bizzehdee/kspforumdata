Then you fire. Now, relative to you, light from the laser is traveling at the speed of light. Relative to bullet, it also travels at the speed of light. So if it\u0027s fair to say that you are traveling at the speed of light with respect to the photon, same can be said about the bullet. So then you and the bullet travel at the same speed? But you fired the bullet. Clearly, it\u0027s moving with respect to you, so the speeds have to be different. See, it just falls apart like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, it has to do with the fact that from perspective of light, there is no longer a distinction between space and time. For a photon, the only direction that exists is forward. It\u0027s both its direction and its future. And if you only have one dimension, and it is both a space and time, how are you going to go about defining velocity of anything?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, the short answer is that you simply can\u0027t use light as frame of reference like that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpeach","CreatedById":34566,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-17T19:06:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBut, how can time without \u0022moving\u0022 at the speed of light(and without being in a black hole)?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
