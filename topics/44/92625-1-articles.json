However, there\u0027s a decent counter to your above statement. Life should not be capable of coming into being in all conditions. In addition, some conditions should be more favorable to the formation of life than others, and should give rise to life first. Earth may be an example of this. Additionally, life on Earth has now evolved space travel, and, with luck, will soon be spreading to other planets, asteroids, and maybe even deep space.

Increasing entropy more means you are just extracting more energy from the environment, which , anything else being equal, grants you a survival advantage.

In nebulae, this means that stars form to convert rest mass into radiation and neutrinos.

Actually, it\u0027s one of the major hallmarks in determining what is \u0022alive\u0022: homeostasis. That\u0027s not a contradiction; AFAIK, thermodynamics is fine if entropy is decreasing in a local area, so long the entropy of the entire system keeps increasing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake the following analogy: We have a sea, and a sun. Water is evaporated by the sunlight heating the sea - the sun\u0027s energy is now sort of in \u0022stasis\u0022 as evaporated water. To increase entropy, that energy must be released. How to release that energy: condensing the water (which in itself releases energy), forming rain, which releases most of its kinetic energy again as heat when it smashes into the surface. However, when having pure water, that condensation is rather inefficient. One needs some contaminant, a disturbance, to nucleate the condensation. Once that nucleation has happened tho, condensation is inevitable, your cloud of water vapor rapidly condenses into rain drops, and entropy will increase much faster than without contaminants in the sky. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELife is basically that disturbance. Life converts sunlight super-efficiently into (waste) heat. Once one has life, it\u0027s probably quite inevitable that it spreads and catalyzes that entropy increase all over your environment. Just like our drop of rain - which is highly ordered on a local level as compared to the unstructured mess of a cloud of gas - life _itself_ tho is highly structured. It\u0027s probably difficult to get life in the first place, but once it is there, it will likely rapidly colonize your entire planet. (\u0022Rapidly\u0022 is of course a relative term). I wouldn\u0027t say it\u0027s however inevitable life will arise by definition, as there will be some requirements for its formation. Just like rain requires the correct mix of vapor pressure, saturation (humidity) and temperature no matter whether there is a nucleation, life requires some (so far mostly unknown) general requirements to exist. Unlike our rain analogy, however, life can adapt, and it is inevitable it WILL adapt and actually become ever better at its job once it exists. That\u0027s evolution for you. Everything that can self-replicate and self-mutate can and will evolve; that\u0027s pure and simple logic. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for viruses, I entirely agree with you it\u0027s rather arbitrary to not include them into \u0022life\u0022. They do carry genetic information, evolve, replicate and mutate. However, it would be ignorant to ignore the fact that they are indeed different from canonical life. They rely on other living things to replicate and mutate. They don\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Eself-\u003C/em\u003Ereplicate and and \u003Cem\u003Eself-\u003C/em\u003Emutate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
