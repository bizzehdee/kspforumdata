Some of you have undoubtedly seen [this page](http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/spacewardetect.php#nostealth) at the atomic rocket website, and been sorely disappointed by what you read. Back in the day, I was a fan of the stealth warship archetype that was defined by the USS sulaco. When I read that page several years ago, I couldn\u0027t believe that something as weak the space shuttles OMS engines (which have a thrust of just 26,700 newtons) could be detected past the orbit of mars! This didn\u0027t seem intuitively possible to me, so I pushed it out of my mind.\n\nRecently, though, I\u0027ve started to look back on this topic and realize that I brushed it aside too quickly. The ability to detect the exhaust plume of a rocket at tens or hundreds of millions of km with an infrared telescope is a major problem if nations are ever planning to wage war in space. I looked at [\u0022\\]the math](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.arts.sf.science/-E6r2F8rgnQ%5B151-175) by john schilling which claims to prove this, and discovered that a 2 meter IR telescope is so sensitive, it can detect a single RCS on the space shuttle firing at a range of 15 million km. I don\u0027t have the talent to verify whether this is true or not, but again, it seems pretty unbelievable!\n\nOne thing thats not clear is whether john is referring to the primary RCS (thrust of 3870 newtons) or the vernier RCS (thrust of 106 newtons). Does anyone know the math behind how infrared telescopes work? Is it just a linear equation, I.E, you half the heat signature and decrease the detection range by half, or is it something more complex? Also, would using a very cold jet of gas forced out by mechanical pressure be more stealthy than a chemical rocket using superheated propellent? I will appreciate any answers you can give!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-29T03:12:19Z\u0022 title=\u002203/29/2015 03:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jrphilps**"},{"CreatedByName":"VirtualCLD","CreatedById":81542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T04:02:14Z","Content":"IR light follows the same maxwell equations as visible light. It just has a longer wavelength. Therefore there are a lot of similarities with visible optics, but there\u0027s a lot of gotchas. In visible, you tend to spot objects based on reflections from a light source (such as the sun). In IR, everything emits lights, so you are looking for the light source itself. Since everything emits lights, your telescope focal plane is typically cooled... cryogenically. Sometimes parts of the optics themselves have to be cooled to, so as not to \u0022blind\u0022 your camera (equivalent to visible optics that have black parts where you don\u0027t want to see light reflections).\n\nAll that being said, both visible and IR sensors can be very sensitive.

If they can detect the vernier RCS at that distance, then all attempts at stealth are pretty much screwed. But if its just the primary RCS they can detect, you might have some wiggle room. In theory, your ships could use small chemical engines to burn for a long time and then coast, without being detected. The only way for an astromilitary to counter this would be to field literally thousands of space telescopes like WISE. The inner solar system has a radius of 450 billion meters, and a volume of 3.82 \u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D 10 35 meters.

If the enemy has IR telescopes that are any good, you\u0027re definitely going to get spotted at some distance even without the engine.\n\nThat being said, how close you can get and not get spotted can make all the difference, especially if there\u0027s any bodies you can make a burn behind.

This satellite would need some sort of control authority to always keep the stone facing the target and a narrow beam laser communicator sending packets of data only during the periods when beam would be impossible to detect.
