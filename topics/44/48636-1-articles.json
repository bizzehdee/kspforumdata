At one point in time, the satellite cancels all local rotational moments in relation to earth (with gyros/RCS/KSP timewarp). From that point on (provided there are no further attitude control actions from the satellite), does the orientation of the satellite stay fixed in relation to the universe (A) or does it rotate and constantly faces earth with one side?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/z0xWvT0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022z0xWvT0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease do not discuss how KSC simulates this, i\u0027d like to discuss real physics here. Topics covered in our heaty discussion today touched tidal locking, force fields, water-in-a-bucket-swung-on-a-rope, ISS active attitude control and Nerf gun fights, but no side could prevail. Do satellites automatically tidal lock to earth? Do they need active attitude control to keep facing earth? Or do they float around their orbits with a precisely-calculated fixed rotation speed that keeps them oriented towards earth without further force/torque input? What happens when they stop this rotation once? Does it depend on orbit height and/or vessel mass or size?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a very clear opinion on those matters (which i am not going to post to not bias this discussion in a certain direction), i just couldn\u0027t find references for it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"check","CreatedById":71875,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T17:16:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf we\u0027re talking about a special case, spherical satellite (with even mass distribution), then I think the answer is A.
