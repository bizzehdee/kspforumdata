A well known piece of history is the fact that scientists feared that the trinity test would lead to the atmosphere undergoing a chain reaction of fusion. This was fortunately not the case, however it would be far from the last time we ignited significant portions of the atmosphere. Ivy Mike\u00A0 was the first in a series of thermonuclear weapon detonated, oftentimes called a nuke, the soviets had the best description for it as a \u0022thermonuclear complex\u0022. This design utilized the teller ulam design, which basically allowed you to chain together nuclear weapons with increasing efficiency. Thanks to the stationary nature, liquid deterium was used as the fuel due to the need for cooling not being a concern. Due to the nature of this new design, no one was certain how much force it would bring before detonation. After the detonation, Edward Teller in California detected it on a nearby seismometer, and proceeded to telegram a head of a los alamos project \u0022Its a boy\u0022. The project by all means went far above expectations, being the fourth largest bomb detonated by the us to this date. While this design was far from the most efficient design, its raw size more then enabled its success. With the data given by Ivy Mike, the United States decided to do the first series of thermonuclear weapons testing, Operation Castle.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf Ivy Mike is to be described as a thermonuclear complex, Castle Bravo would best be described as a thermonuclear building. While still taking place on the marshall islands, the forcibly relocated natives of this island were significantly closer to the tests. Due to either apathy to the people living there, incompetence, or some combination, no one bothered to calculate the effect of wind on fallout. While significantly smaller and far more optimized then Ivy Mike, it was still a far fetch from the mobile and spherical weapon we tend to associate with nukes. This test was expected to be only 5 megatons of force. As nuclear weapons experience hotter temperatures and pressures, not only does more of there mass undergo fusion, more fusion reactions that require higher energies occur, meaning that the yield to mass ratio can increase essentially exponentially. The test was triple of what was expected, the largest bomb detonated by the US to this day. US sailors and servicemen nearby experienced radiation. Children of the nearby tribes seeing the fallout, with no one in the tribes aware of the testing, mistook the fallout for snow and began playing with it. Due to the US not warning basically anyone of these tests, Japan got a grim reminder of there fate just 7 years earlier when a Japanese fishing boat was also subject to significant radiation. It took 3 days for the tribes of the area to be relocated once again away from this radiation, after this test they were subjected to a series of tests to better understand the effect of this radiation, unaware of the nature of these tests. The radiation this test and many others still effect its inhabitants today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile Castle Bravo was far greater then its expected yield, the same could not be said for Castle Koon. Castle Koon was designed by the same place Edward Teller was working at, the Livermore branch of the University of California (now better known as Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory). Utilizing an exotic secondary stage, the design was a dud due to a design defect. Due to this, the planned follow up test of this design was cancelled. Seemingly due to this cancellation, we get brought back to Edward Teller. Likely in spite, Edward Teller proposed Project Sundial, while the specifics aren\u0027t known, this device would have likely used the chaining of the teller ulam design to an extreme. Sundial was composed of two projects, Gnomon, which was a one gigaton primary bomb, and Sundial, which would cover the rest of the ten gigatons. Alex Wellerstien, the nuclear historian behind NUKEMAP with its ten gigatons of force, calculates that sundial would be powerful enough to set all of the UK and Ireland on fire. This device would likely rely on nearly pure fusion energy, and due to the intense temperatures involved there would likely be an extremely high rate of fusion. We don\u0027t know the specifics of how this device would work, and this is leaving the history territory and going into personal speculation territory, but I think I have an idea on some of the specifics. Before the Teller Ulam design, Edward Teller had the idea now known as the Classical super. In short, it would be a conventional fission weapon, and the temperature from that alone would be enough to trigger a runaway chain reaction of nearby pure deuterium. This didnt quite work with our nukes, however it could possibly work if you had extremely high temperatures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe interesting thing about sundial is the fact that it needs a separate extremely powerful nuke for it to work, while teller ulam design can chain stages together, why would you design a 9 gigaton secondary stage and a one gigaton primary stage separately? In fact, why was Gnomon described as a primary stage in the first place? Teller Ulam design is also known as the Sausage design because you can link a bunch of similar stages to get your desired effect. In order to get up to that gigaton metric, you\u0027d likely need many stages of nukes to get up to this point, and at that point why break that staging chain up, having it described as two separate stages is a really interesting detail. While we may never know, I have a feeling (emphasis on feeling, the specifics on how it would work is classified) that Sundial utilized a form of the classic super design, using Gnomon as the primer, and having Sundial be basically pure deuterium (and likely tritium) undergoing a runaway reaction. If this were to be the case, and this design were to work then this means that this design would likely have far greater efficiencies then current designs due to not needing nearly as many structural components. If my math is correct, a complete fusion of a ton of mixture of deterium and tritium would yield 92 megatons of tnt, while it\u0027s unreasonable to expect all reactants to fuse, this also doesn\u0027t account for the additional yield of additional non deuterium-tritium fusion. All things considered, ballparking here but it isn\u0027t reasonable to expect a yield to mass ratio of 50 Mt/t if not higher., bringing the weight down to only 200 tons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-09-01T00:15:49Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2022 12:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Strawberry\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-09-01T04:11:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224169507\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022198828\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221661991201\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022222150\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Strawberry\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, Strawberry said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf my math is correct, a complete fusion of a ton of mixture of deterium and tritium would yield 92 megatons of tnt, while it\u0027s unreasonable to expect all reactants to fuse, this also doesn\u0027t account for the additional yield of additional non deuterium-tritium fusion.
