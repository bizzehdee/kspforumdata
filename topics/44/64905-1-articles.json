In turn, these electric currents will create their own magnetic fields in the junk. These effects may be tiny, but the timescale is large.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, the induced magnetic field could lead to an attractive force between two objects. If their velocity vectors were not too different (think docking) the induced field could stick them together. There is also the tiny gravitational contribution that will always be attractive at all ranges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOutside the magnetic field, we have solar wind. Although I can\u0027t find any literature supporting my guess, I seriously suspect that solar wind could ionize metals over time. This would lead to a net charge and thus a repulsive interaction between any of the space junk... likely greater than the gravitational attraction (it doesn\u0027t take much charge to beat gravity between very light objects). On the plus side, this may kick some of it into a lower orbit inside the Earth\u0027s magnetic field.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStray atoms: Fortunately, these atoms are subject to the same gravity as everything else and would be living in orbits. I think the net effect of drag from these guys would be zero or very close to zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, here is my guess: If a space junk satellite were to coalesce, it would be somewhere between the upper reaches of the atmosphere and the upper reaches of the magnetosphere... probably somewhere near the top of the magnetosphere due to the stuff getting kicked down by solar wind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd as far as the asteroid belt coalescing into a planetismal? Totally negatory.
