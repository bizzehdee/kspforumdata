A team of scientists have a device that appears to violate the laws of physics as we know it... but they don\u0027t know how it works, what it is doing, what new theory is needed to explain it or if it is even a red herring and something entirely different is happening. While the people working on the project might have grand ideas that further violate the laws of physics; it is really just a matter of them being excited about their work.
