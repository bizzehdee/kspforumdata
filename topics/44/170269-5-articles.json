And then if you combine red matter and green matter you get dark matter. If you combine antimatter and matter you get an explosion (white energy). There I explained it. ROFL\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSee with quantum mechanics an n-dimensional states you can create any excrement and make it fly the number of possible complex vectors you can use is infinite. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere: \u03B4(x-y) = 0 at all values except when x = y and at x=y the [integral of \u03B4(x-y) over x=y] = 1. That means the difference between x-y =0 and the amplitude at x=y is infinity. This idea is the reasoning behind heisenberg uncertainty, the momentum of a particle is a continuous function and the position of a particle is infinitely discrete, bam and you have infinity x zero = 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis goes on until someone comes up and tells you something is missing. For example, \u0022Oh Mr. Newton can you explain to me how gravity is pulling that apple to the Earth, what is the description of the demon that is pulling it\u0022. And despite all his calculus and math he could not describe the demon. Nor could he describe why light shot strait down at a piece of glass always reflects a tiny bit of light, or the banding pattern when looking.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo finally you get to the point where you\u0027ve created a whole new type of math and physics and you can explain everything (i.e. the theory of everything) and if the math allows it, it can happen, and if the math doesn\u0027t you create imaginary elements and vectors and matrices, and then if that does not explain it then it cannot exist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I found true with modern physics is that you see a behavior and you create something mathematical that explains, and if that doesn\u0027t work well enough you create some that violates mathematics. For example you create Zero, then negative numbers, then imaginary numbers. Then imaginary dimensions, and if you create enough of these imaginary things you can explain anything, and then you can say \u0027we never seen any phenomena that violates it\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what they are missing is the description are is a set of imaginary vectors that when added to current QM explains \u0027red matter\u0027. Thats all\u00A0 they need. Oh I forgot to add, red matter combined with green matter is always dark. You have to capture dark matter with quantum space time and at certain density red matter and green matter will separate, at which point you can collect the red matter and use it to coerce other forms of matter, like hydrogen in space.

The problem quantum teleportation is that you have to have a device, a computer on both ends, not just to destroy the original copy, but you also have to provide the matter that has been teleported. So basically you cannot teleport to a hole inside a planet. Nor can you do a cryptic teleport to another ship (say a klingon ship in the The Search for Spock). The second point is that teleporting someone is essentially violating two laws, you can\u0027t kill someone or assist in their suicide, and you can\u0027t clone someone. So lets say your transporter fails, you just murdered someone. And there is nothing to stop me from making two or three clones (although QM prevents this you could make two slightly lower resolution, but in the case of molecular assemblies if you had the resolution to build a clone to begin with you are working at the 10\u003Csup\u003E-13\u003C/sup\u003E meter level anyway. So you could basically get some of the information and then get some more information. You must kill the original copy, but once they are in the pattern buffer you could make 10 captain kirks and 10 spocks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"monstah","CreatedById":95210,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-31T22:56:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223282497\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022170269\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221517433703\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002261025\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KSK\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, KSK said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/147660-maxwellsdemon/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022147660\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/147660-maxwellsdemon/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@MaxwellsDemon\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0said everything I need to say, especially the part about films like Gravity, falling into a sort of uncanny valley where most of the science is realistic but that only makes the unrealistic parts stick out more\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWonderful way of putting it.
