A distributed NG launch (1 with Orion, another \u0022naked\u0022 upper stage) can get probably Orion to LLO (assuming the upper stage can mitigate boil off to do the LOI burn). Might have to use a couple hundred m/s of SM props, unsure (depends on dry mass of NG upper stage, and Be-3U I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E).
