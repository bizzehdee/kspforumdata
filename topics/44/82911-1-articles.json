Robotic missions have performed much more science than manned missions to Mars, simply because there are no manned missions to Mars. The reason for that is that it is too damn expensive to do a manned mission to Mars. The scientific return simply isn\u0027t worth the investment compared to a robotic mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA manned expedition would be limited in terms of radius around the landing site and duration of the stay, a few kilometers at most, and a couple of months. While humans could do more sampling in a week than a robot, they would reach diminishing returns after a week because they would only be picking up more of the same rocks in the same area for months until the launch window. Science isn\u0027t about the quantity of rocks that you pick up. It\u0027s more about the variety of samples from various areas of interest and over longer durations. By comparison, a number of robots can cover a wider area of a longer period with less maintenance, risk, and at a fraction of the cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHumans would also miss all the long duration data, such as weather, climate, seasonal variations or sismological activity. Humans also have this pesky habit of spending a large part of their time on sleep, hygiene and feeding. All of these activities require equipment that would be better spent on science, if that\u0027s what your mission is for. Humans are also dirty, messy, clumsy, fragile, and they make mistakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe actual science return depends on the equipment that the human crew carries, but that same equipment can very well be operated by a robot and sent to perform the exact same experiment for much cheaper. There is simply no single experiment that requires human presence that could not be teleoperated from Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn science, you design an experiment around a hypothesis, not around who operates the experiment. The only scientific value of sending humans to live on Mars is to learn about living on Mars, which is only useful if we have a reason to live on Mars other that to study living on Mars.

Curiosity has a top speed of something like 2-5 miles per hour, but it will never actually go that fast, the wheels are too fragile. That speed is mostly a byproduct of the wheel motor design for helping it with things like sandy ground and such. A human can walk around, over obstacles that Curiosity would never move near. The human can do some analysis that the rover cannot. For example, they climb to the top of the hill and see two boulders separated from each other, they can possibly guess which one is more useful to walk to. Just things like this result in the human being able to do more work simply because as automated as the rovers are, they cannot do analysis like that to as deep a degree as humans can.

Curiosity operators only send coordinates and the robot figures out the best route to get there autonomously. The lag isn\u0027t a problem. In a decade or two, exploration robots are only going to get more and more capable, closing the gap between manned and unmanned exploration. By the time we are capable of sending a manned mission, we will have robots that can crawl, climb, dig, fly, send samples back to Earth, and fix themselves, which would negate any advantage of humans over machines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Just out of curiosity, what are your feelings on Apollo?

Sure, as a one-off accomplishment, the Apollo landings stand out as being among the greatest in history. But robotic missions like the Voyagers, Cassini, and even MSL are up there too. Why put all of our eggs in one basket? For the cost of a manned Mars mission (or even a replacement ISS, for that matter), we could easily fund robotic lander missions to Jupiter\u0027s moons, Titan, and probably even the Uranus and Neptune systems. Sure a manned Mars landing would be an incredible accomplishment, but I don\u0027t think it is worth sacrificing the scientific ROI and \u0022inspirational\u0022 PR value of a whole spectrum of robotic missions for it.

The issue with NASA is that their goal has always been about exploring space, not exactly developing it. Incidental to their goals of exploration through being hired for projects, or having some budget to push around, they have managed to develope some industry. But we are now at the point where companies can begin to do things like asteroid mining and the like (soon anyway, go planetary resources!). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is going to be interesting is that in the near term asteroid mining is going to have two sides to its business. Side number one is of course the rare earth metals, but this side is very complicated. Theoretically they will be able to quickly flood the Earth based markets with product and crash the prices (China is going to object big time), but this is not immediately in their best interests. Chances are likely that they will manage the rare earth metals much like diamonds are managed. In reality they are not very rare and thus shouldn\u0027t be expensive, but artificial rarity keeps the prices high. Oh for sure they will undercut places like china, say something like slicing off 1/3 the price, that way everybody goes to them. But up until other companies get in on it (and probably form some horrible conglomerate of asteroid barons) they can just kind of do what they want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second side of this is going to be iron and the like. Chances are for the immediate period of time they will do one of two things, either stockpile it in orbit for later use or send a bunch down for some money. Eventually though the big money for them will be in orbital refineries and production plants. Even if all they do is charge materials costs at 2/3 of the price for getting similar goods into orbit, they will make a killing because that is a cost savings of millions for everybody else. More likely, they will actually scale their price with their production because there is no market in space yet that they need to worry about disrupting and it would be to their advantage to make it as cheap as possible to encourage more customers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce that happens, then things get easier for NASA as their probes and ships suddenly become much cheaper.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-28T17:16:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mazon Del\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mazon Del\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBut we are now at the point where companies can begin to do things like asteroid mining and the like (soon anyway, go planetary resources!). .\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m curious how PR and similar enterprises are going to bring mined resources back to Earth. It\u0027s hard to find info on this, but the Shuttle could return maybe 20 tons of cargo from orbit, and I suspect it had the most capability of any spacecraft ever launched. (AFAIK, currently there are only 2 operating spacecraft that can return cargo from space: Dragon and Soyuz.) 20 tons of iron is about 2.5 cubic meters, which is about 0.00009% of total current world production of iron ore, and would be worth about US$2000. It\u0027s hard to imagine how it could be profitable, unless we\u0027re talking an industrial-scale operation. Total global rare earth production is, at present, at about 100,000 tons. To match that you\u0027d need thousands of launches per year. In 2013, there were a total of 81 attempted rocket launches to space worldwide (including 3 which failed). In the 1970\u0027s (the decade with the most rocket launches of all time), there averaged about 123 launches per year.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-28T17:19:15Z\u0022 title=\u002208/28/2014 05:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Mr Shifty\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
