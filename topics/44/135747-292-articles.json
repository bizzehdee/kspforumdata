So let\u0027s posit a cap of $100M on flight costs, or maybe $400M for a disposable shot (which would only really be necessary for a single monolithic payload that can\u0027t be broken down into sub-elements massing less than 300 tons\u2014candidates for which, see below).

About half the mass of a comsat in GEO is fuel, used for positioning (satellites in geosynchronous orbit drift, very gradually, away from their parking longitude). Their power output is constrained by the solar panels they can carry and the size of their emitters. So a big GEO comsat today is on the order of 5-8 tons. A current advanced geosynchronous comsat such as \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inmarsat-4A_F4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EInmarsat-4A F4\u003C/a\u003E has a 12 kW electrical system; this obviously puts a ceiling on its broadcast power; but ITS raises the bar so high that it effectively disappears. The first post-ITS generation of comsats could have power outputs in the megawatt range if necessary. So I\u0027m going to guess that 1-2 decades after ITS flies, we\u0027re going to see satellite phones converge with regular cellphones in terms of size, convenience, and bandwidth capacity (although they\u0027re going to cost more). Upshot: terrestrial 5G and hypothetical 6G high bandwidth service will look more like municipal-area gigabit wifi, and your phone will cut over to satellite bandwidth if you roam into rural areas (or even suburban areas, by the US definition).
