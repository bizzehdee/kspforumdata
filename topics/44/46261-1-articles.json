So they were using engines with an ISP of only 60?? Are they referring to their reaction control thrusters maybe? Does any of this make any sense? Do the characters have any idea what they\u0027re spouting off about? Or are the show producers even trying to maintain a modicum of accuracy in these values? If this were any other show, I\u0027d not be surprised by such ridiculous nonsense, but Planetes takes such great care in their realism that I\u0027m not so sure they don\u0027t have some reasoning behind their figures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you geeks think?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-17T23:43:57Z\u0022 title=\u002209/17/2013 11:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by thereaverofdarkness\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-18T00:04:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EQuick googling \u0022specific impulse 600000\u0022 produced the following paper \u003Ca href=\u0022http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/87460/1333_1.pdf?sequence=2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAntiproton Triggered Fusion Propulsion for Interstellar Missions\u003C/a\u003E which seems to indicate that an antimatter-catalyzed fusion nuclear pulse rocket can achieve 600,000 seconds Isp if the entire fuel pellet fuses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaven\u0027t watched any Planetes, so I have no idea what type of technology\u0027s available, though the \u0022Tandem Mirror Engine\u0022 appears to be a reference to the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandem_Mirror_Experiment\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETandem Mirror Experiment\u003C/a\u003E in 80\u0027s fusion research.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NGTOne","CreatedById":55972,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-18T00:31:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fission_fragment_rocket\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFission fragment rockets\u003C/a\u003E can have an Isp anywhere in the range of 100,000 to 1,000,000 (depending on design).
