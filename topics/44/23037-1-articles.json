Let\u0027s talk about those. Actually, I\u0027d like to explain in particular one special type of drive that I\u0027ve kinda conceptualized as a staple in my own sci-fi universe, and I want to know what you guys think of it. It may kinda already exist, but then again it may not. I don\u0027t know all the interstellar methods ever proposed. But here\u0027s mine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t like sci-fi, now\u0027s the time to get out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe drive itself is a drive based on energy/matter conversion and that F=ma. I call it the \u0022Instantaneous Point-Condensation Jump Drive Array\u0022 but Jayda drive sounds cooler. Another name for it may be \u0022Quantum Phase Shift Mass Acceleration/Deceleration Drive\u0022. These both generally describe what it does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe drive works by taking the ship and essentially reducing all of its mass into an energous point in space. The energy is encoded with all the mass and energy for the entire vessel, in one single point in space. The drive then sets a frequency for the energy to oscillate at, so that it becomes very unstable and will collapse its energy form back into mass in a short period of time. The ship also, at this exact point in time, annihilates a small amount of fuel to impart a force upon the currently near-massless point in space. This will accelerate the point to a massive speed, as we all know from quantum physics that energy does have SOME mass, albeit tiny. This is where the resonance-stability breakdown frequency comes into play. Each distance for each amount of mass has a specific breakdown frequency. After a short and period of travel, the energous point breaks down and unfolds into its original massive form. Here\u0027s the basic layout of a jump between two points:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;Set coordinates for desired destination\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;Determine exact distance to desired destination\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;Obtain exact starting mass of vehicle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;Determine how much fuel will need to be annihilated to impart the correct amount of force to the condensed form\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;Obtain exact ending mass of vehicle after some fuel is annihilated\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;Determine the resonance stability breakdown frequency of the jump\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;Annihilate some fuel to impart a force while at the same time, doing the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;Set up a resonance cascade to create oscillations in energy \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;The cascade will automatically convert surrounding mass into energy and condense it to a single point (good idea to use this in a vacuum, by the way)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;Point will be accelerated to its destination\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;Resonant frequency of energous point will break down and unfold the structure back into its original form\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;Verify the jump was successful\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EForeseeable problems:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The jump may be off by several kilometers, due to the limitations of the precision of the measurement devices and propulsion methods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Drive would be heavy and ungainly, large ships only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Expensive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Probably a bit risky, since a resonance cascade was in fact exactly what caused the Black Mesa incident.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-People unlikely to get on board (no pun intended) as there would be a popular, yet untrue, belief that a quantum phase change would, in fact, wipe out their current stream of consciousness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Unknown relativistic effects.

So, now, where does the mass go? When matter collapses into a black hole, it doesn\u0027t suddenly lose mass. Also, black holes with masses equivalent to that of starships (say on the order of 10k metric tons for an aircraft-carrier sized ship up to a few million or so for something bigger) will be short-lived.

You\u0027re somewhat caught in a no-mans land where people who know their stuff will look at this and say \u0022nonsense.\u0022 There are a lot of sci-fi authors who make this same mistake; the unfortunate consequence of this is that it is now very difficult for me to read and enjoy sci-fi. I guess my advice is to not try to go into so much detail regarding your drive - accept that it\u0027s fantasy, and use a lot of hand-wavium. The alternative is to sit down with a real physicist (or, better yet, learn physics yourself) and go over your ideas with a fine-toothed comb for feasibility, but this is a lot of work that is likely not going to be central to whatever story you want to tell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrankly, this is the whole \u0022soft\u0022 versus \u0022hard\u0022 sci-fi debate.
