Earth is more or less a closed system. Resources don\u0027t disappear.\n\nEarth is nothing like a closed system. Photosynthesis, which is the reaction plants use to sequester solar energy in the form of chemical bonds in carbohydrate molecules, is an endothermic reaction, which means it requires an energy input. Generally, that energy comes from the sun. Oil and other fossil fuels are formed through a long chain of a variety of chemical and physical reactions, but carbohydrates are the materials those reactions work on. Combustion is the process of getting that energy back out breaking hydrocarbons back into CO2 and water. Even if the cycle were reversible at that point (it\u0027s not, c.f. 2nd Law of Thermodynamics), it certainly wouldn\u0027t be after we use that energy to heat food or move cars around or light our houses. Think of our fossil fuel reserves as a giant battery that took hundreds of millions of years to charge. We\u0027ll deplete the battery within a couple of centuries and that\u0027s it; it\u0027s not coming back on any timescale that concerns us.\n\nI see fusion as a potential solution, but it\u0027s not a panacea. Even if we can get fusion going before fossil fuels are gone and before climate change wrecks havoc on technological industry and supply chains etc, (note: without high-tech factories and global supply routes and foundries and hundreds of other components of our technological civilization, fusion will never ever happen) it will require a massive change in how we get and use energy. Specifically, it\u0027s hard to imagine how overseas and airborne shipping works in that paradigm. Trucking disappears and we go back to using trains for continental transport, which means that paved intercontinental roadways probably are left to decay. (Space travel, needless to say, is impossible without fossil fuels.) Everything becomes more local, prices rise, standards of living fall, and we get used to living in a world that, while higher-tech, is probably somewhat similar to the early 19th century . . . until big-agriculture collapses due to climate change and 8 or 9 billion humans strip-mine the biosphere for food as we starve to death.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T17:49:28Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 05:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mr Shifty**"},{"CreatedByName":"peadar1987","CreatedById":81207,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T18:45:12Z","Content":"Not true.

So their children will grow up in a less than ideal environment. Only the sons and daughters of beautiful people who are also intelligent will grow up in a environment that allows them to fully express themselves. So before long we\u0027ll be overrun by super beautiful, ultra intelligent ubermenschen.\n\u003E See, I can make baseless claims about the future of human evolution as well.\n\nIt isn\u0027t baseless, such as yours isn\u0027t baseless... but the retort doesn\u0027t invalidate the argument. You ignore that the ideal environment is not needed for procreation to be successful, nor does the environment need to be ideal to produce viable offspring that again mate in the future. \n\nAfrica and those wonderful \u0022we need your money\u0022 commercials routinely demonstrates the ability of humanity to survive in even the worst conditions. If we talk truthfully about poverty and welfare, we do see that while we abhor the idea of abusing the system for personal wealth, we also feel we cannot let the children just \u0022die off\u0022 due to social darwinism.\n\nTrying to make the future of evolution into a creationist argument *is* invalid; even as a starch scientist you concede that we procreate for beauty, but trust in \u0022Lord Darwin\u0022 that your evolution will produce a being of superior intellect. lower-middle class is enough to go above the poverty line, and lower-middle class aren\u0027t supremely intelligent beings... WHAT are we, as a species, doing to SELECTIVELY BREED for intelligence? Because the basis of evolution is not creationism, the basis isn\u0027t even survival of the fittest... the basis is procreation and the ability to produce a successful generation.\n\nYou could evolve with the capacity and the drive to produce more babies than other humans (for sake of argument, let\u0027s say 20 in a lifetime), those babies, if viable, would thus overpower the \u0022normal\u0022 line of genetics due to rate of procreation (and if it is a dominate gene). How does this benefit mankind? How does it ensure survival? It doesn\u0027t. But it is a completely valid form of evolution.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I used a poor choice of words in the poll and in my original post. Rather than saying \u0022Humanity\u0022 I should have said \u0022Any life, intelligence, or culture directly descended from or created by humanity.\u0022\n\u003E You all make some great points: A billion years from now, a negligible chance that there will be a recognizable human civilization. Culture, technology, and biology all change, and changes in one of those cause changes in the other two, so it\u0027s inevitable, given enough time, that humanity will cease to exist *in it\u0027s current form.* But I think that *descendants* of humanity will exist for a long time to come. And by descendants, I don\u0027t just mean biological parent-to-child descendants. We could develop artificial life or uplift existing species. We could create intelligent robots that reproduce and evolve like life does. We could all life inside a giant computer simulation. And then all of these creations of ours could do the same thing again. But you would still end up with a descendant of some sort from current humanity. This is what I meant in the original poll.\n\nI do like the new wording... what... residues, of humanity will remain.\n\nThis is a very popular subject in Sci-Fi, especially when we talk of what \u0022symbolics of humanity\u0022 our decedents retain.\n\nCuriosity,\n\nIngenuity,\n\nLove,\n\nCompassion\n\nOf course, this gets into the deep metaphysical notion of what humanity actually is very quickly.\n\nI don\u0027t see us ever leaving the solar system. We were born here, we will die here... but it is possible for us to develop extremely efficient probes with terrifyingly low power requirements that may drift through space, hoping to one day find life. It would be interesting if, by this time, we refined our ability to create an AI; something with the traits we identify as human, to spread our heritage across the stars.

With heavy water as moderator you can even use natural uranium as fuel. Thorium is three times as abundant as uranium, and can also be used. Current designs burn about 5% of their nuclear fuel before they can no longer maintain fission, and it is estimated that there is between 50 and 70 years of uranium left economically recoverable at current levels of consumption. There is no reason at all why you can\u0027t approach 100% burnup of a fuel source with breeder reactors and fuel reprocessing, so using known fuel sources, we could relatively easily squeeze 80 times the life out of our uranium reserves, much more if we\u0027re willing to spend a little more money.\n\n-Solar power is quite comfortably capable of providing for all our energy needs. All of Europe could be powered by a solar array in the Sahara and an HVDC transmission line. Using a eutectic salt as a heat reservoir could smooth output and give dispatchability. Would it be more expensive than digging dead plants out of the ground? Definitely. Would we do it if it was the cheapest way to continue to get our energy? In a heartbeat.

This seems pretty likely to me -- intelligence isn\u0027t a pre-determined outcome of evolution; there\u0027s no evidence that it\u0027s particularly adaptive in the long run. And even though we\u0027ve been more or less the way we are for a few hundred thousand years, we\u0027ve only had the capability to make ourselves known to the wider universe for about 100 of those years.\n\nI\u0027d like to point out that civilization as we know it also isn\u0027t a predetermined outcome of intelligence. i.e. just because you have the capacity for space travel, doesn\u0027t mean you need to seek it out. Native Americans and Africans are strong point here as their civilizations evolved very differently from European Civilizations.\n\nIndian Civilizations, being empathic and having respect for the land, European viewing the world to be inheritance from God to Humans.\n\n**Even now, we insult people who would choose to live in any civilization other than our own**, calling them \u0022backwards\u0022 or otherwise implicating they\u0027re of lesser intellectual capacity than the rest of society.\n\nThere\u0027s no denying that the labour was primarily manual, but we don\u0027t call our Olympiads idiots, do we? We acknowledge that it is more than just strength, that it takes SKILL, the ability to coordinate yourself for short periods of time processing a large amount of data concerning the physical environment and correcting for that error in your output.\n\nI think it would be extremely interesting what happens if we ever find intelligent life that chose a different path than us. \u0022To serve man\u0022 is a reflection on our society to treat \u0022different\u0022 societies as lesser, as animals. How would we treat others should we find them to be too different than us?"}]}
