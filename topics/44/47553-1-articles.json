It\u0027s gas and it\u0027s dissolved in magma. When magma reaches close to the surface where the pressure is lower, gases froth it up, like when you open a bottle of carbonated beverage or when a diver with nitrogen-saturated blood climbs fast to the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be very hard to use it, almost impossible.

Google IO and you will see that it is essentially covered by S compounds. Therefore, it is likely that \u0022volcanic degassing\u0022 in Io is mostly sulfur. As for use, it\u0027s not a mater of thermal conductivity or predictability. Steam from volcanic centres on earth can be used to produce energy. The major challenge in Io would be technical and material science. Sulfur is highly corrosive to metals so any part in contact with the sulfur would need to be made of ceramics. But that is a trivial thing given that if we manage to get to Io to build anything on there is already the major hurdle. Conversely what would you like to go to Io? Ganymede seems a much better place to try anything! It has water! lots of it and I\u0027m sure there is a temperature gradient between the ice surface and the liquid water under that thick icy crust. You can probably build a thermal pump that takes advantage of that...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-11T18:27:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not extrapolating anything. Sulfur dioxide has constant properties. Chemical properties don\u0027t change depending on where the matter is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAside from the fact that sulfur dioxide is not magma (molten rocks), using a gas that tends to erupt violently from a planetary body would be madness. Not only its thermal conductivity is poor (it\u0027s a gas), it would rip apart any infrastructure laid on the terrain. I\u0027d rather sink some heat exchangers into molten sulfur, gently flowing from the depths.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
