Dawn took 7 years to reach Ceres, but that was with a flyby of Mars and a fourteen-month orbital vacation around Vesta, and it used ions which obviously are slow. We could reach 2021 QM1 quickly enough in a pinch. Because Earth\u0027s orbit has so little eccentricity, it doesn\u0027t matter where in our orbit we launch from. Leaving Earth orbit and going from 1 AU to 2.6 AU will cost around 4 km/s of \u25B2v BLEO and require a coast period of around 14 months, but that\u0027s if we want to do a minimum-energy Hohmann transfer and actually match velocity to 2021 QM1 to use some sort of gravity tractor. On the other hand, if we are hitting it with a simple impactor or a nuke, we can do a much faster transfer. It may or may not cost more \u25B2v for the fast transfer since 2021QM1\u0027s orbit is so eccentric.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-19T15:08:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAssuming 3-4 years to set up and launch the mission and a pure impactor mechanism, we could reach 2021QM1 in under 5 years.

No. You still need a pretty significant kick from that trajectory to orbit and then de-orbit the payload, and if you squeeze another stage into this ICBM\u0027s payload, what\u0027s left for orbital mass is tiny. They might be able to put a small satellite into space with it, but not a human. Especially not with any chance of returning back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHwasong-17 has very similar performance to early R-7. That one had a touch shorter range with a heavier payload. And indeed, the Sputnik rocket was effectively a modification of R-7, whereas the Vostok rocket that carried the first human flight mission was a significant upgrade. On top of that, R-7 was built from the start to be upgradable to heavier payloads, in part, helped by the four booster design. I don\u0027t think Hwasong-17 would be easy to upgrade to a human flight capable rocket without attaching boosters to it. SRBs might be a cheap option to achieve that, though. These weren\u0027t as viable of an option in the 60s as they are today. It would still be a huge project, and a very unsafe one under the best circumstance. The safety margin on something like this would be hair thin with basically no spare mass for any safety features.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
