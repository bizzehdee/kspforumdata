I used to think that it was B\u002B, but that doesn\u0027t seem possible... It\u0027s not electronic capture for obvious reasons, so that leaves B- ! But B- seems weird to me : it would mean that the spectrum is from the electrons ! Is it even possible to observe an electron spectrum ? Doesn\u0027t it have to be from electromagnetic waves ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks a lot !\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tg626","CreatedById":112361,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-03T20:05:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.sprawls.org/ppmi2/RADIOTRANS/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.sprawls.org/ppmi2/RADIOTRANS/\u003C/a\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-03T20:12:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tg626\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tg626\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.sprawls.org/ppmi2/RADIOTRANS/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.sprawls.org/ppmi2/RADIOTRANS/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s B- !
