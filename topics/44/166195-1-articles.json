If you step out of the universe and look at a race between light and an object at 99%c, it should read like it would at normal speeds. Light would win the race by that 1%. Presuming the object can actually continue to exceed c, then it would start winning once it overcomes the head start light has.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnless the universe just doesn\u0027t work in a logical way I can\u0027t see any way this wouldn\u0027t be what would happen. This is also why I don\u0027t think FTL breaks causality. With a limited reference frame supposedly you\u0027re breaking it, but it doesn\u0027t take into account that there\u0027s more frames of reference than just space and time, and that ultimately the object doing the travelling (be it energy, light, or physical matter) still has to actually travel a distance as c is not instantaneous. If we try sending signals into our past we might technically do it, but all we\u0027d see in the past is just garbled noise if anything at all.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, that doesn\u0027t handwave the problem of FTL.\u00A0 Time dilation is still a problem obviously for in-universe observers as well as the travelling object. But this doesn\u0027t make exceeding FTL impossible, just means doing so is ineffective as a means of travel; time dilation says that much, and the only way I can think of that might solve that is if we could instantaneously accelerate to superluminal speeds well in excess of c. IE, speeds so fast its indistinguishable\u00A0from teleportation even to the observer outside of the\u00A0universe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd this is why the best odds we have for \u0022FTL\u0022 travel really aren\u0027t FTL travel at all, but rather a way to just get around having to do it that way.\u00A0 Alcubierre (lets remember this is all theoretical here. I think we all know the issues with this) warp, wormhole generation, generational ships, etc.\u00A0 Why engineer some fantastical way to exceed the speed of light and avoid time dilation when we can engineer some less fantastical ways to abuse spacetime or just do it the low tech way and let a 5th generation of descendants be the ones to arrive at the destination?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-06T04:40:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the\u00A0clearest answer I could find:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll the particles that move at the speed of light (e.g. photons) have zero rest mass.

Space-time is not just literal empty space with literally nothing in it and no possible detail. It is actually, when you go right down into the weeds, a rather complex thing. At high relative speeds (in space, speed can only be measured \u0022relative\u0022 to another object, there is no \u0022fixed point\u0022 to measure against) the relative flow of time stats to alter, yes this is for real (eg: GPS satellites need a very accurate clock to work.

Not wrong in the sense that it is completely incorrect, but wrong in the sense that it has since been superseded by modern theories that are \u003Cem\u003Emore correct\u003C/em\u003E. It\u0027s important to understand that all scientific models of the universe are descriptive approximations of how we \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E the universe works based on the observations that have been made, and that new observations can subsequently overturn previous models that fail to account for them. So Newtonian physics is a model that explains the observations that were available to Newton at the time, but failed to adequately explain later observations (most importantly, its inconsistency with Maxwell\u0027s equations of electromagnetism). Special relativity was formulated as a new model to replace Newtonian mechanics (and was itself later superseded by general relativity, which extended relativity to include gravitation). But the current theories (general relativity, quantum chromodynamics, etc...) aren\u0027t taught in high schools because they require mathematics that, for various reasons (most of them stupid), also aren\u0027t taught in high school. So the older theories are taught instead, because they\u0027re considered \u0022close enough\u0022 for the needs of most laymen. (And indeed, even in physics, we still use Newton\u0027s laws as a first-approximation for non-relativistic motion.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe take away from all of this is that you can\u0027t apply Newton\u0027s laws in a relativistic frame work.

More specifically, because of mass-energy equivalence (the ever-so-famous \u003Cstrong\u003EE = mc\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E), as an object with mass gains velocity, it also gains (relativistic) mass from its kinetic energy, which means that you need \u003Cem\u003Emore force to accelerate it the same amount\u003C/em\u003E. The faster you get, the more mass you gain, the more force needed to accelerate, increasing asymptotically as you approach the speed of light. What this means is that you can approach the speed of light, but never reach it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPhotons can travel at \u003Cem\u003Ec\u003C/em\u003E because they have no rest mass.

The object now has more energy, but something we do not encounter in the everyday world is that energy itself has a tiny bit of bulk to it, so that when you add energy to the object, it actually behaves as if it is heavier.\u00A0 We do not notice it because the effect is so tiny, but when you put A LOT of energy into the motion of an object, the effect becomes apparent. What happens when you push a heavier object? It doesn\u0027t move as much, right? So as you keep making the object go faster and faster, it behaves as if it is heavier and heavier. You may start off pushing a grain of dust to reach light speed, but as it gets closer to that speed, it starts to respond as if it\u0027s as heavy as a baseball, then as heavy as a bowling ball, then like a car, a building, a mountain, etc. You can just keep pushing it and making it go faster, but it responds less every time. Due to some very complex math which, to be honest, I do not entirely understand, the result is that ALL THE ENERGY IN UNIVERSE would \u003Cem\u003Estill\u003C/em\u003E not be enough to make that original grain of dust reach light speed. Only things which had no mass to start with, like photons, can be pushed hard enough to reach light speed, because if they\u0027re mass is zero, anything multiplying that zero mass still results in zero mass. And if you can\u0027t make something \u003Cem\u003Ereach\u003C/em\u003E light speed, you certainly can\u0027t make something go beyond it, either.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScience fiction stories come up with all kinds of ways to get around this rule, but they\u0027re based on speculation rather than knowledge, and nobody knows of any way to do it for real.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-06T19:27:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223187953\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022166195\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221507305748\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022133850\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022wumpus\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, wumpus said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second is that much of Einstein\u0027s reasoning behind the \u0022absolute speed limit\u0022 involves casuality (effects only happening after the cause)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEinstein reasoning behind the constant value of the speed of light was \u0022Maxwell\u0027s Equations says so, every other result of those equations is consistent\u00A0to observed reality\u0022 .\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo no, the \u003Cem\u003Ereasoning\u003C/em\u003E don\u0027t involve casualty at all.

The complete formula is supposed to be the work of Zephram Cochrane. Albert Einstein simple formula of E=mc\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E is supposed to be the guide to the fictional character of Cochrane\u0027s E=S(space) plus some unknown operands and variables. The concept is to use energy to create space and encircle a starship with it (the fictional name is subspace), the second thing to do is to draw space tightly in then suddenly release it behind the ship. Space will then expand back to its original position and the ship rides the wave. A wave is not a particle and as such space is drawn in tight and suddenly released against the artificial space (subspace). This subspace does not exist in normal space and so is not subject to normal space physical laws. The key to Star Trek\u0027s mathematic lies in the unknown formula that energy can create space if all the ingredients are there. In the real-world we don\u0027t know if this is possible. I notice some talk about Relativity, I\u0027ll have to read up on that again to enter into that discussion. One thing I wanted to clarify was this unknown mathematical formula that Star Trek uses to justify there faster-than-light starships. In theory it might work. The warpfield word used in Star Trek sounds like in means both the subspace field surround the starship and the compressing and expanding of space to create the wave.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been wanting to say this for a long time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
