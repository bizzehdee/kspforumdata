Well, it seems the specs haven\u0027t been published yet, so I did some extrapolating from some information that\u0027s already public. I used the marketing specs for the Falcon Heavy -- 21.2 tons to GTO, 13.2 tons to Mars Transfer. And I used specs from the Falcon 9 v1.1 upper stage, which I understand will be used unmodified (?) on the Falcon Heavy. (If there\u0027s a secret new stage under development, then this analysis is bunk).

This isn\u0027t very accurate at all, but it\u0027s *much* less than the Clipper mass (3,582 kg), so I think the conclusion is robust: F9-H can\u0027t do the direct Jupiter trajectory, with its current upper stage.\n\u003E \n\u003E The VEEGA trajectory is easily an option. F9-H\u0027s payload would be slightly less than the Mars transfer -- **11,549 kg** for C\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003E=15 km^2^/s^2^.\n\u003E \n\u003E **update: On the other hand**, a single Star-63F upper stage -- one of the larger solid rockets of the Payload Assist Module -- placed on top of the F9-H, could comfortably launch the Clipper on a Jupiter-direct trajectory. Take the Clipper mass (3,582 kg), add 10% margin (3,940 kg). Add on a 4,590 kg Star-63 F (total 8,530 kg). From my extrapolation, the F9-H could lift this much mass to C\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003E = 30.2 km^2^/s^2^. (This is a more comfortable estimate: it\u0027s very close to the Mars transfer that we have a datapoint for). Then the Star-63F can give us another 2,019 km/s boost, to a final C\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003E of 84 km^2^/s^2^. \n\u003E \n\u003E I think that would be credible!\n\u003E \n\u003E Star-63F specs:\n\u003E \n\u003E [TABLE=width: 500]\n\u003E \n\u003E [TR]\n\u003E \n\u003E [TD]Isp[/TD]\n\u003E \n\u003E [TD]297 s[/TD]\n\u003E \n\u003E [/TR]\n\u003E \n\u003E [TR]\n\u003E \n\u003E [TD]empty mass[/TD]\n\u003E \n\u003E [TD]326 kg[/TD]\n\u003E \n\u003E [/TR]\n\u003E \n\u003E [TR]\n\u003E \n\u003E [TD]gross mass[/TD]\n\u003E \n\u003E [TD]4,590 kg[/TD]\n\u003E \n\u003E [/TR]\n\u003E \n\u003E [/TABLE]\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://www.astronautix.com/engines/star63f.htm](http://www.astronautix.com/engines/star63f.htm)\n\u003E \n\u003E [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload_Assist_Module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload_Assist_Module)\n\nI decided to confirm this with my own calculations (using the rocket equation): [http://imgbox.com/D1TZ1fqR](http://imgbox.com/D1TZ1fqR) and [http://imgbox.com/Dvt4NV1Z](http://imgbox.com/Dvt4NV1Z)\n\nI found that while lower margins are possible to launch Europa Clipper to Jupiter transfer (4% with STAR-48) Falcon Heavy can not launch Europa Clipper without a reduction in payload margin, and it would be a better bet, payload-wise, to launch to Europa using the SLS.
