The main reason electric can even compete with gas cars is because they have a road to push off of, but a rocket has nothing but it\u0027s own propellant to push off of.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo me the requirements for a thermal combustion rocket that uses heat rather than chemical reactions to burn the propellant hot enough to give equivalent thrust os not impossible.... just wildly inefficient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince chemical reactions give more energy per pound than the massive batteries that would be required to give the same energy for thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo do that we would need batteries that are compact and not massive that can discharge chemical level power discharges of energy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we could do that then we could actually have thermal combustion rockets that could compete with chemical and solid rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuestion: Is it not true that even if we had compact super batteries, the discharge of electrical energy needed to combust propellant on par with a chemical or solud rocket would cause X-rays?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a guess, since I read somewhere online that in Back to the Future the Time Machine car is really a death mobile, since the sheer number of watts it is putting out would give off X-rays and kill the passengers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow if this is true for a thermal electric combustion rocket on par with chemical or solid rockets for thrust, the obvious solution would be to use reflectors to reflect and concentrate the X-rays into the propellant exhaust to heat it for extra thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut nothing is free..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mirrors can be made of glass, ceramic, or metal foil, coated by a reflective layer. The most commonly used reflective materials for X-ray mirrors are \u003Cspan\u003Egold and iridium\u003C/span\u003E. Even with these the critical reflection angle is energy dependent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMirrors add weight, and that decreases overall thrust because of extra mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I am not saying thermal electric combustion engines will never rival chemical or solid rockets for thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I am saying is that some fusion rocket or some NSWR is actually easier to pull off than a pure electric thermal combustion rocket, since we do not have to make a super dense energy storage medium, we are simply unlocking it and directing it out the back with fusion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-09-10T15:46:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCombustion is necessarily a chemical reaction, so I don\u0027t see how electricity play into your proposal.
