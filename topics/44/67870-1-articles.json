I\u0027m in biology, but I (and everyone in my class knows this) like aerospace more. She printed this out and showed it to me and I decided to take it to KSP to get some information on the compared rocket fuel: JP-10. What is JP-10 and what uses it. Anything in the space-exploration, or is it mainly stuck to the fuel tanks of missiles?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.biologynews.net/archives/2014/03/26/engineered_bacteria_produce_biofuel_alternative_for_highenergy_rocket_fuel.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.biologynews.net/archives/2014/03/26/engineered_bacteria_produce_biofuel_alternative_for_highenergy_rocket_fuel.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sauron","CreatedById":69931,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T20:27:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKerolox rockets are essentially using something vaguely like jet fuel (which is mostly kerosene). But realistically, where one\u0027s fuel comes from is trivial with rockets. On a global scale we\u0027re not exactly launching a lot of stuff to make (net) greenhouse emissions from rockets a serious concern. If we\u0027re worrying about the environmental issues, toxic storeable propellants and toxic SRBs are orders of magnitude more serious issues (but again, in the grand scheme of things still trivial. Again, we don\u0027t launch all that much stuff into space.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T20:40:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJP-10 is a specialised fuel blend for missiles, it\u0027s a precise mix of a few synthetic hydrocarbons. Almost all hydrocarbon-using space launchers just use something like JP-1 instead, which is a mass fraction of crude oil containing dozens of natural compunds in varying ratios. The only one I can think of that used a pure synthetic fuel is the Soyuz-U2, but it\u0027s fuel (Syntin) doesn\u0027t appear to have been similar to the compounds in J-10.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
