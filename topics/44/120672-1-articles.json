I see this problem\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elets say the work pairing two electrons is X relative to creating two close by but not \u003Cem\u003Emolecular\u003C/em\u003E photons, then my thinking is then for creating 3 or a trimer, it would be X\u003Csup\u003E3/2. \u003C/sup\u003ETwo combine 4 would be X\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E, and so on, so that by the time one had a decamer, the difficulty would outweigh any poosible gain. OTOH, this maybe away of bunching 3 photos and lowering the quantum effects of uncertainty. But in space it may only half the diffusion, so if it takes twice the effort to make the light molecule, it would not be worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
