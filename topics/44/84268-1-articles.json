There are six people up there working 60-hour-weeks to keep things running and do experiments. There\u0027s a \u003Cem\u003Eton\u003C/em\u003E of long-term science going on there. Stop now, miss even one single crew cycle, and you just nuked half a decade of in-progress orbital science. And it will take another half decade to resume these experiments after you re-man the station, because most of them would have to be rebuilt and launched fresh and then catch up on lost time. Except you don\u0027t have half a decade left in the ISS program at that time if the program doesn\u0027t get extended...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, all involved parties know that shutting down the station is not an option. It\u0027s the single most expensive structure humans have built in the entire history of human civilization, and not by a small margin. It\u0027s like the bad banks in the recessions a few years ago... \u0022too big to fail\u0022. Whatever political maneuvering is done here on Earth, the station will serve its term until at least 2020.
