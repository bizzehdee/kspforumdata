I\u0027ve found a few sources citing approximately 1.2r, but some conflicting, and some saying that it has not been theoretically proven at all. Nowhere have I found an explanation why.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-11T00:05:03Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2016 12:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by moritree\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-11T00:25:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is the equation you\u0027re seeing without that factor?
