Put simply, in fiction, notably science fiction and fantasy, where multipe sapient races exist, humans are, quite often, the \u0022vanilla\u0022 race. Average, boring, jack of all trades, master of none. Every other race in the setting will have a \u0022hat\u0022, something about them that makes them special, but not us. This is done because most writers (and readers) are human. How would a pacifist react to a book preaching our \u0022natural supremicy at war\u0022, or a cynic to our \u0022favor towards peace and friendship\u0022?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Humanity: F*** Yeah!\u0022\u0027s goal is to give humanity a hat. Someone writes a short story, with a characteristic of the human race as a main theme. Maybe our dogged tenacity catches a stronger opponent off guard in a war of attrition? Or we take one look at the tech the older races are wielding, chew them up and spit them out smaller, cleaner, more powerful and available in several colours? In a few stories, our passion of music, literature and fashion turns us into the settings cultural rock.
