That orientation would result in the most natural daylight cycles for the crew. It would also make the solar panels easy to manage. And perhaps there are some design advantages which result from knowing that one side of the station will always be in shade (e.g. thermal generators). However, is such an axis feasible? You\u0027d have to rotate the axis a full 360 degrees once per year.

The video was fun to watch. To be clear, however, I wasn\u0027t wondering whether NASA had experimented with centrifugal force; I was wondering whether NASA had experimented with the effects of spinning scenery on human health. For instance, they could put someone in an ordinary room with no windows except one simulated window showing a distant Earth rotating once every 10 seconds. Over the course of a few days, would the subject get used to it, or would they continue to suffer ill effects?
