This was nicely explained in 1996 in a paper by Hansen and Paige who showed how nitrogen evaporates from the warm equatorial regions and reaccumulates at the poles, leaving dark substrate behind. Dark substrate is probably tholins. Tholins = organic muck.\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a figure from that 1996 Hansen \u0026amp; Paige paper showing how Pluto\u0027s surface ices move around with time.

Process already starting now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy is the dark equatorial band not continuous? No clue. The \u0022heart\u0022 looks like the brightest spot on the surface, and it\u0027s equatorial. It could just be random feedback. It\u0027s bright, so reflects sunlight, so cold, so gets icy, gets brighter, gets colder, etc. Still, weird that it is at equator. Maybe something interesting going on there. Keep your eye out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorth of the dark equator are the patchy tropics. Summer has started here recently, so I suspect this is where ice is currently evaporating and going poleward. Come back in 20 years and it might look just like the equator. Again, nicely modeled in Hansen \u0026amp; Paige.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are the polygonal features? Not polygons. Seems unlikely any physical process could form large scale linear features of that sort. Your eye is good at playing tricks on you. I suspect that on the nicely imaged side you\u0027ll see no giant polygons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, what about Charon? Still too low detail. I want craters, damnit. And I want them now.
