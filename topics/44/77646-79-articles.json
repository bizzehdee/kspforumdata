The restoration work is proceeding smoothly, the machinery is in good condition, and the factory will be fully operational within a week.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday I was speaking to my boss (the new owner of the precision-engineering factory), and I mentioned the Cubesat project to him. He got interested in engineering in the first place because of the Apollo Program, and he was very interested in what I had to say. The factory is also looking for a few early projects to cut their teeth and get back in the game of making scientific and engineering apparatus...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe good news is this- he thinks the project sounds interesting, and some or all of the satellite components may be within his factory\u0027s capabilities. \u003Cstrong\u003EHe even remained interested when I told him that the KSP Community Cubesat team may not be able to afford to pay market price for the manufacture of most/all of the components...\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is GREAT news! The KSP Community Cubesat project may be able to realize its dream of placing a tiny satellite in LEO after all! I may be able to help us secure precision-engineering of the necessary components at a discount price, as my boss understands that the KSP Community Cubesat Project isn\u0027t exactly rich...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is where you guys come in! We need to design the components and raise the funds for the project in the next couple months.

In this regard, the discount-price manufacturing/engineering may be *EXTREMELY* helpful. But we also need to get the designs for the Cubesat drawn up, so I can get them to my boss and he can decide what is within the factory\u0027s capabilities, what\u0027s the lowest price he can charge, and what design improvements can easily be made, if any (the factory specializes in scientific and high-tech precision devices, so things like space-grade gyroscopes and reaction wheels should be *right* up its alley...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should repeat that there *IS* a timeline to this. My boss thinks the best time for the factory to do something like this would be in 1-2 months from now, when everything will be set up and settled in smoothly, but business hasn\u0027t really picked up for the factory yet...

First, we need to select some kind of project leaders, though, so he has somebody concrete to talk to. I would be more than willing to volunteer to be ONE of these individuals, provided you all understand I have no actual background in engineering (I\u0027m a biologist by trade) beyond KSP, and we should probably have at least one or two additional team/project leaders with more experience in engineering fields involved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EP.P.S.\u003C/strong\u003E Feel free to PM me about my volunteering to take on a role as a Project/Team Leader of some sort...
