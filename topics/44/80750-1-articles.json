An internal combustion engine does not work solely on the fuel supplied and the oxygen in the air. The nitrogen and other gasses (that make up 70\u002B% of air) act as a \u0022working fluid\u0022 that is heated and expanded by the fuel rapidly combining with the oxygen. If you tried to run an engine on the fuel it needs and \u003Cem\u003Ejust the amount of oxygen in air\u003C/em\u003E it either would not run or would run very poorly. What they should have done on Mythbusters is just put the hose from the device into the open carb, like they later did with a bigger hose from a tank of hydrogen (on which the engine ran a bit). They also should have tried different sizes of engines and explained the \u003Cstrong\u003Estoichiometric ratios\u003C/strong\u003E of hydrogen and other fuels with both air and pure oxygen, and volumetric efficiency and just how much total volume of air goes through an engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut investigating to see if it *could* work was not their agenda with that \u0022experiment\u0022, it was to \u0022prove\u0022 that it \u003Cem\u003Ecould not work at all in any circumstance\u003C/em\u003E which is why they completely blocked the carb inlet, and insulted the intelligence of everyone in their audience who knows how internal combustion engines work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NASAFanboy","CreatedById":57300,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T02:30:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t we already have three threads on this?
