Basically you\u0027ve got two catalytic electrodes separated by a membrane. The first electrode catalyses the conversion of hydrogen gas (H2) to protons (H\u002B ions) and electrons. The protons travel across the membrane (hence proton exchange membrane) to the second electrode, where they combine with oxygen molecules (O2) and electrons to give water. The two electrodes are connected via whatever external circuit you\u0027re driving with the fuel cell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn principle I guess you could run the cell as an electrolyser to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. As a practical matter I\u0027m not sure how well that would work - PEM cells are finicky beasts - simple in principle but engineering them to be robust, gas tight and cheap enough for the mass market is challenging (source - I was\u00A0a patent examiner in a previous life and one of my subject matter areas was fuel cells and batteries)\u00A0Along with the problems of storing reasonable quantities of hydrogen, it\u0027s the reason why fuel cells didn\u0027t really take\u00A0off as vehicle powerplants, despite all the \u0027hydrogen economy\u0027 hype.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake that with a slight grain of salt though - that previous life was quite some time ago and the state of the art in fuel cells may have moved on quite a bit since then.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-05T07:13:02Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2017 07:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-05T08:47:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTechnically, you can - it\u0027s called hydrolysis.

The efficiency is lousy, but it could work due to the changes in energy prices. Anyway, back to the question at hand: yes, you can use hydrolysis to store energy and release it again with the fuel cell, but it is overly complicated AFAIK and there are much more efficient ways to store energy...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Abstract_Kerman","CreatedById":175393,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-05T14:52:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223140458\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022164082\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221501917123\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002261025\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KSK\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, KSK said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure I understand the question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\na fuel cell takes power from the hydrogen can you put the power back in the hydrogen?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-05T15:09:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223140660\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022164082\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221501944757\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022175393\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Abstract_Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 minutes ago, Abstract_Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\na fuel cell takes power from the hydrogen can you put the power back in the hydrogen?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, not with a fuel cell.
