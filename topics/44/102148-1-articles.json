I haven\u0027t read much yet, but it looks like they are proposing a long-term satellite called Jupiter that would dock with cargo modules called Exoliner and then dock with the ISS. The Exoliner modules would contain pressurized and unpressurized sections, as well as a fuel tank to refuel the Jupiter satellite/spacecraft. I think I read that it might be possible for Jupiter to do other work, such as launching cubesats, after it shuffles the Exoliner craft around. The theory is that they could launch more cargo in an unpowered (or underpowered) module and leave the satellite/tug in orbit. To be honest, I have reservations about this since I don\u0027t know if oribtal refueling like this have been done before, but I don\u0027t know.

Progress is useful for sending up pressurized cargo and more propellant for the RCS, but has very poor downmass capability. Dragon, on the other hand, can return cargo to Earth, is partially reusable, and will eventually be used to carry crew. Cygnus has no downmass capability at all and has slightly less payload capacity than Progress and far less than Dragon.\n\nAdditionally, having multiple different vehicles operated by different people makes the station more resistant to the retirement of one of the cargo craft.
