The launch window for Mars resupply missions is every 2 years, which means that you need to send larger space craft. Heavy payloads mean that you need a powered landing, which requires more complexity, and more mass added to the payload.\u003Cp\u003EMany of the solutions for problems of living on the Moon are not needed for a Mars mission, but a lot are needed for the actual journey to Mars (hard vacuum, cosmic radiation). Others are needed for Mars (partial gravity, ISRU, closed-loop life support, reusable landers). The complexity of building a Moon shuttle capable of transferring between the lunar surface and back up to lunar orbit is much simpler than building a mars shuttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrew rotations between the Earth and the Moon might be faster than rotations between Earth and Mars, but they would probably be just as expensive. You always need a powered landing on Mars for anything bigger than half a ton, but you can still save a lot of delta-v by aerobraking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solutions for the problems of going on the actual journey to Mars (vacuum, radiation) are better tested in deep space than on the Moon anyway. Maybe on a space station at L1 or L2 (Lagrange points).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPartial gravity? The gravity on the Moon as compared to Mars is the same ratio as the gravity on Mars compared to Earth, so there\u0027s a pretty big difference between the two. So testing a proposed Mars-gravity system on the Moon would give about as much information as testing it on Earth. Closed-loop life support for Mars would be much easier to test on Earth or even in deep space than on the Moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA reusable shuttle from orbit to surface and back would be much easier on the Moon than on Mars. But you only really need reusability if you\u0027re planning on using ISRU. Same applies to a shuttle between LEO and LLO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EISRU - Yes! This would be the thing that would make a Moon base worthwhile. If rocket fuel could be extracted from the Moon, it would break the tyranny of the rocket equation and allow us to go further into the solar system for a lot cheaper, as well as cheaper transportation to/from orbit (but not for refueling things in LEO: if you wanted to go from the Moon to LEO without aerobraking, you would use up at least 80% of your fuel just getting there; to refuel something at L1 or L2 you could only use 1/4 of your fuel, needing the other 3/4 to get up and back from the surface of the Moon, assuming ~400 Isp). But that would be a lot cheaper to do robotically since the Moon is close enough to remote-control assets on its surface from the Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems to me that, other than ISRU, a human outpost on the Moon is about the same as an outpost in deep space, except it\u0027s harder to get to since it\u0027s at the bottom of a gravity well. Mars seems like it\u0027s a much more hospitable place to put humans.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerekL1963","CreatedById":57091,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T17:02:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JakeGrey\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JakeGrey\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EProof-of-concept for the technologies and methods needed to establish permanent settlements on Mars and beyond\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s like placing a proof-of-concept base for a Antarctic habitat two hundred feet down in the Atlantic off of Charleston - you\u0027ll spend 90% of your budget solving the engineering issues unrelated to your proof, and leave 90% of the things you need to prove untested.

But, that leaves out a design point that at this moment must be blindingly obvious. A manned craft going to Mars must be far heavier, and needs more fuel getting a Trans-Mars injection than the craft going to the Moon with the same payload.\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s imagine a reusable \u0022Moon shuttle\u0022 that continuously goes from LEO to LLO (Low Lunar orbit). It can carry, say, six people and a sizeable payload, like a lander, or a base building to be carried down by infrastructure in Lunar orbit. What would the mass of this vehicle be? The vehicle itself, enough fuel for a round-trip, the payload, enough consumables for the people on board to last, say, two weeks, shielding against a solar flare etc. Now, what would the mass of a Mars transfer vehicle be? The crew would be in there for months at a time, so it would need more space-per-crewmember, and more consumables. That slight increase in mass alone means a lot more fuel in the initial stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow would you make a reusable shuttle from LEO to LLO? Where does the fuel come from? You need 4 km/s of delta-v to go from LEO to LLO; assuming an Isp of 400, that\u0027s at most 1/3 of your shuttle\u0027s mass being usable payload, probably less accounting for structure, engines and empty tanks. And that\u0027s one way. If you also wanted to go back the other way without refueling, you would need a shuttle at least 10 times bigger than your payload. If it carries people, it needs life-support and other systems. The Orion crew capsule is 9 tons, its service module is 12 tons and it\u0027s capable of 1.6 km/s delta-v. It has enough room for 6 people to LEO, but probably fewer than that to LLO. So if you scale it up to a shuttle capable of carrying 6 people from LEO to LLO and back, it would have to be around 200 tons! And that\u0027s not including a lander. So I\u0027m not really sure what you mean by a reusable \u0022Moon shuttle\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor cargo, you could use high-efficiency low-thrust propulsion, but the transit times are too long to take up crew the same way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Mars transfer vehicle would probably be something like an ISS module, a little bigger to support 6 crew. The food needed is not that much, something like half a ton per person per year. So maybe 5 tons for the journey to Mars and back, with the habitat weighing another 30 tons or so. A way to make it partially reusable would be to use an \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldrin_cycler\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAldrin cycler\u003C/a\u003E along with crew-carrying spacecraft to go to and from it. The habitat would therefore not need any fuel except for course corrections. If you use an Orion-like spacecraft like with the lunar shuttle (carrying the crew and the provisions), you would need around a 60 ton rocket in LEO to get the ~4 km/s required to rendezvous with the habitat. Landing on Mars takes around 1 km/s delta-v. Taking off from Mars and rendezvousing with the habitat again takes around 6.5 km/s. So that part would probably not be reusable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, there\u0027s a lot of possible architectures for both a Moon shuttle and a Mars shuttle. If you only do a single long-duration mission to the Moon or to Mars, the mass in LEO requirements would not be too far off between the two.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
