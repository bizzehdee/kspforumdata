The Media often publicize a failure of some particular system in some plant, implying that it was a close call\u0022 on disaster; they completely miss the point of defense in depth which easily takes care of such failures. Even in the Three Mile Island accident where at least two equipment failures were severely compounded by human errors, two lines of defense were still not breached--- essentially all of the radioactivity remained sealed in the thick steel reactor vessel, and that vessel was sealed inside the heavily reinforced concrete and steel lined \u0022containment\u0022 building which was never even challenged. It was clearly not a close call on disaster to the surrounding population. The Soviet Chernobyl reactor, built on a much less safe design concept, did not have such a containment structure; if it did, that disaster would have been averted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERisks from reactor accidents are estimated by the rapidly developing science of \u0022probabilistic risk analysis\u0022 (PRA). A PRA must be done separately for each power plant (at a cost of $5 million) but we give typical results here: A fuel melt-down might be expected once in 20,000 years of reactor operation. In 2 out of 3 melt-downs there would be no deaths, in 1 out of 5 there would be over 1000 deaths, and in 1 out of 100,000 there would be 50,000 deaths. The average for all meltdowns would be 400 deaths. Since air pollution from coal burning is estimated to be causing 10,000 deaths per year, there would have to be 25 melt-downs each year for nuclear power to be as dangerous as coal burning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course deaths from coal burning air pollution are not noticeable, but the same is true for the cancer deaths from reactor accidents. In the worst accident considered, expected once in 100,000 melt-downs (once in 2 billion years of reactor operation), the cancer deaths would be among 10 million people, increasing their cancer risk typically from 20% (the current U.S. average) to 20.5%. This is much less than the geographical variation--- 22% in New England to 17% in the Rocky Mountain states.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery high radiation doses can destroy body functions and lead to death within 60 days, but such \u0022noticeable\u0022 deaths would be expected in only 2% of reactor melt-down accidents; there would be over 100 in 0.2% of meltdowns, and 3500 in 1 out of 100,000 melt-downs. To date, the largest number of noticeable deaths from coal burning was in an air pollution incident (London, 1952) where there were 3500 extra deaths in one week.

That\u0027s not quite correct, although you\u0027re on the right track in pointing out that wind doesn\u0027t entirely remove the need for other plant. Grids need reserves online to cover faults and maintenance anyway. Some of this is sitting dormant, but of a type that can get up and synchronise very quickly (eg: diesel, OCGT). So that kind of reserve uses no fuel until it\u0027s needed. Other reserves will be either spinning or hot reserve, where a thermal plant is running, but at less than 100% capacity. It can then increase capacity at short notice as needed. Running at less than full capacity is slightly less efficient, while obviously running hot but not producing is highly inefficient, and is generally avoided.\u003Cp\u003ECoal is generally not used for picking up peaking loads anyway, it\u0027s cheap and normally used for base load generation.
