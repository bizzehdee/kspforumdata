You said now 800Gton CO2 but 200 years ago it was 550Gt, which is (800-550)/200 0.75 Gt/yr, right?\n\u003E You said the ocean now captures 2Gt/yr more, which is 3x the average rate we have been adding it, correct?\n\nBut you can not take the average, because 200 years ago we release almost nothing of co2 to the atmosphere compared to now. And even if we reduce the amount of co2 emissions by year, the overall emission will keep rising, because the current earth temperature rise, more water vapor, more methane and co2 due permafrost melting, less ice --\u003E lower sun refraction, etc.\n\nThat is why everbody said that if we reach to the 2 degress celcius increase then we reach the point of no return, because it does not matter if we dont emmit more co2 at that point, the earth will intensify a chain of events which will release by it self a lot more greenhouse gasses which cannot be stoped, and in case we can, it will cost a LOT more than do it now.\n\nThis is like dodge an asteroid, if you do it 10 years before, you dont need much energy, if you do it the last year, it will be 1000 times harded.\n\nTake into account that the last time earth had these co2 values, humans did not exist.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E That is very true. Natural climate change appears to be slow (hundreds, thousands or millions of years). However, the fact that 30-40% of human CO2 emissions are presently absorbed by the oceans indicate that the time constant/response time of the oceans are much faster than those of natural climate change, no? Otherwise, all of the CO2 we release would stay in the atmosphere until the earth could react. This clearly isnt the case since sources say 30-40% of the CO2 is absorbed by the ocean alone and contributes to ocean acidification.\n\nYeah, again not total sure what you mean by 30% to 40%, the problem here is that not because co2 levels rise we would have always a constant % that will be absorbed, global warming may change local weather, wet places may become dry, and dry places wet. But forest, towns and crops places can not be relocated from one day to the other, which end up dying --\u003E higher levels of co2, seas acidification may also become a problem for life, if we dont increase the amount of life we can not absorb much co2.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The fact that it takes much longer for natural climate change to occur might indicate it is driven by slow periodic processes, and not that the earth takes soo long to react.\n\nBut we already understand which are the process that contributes to co2 capture, but all evidence point that all those process will weaken with the time rather than strengthened.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Note that the permian co2 spike might be caused partial of the extinction of most life and the largest volcano event we know about. \n\u003E In short, volcano emits lots of smoke who blanket earth it also release lots of co2 but this is not the main problem, the problem is the smoke who blocks sunlight and the other effects. \n\u003E \n\u003E mass extinction causes more co2 and reduces uptake until life come back.\n\nYeah but just to clarify, there was some strong volcano events which burn huge forest and started an chain of events which end up with mass extintions, but those are not common, are event that happens once every hundred of millons of years.\n\nIn fact, if we take into account all the earth eruptions or volcano activities in the last 100 years, that total co2 is equal to the co2 released by human activity this last year."},{"CreatedByName":"arkie87","CreatedById":103434,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T19:49:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E But you can not take the average, because 200 years ago we release almost nothing of co2 to the atmosphere compared to now.\n\nYes, co2 release has not been linear, but rather exponential, which is definitely the reason why the current rate of CO2 capture appears to exceed the rate we have been releasing it.
