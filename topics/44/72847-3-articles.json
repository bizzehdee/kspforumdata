Industry, governments and energy users - that is, all of us - will face the twin challenge of more energy and less CO2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis letter is based on a text I\u0027ve written for publication in several newspapers in the coming weeks. You can use it in your communications externally. There will be more information about energy scenarios inthe months ahead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the year 2100, the world\u0027s energy system will be radically different from today\u0027s. Renewable energy like solar, wind, hydroelectricity and biofuels will make up a large share of the energy mix, and nuclear energy too will have a place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMankind will have found ways of dealing with air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. New technologies will have reduced the amount of energy needed to power buildings and vehicles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIndeed, the distant future looks bright, but getting there will be an adventure. At Shell, we think the world will take one of two possible routes. The first, a scenario we call Scramble, resembles a race through a mountainous desert. Like an off-road rally, it promises excitement and fierce competition. However, the unintended consequence of \u0022more haste\u0022 will often be \u0022less speed\u0022 and many will crash along the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe alternative scenario, called Blueprints, has some false starts and develops like a cautious ride on a road that is still under construction. Whether we arrive safely at our destination depends on the discipline of the drivers and the ingenuity of all those involved in the construction effort. Technical innovation provides for excitement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless of which route we choose, the world\u0027s current predicament limits our maneuvering room. We are experiencing a step-change in the growth rate of energy demand due to population growth and economic development, and Shell estimates that after 2015 supplies of easy-to-access oil and gas will no longer keep up with demand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E As a result, society has no choice but to add other sources of energy - renewables , yes, but also more nuclear power and unconventional fossil fuels such as oil sands. Using more energy inevitably means emitting more CO2 at a time when climate change has become a critical global issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the Scramble scenario, nations rush to secure energy resources for themselves, fearing that energy security is a zero-sum game, with clear winners and losers. The use of local coal and homegrown biofuels increases fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETaking the path of least resistance, policymakers pay little attention to curbing energy consumption - until supplies run short. Likewise, despite much rhetoric, greenhouse gas emissions are not seriously addressed until major shocks trigger political reactions. Since these responses are overdue, they are severe and lead to energy price spikes and volatility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other route to the future is less painful, even if the start is more disorderly. This Blueprints scenario sees numerous coalitions emerging to take on the challenges of economic development, energy security and environmental pollution through cross-border cooperation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuch innovation occurs at the local level, as major cities develop links with industry to reduce local emissions. National governments introduce efficiency standards, taxes and other policy instruments to improve the environmental performance of buildings, vehicles and transport fuels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs calls for harmonization increase, policies converge across the globe. Cap-and-trade mechanisms that put a cost on industrial CO 2 emissions gain international acceptance. Rising CO2 prices accelerate innovation, spawning breakthroughs. A growing number of cars are powered by electricity and hydrogen, while industrial facilities are fitted with technology to capture CO 2 and store it underground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgainst the backdrop of these two equally plausible scenarios, we will only know in a few years whether December\u0027s Bali declaration on climate change was just rhetoric or the beginning of a global effort to counter it. Much will depend on how attitudes evolve in Beijing, Brussels, New Delhi and Washington.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShell traditionally uses its scenarios to prepare for the future without expressing a preference for one over another. But, faced with the need to manage climate risk for our investors and our grandchildren, we believe the Blueprints outcomes provide the best balance between economy, energy and environment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a second opinion, we appealed to climate change calculations made at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. These calculations indicate that a Blueprints world with CO2 capture and storage results in the least amount of climate change, provided emissions of other major manmade greenhouse gases are similarly reduced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sobering reality is that the Blueprints scenario will only come to pass if policymakers agree a global approach to emissions trading and actively promote energy efficiency and new technology in four sectors: heat and power generation, industry, mobility and buildings. It will be hard work and there is little time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, Blueprints assumes CO2 is captured at 90% of all coal- and gas-fired power plants in developed countries in 2050, plus at least 50% of those in non-OECD countries. Today, there are none. Since CO2 capture and storage adds cost and brings no revenues , government support is needed to make it happen quickly on a scale large enough to affect global emissions. At the very least, companies should earn carbon credits for the CO2 they capture and store.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBlueprints will not be easy. But it offers the world the best chance of reaching a sustainable energy future unscathed, so we should explore this route with the same ingenuity and persistence that put humans on the moon and created the digital age.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe world faces a long voyage before it reaches a low-carbon energy system. Companies can suggest possible routes to get there, but governments are in the driving seat. And governments will determine whether we should prepare for a bitter competition or a true team effort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is the article, and how I see our challenges and opportunities.

The biggest impact of such an energy source wouldn\u0027t be on our lives either, it\u0027d be on the lives of the people who don\u0027t have access to electricity, or can\u0027t afford electricity. Elevating the quality of life of people generally improves any situation greatly; if you\u0027re living comfortably and not threatened, there\u0027s not much reason to contemplate war or even small-scale conflict. Hell, it could even significantly shift how much sway extremist Islam has with people, if those people were enjoying electricity provided by a Western-made fusion reactor.
