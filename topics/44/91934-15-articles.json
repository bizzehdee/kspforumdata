They just do not have the infrastructure, or they did not use the infrastructure. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I see it, most of the serious space exploration aficionados got their interest more by ideas of exploration and discovery, often despite poor quality coverage of live events (i.e. watching Apollo missions on tiny black and whit TV\u0027s), but as is the case in many things we mostly hear the stories of those who are on the extremes; in this case those who love space exploration and those who greatly oppose it, not those who either passively and nonvocally support or oppose it. Those people probably make up the bulk of the public, not just in the USA but everywhere. How do you convince those people to support that space travel is worthwhile? I have no idea. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I guess that there is a case to make that some of those people will be turned off by tacky video stream, and that NASA, and the other space agencies, should try to themselves well at all times, and in all media outlets.
