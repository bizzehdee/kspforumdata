Humans naturally want to have more than their neighbors, and as a result you might see people who own things like mineral deposits or farmland actively resisting the potential of a robot utopia in order to maintain a status quo where they are still in a position of advantage. With no real control of labor, they would starve resources for immense personal gain while delaying the greater benefit to humanity.\n\nThere\u0027s also the matter of too much free time -- people might take up gardening or KSP as a leisure activity...

In that case, it\u0027s not hard to imagine humans as second class citizens in an economic system where we are greatly outclassed.\n\nThere are some that think robots could someday become creative, or at least, get very close to it. A big part of creative design is combining old ideas with new, making solutions that solve problems, successfully communicating, etc. A lot of the things behind designs boil down to certain rules. Even in graphic design, there is gestalt principles, colour theory, rule of thirds, and a lot of historic and cultural associations that can be used to inform design. \n\nIf an AI is smart enough to consider every possible factor, and learn from experience, then it is entirely possible they may one day work alongside humans.\n\nOne point I\u0027ve heard a few places, is that very intelligent robots should be given wants and goals to make them friendly to humans, to prevent them from overtaking us in ways that will cause us harm.\n\nFor example, if an AI\u0027s only goal is simply to maximise profit, then every decision it makes will be aimed towards doing so- and it will not seek to avoid causing harm to people unless that gets in the way of achieving its goal.\n\nAlthough, it would not be far fetched to claim many humans already act like this.\n\nBut, if AI is given a more complex set of goals, aimed at enhancing human culture, quality of life, and happiness, and looking after the planet. If these are no less important than making a profit, it will make a very different set of decisions. \n\nIt\u0027s hard to predict how a learning robot\u0027s goals would grow and change. If it was not programed, would a robot even develop goals of its own, apart from those related to goals it\u0027s already been given? But, an AI doesn\u0027t necessarily need a sense of boredom, or fun, or art appreciation beyond what it needs to understand humans. An AI has no reason to desire things.\n\nSome robots may recognise that they run things more effectively than us, and make it hard for humans to get jobs in those positions. \n\nIt\u0027s important who is doing the hiring. An AI boss might be programed to be sympathetic towards humans, and hire them alongside humans. AI colleges might be respectful towards humans, considering their ideas and opinions, but helping develop those ideas really fast.\n\nWho spends money, and why is another important factor to consider. An AI ruled system might set itself up to ensure humans still have ways to get money.\n\nIf AIs do earn money, but don\u0027t have enough needs and wants to motivate them to spend it, that would create economic problems without humans.\n\nUltimately, it depends on a lot of things. It\u0027s quite hard to predict what will happen, but by debating and thinking about these things we\u0027ll be able to make smart choises,(or at least, recognise dumb ones,) when it comes to making artificial intelligences."},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T08:31:08Z","Content":"Between programming and entertainment services, we have a long time for this scenario to play out.

Not dismissing the possibility, humans being what they are it\u0027s probably the likelier scenario.\n\nBut after we have piqued up the pieces and survived the trouble times like we always do, we will probably be in post-scarcity territory.

Your robot is a doctor with an AI which produces a more accurate diagnoses than a human -- no human worker is neccessary to provide healthcare services. However you might express that you are more comfortable with a human, in which case someone will likely be available to assist.
