Honestly, I understand the sentiment that if we had a fully reusable system or SSTO we save money, but not too long ago I had a long argument with a friend over why they don\u0027t build a new set of space shuttles. In the course of that I looked into the shuttle system in quite a bit of detail. After realizing just how expensive it is to get any launch system launch ready again, you realize that any reusable system is not going to save you nearly as much money as you think it will.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI say why not go the other way, stop trying to reinvent the wheel and settle on three launch designs (light medium and heavy) and let them pay for their design costs over the next fifty years. Make as many parts as possible interchangeable between them, and pump them out of an assembly line. Bring mass production to the space launch world. Invest all that RnD money into getting the manufacturing process as cheap as possible. Stop trying to build perfect ferraris\u00A0and start going for the reliable subaru. Granted, you would never want to use such a system for manned launches, and you will need to incorporate the cost of failed launches into the price you charge for succesful ones. Still, I think overall it might be possible to beat reusable systems at cost this way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-07T23:31:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, it probably is.

That\u0027s why I think you can develop a sound design, something that gets you to orbit with a high success rate, and then spend all that money currently going towards new launch systems on manufacturing tech. Automate as much as possible, streamline the testing process, get it to a point where a crew of five guys can build your booster in a month. Is that hard? Very. Is that impossible?

At the end of the day, getting to space is hard\u00A0because of the ridiculous physics involved just in terms of energy. Engines that can start more than once are difficult, engines that can throttle are difficult, mostly because they go through such extreme stresses during launch. I still think any engine that has burned its way to space is going to need all kinds of refitting to be used again, which is what killed the shuttle in the end.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t disagree with what people have said here about the issues that will be faced, but as has been pointed out SpaceX has managed to get costs down but doing some of the things I mentioned, now if they cut out their reuse program and poured all that RnD into an assembly line that can pump out a Merlin engine on the cheap, they could probably see similar savings to what they would get with successfully reusing boosters.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-08T14:04:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, essentially it\u0027s: \u0022Making more of the same\u0022 vs. \u0022Trying something new\u0022.

Nothing has topped the Saturn V in terms of payload, so we really haven\u0027t advanced at all by that metric (yeah yeah Falcon Heavy, not done yet so it doesn\u0027t count). In terms of launching we have all the tech we need to reach Mars (or Venus) or anywhere else we like. There are plenty of other challenges associated with such missions, and we should absolutely be investing in how to solve those.
