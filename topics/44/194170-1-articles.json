Several Earth nations decide they do not like you and launch 500g acceleration missiles (burn time is a few seconds at best so they are more or less like suborbital bullets).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suspect that 2g is more than enough to escape the onslaught after you detect the launch,\u00A0while taunting them via broadcast as you break orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s also assume you are orbiting over the Pacific ocean about to fly over China.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuestion: What is the lowest constant acceleration rate of g where Earth based forces could not reliably hit you in orbit?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is interesting though, since as common as constant acceleration is in scifi, if you take that up against modern technology it becomes clear to see that we probably could not even reliably hit them in orbit. Lasers work sure, but people know that lasers are not all that good at hitting distant space targets unless the lens is huge due to beam spread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you think? Is constant acceleration of 1g or 2g so much that Earth could never hit them from the ground with current technology?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf so.... this seals all those war of the worlds scifi stories. Since assuming they have good thrust constant acceleration, they will always have the highest \u0027ground\u0027 and we will NEVER hit them unless we build a giant laser lens or they are foolish enough to land. When they could do orbital bombardment all day until they run out of ammo instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey won\u0027t even need scifi shields.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-26T00:55:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2020 12:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xavven","CreatedById":100398,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-26T02:40:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUndoubtedly you could build a missile that would hit a craft only capable of pulling 2 G as long as it had a way to steer in the upper atmosphere and space.

Justification can range from the hairy and explicit (e.g. that bit in The Martian where the author discusses the nature of the failure of the first Iris launch) to totally implicit (relying on the reader\u0027s comprehension of the word the author has created) - as usual, the best works lie somewhere between the two extremes. Often times, the technical details aren\u0027t particularly relevant, after-all this is science\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Efiction\u003C/em\u003E, and that gives the author quite a bit of leeway as to how they craft the world the story takes places in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Edoes\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0matter is internal consistency.

Start with the class of the ship. Is is a military grade cutter, capable of pulling 8 gees but can\u0027t go past the moon? Is it a dilapidated cargo freighter from the last century, barely able to pull two unladen? Once you know the performance of the ship, choose the performance of the missile. If you want them to get away easily, a few dozen dumbfires at 500 gee might make for a good hair-raiser. If you need some battle damage, proximity warheads (high-explosive frag or nukes) could batter the hull a bit, or perhaps result in a propellant leak. If you need a mission kill, a lucky hit to the engine or reactor might force an emergency shutdown. Any or all of these are valid scenarios given different combinations of ship and missile performance, but if you make that 70 year old cargo ship dodge a barrage of state-of-the-art ASAT missiles, you better tell me how that happened.\u00A0\u00A0As a reader,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethats\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the kind of thing that will bother me - I could care less about the exact acceleration and guidance capabilities of the missile and the ship, as long as the outcome is believable. Maybe the pilot is Rain-Man. Maybe the ship has an experimental AI-controlled EW suite that confused the missiles\u0027 guidance. Maybe you jettison your cargo to act as a decoy. Maybe the astromilitary\u0027s missiles are designed for low-maneuverability targets.

Why would you do that? A semi synchronous orbit of Earth is 20,200 km... orbital time of 12 hours. Medium Earth orbit... at these distances, those missiles are easily avoided. Heck, even a 2000km high orbit would make it easy to avoid these missiles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, why why why would you put your ship within 200km (even worse if you\u0027re talking about just above the karman line at 100km) of a potentially hostile force?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-04T08:01:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223796793\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022194170\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221591256600\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002291917\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 minutes ago, KerikBalm said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLow orbit is like... really really close to Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E(Thoughtfully looks at the mountain at the horizon.
