However, the only sites I\u0027ve looked at are concerned either with items the scale of the US Navy railgun or gigantic megawatt accelerators powered by various nuclear reactors.\n\nAnyways, I\u0027m looking for a set of maths tht would let me calculate a feasible coilgun from parameters such as target depth and material, projectile mass and cross section, et cetera. \n\n*Concrete Example*:\n\nSuppose I require a coilgun to fire a .3g needle of cross-sectional area 12.5mm^2 (barrel, it\u0027s a tapered needle; tip 3.1mm^2). at a Styrofoam target 5m away, and pierce it to a depth of 1cm. What kind of magnetic field strength would I need to achieve thin in a single-coil piece of .4m length? How many turns of common copper wire, with what wattage, would this take? What number of coils would be optimal in this length?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-14T14:44:43Z\u0022 title=\u002208/14/2015 02:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by 0111narwhalz**\n  \nExample now has some more reasonable numbers."},{"CreatedByName":"spudman2","CreatedById":84199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T18:22:57Z","Content":"\u003E\u003EBEGIN UNHELPFUL REPLY\u003C\u003C\n\nI\u0027d suppose the best way to start would be to figure out how much energy, and how fast the needle needs to be moving in order to achieve desired impact characteristics. You can use some of the kinematic equations to figure out barrel acceleration. Knowing final speed, length of acceleration, and initial speed (zero), you can solve for acceleration needed. I\u0027ve never had a chance to study the equations that govern magnet-magnet interaction, but I will say that I think you need a magnetic projectile.

I assume you understand distinction between railgun and coilgun. There are still a whole bunch of different coilgun types. An induction coilgun, for example, is much better at firing rings than needles. It\u0027s also kind of easier to build, because it does not require switching the magnet off. That also makes all of the math easier. Though, you do have to understand a bit about how induction works.\n\nIf you don\u0027t want induction, then material of the needle becomes critical.

You definitely don\u0027t want one, long continuous chunk of ferous material. But you might want ferous rings in your coils. That can dramatically increase the mag field strenght, but it will also increase induction by the same factor. So if yo can build a sufficiently sophisticated switching system that counters induced EMF, you can get better output with ferous rings. But if you are simply switching coils on and off, induction will probably do more damage to final speed than what you get from stronger field.
