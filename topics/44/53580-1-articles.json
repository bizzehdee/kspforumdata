I know trig has to do with the ratios of a right triangle. But it too is marred with theoretical math (I took it in high school and barely passed.)

You learn the full answer is you study abstract algebra, typically around your 3rd or 4th year of undergraduate degree in pure mathematics. Field of complex numbers is an extension of the algebraic field over rational numbers. In simple terms, and dropping some nuances, complex numbers are important because some of them are roots of polynomials with real coefficients.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, that\u0027s simple enough, polynomial f(x) = x\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 \u002B 1 obviously has no real roots, but it has two complex roots, which is nice, but why should anyone care? Honestly, if it was just about the roots of polynomials, nobody would care. This is where group theory and analysis come in. In particular, Lie groups make a grand entrance. Long story short, because this would take up half a text book, any time you have infinitesimal transformations of any kind, the total transformation can be written as e\u003Csup\u003Eix\u003C/sup\u003E for some x.

However, you need to understand the relationship between the terms of the equation, and the theoretical framework that often underpins that. Sometimes there is no theoretical basis, the equations will have been derived empirically, but usually there is a mathematical relationship there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can solve simple engineering problems by simply rearranging formulas and plugging in whatever numbers you\u0027ve got. Engineering only takes from science what ever has a practical use, all most engineers want from scientists is a formula they can use to make predictions. But that doesn\u0027t mean that purely theoretical pursuits aren\u0027t productive, lots of very practical discoveries have come out of blue sky research. And competence with some of the more advanced mathematical techniques is required for some engineering specialities. If you wanted to get into something like fluid dynamics or writing software for FEA then you\u0027ll need a maths background that goes beyond rearranging formulae.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T13:38:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are getting a D- in high school algebra, cut your losses and consider a major in a soft science or liberal arts.
