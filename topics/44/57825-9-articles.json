Although they were refitted several times with modern electronics, the Shuttle was stuck with a lot of 1970\u0027s technology. With Soyuz, there is practically no part that is identical between the original Soyuz 7K-OK and the modern Soyuz TMA.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZetaX","CreatedById":60692,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T18:00:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESkyrunner: at least the Apollo one is obviously hypocritical of you, as you completely ignore the difference between \u0022blowing up while on a mission\u0022 and \u0022problems encountered while testing\u0022 (deadly or not).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
