For a few million years. a moon formed from a single Theia impact can not create two stable moons. One is either flung out, collides with earth, or collides with the other moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, it\u0027s possible to imagine that two different impacts with different parameters occurred, which might create two stable moons if they are in a good resonance that doesn\u0027t flung each other out. It\u0027s possible the Apollo Missions sent spacecraft to the closest moon, then a totally different program sent missions to the other moon. Even more fascinating is if the Apollo missions visited each moon in the same mission, or perhaps there were steps, like Apollo 11 landed on Moon1 and Apollo 13 or so landed on Moon2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most fascinating idea were if two bodies capable of sustaining intelligent life in the same orbital system. Imagine if the Moon really did have oceans. While Galileo is pointing his telescope at the Moon, Neil Moonstrong is climbing aboard the Command Module to land on Earth with an Earth Excursion Module. You\u0027d only really need a Saturn IB Rocket to get to Earth, as de-orbiting from the Moon would be much easier than transfering to the Moon. I am assuming for the purposes of a thought experiment that both planets have humans on them, and similar histories.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chri","CreatedById":62741,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T23:54:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI personally enjoy the fact that we have only one Moon...THE Moon..if we had two I think Moon 1 would still be considered the most important...but it wouldn\u0027t be the same thing..it wouldn\u0027t be that grey circle in the sky that made us dream for centuries and millennia...it wouldn\u0027t have the same..taste and mystery..if there were more than one\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Themohawkninja","CreatedById":9628,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T00:03:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022XilentDude\u0022 data-cite=\u0022XilentDude\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMoon\u0027s equatorial radius is 1200 kilometers.
