Earlier civilisations had a harder time transporting ores and so were quite likely to make do with rubbish. Producing metal takes more fuel than ore, so they had to transport the ores to a place where fuel is plentiful or more likely find both very close together. Furthermore, there is a difference between the sort of deposit that is economical when mining by hand (depth matters more) or by machine (size matters more). Case in point: some of the earliest artisanal haematite mines in the world are still in operation in Southern Africa. (It has been used in cosmetics since thousands of years before smelting was discovered.) The iron ore that\u0027s exploitable under current market conditions still amounts to billions and billions of tonnes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur coal won\u0027t run out anytime soon. There\u0027s something like 7x the carbon in the atmosphere still trapped in coal. Enough to realise any global warming nightmare you care to think of. Some of it is deep below the surface, true, but a lot of current coal mining is open-pit mining which pretty much implies that it\u0027s shallow enough to get to with hand tools.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECharcoal, on the other hand, can not sustain iron production on an industrial scale. There\u0027s a reason Europe is no longer covered in forest--the blacksmiths burned most of it.

Usually, tunnels take a year and a half to dig (equivalent to expanding a mine), then a year to add things like electric lights, wiring, plumbing, and backup generators.

They had to rely on their existing adaptations. We, on the other hand, have technology that allows us to live in and adapt to a variety of harsh environments. We would also know about an impending impact long enough in advance that we could stockpile resources to allow a group of survivors to muddle through. A stockpile of books, machines, tools, medicine, fuel and food would go a long way towards getting a fairly modern society back on its feet again quickly after such an event.
