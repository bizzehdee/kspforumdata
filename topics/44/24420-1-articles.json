If any of you have watched Star wars, or played games like Star Conflict, you will see them in orbit, doing crazy maneuvers slowly down, speeding up, doing insane changes of their direction. How could something like this happen? Would they not fall back to the planet they are around? Wouldn\u0027t they run out of fuel just turning around because they have to stop all forward momentum in one direction to alter their course?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat kind of mechanics do you think are at play here, what technology do you think could exist in the future to prevent them from returning to earth or whatever their planet is while still maintaining nice speed etc etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T00:43:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStar Wars is actually a pretty bad example. The dogfights were inspired by WWII movies, and were made to look good on film, a long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, where the laws of physics are not at all the same ones we have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, dogfighting is a thing of the past. Nowadays, jet fighters launch their missiles from 50 to 100km from their target. The winner is usually the plane that has the best radar system. Also, the F-22/F-35 are probably the last generation of manned fighter aircraft. Why would you risk a pilot by putting him in a plane, when you can put him in a control room and remote control a drone? Drones are becoming more capable than manned aircraft, with a longer range, longer loiter times, and they can take higher G loads in manoeuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is also true for space fighters. Why would you use a manned military spacecraft to fire a weapon when the weapon can be the actual spacecraft? It is cheaper and safer to just fire a missile rather than to launch a manned spacecraft to fire the missile and return safely without being hit in return. Something like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSS_11\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EXSS-1\u003C/a\u003E isn\u0027t as sexy as an X-Wing, but it would probably work better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, If you\u0027ve played KSP, you know how hard it is to rendez-vous with a target. In our case, the target is usually a space station or a satellite, that is passive, and wants you to dock with it. Now imagine how hard it would be if the target was changing its orbit in a random direction every 5 minutes. You simply couldn\u0027t reach it at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModern ASAT weapons are usually air-to-air missiles that have been modified to target a stable military satellite in a predictable LEO position. It is assumed that enemy satellites will not have time to detect the weapon or to try to evade it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best solution is probably a high-power laser system. This could potentially be able to burn a hole in a satellite in a couple of seconds. It\u0027s easier to hit the target, because you can aim for where the target is NOW rather than where it will be in 10 minutes. You don\u0027t need the power to blow up the enemy satellite. All you need is to burn a hole big enough in its solar panels to cut the power or in its tank to make it outgas and lose control. The problem is that these lasers are big and heavy and expensive, which makes them impratical to send to orbit. It is probably more efficient to fire them from an Aegis cruiser or an airborne platform, like the (cancelled) \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_YAL-1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBoeing 747 YAL-1\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut all in all, this would all make for a crappy movie, so lets enjoy Star Wars for what it is.

You know, big battleships move like aircraft carriers or submarines, fighters fly like aeroplanes. All this stuff simply could not happen in reality because objects in space do not behave like they are in water or in air - they are of course in neither of these. Pretty much the only thing that is vaguely believable is the flips that the Vipers in Battlestar Galactica do, where they roll their ship around to fight enemies from all angles while maintaining their trajectory. This could happen, but all the rest of the time where they move around like Spitfires couldn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause there is no friction in space, things... can\u0027t turn very well. It would certainly take, as you suggest, huge amounts of fuel and energy to \u0022turn around\u0022 to start flying back towards the enemy who is chasing you. This doesn\u0027t mean you would fall back to Earth if you tried it though, because speed is relative. If I reduce my speed on the motorway from 70mph to 60, the guy behind still doing 70 will overtake but I won\u0027t come to a standstill. The interesting thing about doing that sort of thing in space though is that by doing a retro-burn you actually end up lowering your orbit which means you will speed up. In other words, if you are in an orbital dogfight and you want to put some distance between you and your pursuer, point your nose at him and light the engines! The distance between you will reduce at first as you lower your speed, but the further along your new orbit trajectory you get, the more you will pull away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBallistic weapons are pretty much a no go in space for two reasons. Firstly, targets are very, very very small and very difficult to hit. The ranges you\u0027ll be fighting from will also be much larger than they are in atmosphere. Secondly, firing guns will alter your trajectory as the projectile and hot gasses being expelled from the barrel would work much like a rocket engine. Finally, anything you shoot stays in orbit and poses a threat to you and your allies as much as it does your enemies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong story short, I don\u0027t think \u0022space combat\u0022 is likely to happen for a very, very long time if ever. It\u0027s just too much hassle. If there IS any kind of space fighting, I imagine it\u0027ll be fought exclusively with nukes because that\u0027s the only way you\u0027re likely to cover an area large enough to hit anything.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T06:54:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe best, by leagues, space combat simulation is in Babylon 5: I\u0027ve Found Her.

Star Wars is a sci-fi series though so let\u0027s consider an existence of technology we don\u0027t yet possess: anti-gravity. Today\u0027s real life spacecraft needs to be put into orbit to stay in space. In other words, it needs to constantly move fast enough not to fall. That\u0027s because big celestial bodies such as, say, the Earth, have gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what if we had some kind of a powerful, yet small anti-gravity device that would fit onto a fighter spacecraft and would compensate for every kind of gravity it encounters? That way, orbiting would no longer be necessary because celestial bodies such as stars or planets wouldn\u0027t pull the spacecraft down. That means you could point your vehicle up, fly it to space in a straight line and just stay there without moving at all. That also means you could make all the maneuvers you want and it would enable you to fly around more or less as you would through air. Well, kinda... if you picked up speed, you couldn\u0027t then just point the nose up and change direction in a matter of seconds (unless, of course, the anti-gravity device had the ability to manipulate gravity in such a way to move it like that)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...And that\u0027s pretty much how it was depicted in Star Wars.

Star Wars is a sci-fi series though so let\u0027s consider an existence of technology we don\u0027t yet possess: anti-gravity. Today\u0027s real life spacecraft needs to be put into orbit to stay in space. In other words, it needs to constantly move fast enough not to fall. That\u0027s because big celestial bodies such as, say, the Earth, have gravity.\u003Cp\u003EBut what if we had some kind of a powerful, yet small anti-gravity device that would fit onto a fighter spacecraft and would compensate for every kind of gravity it encounters? That way, orbiting would no longer be necessary because celestial bodies such as stars or planets wouldn\u0027t pull the spacecraft down. That means you could point your vehicle up, fly it to space in a straight line and just stay there without moving at all. That also means you could make all the maneuvers you want and it would enable you to fly around more or less as you would through air. Well, kinda... if you picked up speed, you couldn\u0027t then just point the nose up and change direction in a matter of seconds (unless, of course, the anti-gravity device had the ability to manipulate gravity in such a way to move it like that)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...And that\u0027s pretty much how it was depicted in Star Wars. If you pay attention you will notice that before each spaceship flew into space, it just lifted itself up without any thrusters.
