Yes, Mars has an atmosphere (a thin one), but concepts for Mars atmospheric entry (aerocapture/aerobraking/landing) usually involve large circular deceleration shields or wingless lifting bodies (with a biconic shape) for the large surface area. Also, it\u0027s not exactly \u0022live\u0022 due to the signal delay.
