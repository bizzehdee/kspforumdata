Its a extreme environment so you would have to choice what ones very carefully and we would need the exact conditions on the area we want to send them before we send them and I can only think off the top of my head one that could POSSIBLY survive now and thats Deinococcus radiodurans.

Not sure about how scientific it is, but the tidal forces caused a lot of earthquakes, but some things made it through. The coolest part about the story was the atmosphere freezing up and falling as snow, with layers of nitrogen oxygen, etc, with a average height of 11.6 meters, if evenly distributed. (EDIT: It might rain those elements first.) Anyway, some people survived, most by places with nuclear reactors to provide unlimited power, like Los Alamos.
