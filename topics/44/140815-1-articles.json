If you observe water flowing you see continuity, not the chaos of activity of electrons and protons and oxygen nuclei that constitute the stream. We have a definition of space, lets just pretend that space is compose of 3D blocks with plancks length sides, its virtual space just like the particles inside. OK that is the setup. The problem has always been converting what goes on at the small scale to make sense at the large scale, and the most tricky part is quantum gravity.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk the second part here is that Newton proposed gravity is two objects applying force to each\u00A0other. This is true you apply force to the ground and the ground forces you up. But its actually a faux force. Einstien\u00A0percieved that if you put an object in a centrifuge an spin it, the object feels an outward force from its\u00A0point of view, but from an inertial objective point of its the bottom of the centrifuge that is applying the non-inertial force, and this force and the ground pushing up on a standing person cannot be distinguished in quality. The centrifugal force is thus a fictitious force \u0027faux\u0027 and so is gravity. Instead there is space-time. If you throw the tiniest\u00A0particles at a section of space time with lots of energy the particles tend to bend relative to the path taken by light\u00A0and as long as the object is not too\u00A0massive or have lots of drag, the particles will assume an orbit. IOW,\u00A0my energy warps the space time of earth a little, and the earth warps the space-time\u00A0which I am\u00A0in much more so. So from our point of view its easier to see the effects of earth on space time more than our bodies on the earths\u00A0space-time.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo how does it do it. One way is to change one\u00A0of the dimensions of planks space, to essentially flatten one dimension. Here is the basic problem, in the quantum world space is funky, meaning there is no objective reality or time that can explain it. Probably a good explanation of spatial dimensions on planck scale is a cube of jelly tied to the back of a bronking bull 2 seconds out of the gate, on steroids. Then during the series take a clock of the space and randomly go back and forth away from the time stamp. So lets assume the back of the bull is absolutely flat and omnipotent, let this represent\u00A0diiferent horizons of a black hole. As we progress closer the jelly would flatten\u00A0in one dimension, until finally, at the black holes event horizon that 3 dimensional quanta is now 2 dimensional, its third dimension is no longer observable from the objective. The jelly can still wobble in the other two dimensions, constricted by space-time, its wobble in the third is now gone.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me clarify this, the\u00A0\u00A0little time quantum spatial units would be flattened wobbly in 3D up to the event horizon, at which point one\u00A0dimension just dissappears, there are an near inifinite number of flat virtual space-times accumulating at the horizon and merging into the singularity. If the singularity had enough energy like our universes pre inflation state\u00A0all dimensions will decompose into one.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Fundemental to the argument\u00A0is that dimension length can only be zero or positive, non negative, so quantum gravity representing gravity would need to represent the pliability of quantum space whose composite with quantum times represent\u00A0space-time\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe proposal is that quantum space can have alot of flexibility, but from our perpective if enough warping aspect\u00A0is applied in one\u00A0perspective, one of its dimensions can dissappear, and consequently we cannot see furthe in that direction. There is an entropy argument to be made concerning energy.\u00A0This means that from our perspective the information in the black hole is in that last boundary layer of quantum space. Yes its a hideous argument, its what happens when you rely too heavily\u00A0\u00A0on models.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope i have reconstituted the argument faithfully. I see this as an intesting model with pitfalls. First although Hawkings saw a problem with entropy, and Hawkings radiation is the solution, so another solution is not neccesary, but might be tolerable. The authors refer to this as the semiclassical explanation.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other problem is that quantum gravity is supposed to be a scalar boson, so are\u00A0we thinking of quantum gravity as reciprocal space? If no quantum gravity is present, the\u00A0quantum space\u00A0would be infinite. This makes the inflation of the universe look like an unpacking of quantum gravity. But in the model above the little quantum space times are condensed at the event horizon, wouldn\u0027t\u00A0also unpack from the edge, not from the whole of the enterior. I don\u0027t have a problem with the concept but the pape does not explain well.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is the point of loop quantum gravity.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other point, imagine the total quantity of energy in the universe, now imagine them as\u00A0individual quantum spatial interactors. Now imagine yourself as a jello-y spatial quantum, can you feel the whole\u00A0universe, or just a wee little bit at a faux time. \u00A0Can we imagine that as the universe heads to the diffuse\u00A0energy state that the action on quantum space is so numerous and so small would quantum time have meaning any more.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have to dissagree that within space time all spatial quanta\u00A0share the same properties, it\u00A0seem to me thay share an average property. Its like saying all humans share the same properties even though some are 7 feet and some ar 3 feet tall.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-02T02:12:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://futurism.com/new-evidence-that-black-holes-may-actually-be-2d-holograms/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://futurism.com/new-evidence-that-black-holes-may-actually-be-2d-holograms/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-08T17:11:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2016/jun/08/soft-hairs-help-resolve-the-black-hole-information-paradox\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2016/jun/08/soft-hairs-help-resolve-the-black-hole-information-paradox\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
