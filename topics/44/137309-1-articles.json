So says Wikipedia at any rate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, the blastocyst itself develops from a smaller, solid ball of cells, so clearly the cells have had to move around to produce a hollow ball from a solid ball. I\u0027m not a cell biologist, so I don\u0027t know how that movement occurs but I\u0027d be very surprised if it could be significantly affected by gravity simply because cells are so small that any force responsible for moving them around will be massively stronger than any gravitational force acting on the cells.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLater on in development, I can imagine that mechanical forces between developing tissues will become increasingly important and those kind of forces may be affected by zero-g.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-19T11:59:20Z\u0022 title=\u002204/19/2016 11:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-19T12:56:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is a crucial first step in development of the fetus though, so at least for now, we know that the embryo can get that far, enough to begin the stage where it can attach to the womb and begin further development - I imagine the next step that the researchers do will be implanting these embryos to test mouses and see how they work out.

You would grow up never developing strong bones, and probably end up with twisted limbs that have little function. There was a great YouTube video going over the potential problems of this (including the whole getting pregnant in the first place part, which has its own set of problems).
