You know they just take off from Earth and then reach the orbiting Elysium in a straight line. So i guess Elysium is synchronized with the Earth so it keeps relative to the same spot to the ground, in that case i\u0027m assuming -but i don\u0027t really know- it would be possible for a ship to behave as in the movie: just point at the big thing in the sky and go full throttle. But then again, for Elysium to be synchronized like that with the Earth it should be pretty far away from it, according wikipedia it is like 35.000 km high but they seem to get there very fast and don\u0027t even sit down while exiting the atmosphere! At that speed shouldn\u0027t they have a hard time not breaking their bones against the walls? I find it hard to mantain balance in the bus!\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother thing is that Elysium has it\u0027s own atmosphere with an open sky in that station. Something like that is even plausible, has ever been studied to do it in the future?\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt just looked weird from my point of view, but then again, my only \u0022knowledge\u0022 of physics come mostly from KSP so i don\u0027t know, maybe it is accurate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-08T13:22:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think Elysium is in GSO.
