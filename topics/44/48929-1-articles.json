They regulate functions in your body; things not controlled by ones own mind, trough the nerves, but the general state in which ones body is in. Hormones flick the swiches which define in what kind of \u003Cem\u003Emode\u003C/em\u003E you are in. Love, rage, hungry or in combat/flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELadies and gentlemen\u003C/strong\u003E, I\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4d like to discuss about one specifically. Adrenaline to be precise, sometimes referred to as Epinephrine. What do you think about it and what kind of adrenaline rushes have you expirienced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy strongest \u003Cem\u003E\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4C9H13NO3\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4\u003C/em\u003E-rush was during an landfall exercise. Something in context to the physical strain and the mindset I had at the moment triggered the rush, wiping out all restraints. I could dash with a 5,7 kg sniper rifle, loosly aiming down the scope without shaking the barrel around. I could see everything sharply, my focus unbreakable. I did not feel any sort of fatigue, nor did I get winded. I could feel my brain go on overdrive, I could process any input at once! My reflexes were like the lightning, If there was a target, I had it marked before I really knew that I did. It was incredible, awesome. An immense feeling of energy, ones veins surging with energy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was quite sore and on bruises the next day. Dashing, crawling and pouncing around without feeling any pain had had its toll. Nevertheless, I now have a awe towards the human body, it has quite a few aces up its sleeve.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
