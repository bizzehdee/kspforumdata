It\u0027s even conceivable that the Moon itself could have its OWN moon, of the same nature - some object it captured (though this is unlikely due to its highly uneven gravity field - even if the Moon were the only body affecting an orbiting object, that object\u0027s orbit would decay due to the highly uneven distribution of mass beneath the surface).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason that our Moon is so anomalous is its unusual origin story - it isn\u0027t captured, nor did it accrete from early Solar System material. Rather, as the current prevailing theory goes, another body, roughly the size of Mars, smashed into Earth a few hundred million years after its formation, blasting massive amounts of planetary material into orbit (and beyond). Over time, this accreted into a large, low-orbiting satellite as the larger fragments drew pieces towards themselves, and were themselves drawn towards even larger fragments. Due to this taking place relatively quickly (because of the abundance of material), the Moon actually underwent some geological differentiation - current models predict that the Moon has a proper core and mantle like the Earth (though much smaller in relation to the crust, which dominates). The unusual story of its formation is also likely responsible for its uneven gravity field - some of the Earth-lumps (side note: anyone got a better name for them? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) were denser than others, and those concentrations of mass persisted during the formation of the Moon as we know it today.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-16T02:48:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ReptilianGameplays\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ReptilianGameplays\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOh, so that\u0027s why Pluto has many moons even with the size?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart of it.
