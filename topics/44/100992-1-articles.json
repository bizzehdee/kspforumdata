The first thought would be yes, it should help. You want to bring ship to some velocity v. So you take some big mass M, add some smaller amount of negative mass (-m), and now total momentum you need is (M-m)v. Requiring less thrust and less fuel.\n\nBut consider the actual interactions between chunks of mass and negative mass. Imagine that you have a big block of negative mass sitting in front of you. You try to push it out of the way. You apply a force forward, but F = ma, and the mass is negative. The block tries to accelerate towards you instead. If you want it to move forward, you have to pull on it instead! I cannot imagine how one would build a structure out of this stuff. At best, it\u0027d probably rip itself apart.\n\nNow, from perspective of Quantum Mechanics. What you are really suggesting is that part of the matter in the ship has forward velocity but reversed momentum. This is, indeed, possible. Virtual particles do this routinely. However, such particles cannot propagate freely. They can only hold on to that momentum for a brief time, and then mast pass it on to other matter. Any stable matter must propagate in direction of the momentum. And so you end up with no way to create negative mass.

I don\u0027t think a magnet made of negative mass would even hold itself together, but let\u0027s pretend it does. Well to start with, magnets are dipoles, and in this configuration, it would want to flip around so that both poles attract each other, and then once it does, the negative mass will be repulsed away. If you find a way to not make it happen, things are getting intereresting.
