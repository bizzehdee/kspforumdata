The asteroids could come later, but we\u0027ll stick to Earth-mined for now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027ll also abstract the launcher and return vessel. *ahem*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022...our patented SuperCheap booster and SuperLift reusable second stage can lift and return 50 metric tons to SpaceMade\u0027s orbiting tele-operated factory complex in LEO for $50 per kilogram return. Lower rates available for \u0027bundling\u0027. Our engineers assure us that we can bring the costs down even lower, perhaps by a factor of five. We deliver to most spaceports. Import fees listed on request.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe question I have to then ask: \u003Cu\u003Eat this cost, what would make sense for this hypothetical factory to make?\u003C/u\u003E What about lower costs of launch? $25/kilogram? $10/kilogram? I\u0027ll assume its manufacturing has cost parity with a normal factory, but it has the advantages of cheap high-vacuum, abundant solar power and micro-gravity to make... whatever unique product that\u0027s an advantage for. It also has the disadvantages of radiation and needing to shed heat, but we\u0027ll assume the plant designer thought of that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the scale looks like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n$10,000,000/kg - This is where we are now. Commercial spaceflight has already dipped their toe in this, with Varda Space manufacturing\u00A0rare pharmaceuticals such as ritonavir. (But they\u0027ve run afoul of the FAA and gone to ask if Australia would be amenable. Something else that has to be worked out before the taps are opened.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n$100,000/kg - Aerospace parts, exotic semiconductors; this is *waggles hand* national defence-level money. Could also produce therapeutic radio-nuclides without worrying about the neighbours; I think I saw a proposal for producing radioactive Rhenium from proton bombardment of a tungsten oxide target... and one of the Van Allen belts just happens to be full of energetic protons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n$1000/kg - University projects, printing human organs in zero-G, specialised electronics, in-orbit production of satellites and probes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n$100/kg - Starting to edge into luxury novelty goods: metallic glass for golf clubs, perhaps space-grown crops\u00A0 - Space-Cacao, anyone?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n$50/kg - Drawing a blank.

Moore\u0027s Law is reaching its limits and will soon be obsolete (some are saying \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.marketwatch.com/story/moores-laws-dead-nvidia-ceo-jensen-says-in-justifying-gaming-card-price-hike-11663798618\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eit already is\u003C/a\u003E). Once we have lower-cost access to space, I\u0027m sure that some of these tech companies will be itching to experiment with ways that microgravity can increase the density or function of integrated circuit chips. With crystal growth in microgravity, perhaps we could see more true monolithic \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_integrated_circuit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E3DIC\u003C/a\u003E chips, where transistors are \u0022grown\u0022 on a three-dimensional lattice to achieve exponentially greater processing speed with a smaller footprint and reduced power consumption.

We have a lot of technologies that depend on liquid-based fossil fuels and internal combustion engines, and there appear to be limits to battery density. What if we could send up a few hundred tonnes of waste plastic with some sort of solar-powered bacteria or bacteria-fungal symbiote that, once exposed to sunlight and microgravity, could \u0022eat\u0022 through the plastic and produce hydrocarbons or some other hydrogen-dense fuel at scale, creating its own lattice structure to continually absorb more and more sunlight?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AckSed","CreatedById":224249,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-30T22:09:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s something that might be facilitated by cheap in-orbit manufacturing: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1383586619358630\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewaterless, high-efficiency recycling of lead-refining waste via vacuum distillation of metals\u003C/a\u003E.
