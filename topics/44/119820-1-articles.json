The 55 knots is more than generous enough. I doubt that Malloy\u0027s could top that. Or do you mean the power-off stall speed? That, indeed, does not apply to rotorcraft. The aforementioned auto-rotation condition applies instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bottom line, from perspective of FAA, is whether the aircraft can be landed safely in case of engine failure. So long as there is a way to do so, they are happy to grant you an exemption even if you don\u0027t fit the exact letter of the regs. Martin\u0027s Jetpack is a good example. They\u0027ve substituted an emergency parachute for glide/auto-rotate capability. And as I\u0027ve indicated above, there is no reason why Malloy\u0027s wouldn\u0027t be capable of safe landing on engine failure, unless you\u0027re doing something stupid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, it\u0027d be pretty easy to crash on power failure, by simply fighting natural descent and trying to keep going at full speed. You\u0027ll still descend gently enough, but that won\u0027t help you much if your stands catch on the ground going 40 knots. On the other hand, that\u0027s not terribly different from any rotorcraft. Just because they can auto-rotate, doesn\u0027t mean they\u0027ll do that without pilot\u0027s help. In case of quad-like ground-effect craft, proper procedure in event of engine failure will be hard pitch away from direction of travel. That will rapidly kill the ground speed while also supplementing lift, allowing gentle landing. You\u0027d have less than a second to react, but since pitching \u0022back\u0022 when you start dropping should be normal thing to do even during normal operation, as it recovers altitude faster than throttling up, I don\u0027t expect it will be particularly difficult to land safely.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-07T14:24:52Z\u0022 title=\u002209/07/2015 02:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by K^2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-07T14:54:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addiction to K2 words, if you read the FAQ, it said that the \u0022bike\u0022 will come with parachutes (maybe 4 small parachutes in the corners, and the pilot may carry one in the back. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis thing has 4 engines, and I guess it would be able to flight (or descend slowly) with just 3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe pilot does not need to learn the autorotation procedures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso not sure why you said that autogyro is always autorotating?

The w vector shows relative wind. It\u0027s more vertical in stalled region because blade moves slower close to the hub. The actual pitch of the blade is roughly constant throughout, but the angle of attack changes because angle of relative wind changes. In the driving region, drag is very small, and relative wind is pretty vertical. Lift is much higher than drag here, so the net force on the blade actually forces it to rotate forward. This is similar to how the glider keeps going forward despite maintaining positive angle of attack. In contrast, while driven portion actually generates more lift, it also generates significantly more drag, and because the relative wind is more horizontal here, the net force ends up against motion of the blade. Torque on driving and driven portions of the blade ends up balancing each other out, providing constant rate of revolution of the main rotor during descent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
