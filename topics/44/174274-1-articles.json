Same with a descent path \u2013 but first I have to get the rocket into Kerbin\u2019s orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have CelestLab installed with CelestLab on top but I can\u2019t quite figure out how I can simulate a delta-v change. I haven\u2019t found a function that gives me the orbital parameters after a delta-v change at any point on orbit. If I can\u0027t find a way, I will try to assemble my own simulation environment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\u003Cbr\u003E\nGreetings\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
