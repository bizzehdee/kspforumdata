You can try asking about it in modding section. Failing that, there are two general options.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) Unity runs via DirectX on PC. There are tools specifically for ripping 3D models from DX games. 3D Ripper DX is pretty popular, and apparently, people have used it successfully with KSP. So that might be a good way to start.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) There are some Unity specific tools for ripping models, which might make it easier to get model and corresponding textures together. [url=https://github.com/ata4/disunity/releases][u]Disunity[/u][/url] came up after a brief search, but it is Java, so I don\u0026#39;t know if you want to bother.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nPersonally, I\u0026#39;d give 3D Ripper DX a try, since it\u0026#39;s something that people have been using for years to rip models from all sorts of games. It usually has the downside of not handling animations, but that\u0026#39;s not a problem for KSP.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOh, keep in mind that pretty much regardless of what you use, you\u0026#39;ll end up with individual modules, not the whole rocket/plane.
