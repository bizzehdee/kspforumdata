to be reminded of the obvious, you won\u0027t last long in the field while that big a danger to yourself (says the guy who worked with a Senior Electronic Engineer who was missing the use of the fingers in his left hand thanks to using a band saw the wrong way.\u00A0 Let\u0027s just say the technicians kept the engineers away from the power tools much more zealously for awhile).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond: three phase motors have another large advantage as the sum of the voltage between each two rails is constant (the sum of all three together is zero, but circuits rely on two inputs).\u00A0 This allows a three-phase motor to deliver smooth power instead of the 120Hz impulses of single phase (in practice this was pretty irrelevant.\u00A0 Single phase and gasoline engines can simply add a flywheel to smooth out the power, but it becomes much more relevant in modern application where the inverter is only generating power for the motor [because it essentially is part of the motor]).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, his description of \u0022brushless\u0022 vs. \u0022induction\u0022 motors is all wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022old fashioned\u0022 (i.e. 20th century and the Edison vs. Tesla battles up to domination by switching power supplies).\u003Cbr\u003E\nDC motors had brushes and used electromagnets to pull permanent magnets (or vice versa).\u00A0 The brushes were needed to switch the electromagnets on an off and/or switch polarity.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAC motors were \u0022induction motors\u0022 and used electromagnets on both sides.\u00A0 They were tied to 3600rpm (or a close integer multiple, I think a 3 phase motor would get thee times that) thanks to the fixed frequency coming from the generator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think there was also a pretty hard limit of ~30hp (22kW) power limit on AC motors (although I\u0027d think you could get the thing going with a system of kludging relays into square waves for frequencies ~6Hz or so).\u00A0 DC motors should be more powerful without starting motors or other kludges, but I\u0027m sure they had similar issues at some power level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nModern motors of the 21st century:\u003Cbr\u003E\nBrushless: Just like the old fashioned type, except that transistors control the output into the motor instead of brushes.\u00A0 In practice also expect the control circuits to include most of the parts for a DC-DC converter to send just the right power to the right places.\u00A0 Also these motors tend to use rare-earth elements to make wildly more powerful permanent magnets.\u00A0 Generally the powerful rare earth magnets allow for a more compact motor.\u003Cbr\u003E\nInduction: Just like the old fashioned type, except that instead of getting power from the generator as AC, they produce the AC directly (and if powered by AC you can expect this to be first converted to some DC rails used to power the AC inverter, and anyone designing the inverter will nearly always design this in three phase [unless cutting cost and indifferent about efficiency] to balance out the draw against those DC rails).\u00A0 This allows the motor to produce maximum torque at zero RPM and let a Tesla move the car with 800hp (or whatever \u0022plaid\u0022 produces.\u00A0 The old ones would just have enough torque to move the motors at 30hp and need a clutch once going).\u00A0 The other benefit to induction motors is that it is far easier to use them as generators while braking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- note: I suspect that \u0022old fashioned induction\u0022 motors to never quite die out for low power sources that operate at a fixed speed with an AC supply.\u00A0 Brushed DC motors are already dead as the life expectancy of a brushless motor is much higher and the cost already low (the volume just isn\u0027t there for a cheaper brushed motor).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS: no matter what his shirt says, a full wave bridge rectifier is drawn like the following (are Canadian drafting standards that
