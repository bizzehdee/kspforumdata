You can sell the reality TV show that will be the selection process for the candidates, and that\u0027s the best that the people that signed up for this can hope for.

Every government that supports this will have to deal with the political fallout when people will die and they will feel pressured to send a rescue mission, but those governments will gain none of the propaganda glory that comes with starting it themselves, they just risk being seen as not doing enough.

If you propose a program to go to Mars that doesn\u0027t include a proving run where people spend the same time in a closed off environment on earth or in earth orbit, you are doing it wrong. People here naturally focus on space. But what about first establishing an autonomous colony in LEO, Antarctica, on Mount Everest or in the oceans? If it\u0027s so easy, it should be no problem. But actually, there\u0027s not even a single successfull attempt to really colonize the parts of earth that don\u0027t support human life. If you can survive in Antarctica, at the top of an 8000 m high mountain, or at the bottom of the ocean for a few years without help from the outside, we can talk.
