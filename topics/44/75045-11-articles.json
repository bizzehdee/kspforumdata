And then people made such a huge stink about storing waste at all, because nuclear waste is so bad and evil and moving it would be bad. They hate the waste so much they\u0027d rather not have any place to store it properly and then glower at nuclear proponents and yammer about waste storage. It boggles the mind.

We can mitigate the risk through technical measures, but it\u0027s a process that requires a bit of care.
