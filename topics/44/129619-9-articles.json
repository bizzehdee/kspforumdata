Too hot? Use heat resistant materials. (Since you lack the apparent common sense, I\u0027m talking about the ones that are still effective at those temperatures, not the ones that weaken due to prolonged exposure.) Pressure too high? Well, again lets try this. Use materials that are unaffected by high pressures and construction methods that withstand those pressures. For unmanned, most of the craft can have an equalized pressure. For manned, just look at what we already have: space ships and submarines.

If we send a payload to Venus to mine platinum (current price, around $30,000/kg), it will have to come back with about 10% of its weight in platinum just to break even on your launch costs from earth.
