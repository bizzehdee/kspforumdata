You would also need a staged rocket - remember, this is Earth, not Kerbin, and you need close to 10 km/s dV to circularize in low earth orbit even with a perfectly flown gravity turn. And since the kinds of fuel you can buy at the hardware store are limited to around 200 Isp at most*, and single rocket stages are practically limited to just over 20x Isp in dV, there\u0027s no way whatsoever you\u0027re going to be launching a non-staged rocket anywhere close to space, even without payload. SSTO rockets don\u0027t actually work IRL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Hardware stores don\u0027t sell liquid oxygen. Cryogenic materials cannot be stored losslessly over time, even \u003Cem\u003Eif\u003C/em\u003E the store owner wanted to pay the significant storage costs 24/7, 365 days a year. Your best bet is probably nitrous oxide and polybutadiene rubber, which lets you build a hybrid bipropellant rocket like the one Virgin Galactic is planning to use for their suborbital tourist flights. That mixture does around 180 Isp and gives you an engine that is throttleable, reasonably easy to handle and relatively cheap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to watch some guys build such a rocket, here\u0027s a video:\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/P5JxXka50Gw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that, like all reality TV shows, this is fairly overdramatised. But it shows you roughly the upper bounds of what you can expect to achieve by bolting together a hobby rocket out of storebought materials.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for serious, commercial launch services, there are/were quite a surprising number of small launch vehicles around. Look for example at the US \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athena_I\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAthena I\u003C/a\u003E rocket. 820 kg to LEO, also fueled by polybutadiene rubber - although as a pure-solid fuel with baked-in oxidizer, which simplifies the design and greatly increases Isp. But that\u0027s already not something you can get at the hardware store anymore, you need specialized fuel production facilities to make that stuff. Also, you can probably expect the rocket to have dedicated production facilities with bulk-ordered materials as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe need for these kinds of rockets isn\u0027t very large, though, considering how easy it is to launch cubesats piggyback on larger rockets. SpaceX for example just completed their CRS-3 resupply mission to the ISS for NASA... and also carried five cubesats along on the side, because they had a few kg worth of payload left that NASA didn\u0027t need. You can get these secondary payload slots extremely cheap if all you have is a cubesat, much cheaper than buying your own rocket, no matter how small it would be. And you get the benefit of riding on a reliable and highly sophisticated booster like the Falcon 9 instead of something someone glued together in his backyard.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-20T08:32:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2014 08:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Comrade Jenkens","CreatedById":59544,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-20T09:11:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the UK all stages would have to be hybrid as building solid rocket motors get you charged with terrorism! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Apart from that and it being at least 5 miles from houses and airfields (almost impossible in the UK) I think anything goes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aghanim","CreatedById":76587,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-20T10:42:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHybrid is easier than liquid rockets, noted\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it seems that launch on existing boosters costs $40k...
