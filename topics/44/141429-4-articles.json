Governments are essential, and if the gov\u0027t is broke, look at the peeps for the ones who broke it. From my point of view everything is relative, the fact we are comparing SpaceX to NASA is one thing, but there are two peas in a pod, because its NASA that is providing the expertise to get SpaceX off the ground, no money transfers, but the knowledge base and background critiques so that they don\u0027t make any program ending mistakes. Government is providing contracts to SpaceX, but the US and foriegn governments. So from that point of view, with out some government impetus, the space programs in general probably would not be anywhere close to where they are today. I\u0027m not a punk, lived on the rock for a long time, and I have seen all kinds of attitudes, those that build and those that destroy. Never going to say that a gov operates a perfect store, but by the same token I know lots of govs, not mine, in the world that are but the worst enemies of the common man, and yet they still seem to get voted into office over and over again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not going to sit here and lets this excrementation go unchallanged, you can\u0027t sit around and casually say that the single most successful, by almost a magnitude, space program is somehow fallen, or broken at its core.

I see alot of NASA bad-mouthing, where are the comparables out there.
