I looked up a paper on Google scholar. In a paper titled \u0022Habitability of planets around red dwarf stars\u0022 we have:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClimatic implications of starspots were modelled in Joshi et al. (1997). dM stars generally exhibit spots proportionately much larger than those on our Sun. These can cause decreases in stellar luminosity of some 10\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u015340% for a few Earth months (Rodono, 1986). The extreme of a 40% decrease in luminosity lasting 4 months would result in a maximum decrease in surface temperature of 27 K in a zone running west along the 20N circle from the 0 meridian. Areas near the eastern terminator, in particular, would be liable to reductions to and below the freezing point of water. However, this would not involve temperature extremes that are excessive in terms of the tolerances of Earth tree species and it is reasonable to conjecture that native plants would evolve with the ability not to suffer fatal injury from low temperatures associated with sunspot growth activity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlare activity on dMe stars (chromospherically active red dwarf stars showing hydrogen-alpha in emission) is commonplace and has been studied for decades. Flares on a given star may vary greatly in intensity and duration (Kunkel, 1969; Pettersen and Coleman, 1981; Giampapa and Liebert, 1986; Rodino, 1986; Worden et al, 1984), although there are generalised relationships between mean \u00C3\u00AF\u00C2\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0161are energy and quiescent stellar output (Lacy et al., 1976). Flaring is most typical of young stars and seems to be related to rapid rotation. It wanes (the e-folding \u003Cstrong\u003Etimescale is roughly 1.0 Gyr\u003C/strong\u003E (Stauffer and Hartmann, 1986; Demarque et al., 1986), as rotation decays through stellar winds (but members of binary systems can be spun up, or retain rapid captured rotation; see Zahn, 1994, and references therein). Some stars \u00C3\u00AF\u00C2\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0161are very frequently, for example UV Ceti was seen to \u00C3\u00AF\u00C2\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0161are about every twenty minutes during observations reported by Mochanacki and Zirin (1980).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlares will be associated with increases in a star\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s output of X-rays, UV, visible, IR, and charged particles emitted as stellar winds (which enhance the radio \u00C3\u00AF\u00C2\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0161ux, as well), but essentially no radiation of wavelengths less than about 2900 \u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6 would reach the ground through an Earth-like atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EM.

However, I\u0027d bet the older red dwarfs still flare some... you probably never get rid of it.

However, I don\u0027t think that a magnetic field is 100% necessary. At atmosphere also acts to protect the surface from ionizing radiation. Additionally, the atmosphere-protecting value of a magnetic field may be literally a little over-blown. Just look at Venus- the thickest atmosphere of all the terrestrial planets, and virtually no magnetic field to speak of. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsider two other things-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe magnetic field would be more necessary when the star is young.
