My question is: could, and would, the entire human race, at some point in the next few centuries, move the majority of it\u0027s people and holdings into space (or rather, move the people, and replace the infrastructure on Earth with what resources we could harvest) and survive, even thrive, in literally the most inhospitable environment in existence, the cold, hot, empty, radiation-filled dark void?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s assume the Earth has gone bust, or is about to very soon. If we really dedicated ourselves to moving enough people into space so that the human race lives to see another day, then there wouldn\u0027t be much bother in getting there. The focus is on if we could adapt ourselves and the environment around us to survive long-term, and build ourselves back up to pre-evacuation standards in population, living conditions and industrial capacity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI once read an article on how living in the Asteroid Belt has some serious advantages, compared to living planetside. A massive torus-shaped space station can spin, and give the effect of any gravity field we wanted, particularly good ol\u0027 1G. In the center of the station, there would be no \u0022phantom forces\u0022 pushing you one way or another, so a \u0022good arm\u0022 qualifies as an SSTO transportation system. The entire Belt holds about 4% of the mass of the Moon, but the Moon\u0027s pretty big, and 4% of any big number is still a big number. In space, the Sun gives an intense glare, and that glare never stops. The \u0022world\u0022 really could depend on solar power entirely for it\u0027s electricity needs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, it wouldn\u0027t be a walk in the park. When the survival of your species is measured in how many centremetres of metal separates you from the vacuum, you will change. The early years will be very brutal, both in the toil each person will feel, mentally and physically, and on the necessities and luxuries the current western system of living gives us. There is also the engineering challenges, how can we shield ourselves from the thousands of solar flares we would have to endure to succeed? What do we do if a stray asteroid grazes a station?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow would we survive without the Earth, or any planet or moon for that matter, and how would that survival change the human race in terms of society, industry, culture, government, science and engineering etc.?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Top8","CreatedById":79933,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T22:50:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe National Space Society has an incredible range of resources \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nss.org/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.nss.org/\u003C/a\u003E as does the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.marssociety.org/home/about/mars-direct\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.marssociety.org/home/about/mars-direct\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been spearheading the design of a hard-sf setting set in 2070 that asks the same questions you do. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe university of Arizona also deals with lifesupport related issues and has a cool lunar farm project: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ag.arizona.edu/lunargreenhouse/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ag.arizona.edu/lunargreenhouse/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the economics and politics there are more than a few possilbilities - my team and I explored many of them for our setting research. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to take a look \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/67002-Visions-of-2070\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/67002-Visions-of-2070\u003C/a\u003E.

Even in the best of situations, which is a mile or two wide asteroid that has cleared the neighborhood, so to speak, you have limited resources. I do not mean oxygen or nitrogen or methane by this. I mean the metals and fuel needed to sustain a long-term colony that needs repairs, new vehicles, and spacesuits every few years. Once the metals and ores run out, we will have to develop a way to either synthetically create plastics, or abandon the colony.

The soliders would wear powerful relics of the past (powered-armor space suits) and go into epic hand-to-hand combat with other realms (other asteroid-cities). Since the priests don\u0027t want the peasents becoming too independent they keep knowledge of explosives and firearms closely secret, so most fighting is done with melee weapons.
