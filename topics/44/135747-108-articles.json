It\u0027s an argument very popular among SpaceX critics, who form the simple mental chain of \u0022SpaceX receives money from the government, therefore SpaceX receives subsidies\u0022 - and in doing so, demonstrate little other than their lack of understanding of what a subsidy actually is. If SpaceX receives money from the government as payment for services rendered, that is not a subsidy, but a contractual \u003Cem\u003Epayment\u003C/em\u003E. Unless you want to go and say that SpaceX also receives \u0022subsidies\u0022 from SES, from Orbcomm, from Intelsat and all its other commercial customers. The goverment can act as a normal commercial customer just fine, and does so all the time - in many sectors of industry and service, not just aerospace. At no point in any of those sectors is anyone talking about \u0022subsidies\u0022. That\u0027s just limited to people trying to invent arguments to discredit certain providers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA subsidy, by definition, is an amount of money paid by the government (or an amount of fees waived) to a non-government entity \u003Cem\u003Efor nothing in return\u003C/em\u003E, in order to keep that entity afloat economically and prevent loss of employment, or as a gift to motivate certain behaviors. Now, SpaceX did receive subsidies in a few of its projects; for example, the company was granted a $15 million \u0022incentive package\u0022, in the form of tax exemptions, from the state of Texas for choosing Boca Chica Beach as the location for their future private spaceport. That is the picture book definition of a subsidy. Of course, with that amounting to maybe a quarter of a single F9\u0027s cost, and with the payout being contingent on SpaceX first spending $100-$150 million in development and construction of said spaceport, that doesn\u0027t look much like the company would be able to keep itself afloat on that while operating at a loss, does it? Texas did this to ensure that SpaceX would choose them, not because they feel a particular need to artificially extend the company\u0027s life. Meanwhile, when NASA orders cargo launches to the ISS, then that\u0027s no different from NASA ordering a team of janitors for Kennedy Space Center. The janitors are not receiving \u0022government subsidies\u0022; they are receiving payment for services rendered to their customer. That the customer happens to be a government agency may be an interesting bit of trivia, but nothing that changes the contractual relationship between the two parties. Why should it be different for SpaceX?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-04T09:04:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen is the launch ?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-04T09:08:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently tracking\u00A015th December\u00A02154-0054 local time (2:54-5-54 UTC).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-04T11:17:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nGovernment subsidies: Since its inception,\u00A0SpaceX has relied on government contracts.

SpaceX wasn\u0027t the first to envision reusable rockets and won\u0027t be the last. The challenge never was technological. It has always been economical. Reusability only makes sense if you have high enough flight rates. Increasing flight rates does not depend solely on bringing costs down. It depends mainly on finding a purpose for those flights.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\nSpaceX has a high probability of finally achieving first stage recovery and reuse. That will be a great technological accomplishment, but let\u0027s remember that the goal isn\u0027t to recover or reuse stages, it is to bring costs down. Recovery and reuse do not automatically bring costs down, nor are they the only ways of bringing costs down. Ultimately, what will bring costs down is to increase flight rates in order to generate\u00A0economies of scale.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\nOrbital launches are expensive because they employ lots of people to manufacture, test, handle, integrate, transport, and launch the rocket, but also to build\u00A0payloads and ground stations,\u00A0integration,\u00A0fueling, handling, mission planning, mission control...\u00A0There are also infrastructure costs,\u00A0administrative overhead costs, facilities, power, IT, HR, training,\u00A0legal, catering, etc... \u00A0The result is hundreds, if not thousands of highly qualified\u00A0people, working in the aerospace industry.\u00A0The biggest cost factor is not the first stage hardware, it\u0027s the payroll\u00A0of a particularly expensive\u00A0workforce. Recovering the first stage is not going to automatically reduce costs by 50% (or even 20%) unless it allows to fire 50% of the workforce. It only has the potential to\u00A0save some of the manufacturing costs, the rest of the costs remain constant.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\nSpaceX has invested in facilities that can mass-produce Falcon cores. This means that if reusability comes into full swing, those facilities will be underproducing and\u00A0the cost of each stage will actually increase\u00A0due to the lack of economies of scale, which might negate the whole reusability business model.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\nThis is why the competitors of SpaceX (ULA, Airbus, etc.)\u00A0are in \u0022wait and see\u0022 mode. They have their plans to incorporate reusability into their business models if they need to, but they are mainly waiting to see how the market reacts to SpaceX and if SpaceX can actually make reusability profitable before they decide whether it makes economical sense to commit to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever great you think reusability is, once it is accomplished and repeated it will belong to competitors in a snap of the fingers and improved by competitors shortly thereafter, Musk has good common sense about energy conservation, but Besos\u00A0has good ideas about economy. Remeber that musk wanted to send mice to mars even before his car companies wheels were rolling, not good in the economic sphere.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Indians, Iranians\u00A0and Chinese wont give a hoot about patents\u00A0they will reverse engineer the stuff, none of the big players want to be left behind. The russians also have a status quo they want to preserve they wouldn\u0027t want the privates to take the remaining profit out of the space program. Everyone has an impetus to copy if it is more economical, and that is what they will do.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI should add that space industries have huge multiplyer effects because almost all the goods used to engineer and make rockets in the US are locally produced, its not killing the bidget tonsubsidize this, but the US must make sure the product is competitive for the reasons\u00A0stated above. We can\u0027t just throw $ into a hole and expect the long term outcome to be good. These jobs are high salaried with a good taxable base and these people buy\u00A0goods that support thier local economy. Just take a loknat the development around clear lake texas, they have even added a new port, and east texas has become the largest manufacturing center in the us, The government could be buying contracts with a dozen companies for the same platform profile and it would all be good for the economies in the short term.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoca chica is a practical desert, sure its green but mainly green on alot of loose sand, there is nothing there, but wait a decade or so.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe question is not whether delivering stuff to space can be economically profitable, the\u00A0question is whether space delivers back something that is profitable. Musk mousing up mars is a ego-shot, deliver a drone to a roid or comet or a martian moon and start doing some chemistry and delivering back to earth samples with that recoverable space vehicle.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-04T14:46:41Z\u0022 title=\u002212/04/2015 02:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
