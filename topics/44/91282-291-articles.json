But a) that problem already existed with reactive armor, and b) a heat round going off next to you might not be as bad as anti-personnel fragmentation grenade, but it\u0027s still bad news. So infantry moving with armor has to respect the distance regardless. You have to move a little further from a tank with reactive armor, and a little further yet if it\u0027s an active defense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBesides, if your armored units are built more around light APCs than heavy artillery units, and you rely on air support for strikes, you can probably get away with your infantry spending more time inside, where they are protected by the active defense, rather than outside, where they are threatened by it. That, of course, is all highly situational.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can hide tanks pretty well, and as other pointed out drones and planes mostly use subsonic missiles.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow it was one plan for an missile who used an kinetic kill projectile hitting at mach 3, this got canceled but is something you could bring back.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe problem with infantry in APC is that they are not infantry but passengers. Their main benefit is that you have an fast vehicle who is hard to ambush with machine guns or artillery who light skinned stuff like trucks is and also provides fire support.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow they also protect you from friendly fragments then you hitting targets, this works better with smart weapons as you can get much closer to the target so you hit an target with a bomb or two then kick in the door couple of seconds later, but walls does that too.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I agree that armored vehicles will probably become lighter and rely more on active defenses.
