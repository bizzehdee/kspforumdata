In turn, because that\u0027s a directory that has software in it, it\u0027s specially protected for security reasons. Among other things, users do not have write permissions in these folders. Because of this, it\u0027s considered a major faux pas to store any form of user data under C:\\Program Files\\, such as config files, savegames, documents and images, and so on.\n\nAlso, Windows is a multi-user OS, and while only a minority of software actually takes advantage of this, it\u0027s theoretically possible to install software in such a way that each individual user can use it in complete separation from all other users. In a game installed in such a way, you would not see the savegames created by someone who logged in with a different Windows account, for instance, and you making changes to graphics settings does not overwrite theirs - even though you\u0027ve launched the exact same game client.\n\nIn order to pull this off, and in order to isolate user data from the installed software, the software must actively hook into the OS in a certain way. It must be able to dynamically create folders for its user data under C:\\Users\\\u003Cusername\u003E\\... whenever a user who does not have these folders launches the software - even for user accounts which didn\u0027t even exist at the time of software installation. It must keep track of these locations it has created in case the software needs to be uninstalled, so they can be removed. It needs permission to launch in a user-isolated context. And so on, and so forth.\u003C/username\u003E\n\nAnd that doesn\u0027t even begin to get into more complex software that might run DRM measures or needs to supply its own runtime extensions, DLL files or even entire hardware drivers which need to be copied into Windows system folders and/or registered with the OS to be loaded when the computer starts up. Some software even installs other software it has a hard dependency on, and that software may require complicated installation procedures of its own.\n\nKSP can get away with just copying files because a.) it\u0027s completely encapsulated within the Unity runtime and does not require anything else to run; b.) it doesn\u0027t give a damn about people giving it weird looks for saving user data under Program Files (and you shouldn\u0027t install it there anyway, since some mods are broken by the restrictive permissions of that location); c.) it is not in any way, shape or form multi-user aware; and d.) it does not feature any DRM."},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T07:35:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Most games don\u0027t need much system setup, drm and anticheat is main exceptions.

Windows is the only operating system to act in this \u0022dirty\u0022 way.\n\nOn Mac OSX, most of the programs are \u0022self-contained\u0022. They are nothing more than a directory following some convention that you can drag-and-drop where you want ( by default in the application directory ).\n\nLinux distributions have packaging systems. deb or rpm packages are more or less a \u0022zip\u0022 of a list of file that are copied in predefined place. RPM/DEB can have scripting. The configuration under Linux is done \u0022per application\u0022 via configuration file and there is no such (ugly) thing as \u0022the registry\u0022.\n\nAndroid use an hybrid system between the Linux way and the OSX way. They have a packaging system but each package is mainly \u0022self-contain\u0022 to be isolated from the OS itself.\n\nThe concept of installation is a thing quite specific to Windows."},{"CreatedByName":"kurja","CreatedById":66303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T08:48:07Z","Content":"\u003E i assume linux does things more or less the same way, with some kind of install script. i dont really know what happens when i \u0027sudo apt-get install whatever\u0027, but i assume it does a lot of the same things that windows installers do.\n\napt-get will download only the needed resources/libraries aka dependencies from the ppa; that\u0027s one of the nice things with linux, many programs can share the same assets. The system does a wonderful job at keeping track of dependencies, so when you remove a program the assets that are used by other programs are left in place as needed. Apt-get installed software will also get automagically updated when you apt-get update \u0026\u0026 apt-get upgrade (what the normal, automatic system updater does in Ubuntu and such), so the individual programs do not need up-to date checking, which imho is a huge nuisance in windows."},{"CreatedByName":"Albert VDS","CreatedById":74055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T10:32:47Z","Content":"Software from a zip file requires the software to be self contained or at least runable on an average OS install.

Check Windows version for compatibility with the software being installed.\n\n2. Tell user what exactly he\u0027s going to install (name and version).\n\n3. Show the EULA and make user accept (or decline) it.\n\n3.5. Ask user for registration info (serial numbers etc) and do appropriate checks.\n\n4. Ask where the software should be installed to (disk and folder).\n\n5. Ask which features of the software should be installed. For example, when installing Microsoft Office suite, you can choose to install Excel and skip other features (Word etc) if you don\u0027t need them.\n\n6. Choose (according to the selected features and/or Windows version) and unpack necessary files to the proper location(s).\n\n7. Create shortcuts at the Start menu and/or desktop (and maybe somewhere else). Adding new Send To destinations also goes here.\n\n8. Create an entry in the Programs and Features (formerly Add/Remove Programs) Control Panel applet.\n\n9. Create additional registry entries (i.e. register new file types, protocol handlers, Windows Explorer context menu extensions etc; installing kernel mode drivers and system services (it the software needs them) also goes here).\n\n10. Install additional software packages (usually Visual Studio runtimes; years ago DirectX updates and various versions of .NET Framework were popular, too).\n\n11. Ask user if he wants to run the software right now.\n\nNot all these actions are used by every piece of software. Some of these actions can be performed by software itself on the first run. Some first-run actions usually performed by software and thus not mentioned above can be moved to installer. Some less popular actions are not mentioned at all.
