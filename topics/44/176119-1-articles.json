We have very little information about how to teleport (jumping is basically teleport), and especially, about wormhole, since we haven\u0027t even send a probe there, we don\u0027t even know if it leads to somewhere, so all current information about them is purely from observation, speculation and theoretical calculations\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, the laws of physics simply prevents it. Unless you have infinite energy and some plot-device level of propulsion technology, we simply ain\u0027t going anywhere. Gravity, orbital mechanic, energy requirements, spaceship design, material and most importantly heat dissipation, is the problem that must be overcome before we even started thinking about this.\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003EEven without \u0022Jumping\u0022 shenanigans (which is basically teleport, if we want to be literal), the idea of interstellar travel in respectable amount of time using cold hard science is still beyond our reach, judging by our current technology. If we\u0027re talking about \u0022conventional\u0022 propulsion techniques (i.e. rockets of one sort or another, whether chemical, nuclear, anti-matter, or whatever else), even approaching lightspeed would require more energy per second than all of Earth\u0027s industries use per year. While this may be explained\u00A0by advances in technology, the general formulas for velocity and acceleration are such that as you approach the speed of light, the energy needed to accelerate anything with non-zero mass increases asymptotically. In other words, you need an\u00A0infinite\u00A0amount of energy (and an\u00A0infinite\u00A0amount of time) to accelerate to the speed of light.

At first, they wrote about going to moon, then going to venus. After the space race, we started exploring other planets, and they naturally went nuts since those celestial bodies out there does not look like what they imagined/ speculated before, so they changed their setting to another star, but since the distance involved is literally astronomical (pun intended), and audience simply want to see the story progress to somewhere interesting in space (which is very very far when we\u0027re talking about distance in space), a plot device for travel was invented, and thus the concept of jump drive, warp, FTL and recently, wormhole portal was born.\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003EJumping/ warping/ wormhole mechanic is poorly explained in the sci-fi story.

So I take my model, throw in any uncertainties I can\u0027t account for, such as random fractures in the materials, and I get how thick I need to make critical parts to prevent failure with a 99.999...% guarantee.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow we take our current model. We make predictions, and they are perfect within our capacity to measure across the board. We take most pessimistic estimate of the odds, and we arrive at how certain we are about conclusions. Something that\u0027s going to have a lot of moving parts, like planetary trajectories, will have high uncertainty. We don\u0027t know the value of G all that well, we aren\u0027t tracking all objects in the system, and there can always be a rogue gravity wave. So you can\u0027t be too certain. But if you take something that follows as theorem from core principles, then you just take raw certainty in these principles. And as we\u0027ve stated, that\u0027s a ridiculous number now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then you say, \u0022What if it isn\u0027t? We\u0027ll do better.\u0022 How? You\u0027ve just taken the only thing that actually let us arrive at a theory - ability to establish degree of uncertainty - and thrown it out of the window. If you are saying \u0022It could be wrong,\u0022 you are saying, \u0022All of physics can be entirely wrong,\u0022 because you are putting huge error bars on base assumptions. Everything that follows will be worse. How the hell am I supposed to figure out tolerances on an airplane, if you can\u0027t even give me certainty on principles it\u0027s based on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can replace bad models, mechanisms we\u0027ve misunderstood, and it will only impact things that were being modeled this way. You can\u0027t just discard the core of what all of your knowledge is based on, and then just shrug it off, saying we\u0027ll do better. You\u0027ve just discarded the only way to get better. You are actively sabotaging the very means of obtaining knowledge by insisting on going by gut-feeling rather than theory on something so fundamental.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223406693\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022176119\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221530187828\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129408\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerbiloid\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n37 minutes ago, kerbiloid said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot that I\u0027ve failed, but do you already know, what is dark matter?

You want the space aboard your space ship to house your colorful characters, dazzling weapons, holodecks, shopping malls, and other fun and excitement \u2014 not deck after deck full of boring old propellant. And you want to allow for long patrols without having to refuel at every destination. So, you equip your spaceship with a gravity manipulation\u00A0Reactionless Drive\u00A0that allows her to accelerate without throwing material out of her tailpipe.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nBut hold on. There\u0027s a problem:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nFirst, if you allow them to accelerate without pushing anything, they are now violating one of the most basic laws known to physics: the\u00A0conservation of momentum. In the real world, you can\u0027t apply a force to an object in one direction without causing an equal-and-opposite force on some other object. Rockets fly up because their exhaust flies down. Jumping up pushes the Earth ever-so-slightly downward; falling back to the ground afterward pulls the Earth ever-so-slightly up. By letting your space ship violate this basic law, you\u0027re saying that momentum\u00A0is not always conserved.\u00A0What other circumstances in your universe will cause momentum not to be conserved? Do the laws of Newton simply get held in abeyance every time someone switches on a gravity generator? Are there natural phenomena that accomplish the same thing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nSecond, are you also\u00A0violating the conservation of energy? A 1000 tonne spaceship traveling 1/10 of the speed of light has a kinetic energy of 450 quintillion Joules, equal to 100,000 megatons of TNT. That energy had to come from somewhere. Did it come from burning some sort of fuel on board your space ship, to power the generators? If you used the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium as your fuel source, and you managed to\u00A0create a fusion reactor technology that\u0027s nearly 100% efficient, you\u0027d have to burn at least 350 tonnes of hydrogen to obtain that much energy, which is a third of your spaceship\u0027s own mass. (This isn\u0027t as bad a mass-ratio situation as if you\u0027d used a plain-old momentum-conserving fusion rocket, but it\u0027s still pretty significant.) And you\u0027ll have to burn just as much again to slow your space ship back down at the end of your trip. If this is too much for you, and you decide your reactionless gravity drive simply works by tapping into the magical gravity waves of the universe and surfing along them with only minimal power requirements, then your space ship\u0027s kinetic energy is being created \u0022ex nihilo\u0022. You\u0027ve got yourself a free energy machine! Just strap your space ship to one end of a long lever, strap the other end to a huge electric generator, and fly in circles. You can generate enough energy to power your entire civilization this way, with no cost in natural resources. This will play absolute\u00A0havoc\u00A0with the setting\u0027s economy. You\u0027ll have to throw away that whole story about space empires\u0027 war over\u00A0Space Oil.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThird, if any 1000 tonne space ship can easily accelerate to a tenth of light speed, then every two-bit spaceship owner has in his possession a weapon of mass destruction. Those 100,000 megatons of TNT-equivalent kinetic energy will act like 100,000 megatons of\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eactual\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0TNT if they strike a planet. Want a future populated by plucky tramp space-freighters and sneaky space pirates? It ain\u0027t gonna happen if every ship is a Hiroshima-on-steroids waiting to happen.

Thermonuclear\u00A0torchships?

Special Relativity makes it absolutely clear: it is physically impossible to accelerate an object with any kind of mass so that it\u0027s moving faster than the speed of light. Even accelerating an object\u00A0to\u00A0the speed of light would require an infinite amount of energy. However, we\u0027ve also pretty much established that there are no other technological species on any planet in the Solar system other than Earth. If we want to have space adventures involving high-tech aliens, we\u0027ll have to travel to other star systems, and the distances involved are so enormous that it would take years to get from one star to another if you were limited to sub-light speeds. Science Fiction writers have had to compromise, and allow\u00A0some\u00A0means of travelling faster-than-light which didn\u0027t turn their universe into something totally unrecognizable to a modern reader. Therefore, the ability to move faster-than-light has received more attention in SF than any other fantastic concept.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe very worst problem with FTL travel (or even just\u00A0FTL Radio) is a certain niggling consequence of\u00A0Time Dilation. When travelling at any speed, even a brisk walk, relative to somebody else, you\u0027ll see his clock move slower than yours \u2014 but he\u0027ll see\u00A0your\u00A0clock move slower than\u00A0his. This way-counterintuitive state of affairs means that some distant events in the universe which are in your future are in the other guy\u0027s past, and vice-versa. Without FTL travel, though, this isn\u0027t a problem. Einstein and Minkowsky established that for any event that\u0027s in Oberver A\u0027s future and Observer B\u0027s past, no matter how far in Observer A\u0027s future the event is, it will always be far enough away that any\u00A0light-speed signals\u00A0from this event would not reach Observer A until the event was also in Observer A\u0027s past. When plotted on a space-time graph, the signals from the event would stretch out in spacetime in a \u0022light cone,\u0022 which guarantees that the signal will not reach any observer in the universe until the event is in that observer\u0027s past. To put it another way, let\u0027s say that in Observer A\u0027s reference frame, Event 1 occurs before Event 2, but in Observer B\u0027s reference frame, Event 2 occurs before Event 1. Light cones maintains\u00A0causality\u00A0by ensuring that, if Observer A would find out about Event 1 before Event 2, Observer B\u00A0cannot\u00A0find out about Event 2 before information about Event 1 is theoretically available to him.\u00A0By going faster than light, even just\u00A0FTL Radio, you\u00A0can\u00A0receive information about events that are in your own future. You can perceive Event 2, which was caused by Event 1, before Event 1 actually occurs in your reference frame. In other words,\u00A0Time Travel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nHow do veteran SF writers handle the time travel consequences of FTL travel? Most of them don\u0027t. They simply\u00A0sweep it under the rug\u00A0and hope no one will notice. Those authors who do address it often end up with bizarre universes where wars are fought before they\u0027ve even started, and characters can\u00A0shoot their own grandfathers. The other main problem with FTL travel is what it can do to life in SF universe even\u00A0without\u00A0time travel. If your space pirates can just jump into hyperspace at the first sign of trouble, you\u0027ll never have any exciting\u00A0space battles. If you can ram a planet or another spacecraft while travelling at FTL speeds, you risk turning even the tiniest FTL shuttlecraft into a planet-killer that will put even the largest, fastest slower-than-light kamikaze to shame.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe last problem with FTL travel is more practical:\u00A0we don\u0027t know how to do it in\u00A0Real Life. Every attempt to come up with a way to do so has run into intractable problems. Quantum entanglement can occur instantaneously across vast distances, but it can\u0027t convey any actual information faster than\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ec\u003C/em\u003E. The\u00A0Alcubierre space warp\u00A0requires the energy output of an entire sun just to create, and there\u0027s no guarantee that you could actually make the space warp\u00A0move\u00A0\u2014 and even if you could, there\u0027s even\u00A0less\u00A0of a chance that it could move faster than\u00A0c.

System that violates conservation of momentum in one coordinate-system necessarily violates conservation of energy in another and vice versa. This is because energy and momentum are components of a 4-vector known as 4-momentum. They are related the same way that space and time are. Distinguishable, but inseparable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, and more interesting point is that while these quantities are strictly conserved, change in velocity does not need to result in change of momentum or change in energy! Certainly, in classical mechanics, p = mv and E = mv\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E. So change in velocity requires reaction mass and expended energy. If you are using a conventional rocket, you\u0027re stuck with this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the moment you step away from classical mechanics, things get more interesting. I won\u0027t go into details of Quantum, because they get complicated, but it\u0027s worth mentioning that there is concept of mass shell, and only on-shell particles follow the above rules. Off-shell particles can travel in direction different than their momentum vector suggests. Of course, off-shell particles have limited range and life time, and are most commonly found in various interactions. E.g. photons in electromagnetic interactions are off-shell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe more relevant caveats come from General Relativity. Here, momentum picks up a contribution from frame dragging. A very naive analogy is swimming in the river. You have to expend energy to move relative to the water, but if the current changes, you can speed up or slow down with it without doing any work. This is sort of how Alcubierre warp drive works. Ship goes from rest to moving, but it does so because it\u0027s local frame accelerated, not the ship itself. Consequently, ship\u0027s momentum and kinetic energy\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Estay the same\u003C/em\u003E. Now, this still takes a huge amount of energy to warp the space-time, but that energy, at least in theory, is recoverable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo for example, you might power your ship with a kugelblitz - a miniature black hole made up of light. Let it evaporate in a miniature nova, redirect all this energy into curving space-time, and your ship is now in warp. When ship drops out of warp, the energy of the space-time curvature is released, and redirected back into a single point to create a new kugelblitz.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously, I\u0027m glossing over many, many details. We have no idea how to manipulate these quantities of energy, and Alcubierre drive itself has very serious limitations preventing us from building even a proof of concept. But it can work!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
