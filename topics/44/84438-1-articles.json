Thought I\u0027d ask this here- I mean it\u0027s SCIENCE right, and this is an international forum. I was wondering if anyone in the area of ancient Amphipolis ( Greece ) could fill me in on what\u0027s happening with the big excavation at the recently discovered tomb. I learned about it only today ( Thanks US media!) but hear it\u0027s a big story in the area. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to hear some speculation on whom those interested think could be buried there. If the date they give for internment ( 325-320 BC ) is correct it\u0027s right in my wheelhouse, but I\u0027m stumped as to whom would be interred ( granted I\u0027ve only been on the case about an hour ). Someone from Cassanders\u0027 purges? Philip Arrhidaeus, the young Alexander IV perhaps, or Roxanne?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould also use some help translating the only word I\u0027ve seen in the tomb \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00A5\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00A0\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00A0\u00C3\u017D\u00C5\u00B8\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20AC\u02DC.

So far they have made it to the beginning of a third chamber and they have a visual of a fourth wall that may lead to another chamber, they won\u0027t know until they clear out the room from the dirt and make it structurally safe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
