Due to limitations inherent from using parachutes on touchdown speed, the capsules either have to splash down on water (Apollo), or use landing rockets (Soyuz). While satisfactory, these methods give little control of where the spacecraft ultimately lands, beyond aerodynamic adjustments during reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI propose embedding helicopter rotors into the capsule. When not in use, these rotors fold flush with the capsule\u0027s outer shell, probably on the conic section of the vehicle. After reentry, the blades pop open to its full length, and assumes a negative angle-of-attack. This is done to convert some of the velocity of the capsule to either store raw kinetic energy within the rotating blades, or use the rotor as an input to a generator to charge a battery. During final landing approach, the negative AoA is changed to a positive AoA, using the stored kinetic/electric energy stored from freefall-charging phase, effectively turning the space capsule into a helicopter, enabling precise control over the final position of the landing capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to hear your opinions on this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MBobrik","CreatedById":59889,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-09T19:33:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewould a rotor of the size needed not be much heavier than a equivalent parachute ?

Try looking at the two external links at the bottom of the article, especially the first one. A helicopter in autorotation is essentially gliding forwards; if its engine quits while hovering (or moving slowly) it needs to be high enough above the ground to have room to \u0027dive\u0027 to gain that forward speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(The article mentioned an interesting case of an experimental helicopter with weights built into its rotor. The weights give the rotor high enough inertia that the \u0027dead man\u0027s curve\u0027 (the shaded portion on the left of that diagram) doesn\u0027t exist -- the rotors have enough inertia to keep spinning long enough to let the helicopter land even if the engine quits while flying low and slow. But there are disadvantages to making the rotors heavier, and the helicopter never went into production.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterestingly, a link from that page discusses the aerodynamics of autorotation (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.copters.com/aero/autorotation.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.copters.com/aero/autorotation.html\u003C/a\u003E), and it starts with the case of vertical autorotation. So I guess it is possible, after all. But the vertical speed is higher than in the forward autorotation case -- too high -- which is why the \u0027dead man\u0027s curve\u0027 exists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor something like an Orion capsule with rotors, the fact that the rotors wouldn\u0027t extend much past the body of the capsule itself (i.e. the capsule would block most of the \u0027driving region\u0027 of the rotors) is an additional problem for vertical autorotation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
