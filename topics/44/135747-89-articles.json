I know that, whilst most rockets have an onboard computer at the top that controls all the stages underneath, the F9 also has a computer inside its first stage, so that it can reenter and land on the ASDS. However, shouldn\u0027t the second stage computer have informed the first stage one about the failure, so that it would cut its engines? Could this be a sign that the two computers weren\u0027t communicating with each other?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming that the two computers do communicate and that there are any known failure modes that the second stage computer can report to the first stage, that still doesn\u0027t guarantee that the SpaceX engineers had predicted the exact failure mode we saw, which they would have to do in order to program the 2nd stage computer to initiate an abort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat we can be certain of is that the engineers will have been very conservative in choosing which (\u003Cem\u003Eif any\u003C/em\u003E) failure modes trigger an abort, because of the very serious danger that they will create too many false-positives and thus generate more failures than they save. It\u0027s a nuisance if they lose a 1st stage (one that they *might* have been able to salvage *if* it landed on the barge) due to an upper stage failure, but it\u0027s BAD if they lose a payload because their computers aborted due to an \u0022imaginary\u0022 failure! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is quite likely the engineers chose to NOT preprogram in any abort modes once Q\u003Csub\u003Emax\u003C/sub\u003E has passed. The only reason to abort a rocket is to save lives, ie people on the ground or flying the rocket. In a case like this of an unmanned rocket, they only have to worry about people on the ground, and once a rocket has gone supersonic it is so high and going so fast that a RUD event is as good as a detonation for protecting groundlings\u0027 lives - it *will* break up into small bits that *will* fall on water, not on vulnerable communities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce they are flying passengers things will be \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E different: they will have many failure modes programmed to cause aborts, all with the aim of getting the Dragon capsule away from any big, bad booms and safely down to Earth. But until then, they are unlikely to bother with post-Q\u003Csub\u003Emax\u003C/sub\u003E aborts, there\u0027s no point and they could be counter-productive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022graphene\u0022 data-cite=\u0022graphene\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENot saying it happened, but what would one see in a thermal image if an anti-missile laser system were targeting during the boost trajectory?

When mega-corporations have divided a market up between them they tend to settle into very similar ways of doing business which aren\u0027t, necessarily, the best ways to progress technology. Any kind of outside competition makes them get a bit more imaginative, which generally (not always, but usually) is for the good.
