This becomes a larger problem when you compare USD to the Yen. You tell how strong a currency is by looking at it\u0027s past history compared to other currencies. As for why, currencies change value for various reasons, among them: each country having different levels of inflation, countries increasing the amount of currency available, and how the country is doing economically among other things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TrooperCooper","CreatedById":110599,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-10T04:25:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EForeign exchange rates are driven by many.... many many factors.

It represents an exchange of IOUs denominated in USD for real, durable goods. What the debt really represents is nothing more than the increase in the total money supply through deficit spending over some arbitrary time period. (For the U.S., that time period is approximately since 1840, which is the last time the U.S. had a $0 debt balance.) Debt is an incomplete and arbitrary economic measure and thus virtually useless for saying anything about the strength of an economy, particularly since most people don\u0027t really understand its significance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
