A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E describes, has never been planned by any space agency for any mission. It\u0027s not feasible at all. You never simply burn straight up to escape velocity; you\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ealways\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eperform a gravity turn.

This was more often done a long time ago, when we didn\u0027t have restartable upper stages. It can technically be slightly more efficient due to the Oberth effect but it requires perfect timing and often is not possible depending on your launch site latitude and the inclination and phasing requirements of the mission.

When we were doing our planning for crewed moon missions, there were three options. In a\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EDirect Ascent\u003C/strong\u003E mission, a single ginormous rocket would take off, go into a LEO parking orbit, burn to the moon, enter lunar orbit, descend to the surface, return to lunar orbit, and then return back to Earth. This never required any orbital rendezvous or docking, but it meant the largest possible launch vehicle. In an\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EEarth Orbit Rendezvous\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0mission, many small launches to LEO would assemble a moon vehicle which, once completed, would burn to the moon, enter lunar orbit, descend to the surface, return to lunar orbit, and then return back to Earth. This could be completed without building any ginormous rocket. In a\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003ELunar Orbit Rendezvous\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0mission, a single ginormous rocket would take off, go into a LEO parking orbit, burn to the moon, and enter lunar orbit, THEN send a small lander down to the surface while the main vehicle remained in lunar orbit, after which the lander would return to the main vehicle and the main vehicle would return home. This meant the original launch vehicle, while still very large, wouldn\u0027t have to be nearly as large as in a Direct Ascent approach, and this is what became the Apollo architecture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll three things can be called \u0022direct ascent\u0022 but they are all very different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt should be noted that there are actually more than just those three options.

This was the original plan for the Apollo missions, although it would have required the C-8 Nova rocket with nearly twice the takeoff thrust of the Saturn V. This is also the successful mission architecture for the (robotic) Luna 16 lunar sample return.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMonolithic Lunar Orbit Rendezvous.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EYou have one vehicle which leaves Earth and enters lunar orbit, but then sends a separate lander down for the landing mission. This offers a huge advantage over Direct Ascent because you leave the re-entry capsule and all of the return-to-earth propellant parked up in lunar orbit instead of dragging it down to the lunar surface and back up, although it does require two separate life support systems. This was the architecture used by the successful Apollo program, and it was the architecture planned for the N-1 lunar landings.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEarth Orbit Rendezvous.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EYou use a series of smaller launch vehicles to build a larger mission vehicle in low earth orbit, and then that vehicle performs a Direct Ascent mission. This was the architecture favored by Von Braun and (if memory serves me correctly) Buzz Aldrin. It would have taken ten Saturn 1 launches: one for the capsule, one for the ascent-and-return stage, two for the descent stage, one for the lunar orbital insertion stage, and a whopping five to fully refuel the upper stage of the last Saturn 1 to perform the TLI burn. This required an extremely high launch cadence and complex orbital rendezvous and assembly with cryogenic propellant transfer, all of which is possible today but would have been highly aspirational in the 1960s.

This requires (at least) two separate transfer burns to TLI and two separate lunar orbit insertion burns, but it allows you to take nearly as much payload as Dual Orbit Rendezvous with smaller launch vehicles. This is the plan for the Artemis missions, except that the SLS-launched crew capsule will rendezvous with the commercially-launched lander in NRHO rather than LLO. With Lunar Starship acting as the commercial lander, this adds on retanking missions in LEO which technically makes it both Dual Orbit Rendezvous and Distributed Lunar Orbit Rendezvous; if NASA had gone with National Team then it would have been a straightforward Distributed Lunar Orbit Rendezvous.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESustained Integrated Architecture.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EThis describes any long-term sustainable architecture intended to foster multiple repeat missions to and from a destination using the same system of vehicles. For example, the Space Transportation System (which shrunk and shrunk to eventually become the Space Shuttle and nothing more) originally envisioned a reusable winged chemical shuttle providing regular service between Earth\u0027s surface and an LEO space station, a reusable\u00A0space-only nuclear shuttle launched on Saturn V providing regular service between an LEO space station and a lunar orbit space station, and chemical tugs (brought to the LEO space station by the winged chemical shuttle and then sometimes transferred to the lunar orbit space station by the nuclear shuttle) to launch deep space probes or act as lunar lander stages.

The degree of efficiency improvement is also often a factor of the T/W ratios of the each stage. If the stage which provides the bulk of the\u00A0\u0394v for orbit (whether that\u0027s a second/sustainer stage which doesn\u0027t make orbit or the same stage that performs the BLEO burn) has a low T/W ratio, then it will need to have a lofted trajectory, which results in Oberth losses because you\u0027re performing your burn from a higher altitude. This effect is further multiplied because a stage with a higher T/W ratio can perform the BLEO burn more quickly, which means it can take more of an advantage of the Oberth effect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther changes in efficiency are associated with any\u00A0\u0394v lost to drag in the parking orbit. This is small but not always insignificant; Centaur continually vents hydrogen press gas to make up for drag losses in its parking orbit. If you have an upper stage with a low T/W ratio and so you have an initially lofted trajectory, then there will be a balance to how much of a perigee raise you perform. Too much, and you\u0027re losing Oberth efficiency; too little, and you incur higher drag losses during your dip through the very upper reaches of the atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224192284\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210298\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221666983708\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257801\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magnemoe\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 10/28/2022 at 3:01 PM, magnemoe said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr if you want an inclination who don\u0027t fit with your launch window?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot just inclination; it\u0027s also an issue of phasing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224192657\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210298\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221667052612\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022190194\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022farmerben\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 10/29/2022 at 10:10 AM, farmerben said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEverybody should try this in KSP you might be surprised how well it works.\u00A0 \u00A0This is anecdotal, I find that a rocket powerful enough to orbit on the first stage can easily reach apogee millions of km above Kerbin.\u00A0 The second payload stage from there can easily go on it\u0027s interplanetary mission, without wasting much second stage fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure, it works.
