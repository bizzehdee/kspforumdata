An eminent scientist on one side makes a breakthrough in miniaturisation physics and defects to the other side. Unfortunately, during his extraction, he suffers a brain injury which a) puts him in a coma and b) can only be treated from inside the body. Cue, a miniaturised sub and it\u0027s crew sent in to the scientist\u0027s body for a spot of microsurgery.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAsimov wrote the book of the film but was never really satisfied with the handwavium powered miniaturisation device.\u003Cem\u003E Fantastic Voyage II \u003C/em\u003Ewas his own novel, based on a related premise but with, amongst other things, a much more coherent explanation of miniaturisation and its ramifications. It was pretty much a classic example of 0111narwhalz\u0027s seventh point - the physics were clearly slightly bunk but they were internally consistent and their ramifications drove a lot of the plot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a point to this. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMiniaturisation in FV II was supposed to work by reducing the size of Planck\u0027s constant over a finite volume of space. It was energy intensive, inefficient and metastable which made it very dangerous for a variety of reasons. Shapirov (the Soviet scientist who developed the technique in the first place)\u00A0had a theory that Planck\u0027s constant and the speed of light were linked. Decrease one and the other should increase to match.\u00A0The problems with miniaturisation arose because the two constants were uncoupled. Figure out a way of coupling them and firstly miniaturisation becomes an easy, stable and energy efficient process and secondly, faster than light travel becomes possible. Or rather the speed of light becomes arbitrarily high such that a suitably miniaturised starship can travel faster than 3x10^8 m/s without violating relativity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-11T07:49:13Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2016 07:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-11T08:29:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy don\u0027t you go with Alcubierre Drive?

fiction stories. \u00A0I was inspired by the game \u0027Traveller,\u0027\u00A0Poul Anderson, Asimov, and\u00A0Niven in particular, and wanted to stay as close to \u0027hard\u0027 science fiction as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually, I realized two things: \u00A0 1) Almost all of what I came up with was derivative rather than original, and 2) the original stuff usually didn\u0027t end up making a whole lot of sense. \u00A0 (For instance: \u00A0I had this dramatic image of a space warship suddenly surrounded by a cloud of icy particles as it vented its atmosphere prior to combat, to avoid explosive decompression. \u00A0I loved it. \u00A0 But i couldn\u0027t reconcile it with the terrible waste of resources of sending out your atmosphere into the void and then having to replace it later...) \u00A0I did like playing with real and almost-real technologies like railguns, particle beams, and electro-magnetic defense shielding. \u00A0I went through a phase where my \u0027space marines\u0027 a la\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EStarship Troopers\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0were armored with mirrorlike reflective armor (think old-style Cylons) against laser attack, but then I realized that when you reflect a laser, it goes somewhere else, perhaps somewhere in your own ranks and takes out one of your buddies, so that was out...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, the \u0022Collins Drive\u0022* I came up with was generally along the lines of a \u0027stutterwarp\u0027 or phasing system like in Anderson\u0027s\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EFlandry \u003C/em\u003Ebooks, and I imagined it like a needle and thread weaving through the fabric of space-time (making the use of the term fabric particularly apt), where a vehicle in \u0022our\u0022 space-time is not actually moving faster than light at any given point, but \u0022skips\u0022 along at a speed that ends up being FTL. \u00A0I envisioned a generator that \u0027wove\u0027 through the fabric in a way that could be visualized as a\u00A0sine wave, and then postulated that (a la Flandry) a warship would need to match phase with a target in order to hit it-- so, to avoid that, one could hook up several generators with varying wave patterns to make the pattern complex and harder to match; and I decided that it was reasonable that gravity would have an effect on the \u0027fabric,\u0027 basically making it a \u0027denser weave\u0027 so that you could flicker in and out of phase in any gravity field, but that it would be much less efficient, to the extent that FTL \u0022velocities\u0022 were unattainable

Objects have a finite thickness, which makes it so you can\u0027t fit an infinite number of vessels on a single radius. Certain \u0022bands\u0022 are allocated to private civilian, commercial freight, and military traffic, just as radio has. For the benefit of plot, space possesses a certain amount of \u0022spatial fluid\u0022\u00A0(Yeah, you heard me. I said it. It\u0027s basically aether.) which flows freely between layers according to something akin to gravity.

This is generally a requirement imposed purely by the author\u0027s desire to tell a specific kind of story.
