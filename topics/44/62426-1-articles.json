We, as 3D objects, can observe and interact with only 3 Dimentions of space and the 1 of time for a total of 4, but there still is a 4th Dimention of space that we cannot observe or interact with. The reason this is known is simply following the good old Dimention expansion patters that have been noted between the 1, 2, and 3d dementions we can observe. These paterns are things like this: on a 1D square, you have a line segment with 2 vertexes. On a 2D square, you have 4 vertexes and a new 1D shape (a edge). A 3D cube has 8 vertexes, 12 edges and a new 2D shape (a face). In a 4D Hypercube (also known as a tesseract) there are 16 vertexes and there is a new shape (a 4D face) which is 3D. A 4 D object would cast a 3D shadow and can only be observed with 3D vision (our vision is 2D) making such shapes beyond our imagination, but totally possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis pattern can be continued infinitely, suggesting that there are an infinite number of space Dimensions, but if the 4th Dimension is beyond our ability to fully understand, we don\u0027t stand a chance at understanding anything higher dimensional then that.

Usually, alternative timelines show up in either the context of \u0022parallel dimensions\u0022 or Many Worlds. The former is a bit of a misnomer, and is actually closer to the more modern concept of having multiple branes in the bulk. There, you do have extra dimension(s) which you can associate with alternate time lines, but it\u0027s a little bit more complicated overall. And these extra dimensions certainly aren\u0027t just extra time dimensions. Many Worlds, in contrast, doesn\u0027t rely on extra dimensions at all. All of the time lines share the time dimension via superposition.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
