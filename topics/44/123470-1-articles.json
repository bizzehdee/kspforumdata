The spatular nose on a hypersonic vehicle is largely to increase the L/D ratio.\u003Cp\u003EFirst, a bit of context. Waverider concepts first surfaced in the early era of hypersonics research (the 1950\u0027s). The basic idea is to design airfoils specifically to position attached shocks that trap spanwise flow, generating additional lift (called compression lift). The initial waverider concepts were delta winged with blended conical bodies and downturned wingtips, and blunt drooping leading edges. You can see a bit of this heritage in the XB-70 Valkyrie project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.aerospaceprojectsreview.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/naa-scramjet-small.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022naa-scramjet-small.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://forum.keypublishing.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=211385\u0026amp;stc=1\u0026amp;d=1358323402\u0022 alt=\u0022attachment.php?attachmentid=211385\u0026amp;stc=1\u0026amp;d=1358323402\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://forum.keypublishing.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=211319\u0026amp;d=1358199566\u0022 alt=\u0022attachment.php?attachmentid=211319\u0026amp;d=1358199566\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen in 1966, British RAE (Royal Aircraft Establishment) researchers Pike \u0026amp; Kuchemann came up with a novel waverider design called the Kuchemann Tau.
