It\u0027s more biochemistry and diagnostics than biology but I\u0027m happy to help with what I can just out of curiosity. A small scale bio experiment is relatively simple in theory but I have no clue how a launch provider would feel about it if you\u0027re not from a certified bio lab. In any case it should be something that deals with short term exposure to LEO conditions to justify the need for a cubesat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T07:27:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only advantage this could have over ISS and Earth experiments is low-G exposure. They\u0027ve done microgravity on ISS, and hypergravity has been done on Earth. But it doesn\u0027t look like there have been any hypogravity experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo guarantee that it\u0027d be useful, but at least, it fills in the gaps in the data. We could probably run it with Moon\u0027s gravity and maybe even get it up to Mars to see how viable hydroponics on Lunar/Martian bases could be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadiation shouldn\u0027t be too bad in LEO, but at least one candidate species should be something that is particularly likely to do in strong UV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith NASA, the most likely ride would be via ISS, which would give us a very good starting orbit with as much as half a year before it decays. But it\u0027s likely to be extra strict on biologicals. A routine sat ride would probably not care what you put up there, so long as it\u0027s not harmful to humans if it\u0027s accidentally released. With ISS, things would definitely need to be checked with NASA on case-by-case. The container will be sealed. Exterior can be sterilized. But they might still want demonstration of ability to have nothing in the jar other than what\u0027s on manifest. That probably means we\u0027ll need help from a university bio lab equipped to handle something like that. But that, in itself, isn\u0027t tricky to get assistance with. I\u0027m sure there are plenty of unis that wouldn\u0027t mind giving students some exercise in whatever\u0027s the bio equivalent of clean room procedures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I mostly need to know from someone who\u0027s bio savvy, is what\u0027s the minimal diversity needed for a closed system to survive for up to half a year? What I need in there to get the ball rolling? And what temperature ranges should be maintained? Ideally the temperature range should be as high as possible. That will probably affect the choice of the species.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne more thing. Before we can get sat in orbit and establish the hypogravity environment, the container will undergo significant over-G followed by considerable length of free fall. I\u0027m sure whatever\u0027s inside can weather it out, but mostly that\u0027s to point out that what we have inside can\u0027t rely on gravity or its lack for staying put. If jar isn\u0027t completely filled with water, that water will slosh about. So will any loose soil.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose, a solution is to simply deal with the volume being completely filled with water, but that will both increase the mass of the sat, and will reduce impact of hypogravity. It\u0027d be more interesting to see how plants can grow above \u0022surface\u0022, I would imagine. But it might be possible to have something like a clear sponge to act as \u0022soil\u0022 and have some algae or other organisms in that sponge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, just some thoughts and technical limitations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. Bonus points if the plant or full ecosystem could actually be useful to a Lunar/Martian base.
