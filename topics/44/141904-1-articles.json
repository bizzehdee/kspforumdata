My intuition tells me that the pressure, acoustic resonance,\u00A0and turbulence from the combustion would interfere with the clean mixing of the propellants either by igniting them prematurely before they have mixed properly, or by disrupting the jets of liquid and preventing them from mixing properly before combustion. How far down\u00A0the chamber does the combustion take place, is it closer to the throat of the nozzle, or to the injector plate itself? Is the propellant injected with sufficient pressure to keep the actual combustion away from the injection mechanism?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess my confusion stems from the fact that it would seem that the combustion would put sufficient backpressure on the injection process to interfere with an even and stable mixing of the fuels, or if the combustion is happening right up against the plate,\u00A0to cause them to begin to ignite before they\u0027ve mixed properly, but obviously they work or real life rocket engines wouldn\u0027t function as they do so obviously I just don\u0027t understand it fully.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-16T11:54:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile I\u0027m in no way qualified to talk about this topic, I would personally make it a default assumption that the combustion chamber pressure never gets anywhere near the injection pressure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTurbopumps are extremely hardcore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-16T13:16:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as I know, turbulence increases mixing, rather than preventing \u0022clean\u0022 mixing, I would imagine that the environment within the combustion chamber results in almost instant and complete.

In an LH2/LOX rocket, sometimes making the O/F ratio a little too rich, the net result is greater specific impulse. This is because there are unburned hydrogen gas in the exhaust, which are lighter than water. Given the same temperature and pressure, a lighter gas gives greater specific impulse. This is also the reason why some kerosene/LOX rockets run a little oxigen-rich; oxygen gas is lighter than CO2 or water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222633703\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022141904\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221466098218\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022150330\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cubinator\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 minutes ago, cubinator said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom my very limited knowledge of rocket engines, I would say that if the fuel combusts too far up the throat of the engine, you will have a very big problem and you will not go to space today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, just before the nozzle throat is a component called the \u003Cem\u003Ecombustion\u003C/em\u003E chamber, where, as you guessed, the (chemical) propellant is injected and reacted.

I think that the greater number of impinging streams (doublet, triplet, pentad etc) the greater the likelihood of blowapart. Also the greater the number of impinging streams the more heat will be transferred into the injector plate. With non-hypergolic mixtures I believe the flame front is designed to be maintained further down the combustion chamber to allow for more complete mixing and avoid blowapart though I have only ever worked with hypergolic mixtures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the topic, yes that can happen. The combustion can cause an acoustic vibration which can affect the injector system slowing down the injection and causing a larger vibration. To prevent this the injector flow is \u0022decoupled\u0022 from the combustion chamber so that vibrations in the combustion chamber will, ideally, not affect the combustion chamber. To do this the pressure drop across the injectors is normally made to be around 20% of the total pressure such that fluctuations in the chamber pressure will not affect the flow rate across the injectors. Huzel and Huang do a good job explaining this in DESIGN OF LIQUID ROCKET PROPELLANT ENGINES (1992) pgs 104-116,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"the_Demongod","CreatedById":150124,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-19T14:07:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/158799-a-fuzzy-velociraptor/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022158799\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/158799-a-fuzzy-velociraptor/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@A Fuzzy Velociraptor\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003EGreat answer, this was what I was looking for. Basically, having looked at how injectors work and seeing some videos and simulations of impinging streams mixing two fluids and such, I sort of found it hard to believe that such a process could work just as well under the conditions of combustion, so it\u0027s good to know that my suspicions were not entirely unfounded.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003EThanks again\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
