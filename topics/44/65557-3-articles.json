But it\u0027s not just about direction. There are two types of friction, static and kinetic. Static friction is stronger than kinetic. Ever wondered how violin strings work? I suggest you look it up. Strength of the friction force also depends on the normal force. Try to slide a carpet across the floor. Now try it with a person standing on the carpet. See where I\u0027m going with this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour rig twists and wobbles. When the board tries to twist in recoil to motion of the weights, rail prevents it from doing so. Same deal with the wheels, though, it\u0027s sideways motion that has bigger impact there. Whenever that happens, normal force increases dramatically. So the amount of friction your rig has is time dependent. If you now have something rocking forward and back, as you do, if the forward motion of your weights matches the twist timing, the friction force prevents the whole board from recoiling. But as the weights are drawn back, the normal force is much smaller, allowing the board to accelerate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a very simple effect.

The thing is, the contraption does not go through a cyclic motion, it\u0027s a one shot movement, then it needs manual resetting. That it moves after being let go proves nothing. Rubber bands do it better if you fire them with your fingers. It\u0027s the same here. He moves the arm sideways, then he lets go of the arm. The arm centers and precession of the gyro forces it forward. As it moves forward, he lets go (and probably gives it a push unconsciously, because that\u0027s what muscles do, but it does not matter much whether he does or not). At that moment, the total momentum of the machine is non-zero, it\u0027s just not equally distributed. The frame is stationary while the arm with the gyroscope is moving forward.
