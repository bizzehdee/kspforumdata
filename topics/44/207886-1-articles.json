Somewhat infamously, you can see Jupiter in the data by eye, but it has yet to detect eg: Venus. But more generally, my response to trying to use it for distant planets is \u0022lol, lmao\u0022. Weirdly enough, the period of a planet in our solar system isn\u0027t too important (so you don\u0027t need hundreds of years of data), but the sorts of distances would make the semi-amplitude (which scales roughly as mass/sqrt(distance)) negligible.
