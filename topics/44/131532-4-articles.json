Of course a bridge will have elements of compressive or tensile forces on it, thermal expansion of the deck, and so on, but its main form of loading is in bending, as you have the self-weight of the bridge and whatever you put on it, acting over a huge lever arm because of distance to the piles. That\u0027s why things like suspension bridges have towers, it\u0027s essentially to create another long lever arm to provide the resisting moment and reduce the stress on the deck (among other things).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLikewise, a space elevator will experience some bending because of things like wind loading, radiation pressure, or even gravitational interactions with the moon, but the vast majority of the loading on the structure will be in line with its support, leading to a tensile load.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tensile load will scale with the length of the cable, due to the cable\u0027s self-weight.

In reality the bending moment will lead to it having a compressive force on the top face and a tensile force on the bottom face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn any case, I was talking about the primary loading. Of course a bridge will have elements of compressive or tensile forces on it, thermal expansion of the deck, and so on, but its main form of loading is in bending, as you have the self-weight of the bridge and whatever you put on it, acting over a huge lever arm because of distance to the piles. That\u0027s why things like suspension bridges have towers, it\u0027s essentially to create another long lever arm to provide the resisting moment and reduce the stress on the deck (among other things).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLikewise, a space elevator will experience some bending because of things like wind loading, radiation pressure, or even gravitational interactions with the moon, but the vast majority of the loading on the structure will be in line with its support, leading to a tensile load.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tensile load will scale with the length of the cable, due to the cable\u0027s self-weight. A bending load will scale with the square of the length of the cantilever, due to the nself-weight of the beam increasing with length, and also due to the bending moment increasing with the length of the lever arm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, I know. But my point is also in the cables. In a suspension bridge, actually the deck only carries little of the strain - the cable does. Using carbon nanotubes in great length can be applied on bridges and space elevator. So, the question is, will a carbon nanotube that long be viable ? It needs to be a single strand all way long... And most rough tensile force estimates for theters puts it outside nanotube\u0027s ultimate tensile strength. Now you can add swaying motions, collision...

The idea he posited was that the craft could impact the surface at a tiny vertical velocity because it\u0027s at such a shallow angle. The same can be said of, say, the Space Shuttle. Shuttle landed at about 100 m/s, and did just fine. If it had done so in a vertical dive, the outcome would\u0027ve been somewhat different. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea was in fact a rolling landing, minus the wheels, which would be replaced\u00A0with large skids. Whereas an aircraft uses lift\u00A0combined with throttle to control sink rate, this craft would use rockets to control the sink rate, and would use them continuously during the skid to keep the nose up, and the skids optimally contacted to the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not even suggesting it works, we have no idea.
