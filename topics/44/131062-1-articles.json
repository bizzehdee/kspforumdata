Do satellites launched in this way have their own propulsion to adjust their orbits? I read that the film Gravity was unrealistic because the orbits of satellites are far lower than the ISS. Some of the satellites, called \u0022CubeSats\u0022 are just four inches cubed! Even so, flicking it away with the robotic arm (I have no idea whether that\u0027s what they actually do - I would have expected the arm to move very slowly)\u00A0will only affect the other side of the orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-30T17:43:26Z\u0022 title=\u002201/30/2016 05:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by THX1138\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-30T18:04:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCubesats rarely have propulsion, and the ones launched from ISS are even less likely to have it.
