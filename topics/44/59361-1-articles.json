I figured that you people could probably answer my question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, the basic concept of the planet is that it rotates faster than an orbit infinitely close above the surface would travel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously anything on the surface would be flung off so there would be no dust, atmosphere or rocks, and it would probably have to be made of some strong metal. Also I\u0027m not sure how it got to be spinning so fast, but I\u0027m just interested in if there is a problem with a planet like this theoretically, not whether it\u0027s realistic for it to exist or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings I figured out about the planet (feel free to tell me I\u0027m wrong):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA: It would be nigh-impossible to land on. You would expend massive amounts of delta-V because you would have to 1. speed up to be at its surface speed 2. manipulate your path as you flew so as not to zoom off into space. I think you\u0027d be burning down and prograde unlike a regular landing retrograde and up. You\u0027d also have to tether your ship and yourself down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB: Standing in a cave inside it, the center of the planet would be above your head because centripetal force would be greater than gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC: It would be trying to fling itself apart, so it would have to be very strong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED: Small asteroids that are spinning fast are this already, but they aren\u0027t interesting because they have so little gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo anyways let me know if a planet like that can\u0027t exist for some reason, or if you can figure out something else interesting about a planet like this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbin Dallas Multipass","CreatedById":79477,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T00:42:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA planet like this cant form I\u0027d say.

At best you can get a body with almost 0 G at the equator, but if you account for the fact NovaSilisko mentioned (at huge scales, solids behave like very viscous fluids), you get internal friction, heating, distortion.

Rotation slows down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne even more possible scenario is global stratification, where the less dense material collects on one side and a bulge is formed which would partially detach from the body and turn into a satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFragment from a large impact upon a bigger, heterogenous body are a candidate.
