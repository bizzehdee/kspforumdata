And to get speed, you first need to make the area the flow is going through smaller, trading pressure for speed like a garden hose nozzle. But at supersonic speeds, that no longer works and you have to start expanding the area.

The more the exhaust gases expand, the lower their pressure drops. If an engine is firing inside the atmosphere, and its exhaust gas drops below atmospheric pressure, then air pressure is going to start to flow into the nozzle around the lip. This decreases thrust and efficiency and can even cause catastrophic damage if the exhaust flow becomes too uneven and exerts asymmetric pressure on the nozzle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other reason is weight. Making your exhaust nozzle twice as big may only increase your thrust and efficiency by a few percent.

The outflow of the turbine and the impelling of air around the turbine create a larger gas flow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is less important than what the jet does. A propellar on a plane creates work, but the tips of the propeller are forces to work against Mach forces when the blade travels fast enough, propellers cannot compress air well in the direction orthogonal to motion and make the air go faster (jet) than a certain speed. A jet compresses the air inward toward the axis of forward motion, in doing this it accelerates the air without needing for impeller blades to match that pesky Mach speed. So for aircraft that fly about one-half Mach or lower a propellar (or turboprop) is an appropriate propulsion. Once the craft exceeds 170 m/s in speed than Mach but below Mach speed a jet engine is more appropriate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221280px-9V-SQI_-_c-n_28530_-_777-212ER_-_\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022683\u0022 src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/9V-SQI_-_c-n_28530_-_777-212ER_-_Singapore_Airlines_-_Singapore_-_Changi_(8392103750)_(cropped).jpg/1280px-9V-SQI_-_c-n_28530_-_777-212ER_-_Singapore_Airlines_-_Singapore_-_Changi_(8392103750)_(cropped).jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNote (wikipedia-United Airlines 777 N797UA LAX.jpg) that the front of this Rolls Royce Trent Engine is about 2 workman in height, the back is about is a small fraction.

For a low velocity turbofan it can do this magnitudes more force per gram of fuel. But that defeats the purpose, because the atmosphere is 1/5th as thick at 13 km as MSL and because jet engines work better when the bypass air is closer to 0K, you can not take advantage of high altitude flight if your jet engine is at its coffin\u0027s corner at 7 km.

Rather, it increases the specific impulse for a given expansion ratio.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChemical propellants have a certain amount of chemical potential energy. Igniting them in the combustion chamber converts this chemical energy into thermal energy with very high efficiency. However, converting that thermal energy into controlled thrust (kinetic energy) is the hard part. The more your exhaust flow expands, the more of its thermal energy is converted into kinetic energy.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn engine with a chamber pressure of 2 atmospheres can have 50% of its thermal energy converted by expanding to 1 atmosphere or 100% converted by expanding to vacuum. An engine with a chamber pressure of 10 atmospheres can have 90% of its thermal energy converted by expanding to 1 atmosphere or 100% converted by expanding to vacuum. The SpaceX Raptor engine has a chamber pressure of 247 atmospheres, so it can have 99.6% of its thermal energy converted to thrust by expanding to 1 atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course there are always other efficiency losses; these percentages are the theoretical maximum. But it\u00A0means overall that for a generally higher chamber pressure, you can utilize more of the total energy at sea level, and you can use more of the total energy with a smaller engine nozzle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell said. \u00A0I hope you don\u0027t think I was saying anything differently than

by increasing chamber pressure or expansion-ratio (keeping one the same and increasing the other), it\u0027s just that, as you said, those improvements become progressively smaller and smaller as you approach a mathematical limit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour math is off, though. \u00A0It\u0027s not nearly as simple as dividing the chamber pressure by the final exhaust pressure to find the percentage of thermal energy you harness. \u00A0A rocket that expands its exhaust from 100 atmospheres to 1 atmosphere is *a lot* less than 99% efficient. \u00A0The math involved actually really hard-

You have to be able to get your propellants inside the chamber, after all. If you use a pressure-fed engine, you have to have tanks which can handle a greater pressure than your chamber. If you use a turbopump, you need power to run that turbopump. A gas-generator turbopump is the most straightforward way of doing it, but if you run too much propellant through your turbopump, you have less available propellant to actually burn in your engine. An expander cycle is more efficient, but is constrained by the specific heat of your fuel and the surface area of your exhaust bell. Staged combustion is best for supplying both high turbopump power and high efficiency, but it is terribly hard to get right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpaceX\u0027s Merlin engine has successfully uprated its turbopump speed multiple times, permitting higher flow and higher power.
