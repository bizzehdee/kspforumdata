A surface-based infrastructure is highly exposed to extreme heat during day and extreme cold during night, necessitating a material with high tolerance against thermal expansion with large margin of hot and cold limit since the difference of temperature in mercury is extremely large.

It\u0027s still not livable by any means, but it makes the planet far more interesting to astronomers. Currently, Mercury is not a priority on any space program worldwide. It\u2019s farther away than Mars, hotter and less hospitable as well less likely to contain evidence of life. Still, this planet has a lot to teach us about the extremes of planetary science \u2014 which in turn has a lot to teach us about the search for life elsewhere in the universe.

With current mercury\u0027s magnetic field, it\u0027s far too weak to prevent atmospheric gases to vaporized away by the sun (mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system anyway, so it\u0027s not a surprise that it has a fairly weak magnetic field). What needs to be done first is by finding a way to prevent that (or you could just dig underground base, which is far more easier than terraform a whole planet). We also haven\u0027t deal with radiation problem. On earth, harmful radiation from the sun is filtered by ozone layer, but on mercury...
