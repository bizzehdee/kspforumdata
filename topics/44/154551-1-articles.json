Specific impulse is defined quite simply - it\u0027s the impulse per unit of propellant, or equivalent the thrust divided by the rate of propellant flow. If you did the propellant by mass you would get a \u0022specific impulse\u0022 in m/s - the same units as effective exhaust velocity and for a perfect rocket they are indeed equal, so it just swaps straight in. To get specific impulse in seconds you need to instead measure the propellant by \u003Cem\u003Eweight\u003C/em\u003E, and that implies the measurement of that weight in a certain gravitational field.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s why we get \u003Cem\u003Eg\u003Csub\u003E0\u003C/sub\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, Earth standard gravity, in the rocket equation.
