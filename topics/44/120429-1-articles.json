I didn\u0027t see any details about how they measured their photo-currents (I should go read the original paper) but presumably you need a connection (via your external circuit) between the positively charged substrate and the negatively charged nano-particles. Which doesn\u0027t sound too hard in itself - just place a metal foil over the top of your nanoparticle layer for example* - but building a working device which provides that electrical connection \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E allows sufficient water to actually get to your nanoparticles \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E allows the evolved hydrogen and oxygen to escape, is going to be a bit trickier. Not impossible I\u0027m sure but a non-trivial piece of engineering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Edit - although Indium Tin Oxide on glass would work better since you also need to get light to your nanoparticles.
