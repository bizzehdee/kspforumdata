The criteria I have set out is as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe egg must be placed on the ground intact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe egg may not have any materials protecting it. Only a harness may be used to attach it to the sky-crane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe egg must be initially positioned 50 meters above ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe egg must be returned via retro-water rockets, and a parachute may be used as long as it is not active upon touchdown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea comes about from the Curiosity lander\u0027s unprotected nature upon touchdown. If NASA can land an unshielded 1 ton rover on Mars, why can\u0027t I land a simple egg on the ground?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the automated descent I am thinking of using software from a quadrocopter to land softly, utilizing gyroscopic and altimeter sensors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheir will be one or two pressure vessels, and 4 nozzles spaced out around the frame. Individual fast-response valves will control the thrust of each nozzle, in order to keep the pitch of the craft under control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will have access to a 3d printer with dual-extruders to print water soluble plastics, metal and wood CNC machines, and a machine shop once school starts back up.

Either way I wish you luck.

I overloaded my rocket with water, but it still flew rather high since it was reinforced and capable of high pressures. The parachute deployed, but it did not unravel.

You can order the concentrated stuff from a number of reagent stores. Highly unstable, super corrosive, and yet safe in comparison with hybrids. Also, doesn\u0027t require ignition, not likely to blow up, and makes for very easy to build engines. They won\u0027t last long due to oxidation, but they\u0027d be easy to replace.

Yes, it basically boils down (heh) to building a quadropter to land the egg safely after parachutes brought down the descend speed.

Of course, it all depends on volume of the gas you have on board. Since you haven\u0027t specified that, I\u0027m not entirely sure how you are doing your math. It\u0027s also a considerable amount of pressure, which can cause serious injuries in case of failure, even if you avoid any metal parts that could turn into shrapnel. Pressure wave alone could do it. If you can get a composite pressure chamber, it might be worth considering. Otherwise, it sounds kind of insane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat sort of delta-V are you looking for, anyways? You\u0027d be looking at something in the 30m/s range for impact speed. So that\u0027s minimal dV you need in suicide burn. Of course, acceleration isn\u0027t instant. In principle, an egg can survive up to about 50g, but with harness and safety margin, more than 10g would be pushing it. That gets you to stop in 0.3s at a cost of only about 3m/s more in dV. You\u0027ll also have to start braking within 4.5m of the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at some affordable sonar options for robotics, you can start getting updates from about 6.5m at 50ms intervals. That means your first ground detection will be within 5-6.5m. That\u0027s enough, but leaves almost no margin for error. You\u0027ll probably want some reserve thrust here. Furthermore, you can count on at best 5-6 position updates while braking. Worse, voltage readings \u003Cem\u003Ewill lag\u003C/em\u003E. These are just the sort of hardware limitations you\u0027ll have to live with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in terms of delta-V reserve, you don\u0027t have to worry about much. If you don\u0027t manage a soft landing in ~40m/s, you\u0027ve already gone splat. And you can certainly do 40m/s with a water/air rocket. So it\u0027s all about control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EControl is the hard part. Lets forget valves and lag on thrust for a moment. I\u0027m going to pretend that you manage to design your valves, and they have perfect response time. We are back to our worst case scenario. Your sonar is reading something between 5-6m, the error is about 10% due to the fact that voltage hasn\u0027t adjusted yet, and you have 4 more readings to estimate your velocity and time of impact. You can Kalman filter that data, and you will want to, along with accelerometer data once rockets kick in. You\u0027ll also manually set uncertainty on terminal velocity before you do your first Kalman pass. Hopefully, you can get to within 10% on that as well. Your goal is to be within safe stopping distance until you hit about 80cm from impact. There you can start using IR range finder as backup. You\u0027ll want to get at least a few readings off of that before impact as well. You won\u0027t have enough to make major corrections on velocity, but it will give you smaller errors on the range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe actual control logic should assume worst case scenario. Take your velocity, go up a couple of sigmas, take distance and take away a couple of sigmas. You need to be able to stop within that. And you don\u0027t have direct thrust measurements. Only accelerometer data, which you\u0027ll also have only a few updates on. There is no time to PID this stuff. You\u0027ll need a look-up table of pre-calibrated values. Given x acceleration on each jet and y position on the valve, go to z position for correction. If you don\u0027t finish correction within 50ms between updates, your lander is probably already flipped over, and trying to correct further is moot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENaturally, this is also where lag corrections will have to come in. If you have to adjust little, you can assume corrections to be instantaneous. If you have to correct a lot, you need to over-correct. That has to be part of the look-up table as well. Again, calibration is the way here, and there is nothing you can do about that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, MCU. You\u0027ll need six axis acceleration readings, at least two sonar readings, run Kalman in between, compute corrections, get valve servo positions, set them, and still have time for a break before the next 50ms wave of updates. I hope you are comfortable with assembly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s what this project looks like on the control side of things, rockets aside. The reason you might want to look at high delta-V options is to start slowing down way in advance and do a gentle glide, which is \u0022easy\u0022 on the control side. If you want to do it with water rockets, you have to suicide burn it, and then the actual delta-V isn\u0027t your problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Creature","CreatedById":106457,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-02T09:06:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a pretty cool idea.
