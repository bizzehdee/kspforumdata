The answer is that the space around a black hole is so aggressively curved that you would have to be traveling at the speed of light in order to orbit anywhere near the event horizon. Recall that the speed of a circular orbit increases as you move closer to the center of a body. For black hole physics, the speed of a circular orbit exceeds c well above the event horizon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCalculating orbits near Earth is straightforward enough, but orbital mechanics goes haywire near a black hole. The reason stable orbits exist around the Earth is that Earth\u0027s gravity curves space just enough that a \u0022straight\u0022 line closes into a loop. But a black hole curves space until there are no closed paths. If you were just outside the event horizon and tried to accelerate away, you would experience space literally stretching out away in front and behind you.

Maybe this is the case, but every prior physicist\u0027s presentation on black holes that I\u0027ve seen has implied otherwise, that in fact mass can fall into a black hole and that black holes can increase their mass over time this way in the reference frame of an external observer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurther: What if instead of sending a ship, we send another black hole?

This is known in physics as the no-hair theorem. No matter what went into the formation of a black hole, those are the only three observable things about it. From an outside perspective, two black holes are identical if they have the same mass, the same charge, and the same angular momentum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what happens when a black hole grows? Well, the only thing that CAN change is mass, charge, and angular momentum. The mass of the infalling object is added to the mass of the black hole. Recall that any object, no matter how small, has a gravitational field. Thus, when an object crosses the event horizon of a black hole, externally it is simply the merger of two gravitational fields. Since gravitational potential waves travel at the speed of light, it is a (relatively) simple matter to model their merger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll that to say: talking about what \u0022happens\u0022 to something falling into the event horizon is needlessly confused, because the object itself ceases to exist from an outside perspective; the only thing visible from afar is that the diameter of the event horizon increases ever so slightly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn additional complication, which some here have touched on: the event horizon itself is defined by the location of the observer. We arbitrarily define the event horizon as viewed from infinity, but since all gravitational fields extend infinitely, every actual\u00A0observer is observing from a different gravitational potential height. The event horizon observed by any particular observer will depend on how far they are from it; an observer relatively close to a black hole will observe an infalling object longer than an observer farther away. For the unfortunate individuals actually crossing the event horizon (assuming it is a large enough black hole that tidal forces do not shred them), they see the event horizon below them shrinking and shrinking while the spacetime behind them grows larger and larger without bound.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, the no-hairs theorem, despite being strongly indicated by everything we know about black holes, suggests that information about the particles which fall into a black hole is destroyed. However, classical physics does not permit the destruction of information. Another problem is that all objects with non-zero temperature (including black holes, as shown by Bekenstein) must emit blackbody radiation as defined by Planck\u0027s law, but a black hole by definition cannot allow anything to escape.\u00A0Hawking hypothesized the eponymous \u0022Hawking radiation\u0022 as a solution to both the no-hairs problem and the blackbody problem: quantum tunneling at the event horizon permits some particles to escape to infinity, carrying radiation, information, and mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, as is often the case with cutting-edge physics, each new solution poses a new problem. If the event horizon is entirely position-dependent and would not be visible to an infalling observer, how could it simultaneously be the source of a flood of particles? This is known as the firewall problem; Hawking radiation means the event horizon would literally be a \u0022wall of fire\u0022 that would incinerate anybody crossing it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFortunately, quantum mechanics comes to the rescue here: quantum fluctuations in the gravitational field allow Hawking radiation to be emitted from any distance, solving the firewall problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-27T14:16:21Z\u0022 title=\u002203/27/2017 02:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 27, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by sevenperforce\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-27T14:29:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222998718\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022158132\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221490605979\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107381\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Green Baron\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, Green Baron said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSee it like this: the object stops at the event horizon and does not pass though, instead, the event horizon expands (and that without hurting causality, wow :-)). \u003Ca href=\u0022http://mathpages.com/rr/s7-02/7-02.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u003C/a\u003E is what i found about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCausality is not \u0022hurt\u0022 because the gravitational field of the infalling object already existed.
