Ask the Air Force to put it on the X-37. Sierra Nevada would probably love to put it on the Dream Chaser. The Space Shuttle had numerous capabilities, yes, but a lot of them were wasted on all the flights where it just acted as an outrageously expensive HLV, and the rare missions where the unique capabilities of the Space Shuttle really shined... probably could have been done more economically by sending up a custom mission module on a separate unmanned vehicle, and sending up any necessary crew on something smaller and less deadly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: To further clarify a point, the New Glenn\u0027s gigantic 7 meter fairing is filled with my hopes and dreams for an ISS replacement.

They couldn\u2019t separate the boosters \u003Ci\u003Eor\u003C/i\u003E the orbiter from the tank early, there was simply no procedure (\u201Cbutton\u201D) to do so, the entire launch was controlled by the computer. There was no procedure, because the assembly couldn\u2019t survive it. Like someone else said, everything was under an \u003Ci\u003Eincredible\u003C/i\u003E amount of stress while the engines were running. Ever forget to check yo staging and have your running boosters come back and hit your core?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe orbiter too was \u003Ci\u003Eextremely\u003C/i\u003E fragile, which seems like an odd thing to say, but most of the shuttle\u2019s abort modes, such as they were, were limited by not overstressing the airframe. The RTLS (return to launch site) abort in particular was like something right out of Kerbal. If the shuttle lost one or more engines while the boosters were lit, it would have to continue downrange until the boosters were dropped, \u003Ci\u003Ethen continue downrange some more\u003C/i\u003E, then turn around, flying backwards, and burn towards Florida. This was catefully planned so that when the orbiter finally separated from the ET, the tank was down to 2% fuel. Any more and a successful separation was unlikely. If the shuttle lost \u003Ci\u003Eall three\u003C/i\u003E engines while the boosters were running, it might be able to continue on until separation, but would be Lost anyway as the airframe couldn\u2019t take reentry from that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, \u003Ci\u003Ein theory\u003C/i\u003E, they could have made a big, ejecting crew module, but this is really, \u003Ci\u003Ereally\u003C/i\u003E hard when there\u2019s so much structure surrounding the cabin.
