I\u0027ve been studying countless surveys and technical books to educate myself. Another instrument I\u0027m using is a magnetometer but I\u0027m less familiar with that instrument. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to know if some of you have experience with these instruments. How have you applied them to your research, work, or education? If you don\u0027t have any experience but knowledge on the subject then I would be interested in what you think about studies using these instruments. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m adept with both the tools (conducted field research in both hemispheres!) but rarely meet someone to discuss them with. Just reaching out! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstruments I\u0027m using: GSSI 400 MHz and 200 MHz antenna and an Overhauser magnetometer.

Have used magnetometers a fair few times though, mainly in developing magnetic shielding for a compact atom interferometer gravity gradiometer to produce a homogenous and low magnetic field within the inteferometer so that the contribution from gravity\u0027s gradient to the phase difference in the interference pattern produced can be extracted from the phase difference due to the zeeman effect, which for a compact atom interferometer in Earth\u0027s magnetic field is usually much higher and swamps out the signal due to gravity\u0027s gradient.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
