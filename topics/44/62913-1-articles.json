A dense nebula has 10 000 particles per cubic cm, a factor 10\u003Csup\u003E15\u003C/sup\u003E smaller than air at sea level.

Or to put that in perspective, enough to barely lift 2kg on earth. You would have to take it into account, you are going to deviate a bit.

Even the densist molecular clouds might reach a few million atoms of hydrogen per cm^3. This is a density of something like 10^14 times less dense than air ASL. Likewise, for similar hypersonic flight effects, one would need to move 10 million times faster. So if one had a 100 m^2 control surface or wing at an AoA of 30 degrees, they could get up to 3.5E-13 newtons per (m/s)^2. So if they moved 1700 km/s, a 1 m^2 control surface could get a newton of force. A single newton. The wing would have to be made of thin paper in order to make it apply 1 gee. At Earth sea level, it would only need to move 17 cm/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, that is momentum. The story for kinetic energy is very different. 10^-14 kg of H2 moving at 1700 km/s has an energy of 14 millijoules. Not bad, right? What if that much hydrogen is hitting every square meter of your ship every 600 nanoseconds? That is something like 25 kilojoules per m^2. That is only 17 times brighter than sunlight, right? Well.... Yes. But it is in the form of H2, not sunlight. That means it would, for the purposes of anyone on board, be ionizing radiation. And it also means that the wings would probably just molecularly decay and absorb th H2 instead of reflecting the H2, as even crystalline graphene cannot survive hydrogen impacting directly at speeds over 50 km/s unharmed. This means the wings would suddenly be very good ablative thrusters, loosing their entire mass normal to their surface at 20 km/s or so within a matter of seconds. So actually, you\u0027d be experiencing forces similar to those on an older airplane, but only because your ship is a giant ablative reverse thruster.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T20:48:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022spudman2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022spudman2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E@DonLorenzo\u003Cp\u003EYour craft is moving at 1/30c, which means that gas particles are hitting you at 1/30c.

This is why it is sometimes useful to add fins to rockets: the lift force is proportional to the angle of attack, thus if something disturbs a rocket such that it is no longer pointing in the direction of fluid velocity a lift force is created. If the lift force\u0027s line of action acts through a point behind the center of mass, then this lift will produce a torque that will tend to correct the rocket\u0027s angle of attack back to zero. So the fins make the rocket dynamically stable, even though the lift force is not acting in opposition to gravity in this case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the OP, it\u0027s a really interesting question! Lift coefficients are functions of an object\u0027s shape, Reynolds and Mach numbers, and effective roughness ratios among other things. I\u0027ve heard that nebulas can be quite hot, but I\u0027m guessing that even despite that viscous effects would be basically negligible, and so we would mostly only need to worry about the shape of the object. Let\u0027s say some crazed alien art collector of the far future towed an ancient Earth-Human Boeing 747 out to the Orion nebula and mounted it to a relativistic rocket kick stage for the purposes of creating an avant garde installation. The 747 has a wing area of 541 m^2 according to wikipedia, so the velocity needed to generate a single Newton of lift given a 45 degree angle of attack would be 6.12E6 m/s or about 0.02 c.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-14T04:25:27Z\u0022 title=\u002202/14/2014 04:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by architeuthis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
