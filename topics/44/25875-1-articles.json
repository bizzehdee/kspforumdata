Many of you probably have some idea about how approaching the speed of light affects perception from all frames of reference, often with varying results. I.e., Relativity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a strange sort of implication in this bit, though. If distance contracts as you approach the speed of light, and time dilates... \u003Cem\u003Ehypothetically\u003C/em\u003E, what do the equations say if you move \u003Cstrong\u003Eat\u003C/strong\u003E the speed of light? Well, nothing that makes sense, to be honest. The length contraction formula implies that from the frame of reference of anything travelling at the speed of light, length is \u003Cstrong\u003Emeaningless\u003C/strong\u003E. You end up dividing by zero if you try to find the length of anything from that reference frame. The time dilation formula basically ends up being rather similar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, there\u0027s an interesting difference. Distance \u003Cem\u003Econtracts\u003C/em\u003E and gets smaller and smaller as you approach light speed, whilst time \u003Cem\u003Edilates\u003C/em\u003E and gets more and more stretched out as you approach the speed of light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, to something moving at light speed (hypothetically, of course), distance will have shrunk into a meaningless nonentity smaller than a Planck Length, whereas time will have stretched out so far as to be effectively if not literally stopped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis, to me, implies something very odd. Time and space are thought to be inseparable -- gravity distorts space-time, as though it\u0027s a membranous thing which consists of both distance and duration, as if the two are inextricably tied to one another. But these equations in relativity appear to indicate that if you go fast enough, you distort space and time \u003Cem\u003Eseparately\u003C/em\u003E -- space \u003Cstrong\u003Eshrinks\u003C/strong\u003E whilst time \u003Cstrong\u003Eexpands\u003C/strong\u003E. This doesn\u0027t really make sense, unless time and space are simply entirely different entities... but there is so much in physics that points to them being inextricable from each other, and meaningless without each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing it suggests to me is that to an observer that is travelling at light speed (shall we say a hypothetical observer that is a conscious construct of photons?), space and time do not even exist. I mean, when you think about it, all the funny quantum effects where photons behave as though they are in two or more places at once work with this sort of thinking -- after all, if they do not have to worry about time or distance, they could be all across the universe at any given time or place. Every photon in the universe could the \u003Cem\u003Ethe very same photon\u003C/em\u003E, just popping up in our perception at different times and places.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe question that arises when one considers the fact that a thing travelling at light speed has no limitations based on space or time is... well... how does that speed even exist? If space and time are shrunken and stretched in and out to infinity, would we not even be able to measure the speed? Should it not appear to travel instantaneously and not have a speed at all? It doesn\u0027t make sense that just by the very fact of us claiming light speed as a speed limit implies that the speed of the thing we are measuring (light) \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E be infinite, if its own speed is indeed the \u0022limit\u0022 that we think it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour thoughts, guys?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stochasty","CreatedById":57264,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T14:36:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is going to get a little math heavy, because there\u0027s no other way to satisfactorily answer your questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vexx32\u0022 data-cite=\u0022vexx32\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHowever, there\u0027s an interesting difference.

To illustrate, the Minkowski space (special relativity) distance element is given by:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eds^2 = -dt^2 \u002B dx^2 \u002B dy^2 \u002B dz^2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means that the special relativity manifold is not Euclidean, but rather hyperbolic (also called Lorentzian in the literature). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a way to think about the implications of this fact. Imagine a 2-dimensional Euclidean spacetime defined by one direction which we\u0027ll call \u0022time\u0022 and another direction which we\u0027ll call \u0022space.\u0022 Velocity vectors are, by convention, defined to be unit vectors on this spacetime, so the the velocity vector of a \u0022stationary\u0022 object (one not moving in the spatial dimension) is a vector of length one which points entirely in the time direction. Now, imagine that we apply acceleration in the space direction - this will add a spatial component to our velocity vector, but the vector must stay normalized so what we\u0027re actually doing is rotating that vector. It\u0027s relatively easy to see that if we continue to apply acceleration the allowed velocity vectors inscribe a circle on spacetime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, here\u0027s where causality comes into play: a \u0022trajectory\u0022 is an integration over some arbitrary function of velocity. Think about it as starting at a point, and moving at a constant rate in the direction of your velocity vector while at the same time allowing that vector to rotate according to this arbitrary function. It\u0027s pretty easy to see that, if velocity vectors are allowed to inscribe a complete circle, it is possible to define a function which will eventually return one to one\u0027s starting point. This is a problem, though, because we have defined one of the directions to be \u0022time\u0022 - if you are allowed to visit the same point in space and time more than once you have violated causality (there are some caveats to this, but they are beyond the scope of the present illustration). Basically, by treating space and time identically the way a Euclidean spacetime would suggest, we lose causality, and therefore we lose any notion of \u0022time\u0022 itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the SR metric is hyperbolic. What that means is that, as we rotate the velocity vector in the method I described above, the shape we trace out is not a circle but a hyperbola with asymptotes along the lines x=t and x=-t. This confines our allowed velocities to a 90 degree cone around the time axis, and thus means that it is impossible to generate a trajectory which visits the same spacetime point more than once - hence, causality is preserved. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vexx32\u0022 data-cite=\u0022vexx32\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe other thing it suggests to me is that to an observer that is travelling at light speed (shall we say a hypothetical observer that is a conscious construct of photons?), space and time do not even exist.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is pretty much the case.

Not all of those particles are mass-less, and not all of them travel at C, but all of them are strictly limited to C as a maximum velocity. So, when gravity bends space and time to a point where a photon sphere, and an event horizon are formed, it becomes impossible for any particle to escape the event horizon on any outward trajectory, because (from the perspective of all particles within the event horizon), there is no speed or trajectory that points away from the singularity.

It\u0027s a particle that shows up when you try to quantize gravity, but you should also keep in mind that no successful quantum gravity theory exists. In other words, if such a thing as graviton really exists, we have no theory to properly describe it. Though, there are some indication of its properties if it does, in fact, exist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe slightly more relevant comment is that what you describe is relevant to on-the-shell particles.

Attempting to describe the singularity itself perturbatively runs into renormalization issues and generally fails. You can consider propagation of gravity waves due to a change in the position of the black hole - this is the subject of the numerical relativists working on binary black hole mergers in conjunction with LIGO on the experimental side - but even those calculations are considering perturbations well away from the two black holes and the event horizons; the collision itself is handled non-perturbatively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, K^2 is correct that virtual particles are not confined to behavior on the mass shell. This is one of the ways to think about Hawking radiation - you have correlations between virtual particles on either side of the horizon which result in an energy flux across the horizon. Gravitons can be approximated by a massless, minimally coupled scalar field which certainly obeys the properties K^2 describes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if we want to get speculative and start talking quantum gravity, things change. There\u0027s some indication, based on generic properties of candidate quantum gravity theories (and supported by some of my own, soon-to-be-published research in stochastic gravity) that spacetime is not four dimensional on small scales, but rather two-dimensional. The geometry may be something like a 2-complex (to understand what a 2-complex is, think of an arbitrary graph in 3 dimensions - containing vertices connected by edges - and allow that graph to evolve in time such that each vertex traces out a world line and each edge a world sheet, but also vertices are allowed to merge and split so that the graph changes shape from time slice to time slice). If this is the case, then (on a given time slice) a black hole would look like a graph where every vertex has many connections leading towards the singularity and only a few leading away, such that any particle random walking the graph has an overwhelming probability of falling towards the singularity. \u0022Gravitons\u0022 in this picture are the connections in the graph itself, so the singularity is still gravitationally connected to the outside universe. Of course, this is only on such picture (one suggested by the Loop Quantum Gravity approach, but also not incompatible with several others); it is by no means the only picture, nor is there any reason yet to believe that this is the way things really are.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-07T21:13:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2013 09:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Stochasty\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Person012345","CreatedById":33728,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T21:02:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Stochasty\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Stochasty\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe geometry may be something like a 2-complex (to understand what a 2-complex is, think of an arbitrary graph in 3 dimensions - containing vertexes connected by edges - and allow that graph to evolve in time such that each vertex traces out a world line and each edge a world sheet, but also vertices are allowed to merge and split to that the graph changes shape from time slice to time slice).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat sounds too complex.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBa dum dum tish.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
