Imagine the situation: something is going to happen to the solar system which will leave it uninhabitable within a century. Perhaps a strangelet is converting the sun into a Quark Star, or some other doomsday scenario is gonna wipe us out. But *something* means the human race has got to get up and go or die trying (since an end-of-the-solar-system scenario is the only possible reason I can see for attempting a manned interstellar mission any time in the near future given the vast difficulty of the task). \n\nHow would you design such a mission? \n\nWhere would you go? \n\nHow big would the crew be? \n\nHow do you solve the problem of ridiculous journey times (without using *Interstellar\u0027s* wormhole macguffin)? \n\nWould it even be possible? \n\nWould the world get behind such a mission or ignore it? \n\nLet\u0027s try and stay within the realms of possibility here guys, so no Alcubierre drives since we don\u0027t have any confirmation that they could work yet."},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T20:09:35Z","Content":"Antimatter and laser sails are pretty much our only options, and it\u0027ll take both, not just one."},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T20:49:25Z","Content":"Assuming we have some sort of cryonics/hypersleep/suspended animation technology?\n\nMagnetic sails and fusion or antimatter engines, liquid droplet radiators to be used during engine operation, and normal radiators afterwards, big whipple shield, and perhaps a \u0022simple\u0022 nuclear reactor to maintain power.

Fusion other than nuclear pulse propulsion is right out, it doesn\u0027t work now and there\u0027s no guarantee it will.\n\nI\u0027d have to think about where it would go. Keep in mind that the closest star *now* isn\u0027t necessarily the one we can get to soonest because the stars are moving too! In the long term we need an external source of radiation, nuclear reactors won\u0027t run the ship forever.\n\nActually I wonder if Jupiter orbit might not work. It does give off a fair bit of infrared radiation, and while that low-grade radiation would be difficult to exploit I wouldn\u0027t count it out. Of course this assumes that whatever killed the Sun won\u0027t kill Jupiter too.\n\nIt would take generations, we\u0027re talking generation ship stuff.\n\nNow as for how many people would go and whether the world would be behind it, I\u0027m afraid this is where it turns ugly.

Just build a bunch of space stations and sit it out in the Kuiper Belt. Plenty of resources to keep you going for millions of years. From there we\u0027d have to rebuild our civilization. There\u0027s no way we\u0027d get more than 0.1% of the current population into the space stations, so we are dangerously close to extinction.

I never said we should use fusion to travel to other stars. \n\nAlso, what\u0027s your source on that? D-T fusion has a mass defect of 17.5MeV. If you use that in a fusion drive you\u0027d get a theoretical exhaust velocity of 0.087c. Say you wanted to go 10 ly within 200 years. You\u0027d need 0.1c of dV. Plugging the numbers into the tsiolkovsky rocket equation gives you m(frac) = e^(dV/v(e)) = 3.15. So your fusion fuel only needs to be about 3 times as heavy as your payload.
