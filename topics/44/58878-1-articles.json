The L1 is between Earth and Sun, L2 is always behind the Earth, L3 is always on the opposite side of the Sun from the Earth and L4 and L5 are leading and lagging, respectively, in Earth\u0027s orbit. Most of these points aren\u0027t stable, but they have stable orbits around them. (Halo orbits, Lissajous orbits, etc.) If you want a satellite that stays in the same position relative to both Earth and the Sun, these are the points you\u0027d put your satellite. So L1 is useful for solar observatories, and L2 is good if you want a place where sunlight does not interfere with you watching the sky. Other three points aren\u0027t particularly useful, but they do tend to capture asteroids. Not so much in the Earth-Sun system, but very much so in Sun-Jupiter L4 and L5.
