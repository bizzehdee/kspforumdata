This makes the task of obstacle recognition and avoidance rather simple (since there are none) and the computer just has to worry about keeping the craft flying straight and level. In locations where one would normally drive, there are many dynamic and highly unpredictable obstacles (read: other humans in cars) that the driver must avoid.
