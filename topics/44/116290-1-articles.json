(I assume it depends on the nature of the imaging system?) How much is the image magnified and/or made brighter? Is the image ring always ~1-1.5 solar diameters for the typical 550-1000 AU distances, no matter how distant the object being magnified is? If so, does this make it unsuitable for observations of distant galaxies? Can this work for more distant stars, and if so, why isn\u0027t it already in use given that there are a number of distant (non-trivial redshift) galaxies with annoying foreground stars?

I\u0027ll try to calculate some things with it first.\n\nEDIT : \n\nThe results, for an infinitely distant object located behind the lensing object, gives a minimum distance from Sun as ~550 AU, where the Einstein Ring / Cross will be located at the rim of the Sun\u0027s disk from that distance. The angular diameter of this ring/cross will be 1.69E-5 radians (for comparison, HST resolving power is 2.42E-7 radians). Not to mention things like corona and such. So I should say that this thing is going to be expensive anyway, and it\u0027d still be better to get a lot of dish on ground.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-21T04:52:12Z\u0022 title=\u002207/21/2015 04:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by YNM**"}]}
