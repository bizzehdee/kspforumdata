On top of that we never landed anything in such a low pressure enviroment horizontally (if that is even possible). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe lack experience at this and have problems to predict the weather conditions and we only know the surface material from satelite images. I\u0027m not sure that a program can deal with that.

Although software and satellite imaging have improved significantly since then, unpredicted problems are still fairly common when landing in new places (philae lander).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I still wonder if a glider could be used to get at least somewhat close to the target. You could ditch the wings before the final landing and do that last bit with regular engines. I\u0027m not sure though if it could even glide long enough to perform any meaningfull course corrections.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
