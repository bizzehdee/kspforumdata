If you have an external force applying a torque on the spacecraft, the CMGs or reaction wheels absorb the angular momentum and keep the craft stable. If the force is on-going, as with radiation pressure or gravity torque generally are, then your CMGs or reaction wheels will eventually saturate and you will need to dump the momentum using RCS or some other interaction with the outside universe. Depending on the mission, it may be possible to rotate the craft and reverse the external effect, in which case you can avoid saturating the CMGs in the first place. But if you need to keep a constant orientation than you need thrusters. Or you could do something clever, like pumping fuel around the craft to alter the effect of gravity torque, or moving solar panels to alter radiation pressure, but those are more complex solutions and additional points of failure, so they are not used in the real world to my knowledge.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpeach","CreatedById":34566,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-15T22:18:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you,both, for the answer!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
