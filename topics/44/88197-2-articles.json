Part of it must be that we lose some of our creativity and mental vigor when we grow older, but I also do believe that part of it is that only the new guys have the capability to see things from a different perspective. Einstein was brilliant because he was the rare exception to this rule- he managed to maintain much of his creativity and innovative nature well into old age and eventually after many years being submerged in the field.

For all we know, a \u0022superconducting version\u0022 could work worse not better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is \u0022something incredibly useful to be gained\u0022 in every experiment. Nothing special about this one. It is just naive to EXPECT anything incredible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-02T16:37:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022N_las\u0022 data-cite=\u0022N_las\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat do you mean \u0022Einstein was a MERE patent-man\u0022? He was a physicist with a degree. He just worked for some time at a patent office. Thats like saying: \u0022This physicist worked at McDonalds once during his college time to earn some money. Therefore he wasn\u0027t an established physicist but a mere burger cook!\u0022\u003Cp\u003EAnd I am not even sure what you mean in regards to Hawking. Someone \u0022laughed\u0022 at ideas like his? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan you bring up an ACTUAL example an major breakthrough in physics that has come from an \u0022unestablishment\u0022 guy? What do you even mean by that? Someone who didn\u0027t had a dregree in physics?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe meant that until he started cranking out big theories, he had little impact on physics. If a physics student (or a guy who just finished studies) made a great discovery \u003Cem\u003Ewhile still working at McDonald\u0027s, \u003C/em\u003Ethen you could say a similar thing. Einstein was not any sort of university professor when he first started on his theories. Northstar didn\u0027t meant \u0022unestablished\u0022 as \u0022lacking a degree\u0022, but rather \u0022not known for other, prior achievements\u0022. And this is true. It does seem that scientist either makes a groundbreaking discovery (and spends life either polishing it or teaching it), or spends life teaching and making small steps confirming the already established theory. There is little middle ground in there, very few \u0022old timers\u0022 actually came up with really new stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
