And above this contraption called earth was that nifty thing called sky, with its nearly countless little holes perforated into this giant tent, backlit by some fancy gods or whatever. And our sun... whoa yea, tons of misconceptions. It was called god, creator, demiurge, sun, glowyfart, slowly oxidizing lump of coal and similar stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd some later time, the earth was a ball, circling the sun, which was suddenly a nuclear fusion furnace, driven by its own weight on itself, travelling through something even more adventurous, called a galaxy and this galaxy was our universe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd some more time later, after those funny humans made up some very interesting devices to measure the how and why of all theese happenings and where it wil bring us, they found even more galaxies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly the universe was uncomprehandably huge, filled with uncomprehendably tiny matter and even more tiny energy. And this all exploded out of nothing into today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe maths behind all this is really intrigueing and leads to many funny theoretical possibilities of which none were ever achieved, observed or recreated. The maths lead to even more fasciniting conclusions, which contradicted most observations, which in the first place lead to theese conclusions, in exactly the way, the universe plays its games with us, in throwing us from one paradox into another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we refined our methods of measuring and observing. And tadaa, more perplexity in the scientists faces. More contradictions, more paradoxii.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo science started to cry and went into a deep slumber.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd suddenly a freak (when i refer to freaks, I\u0027m actually giving compliments. Freaks are cool. Ppl need moar freaks), a plasma scientist, a mythologist and tons of other people put really much effort into rewinding, well, all sciences involved in understanding the world, because we obviously took the wrong turn some time ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell and this really great number of actual scientist, free scientist, hobby scientist, science enthusiasts and a few information consumers produced a totaly different perception of our universe. By including all sciences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo they came up with the electric universe and plasma cosmology, which explain the universe in a truly epic way, including myths of ancient times as well as revamped modern sciences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI belive the most professional information portal about the topic is the \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003EThunderbolts Project\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022\u0027s homepage, which has even an interesting, active youtube channel, containing several hours of informational material and weekly updates on reeinterpretations of scientific space missions, whenever \u0022mainstream scientist\u0022 are completely baffled, because their experiment didn\u0027t give the expected results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short terms: (As far as i got it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace is \u0022electrified\u0022 and electricity and its \u0022effects\u0022 play a major role in our universe. Furthermore, our planet as well as others were \u0022zapped\u0022 several times, a few of those events almost lead to extinction of mankind. Theese zappy actions were recorded by prehistorical dudes and are still feared in form of a collective \u0022doomsday anxiety\u0022. And those events are not billions of years in the past, more like dozens of thousands of years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I\u0027m not posting any sort of links here, since interested people know how to acquire their desired information;)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe aware:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe whole theme is extremely controversal, since it nullifies (badly approximated by me) the last 100 years of cosmologic sciences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it astonishingly explains most (all??) current conundrums of space and it\u0027s contents, and as a little bonus, some ancient \u0022myths\u0022 were found to be \u0022true\u0022, one just had to \u0022look through the lyrical abberation of information\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome might already be involved, some not, some might start shouting \u0022 arrhh, heretic! burn him!
