What may seem obvious to someone judging from the comfort of their armchair may not be so obvious to people in the heat of the moment. \n\nAs an example, the gear lever on commercial transport aircraft, even in this day and age of glass cockpits, are mandated to have a tire shaped knob on the end. The allowable profiles are right in the FARs. Clearly there have been problems where highly trained but fallible people have grabbed or failed to grab the landing gear retract lever at some critical time."},{"CreatedByName":"Kilmeister","CreatedById":65062,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T16:29:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s what I\u0027m wondering.

It\u0027s not hard to see something confusing for a pilot being overlooked by an engineer designing the thing. Reminds me of an episode of Air Disasters I watched once. An autopilot instrument to set a vertical descent rate had two modes: Descent Angle, Descent Rate. The display was small and only was 2 digits to save space on the crowded dash. The difference between the display was \u00223.3\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0\u0022 and \u002233\u0022. The Pilot attempted to set to 3.3\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 angle of descent, but set it at a hefty 3,300 feet/min rate which ended up plowing them into a mountain many miles short of the runway. It wasn\u0027t the only factor into the crash, but it was a significant one.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Inter_Flight_148](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Inter_Flight_148)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T16:37:04Z","Content":"This wasn\u0027t the \u0027wrong lever\u0027 as such, it was a lever activated a little while (14 seconds) before it was necessary. It doesn\u0027t seem the pilots were aware activating it that early would have this effect (remember it\u0027s merely an unlock), and they were both under a very high workload.\n\nEDIT: Or to directly quote the report;\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 3. The copilot was experiencing high workload as a result of recalling tasks from memory while performing under time pressure and with vibration and loads that he had not recently experienced, which increased the opportunity for errors.\n\nand\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 8.

It\u0027s not hard to imagine someone who accidentally unlocks or activates a system a little too early when operating a complicated piece of machinery in a busy situation. The reason for unlocking the feather \u0022braking\u0022 system at Mach 1.4 is due to the fact that aerodynamic forces are strong enough to keep it down. If the system doesn\u0027t unlock , then they abort the remainder of the rocket burn, dump oxidizer and land. If they wait to unlock the feather system once they are \u0022in space\u0022 and find out it won\u0027t unlock, then they\u0027ll just break-up on re-entry.\n\nEDIT: Ninja\u0027ed by PakledHostage"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T17:30:15Z","Content":"Why wasn\u0027t the feather release automated?
