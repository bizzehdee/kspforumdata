This limited license includes the right to make one or more backup copies of each file associated with your account, in whole or in smaller pieces, and to transfer that file (or each piece of a file) to any location for storage on one or more of our Devices, to other systems that we operate, or to a third party that may process or store User Content for us. You grant us and each third party we work with the right to transfer your data to any location, including outside of the jurisdiction where you reside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.2. Sharing of User Content. We may offer features that enable you to make User Content available to others (whether publicly or to a specified group). We do not have the ability to control what any third party may do with User Content and we are not responsible for those actions. Once User Content has been shared, those with access to it may be able to reshare, publish, re-use, modify, or otherwise exploit User Content, so please carefully consider what you choose to share before you share it. While our Service may include sharing features, we may place limits on the volume and speed at which materials are available, we may temporarily disable or limit sharing in order to protect the health of the Service, and in many cases the availability of your User Content will depend on the speed and capacity of the Internet connection that is connected to the Device associated with your account.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.3. User Content Representations and Warranties. You are solely responsible for User Content associated with your account and the consequences of uploading, posting, or sharing that User Content.

User Content Disclaimer. We are under no obligation to edit or control User Content that you or other users post or publish, and will not be in any way responsible or liable for User Content. Space Monkey may, however, at any time and without prior notice, screen, remove, edit, or block any User Content that in our sole judgment violates these Terms or is otherwise objectionable. You understand that when using the Service you may be exposed to User Content from a variety of sources and acknowledge that User Content may be inaccurate, offensive, indecent or objectionable. You agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against Space Monkey with respect to User Content. We expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with User Content. If notified by a user or content owner that User Content allegedly does not conform to these Terms, we may investigate the allegation and determine in our sole discretion whether to remove the User Content, which we reserve the right to do at any time and without notice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis shifts liability for the content onto the user, just like any other storage service does, and protects the users storing other people\u0027s data in much the same way. \u003Cstrong\u003EIf\u003C/strong\u003E it were proven that illegal or unlicensed or what-have-you data were on their service, then it would be up to SM to remove it to comply with law enforcement, and they have very explicit clauses in the ToS allowing just that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace Monkey and its users would only be liable for a bad user using the service for illicit purposes if they were informed of the criminal activity and didn\u0027t act; that would make them an accessory.
