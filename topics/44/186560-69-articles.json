OK, benefit of the doubt and call it $2B for 2 flight, 1 test stage for lowest possible SLS cost (it\u0027s more likely a billion each)\u2014that\u0027s $666M each.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe now have $1.175B \u002B $0.667B = S1.842B for the core plus SRBs... ICPS is ~$160M per stage, bringing each to an even $2B. EUS will obviously cost more, not less than ICPS, but there is no possible way SLS launches ever drop below 2 billion each. Not including Orion (over a billion per CSM), not ever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere could they reduce costs to make an SLS cheaper cargo version?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n$666M for each core stage seems like a starting point. Off the shelf propane tank cost is not a lower limit for SLS, as the tanks have to hold Hydrogen which is more expensive to design for. A quick google shows that using current hydrogen storage transport container costs, tank capacity large enough to hold that much LH2 would cost $50M. That might not be a bad lower limit, but for ground use, mass clearly doesn\u0027t matter, either, so I of course don\u0027t expect that to be a reasonable number. But it seems like heading towards that number an order of mag lower (at least) than the core stage costs should be possible. NG is 7m, 83% of SLS diameter, and they plan to compete in price with F9. They have to be making those stages (overbuilt for reuse) for not more than $100M. $200M for SLS made in a way that doesn\u0027t rip us off?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat gets SLS to $1.8B, or maybe holds it at $2B with EUS (assume EUS is ~2X ICPS).The next place are the fireworks on the side. There is simply zero reason that 2 SRBs should be $971M, that\u0027s criminally high. Old information seems to imply Shuttle SRBs were more like $50M for a set. Dunno why we (taxpayers) are being ripped off by a factor of ~20, but we are. So if the SRBs were properly contracted at $50M for a set, or even just 10X less at $97M for a pair, we could drop the SLS launch price to $1.26B!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s starting to get someplace. Now we just need to get RS-25s down to a reasonable price. There\u0027s not really any reason for a rocket engine to cost more than even $10M for disposable engines IMO. Heck, in constant dollars SSMEs were $50M new, right? How about half that for expendable versions? Now SLS has $100M on the bottom, instead of $400M. We\u0027re now at $826M per launch (block 1B cargo). If EUS could be made not $360M, we could drop that further, and $360M is criminal for that, as well (Delta IVH cost for a single stage? yeah, no). No single upper stage should cost as much as any single stick liquid rocket launch retail. Call it $60M. That gets us down to $526M per launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf SLS was not literally ripping off taxpayers, half a billion would be an entirely reasonable cost for that capability, and I\u0027d be a huge fan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: turns out Shuttle external tanks cost... $75M. SLS has new tanks, so new they are not at all the same (removing all commonality). Still, the core stage is just 18m longer, so call it 50% more cost. If we pay more than ~$113M for the core stage... we\u0027re being ripped off. You can round that up slightly, as ET-94 was delivered to NASA in 2001, so whatever inflation does to that in 20 years (not much).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-04-10T23:27:20Z\u0022 title=\u002204/10/2021 11:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EApril 10, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by tater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RCgothic","CreatedById":132560,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-10T18:39:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSLS / Orion are the least essential bits of Artemis, tbh.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake away the commercial support of Falcon Heavy, Vulcan, Starship or HLS, and people don\u0027t walk on the moon period.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake away SLS/Orion and we can still make something work by Earth Orbit Rendezvous, probably for a good deal less money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-10T19:24:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223952323\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022186560\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221618079988\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022132560\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RCgothic\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n42 minutes ago, RCgothic said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake away SLS/Orion and we can still make something work by Earth Orbit Rendezvous, probably for a good deal less money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, but it is funded, regardless.

ET-94, the light weight tank built for \u003Cem\u003EColumbia\u003C/em\u003E, and delivered to NASA in 2001, cost $75M brand new. SLS core is a little more than a third larger. Call it 50% larger to slop up the cost. Corrected for inflation and the larger than it should be increased size (50% larger), that\u0027s $171M, I said 112 I think.
