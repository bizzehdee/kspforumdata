It would be launched via 4 Falcon Heavy rockets, 2 SLS Block IB rockets, and 5 SLS Block II rockets.\n\nI know it\u0027s not perfect, that\u0027s why I posted it here, to be criticized. I wanted it to be realistic and doable within a decent amount of money and science return.\n\nMost of the information can be found on the images themselves.

Anyway, I have a few more ideas/suggestions:\n\n- I am pretty sure the mega SLS can only launch 130mT into low earth orbit, not 150.

So the exact module masses and launch vehicle types for them will have to change around a bit.\n\n- You mentioned a Methalox-propelled SSTO lander using ISRU to refuel on the surface of mars. Entering mars orbit from the surface requires about 3650m/s of Dv, so a lander with a full mass of 40mT using a \u0027raptor\u0027 engine would need 25mT of Methalox fuel capacity, leaving only 15mT for the structure, habitat, engines, etc etc. Luckily this can be partially solved by the fact the falcon heavy can lift not 40 but 53mT into low earth orbit. Our 53mT lander will need 33mT of Methalox fuel, giving a slightly better 20mT for everything else. If we use the mega SLS, our 130mT lander can have a dry mass of 49mT, which will be enough for our 8-person expedition.\n\n- Instead of using \u0027tin can\u0027 modules for the orbital vehicle, it would be a much better choice to use Bigelow Aerospace\u0027s BA 2100 module. It can easily be launched on an SLS, can accommodate the crew of 8 easily and is more radiation and micrometeoroid resistant than other designs. more info can be found at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BA_2100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BA_2100)\n\n- I still cannot see any flight timeline. Using the launch windows link provided, what do you figure the (TMI, Mars arrival, Mars landing, Mars liftoff, TEI, Earth arrival) time schedule to look like?\n\n- Are the sizes of the NTR propellant tanks just guesses, or are they based on the real density of liquid hydrogen?\n\n- In case Orion can\u0027t be used, there should be a backup plan to use the SpaceX Dragon V2.

Not even a small one? Or a nuclear powered ion drive craft, for that matter?\n\u003E \n\u003E Is it just a matter of need? Massive PR flak from any attempt to launch something with the \u0022N-word\u0022 (Nuclear) on board? Something else?\n\nThe massive development cost, mostly (build the facility where you can test a nuclear rocket, mostly, including capturing the exhaust and the pieces of the very radioactive engines you test to failure like you should). Plus the lack of real *need* (they would sure be nice to have), and the fear of the N-word, of course.\n\nAs to design tips, well, capture at a highly elliptical orbit saves *a lot*, since you can save delta-v for the most massive components, namely the interplanetary Hab and the return stages. More of a job for the MAV, but that can refuel on the ground and do it in two legs. Then coming back from that barely-captured orbit is a breeze, which requires smaller return stages that can be chemical, which requires smaller stages to bring them to Mars in the first place...\n\nRune. Google the Von Braun Mars \u002769 plan, it\u0027s full of nice ideas."},{"CreatedByName":"fredinno","CreatedById":143381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T17:29:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E No, in fact it is quite clever. I was under the false impression the MAV would be where our crew lived for the whole surface expedition.\n\u003E Other than that, everything seems good, I am still curious about the NTR hydrogen tanks. Are the volumes of the tanks just a random guess or are they calculated using the density of liquid hydrogen? And what kind of NTR is being used? A NERVA?\n\nThe tanks are a guess.![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) I was planning on replacing them anyways, though. The NTR, though, was intended to be a NERVA engine, or a variant."},{"CreatedByName":"ChrisSpace","CreatedById":140622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T07:14:51Z","Content":"For the tanks, Wikipedia says molecular liquid hydrogen has a density of 70.85 kg/m3. So each 1mT of the stuff would have a volume of 14.114m3. If our tanks are 10m wide, this means each 1mT of propellant will add 0.1797m of height.\n\nAs for the NERVA, Atomic rockets says it has an isp of 825s, a thrust of 49kN and a mass of 10mT. This all sounds doable."},{"CreatedByName":"ChrisSpace","CreatedById":140622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T09:12:13Z","Content":"Okay, some more propulsion-related calculations:\n\nEach vehicle has a 130mT nuclear propulsion stage using an NTR similar to the NERVA. the NERVA had a mass of 10mT, and the tank/docking/RCS systems will probably add another 10mT. This means our vehicles will each have 110mT of liquid hydrogen propellant, and tank dimensions of 10m wide and 19.767m long. According to the Dv map I posted, a transfer from LEO to low mars orbit requires 2440 \u002B 680 \u002B 90 \u002B 390 \u002B 670 \u002B 340 \u002B 400 \u002B 700 = 5710 m/s of Dv. With 110mT of propellant and an isp of 825s, this means I should be able to calculate how much payload the mission can allow. I have been looking for a rocket equation calculator which uses propellant mass and Dv to find the dry mass, but all the calculators I find only use the wet/dry masses and not the propellant/dry masses. Can anybody help?"}]}
