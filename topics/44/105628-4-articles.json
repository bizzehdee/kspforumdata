The most believable version so far is that damage was done by collision with third stage during separation, perhaps, due to third stage engines not shutting down correctly. If so, any clues to the causes would far more likely be discovered on the third stage itself, but these things are designed to thoroughly disintegrate during re-entry."},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T06:43:45Z","Content":"It\u0027s ALIENS obviously.![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\n:joking:\n\nOr the guy with psychic powers used them to spin it so they can\u0027t experiment on him on the ISS\n\nI don\u0027t belive any of this"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T15:05:38Z","Content":"I hope it crashes in \u0027Merica, we need some Progress."},{"CreatedByName":"Frida Space","CreatedById":60943,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T14:14:56Z","Content":"Re-Entry Predictions\n\nUpdated: May 1, 2015 - 10:00 UTC\n\nCurrent Orbit: 182.7 x 247.3 Kilometers, 51.645\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0\n\nLatest Re-Entry Predictions:\n\nSpaceflight101: May 10, 2015 - 12:15 UTC \u002B/-3 Days [issued: May 1]\n\nSatflare/Joseph Remis: May 10, 2015 - 17:05 UTC \u002B/-52 Hours [issued May 1]\n\nUSSTRATCOM: May 9, 2015 - 17:33 UTC \u002B/-6 Days [issued: April 29, 17:47]\n\nRoscosmos: Initially: May 7-11, Revised: May 5-7 [issued: April 29]\n\nESA: May 9, 2015 \u002B/-2 Days [issued: April 30]\n\nRe-Entry Location: No Prediction possible yet"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T15:29:36Z","Content":"In the past couple of days russian ground controllers managed to contact the vehicle, retrieve telemetry, and reconfigure the system usually used to supply the ISS to feed the thrusters; however, they failed to actually stop the spin.
