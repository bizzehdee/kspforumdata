It all depends on how close to the speed of light you are.). Of course, time would continue normally outside of your ship so you\u0027d find upon arrival that thousands of years have passed.

Let\u0027s take the low\u00A0number of 40 000 tons, or 40 000 000 kg per year. There would be roughly\u00A0120\u00A0000\u00A0000\u00A0000\u00A0000 particles that hit the Earth in such a scenario. If we take our spaceship to have a rather tiny cross section of just 200 m^2, that means, our ship would be struck around 180 times in one Earth orbit, which it would cover in just under an hour.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis article\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-size-of-a-crater-left-by-the-average-thermonuclear-bomb\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.quora.com/What-is-the-size-of-a-crater-left-by-the-average-thermonuclear-bomb\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nstates that a 104 kt (subterranean) bomb excavated 11 000 000 tons of material, so our 20 times smaller bomb would dig up 500 000 tons. To reach our 60 gigatons mark, we would need 120 000 strikes, which would occur in roughly 25 days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShield not heavy enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot for nothing, but you chose a *very* high relativistic speed there, knock 30km/s off your speed (so two 9\u0027s less) and the kinetic energy of incoming particles drops by a factor of 10.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThough I couldnt find much in the way of densities, it was clear that one can expect the solar system to be an area of increased density.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would also wager that there is a better approximation than comparing it to subterranean nukes - the energy is not going to be released at depth but quite close to the striking surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut even so, under some conditions it still might not be enough \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the Daedalus designs, albeit considering a much lower relativistic speed, used boron as a shield due to its high heat of vaporisation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither way, if you are going to put that many 9\u0027s in your relativistic speedometer, you are going to need a very heavy shield indeed, or some other way of dealing with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-27T11:53:48Z\u0022 title=\u002203/27/2017 11:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 27, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by p1t1o\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
