The plate, designed to shift by around 5 millimeters, normally separates after the rocket starts moving off the pad. However in this case, it apparently moved by as much as 11 millimeters before the rocket had a chance to leave the pad. As a result, all electrical connections between the pad and the rocket were severed, while the vehicle\u0027s engines were yet to develop their full thrust. At that point, the engines could still propel the rocket into the air, but could not keep it in stable flight. (According to the telemetry, the pressure inside the combustion chambers of the engines was 90 kilograms per square centimeter, instead of required 150 kilograms per square centimeter.) The flight control system could interpret such a situation as an emergency, (even if the rocket was still standing on the launch pad), and sharply throttle all engines to a maximum thrust in order to prevent the vehicle from falling onto the launch pad. In turn, the sharp increase in thrust could cause a fire detected by temperature sensors.\u003Cp\u003EIf confirmed, such a scenario would make the cable interface plate of the launch pad a culprit in the abnormal liftoff and the subsequent crash. The exact reason for the plate to go down was not immediately clear, but it could be due to its wrong installation or a mechanical failure. The erratic behavior of the rocket during its short flight also remained to be explained under this scenario.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking forward to learning more from the investigation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-06T18:49:39Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2013 06:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by MaverickSawyer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-09T13:54:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.interfax.com/newsinf.asp?pg=2\u0026amp;id=429110\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.interfax.com/newsinf.asp?pg=2\u0026amp;id=429110\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMOSCOW.
