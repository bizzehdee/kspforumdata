And pressure doesn\u0027t even matter. Say you have a spherical tank, which is best geometry for weight efficiency. If you double the size of the tank, you can store the same amount of H2 gas at 1/8th of the pressure. But you\u0027ve also increased cross-section area by factor of 4, while increasing cross-section circumference by factor of 2. So net decrease in thickness is factor of 4. But you\u0027ve also increased surface area by the same factor, four. So the total mass of the tank remains exactly the same!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless of pressure, given amount of H2 gas at fixed temperature requires a certain mass of the tank. (This works for any gas, by the way.) And it\u0027s a lot. If your tank is made of steel, for every 1kg of H2 at 300K, you\u0027ll need 1.8kg of steel in the tank!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the only practical way to store H2 in a rocket of any kind, where weight matters, is to store it as LH2.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T02:28:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is the traditional approach.

It doesn\u0027t matter. You can take H2 at high pressure and small volume, and then you are hauling lots of tank because the walls are so thick. Or can take H2 at low pressure and huge volume, and then you carry \u003Cem\u003Eexactly the same\u003C/em\u003E weight of tank because the walls have sugh a huge surface area. Either way, you need 1.8kg of tank per 1kg of H2 if you make the tank out of steel. You can do better with composites. But you will still have hard time beating 1:1 ratio. Compared to cryo H2, where in large volume, your tank weighs less than a tenth of your fuel. Now, do you want to bring 2kg of stuff for every 1kg of H2 you make use of, or 1.1kg of stuff for the same 1kg of H2? The choice is pretty simple. You bring cryo H2 at a fraction of a weight cost.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T05:27:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAgain.

Looking at it from a somewhat simplistic point of view, I guess that means it comes down to mission duration. With a boil off rate of about 1% a day, you will lose in the neighborhood 50% of your LH2 in roughly 70 days. After that, it will take about 70 more days to get down to 25% of your original amount. The longer the mission, the more interesting compressed gas becomes.

The problem is that the non-rigid tank would still have to be at least thick enough to contain H2 at some pressure, and it can\u0027t have a better tensile strength than a good composite tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to look at it another way, a non-rigid gas-filled balloon is at least as heavy as a rigid balloon of the same size.

We already do that at many facilities that make use of large quantities of liquid helium. (E.g. J-Lab.) Electricity is much cheaper in space than propellant is, and with large enough tanks, the extra weight of the condensation unit is going to be very small. (Boil-off rate scales as area, while total mass scales as volume. So with 2x larger tanks, condensation unit is going to be 2x smaller fraction of your weight.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T06:12:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you want to look at it another way, a non-rigid gas-filled balloon is at least as heavy as a rigid balloon of the same size.
