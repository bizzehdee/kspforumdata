It\u0027s politics. Back when Obama was pushing ARM, NASA made the decision to basically do what you\u0027re saying: \u0027skip\u0027 Block I in favor of Block IB. Unfortunately, they were told to keep EM-1, so they compromised on doing one Block I mission then switching over (which IMO is the worst of both worlds, but whatever).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFive years later, and thanks to this new aggressive schedule, it looks like Block I is going to be the real workhorse of the fleet, and Block IB\u0027s future is uncertain. A complete reversal over just five years! Seems like a lot of time, but it\u0027s really not that long at all when you\u0027re dealing with literal rocket science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is why a lot of people bang on about having clearly-defined mission goals: because then you don\u0027t have to deal with a rocket constantly in flux.

Thus NASA overbuilds generalist rockets that can be adapted to fit the politics, because it\u0027s the only way they can get anything built at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI see a few issues with that view of things:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) SHLVs are not generalist vehicles. The commercial sector has generalist vehicles capable of a very wide variety of missions, ranging from COTS/Commercial Crew, to deep-space probes, to mundane weather/communications/navigation satellites well handled. The only thing you need SHLVs for is to make super-heavy missions like manned BEO exploration possible with a minimum of assembly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) The SLS is underbuilt for most conceivable super-heavy missions. It can\u0027t do a single-stack lunar landing, meaning assembly is required... and if you admit \u0022some assembly necessary\u0022, then you run into schedule/tempo issues, and running the mission with commercial LVs starts to look more attractive. An Ares V would\u0027ve been a semi-decent option: stupidly expensive, but big enough for single-stack lunar landing, giving it a guaranteed SHLV niche, and breathing room to be used for other missions like superheavy probes or assembling a Mars vehicle. SLS sits right in that awkward zone where it\u0027s too big for run-of-the-mill tasks, but not quite big enough to have a guaranteed niche.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) An expendable SHLV was likely a decent choice in the Bush Jr/Obama era, when options commercial HLVs were fairly limited and expensive. Unfortunately, instead of either pressing through on Constellation or cancelling it outright, we got a compromise that mostly just serves to funnel money to Shuttle-era contractors without being a good solution to anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jadebenn","CreatedById":41164,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-11T00:48:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFolks, let me elucidate you all on the sad story of a project known as DIRECT. The idea was simple, and may sound familiar: build a new heavy lifter out of old shuttle parts to minimize downtime in-between the shuttle transition. It was basically an engineer revolt from inside NASA against the (ill-fated) Ares I and V rockets of the Constellation program. DIRECT is similar to SLS, and in many ways was the program\u0027s \u0022father,\u0022 but it was distinct from the end-product\u00A0in a number\u00A0of ways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe primary motivation behind DIRECT was to close the launch gap. The shuttles were going. It had already been decided and no-one wanted to revisit that. However, the promise of DIRECT was that the majority of the shuttle workforce and infrastructure could be retained.\u00A0This is a big deal: any more than a few years downtime and a large amount of that knowledge just goes away as people retire or move onto new jobs. DIRECT was supposed to prevent this. Here\u0027s how:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022VTwRjRp.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/VTwRjRp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis rocket, known as Jupiter, is basically just a shuttle rocket, minus the... y\u0027know, shuttle. Very little modification. The biggest change would be moving the three SSMEs to the bottom of the external tank and flattening its top. The resulting rocket would be highly capable, with a payload capacity of about 70 mT to LEO per launch. Hey, wait a minute!\u00A0Doesn\u0027t that number sound familiar? Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027m getting to that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the Obama administration canceled Constellation, NASA and Congress freaked out. Eventually, with the help of the DIRECT people, a compromise was reached. Orion was \u0022un-cancelled\u0022 and Congress\u00A0wrote the goals of the DIRECT program (more-or-less) into law. They called the resulting rocket\u00A0the Space Launch System, or SLS for short.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFeeling satisfied, DIRECT disbanded. They didn\u0027t get everything they wanted, but they felt pretty good about this new \u0022SLS\u0022 thing. After all, it seemed to follow the principles they had set out that would allow maximum commonality with shuttle equipment and minimize the gap between the shuttle program and its successor.

Ares V, possibly coupled with a proto-COTS instead of Ares I (I fully agree on Ares I being a poor idea), was big enough to at least do single-stack lunar landings to compensate for its presumably slow cadence. If any single thing should have been preserved from Constellation, it\u0027s the Ares V, instead of its awkward smaller cousin the SLS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*I don\u0027t actually know what cadence was projected for Constellation. I could be wrong, but I suspect it would\u0027ve wound up being similar to SLS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d also argue that there\u0027s some sense in proposing the Ares I. It fulfills the purpose of separating crew from cargo, and would have been a reasonably cheap way to get the astronauts to space. Later studies by the Air Force indicated \u0022hold on, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E exhaust will murderdeathkill any abort\u0022, and SRBs are in general probably less safe, but it wasn\u0027t an insane idea... just a sub-optimal choice that was fortunately cancelled before astronaut lives were risked on the thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso (despite my name: I swear I had this screen-name long before FH ever flew), I\u0027m pretty skeptical of the Starship/Superheavy. There\u0027s a chance it might work, but I\u0027d rather not bet the farm on it anytime soon. What I would argue is that, between FH, New Glenn, and Vulcan/Vulcan Heavy, there\u0027s a pretty solid chance we\u0027ll be able to throw some heavy-duty modules into space with commercial LVs. With the immense flaws in SLS, I\u0027d rather go for missions based on assembly of mid-sized modules on multiple commercial HLV launches than continue pouring money down the SLS drain.

The idea was simple, and may sound familiar: build a new heavy lifter out of old shuttle parts to minimize downtime in-between the shuttle transition. It was basically an engineer revolt from inside NASA against the (ill-fated) Ares I and V rockets of the Constellation program. DIRECT is similar to SLS, and in many ways was the program\u0027s \u0022father,\u0022 but it was distinct from the end-product\u00A0in a number\u00A0of ways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe primary motivation behind DIRECT was to close the launch gap. The shuttles were going. It had already been decided and no-one wanted to revisit that. However, the promise of DIRECT was that the majority of the shuttle workforce and infrastructure could be retained.\u00A0This is a big deal: any more than a few years downtime and a large amount of that knowledge just goes away as people retire or move onto new jobs. DIRECT was supposed to prevent this. Here\u0027s how:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/VTwRjRp.jpg\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022VTwRjRp.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/VTwRjRp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis rocket, known as Jupiter, is basically just a shuttle rocket, minus the... y\u0027know, shuttle. Very little modification. The biggest change would be moving the three SSMEs to the bottom of the external tank and flattening its top. The resulting rocket would be highly capable, with a payload capacity of about 70 mT to LEO per launch. Hey, wait a minute!\u00A0Doesn\u0027t that number sound familiar? Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027m getting to that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the Obama administration canceled Constellation, NASA and Congress freaked out. Eventually, with the help of the DIRECT people, a compromise was reached. Orion was \u0022un-cancelled\u0022 and Congress\u00A0wrote the goals of the DIRECT program (more-or-less) into law. They called the resulting rocket\u00A0the Space Launch System, or SLS for short.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFeeling satisfied, DIRECT disbanded. They didn\u0027t get everything they wanted, but they felt pretty good about this new \u0022SLS\u0022 thing. After all, it seemed to follow the principles they had set out that would allow maximum commonality with shuttle equipment and minimize the gap between the shuttle program and its successor. What could go wrong?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, uh, NASA management interpreted this act \u003Cem\u003Efar\u003C/em\u003E differently than they intended, and the result was essentially a fusion between the original vision for DIRECT and the canceled Ares V.

Ares V, possibly coupled with a proto-COTS instead of Ares I (I fully agree on Ares I being a poor idea), was big enough to at least do single-stack lunar landings to compensate for its presumably slow cadence.

You know how SLS Block I turned out to be about 25\u00A0mT stronger than it was originally supposed to be (largely due to the aforementioned mods that sunk DIRECT)? Well Block 2 as currently designed has the opposite problem. Thanks to the changes made to I and IB, just slapping some better solids on the side ain\u0027t gonna cut it anymore. You\u0027ll need a new upper stage or something better than solids (like those F1Bs)\u00A0to hit that 130 mT figure now, and that means you\u0027ll need to mod the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, MLP, and launchpad appropriately.
