But they also need lots of energy to do damage, as the energy is not kinetic but radiation, essentially heat. Thermal damage on orders similar to kinetic damage must be very\u00A0high intensity and high energy, otherwise it would be less than a sunburn. Low energy would require more time to inflict damage, not very practical. So the intensity and energy must be huge, meaning\u00A0small spot size (maintaining that over significant distances may prove an issue) but huge amounts of power. Assuming the energy must be similar to a bullet, around 2000 joules (slightly less, but\u00A0I like round numbers), we can calculate the power required for stopping the bullet, which imparts damage to the target. If we need to deliver similar amounts of energy, but in just 1 thousandth of a second, then we need 2 megawatts of power, ignoring losses. And the size of the laser/cost and other things depend on the power more so than applied energy. Of course, conventional\u00A0firearms produce similar amounts of power to accelerate the projectile, but they have the advantage of fast chemical reactions. Of course, technology will improve with time, and laser weapons are being deployed on ships, albeit not as primary weapons and with short ranges.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-23T02:13:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnly 30\u002BkW for a weapon-strength laser.

Aside from pinpoint accuracy and instant-hit capability, lasers usually suffer from:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Power requirement: This is undoubtedly one of the problem faced by energy weapons (not just laser). The power requirement of generating laser beam with sufficient power to be considered as a weapon to actually cause a damage (and not just blind people) is absurdly high. You will need a nuclear reactor or self-sufficient power generating method to fulfill those power-hungry laser to be considered practical\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Range: Lasers do have a long range, but in atmosphere, there\u0027s a problem with beam dissipation. Basically, laser beam decays as they travel through air. This can be mitigated by increasing the intensity of the laser, but then it ends with more power requirement. Even if the laser have a very long range, the terrain is still a problem. Basically, every laser weapon needs a line-of-sight to the target to be able to damage them, in other words, the laser weapon is as exposed as it\u0027s target for return fire, while with good \u0027ol artillery barrage, you can do same (or even more) damage to target by simply arcing the projectile around obstacles, potentially even surpassing the range of laser weapons while being safer as you fire them from behind terrain obstructions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Damage: Bullets, missiles, rockets, and any other ballistic weapon cause a damage on their target ON IMPACT. While lasers, being a sustained beam, need to be focused on target for a few moments as it cause GRADUAL DAMAGE, meaning most ballistic weapon might be able to destroy the incoming missile targeting an aircraft carrier as soon as it impacts the missile body, but laser beam need more time as it damage the missile until it\u0027s sufficiently damaged, during which, the missile might be already close enough that it\u0027s destruction still send damaging debris on the carrier\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Heat: Lasers have poor heat dissipation. Most ballistic weapons can mitigate heat by simply changing barrel (and even if the barrel becomes damaged due to overheating, it\u0027s barrel simply need to be replaced). Lasers need a way to dissipate heat, which might be a radiator-type heat exchanger or coolant-based system. But then this brings a question: if a laser gun breaks because it\u0027s overheated (like a gun with warped barrel), does the process of fixing it could be considered as practical or complicated? Most guns can simply change the barrel, but laser gun is not a simple thing, it\u0027s takes an engineer or scientist to fix that thing, it\u0027s not something that every soldier can fix in the middle of battle like their jammed gun\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot to mention cost \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-23T07:18:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOfftop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA tandem of (\u003Cem\u003Elaser \u002B microwave emitter \u002B ultrasound emitter\u003C/em\u003E) would be greatly useful for an evil scientist living in a grim castle somewhere in Middle-Earth, Westeros or any other medieval.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey spend nothing except pure energy (need no ammo or fuel),\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey can be focused with much less number of moving parts than a machine-gun or a flamethrower (so, need less or no spare parts)\u003Cbr\u003E\nTheir firepower is tunable.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey don\u0027t miss.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey can be easily managed from a notebook.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, you can put several turrets around your castle and set guard mode on.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOnce a hero comes close to the redline, a pair of the nearest turrets gets refocused to him, target with low-energy lasers, and switch on the ultrasound.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDogs, cats and don\u0027t know, maybe the horse who accompany him, get worried and try to alarm him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the hero is enough stupid to proceed (as clever animals already get retired), the turrets automatically switch on the microwave emitter.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe hero feels hot, and not only for his braveness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this freak keeps moving and crosses the last line, the turrets set the microwave power to maximum\u00A0 and switch on the high-energy laser.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe hero, blinded by laser and in red-hot (from microvawe) armor (he can\u0027t take it off for obvious reasons) randomly walks and falls dead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you prefer to capture him, you can switch off the latter options and just wait while he falls down unconscious.
