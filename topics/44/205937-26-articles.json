For any 2 causally linked events (like 1. Queen Elizabeth dying and 2. Charles ascending the throne) one can always find an event that is not causally linked to these 2 (say a star in another galaxy going supernova) which is observed at the location of event 2 before it is observed at the location of event 1. That doesn\u0027t mean the causally linked events are reversed, it basically means that the past exists and the future exists, and just because we are in a location (in space-time) where our viewpoint doesn\u0027t allow us to experience (or observe if you prefer) what we consider the past or the future doesn\u0027t mean they are less real. Another way of looking at this is to say there is no absolute measure of time, it is always relative to the observer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the Queen died, Charles became King, instantly. Just because he happened to be in a location in space-time where he could not know about it yet does not mean he isn\u0027t King, it just means he\u0027s King without knowing it. Even without anyone on Earth knowing it, but notably NOT without any possible observer knowing it (the people on Mars in your hypothetical example knew).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the transfer of the title is instantaneous, which is possible because it doesn\u0027t require the transfer of any information.
