If the fan blades spin, the centrifugal/centripetal forces causes a radial pressure gradient. The pressure at the outer radius is higher than the inner radius. Since the outlet is venting to ambient pressure, flow is created.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(2) Now imagine you weld the fan blades to the housing. If you spun the housing at the same RPM, you would still get flow, since the outlet pressure is still above ambient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(3) Now imagine you welded a duct connecting the outlet to the inlet hub. The system is now fully contained. If you spun the device, would you get flow?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy inclination is no, since in the return duct, there is the same centripetal acceleration that causes\u00A0 the same pressure gradient in the radial direction. Thus, i cant think of a reason the flow would go one way vs. the other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts? Clarifications?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTIAA\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeiss Ikon","CreatedById":174016,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-14T00:46:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are correct.\u00A0 You\u0027d get a \u003Cem\u003Epressure gradient\u003C/em\u003E due to the centripetal acceleration, both in the fan housing and in the return duct, but you\u0027d get no flow beyond startup and shutdown transients as the \u0022spin gravity\u0022 rises and falls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027d probably also tear up your mounting system, because the duct would imbalance your erstwhile squirrel cage blower beyond the ability of the bearings and struts to hold it in place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arkie87","CreatedById":103434,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-14T14:30:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223727969\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022191012\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221578962770\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022174016\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zeiss Ikon\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 hours ago, Zeiss Ikon said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are correct.\u00A0 You\u0027d get a \u003Cem\u003Epressure gradient\u003C/em\u003E due to the centripetal acceleration, both in the fan housing and in the return duct, but you\u0027d get no flow beyond startup and shutdown transients as the \u0022spin gravity\u0022 rises and falls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 hours ago, Zeiss Ikon said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027d probably also tear up your mounting system, because the duct would imbalance your erstwhile squirrel cage blower beyond the ability of the bearings and struts to hold it in place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like something a Kerbal would do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
