I\u0027m putting together a shopping list. In principle, if we go with off-the-shelf CPU/MCU, we can go pretty fancy.

It\u0027s easy to work with. There is a huge amount of tools available. It will make floating-point computations a bit tricky, but honestly, everything we need can be done in fixed point. It also has very low clock rate, so we wouldn\u0027t be streaming any video. (Not that I was counting on that.) It will be plenty for navs and attitude control work, and it will be able to handle communications with ground stations and transmit images.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest part, the off-the-shelf 8051 costs $10. So we can burn through a stack of them during development and testing without costing us. On the other hand, I\u0027ve found rad-hard version of the same chip (UT69RH051) for $1,275. Expensive, but it\u0027s the sort of funds we might even find at the last possible moment, and still be able to swap out the off-the-shelf 8051 for a rad-hard one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still looking at memory and other components.

It would work in more circumstances We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d have do do some ground testing, of course - we should have reasonable confidence that the technology will work, and with the EM drive or QVT that should be possible. The difficulty besides understanding the construction of the thruster will be measuring low thrust levels - millinewtons or micronewtons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also no reason not to equip both an electrotether and EM drive/QVT beyond mass. Only one of the devices should need to be powered at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this is a long term project, then we should have the time to do such testing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: NASA\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s efforts apparently produced about \u003Cstrong\u003E90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B5N\u003C/strong\u003E of thrust with \u003Cstrong\u003E17W\u003C/strong\u003E (Watts), which sounds like it is within the capability for a cubesat mission. Other tests done for Q-thrusters (there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a different design, which is better associated with the theory) show micronewtons of thrust in that range - that still works, if you let the engine run long enough (months).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit2: There\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s actually a probe mission for the Mars One project, which is supposed to go to Mars in 2018 or so. It might be possible for them to carry a cubesat project along.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-02T01:39:07Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2014 01:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainArchmage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rainbowtrout","CreatedById":60253,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-02T12:54:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rakaydos\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rakaydos\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI dont think it\u0027s our place to play with drives of uncertian physics.

The physics of quantum mechanics is well understood at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want a thruster that is better tested, you can look at plasma. It uses a block of teflon, and an electrical spark to vaporise it. The energy is stored in capacitors, so the thruster is pulsed. The specific impulse is higher than the space shuttle main engines (I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve seen about 500s quoted), but not as efficient as ion engines.

However, on spacecraft reaction wheels need to be kept operational or have their angular momentum removed in conjunction with thrusters. They are also known to break, this is what happened to the Kepler telescope.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-02T17:02:37Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2014 05:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainArchmage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"indroth","CreatedById":115621,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-02T17:22:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EToo late this year, but maybe next year?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.smallsat.org/technical-program/workshop\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.smallsat.org/technical-program/workshop\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
