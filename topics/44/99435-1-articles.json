Metallic coatings have very low emittance, so films coated on both sides are typically used for the inner layers of insulation blankets to minimize heat transfer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAluminum is the most commonly used coating; it combines low absorptance and emittance with low cost. The surface emittance, and hence energy transfer, can be reduced further through the use of gold coatings. Because gold is nearly inert, it has also been used in applications where the MLI blankets will be subjected to moist (salty) atmosphere for extended periods (e.g. space shuttle). As an alternative in this application, the aluminum can be protected with a corrosion resistant AOC coating.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAccording to the first\u00A0pdf\u00A0(NASA), the MLI insulation on the Solar Maximum Mission in the 1980\u0027s was goldized Kapton.
