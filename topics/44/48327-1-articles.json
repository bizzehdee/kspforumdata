Through this method the guidance system can determine the orbital parameters of the spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Teirusu","CreatedById":65301,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-14T04:52:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA number of ways, in fact:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) On-board accelerometers/gyroscopes can semi-accurately track a spacecrafts movement through space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Many deep space probes will have separate star-tracking cameras on board that they can use to further refine their velocity/orbit/direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) As Lajoswinkler said, satellites closer to home we can track with radar.. to some extent. Not perfectly, but fairly accurately. Obviously, that drops off the further the satellite is from us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Doppler effect can be used quite accurately, using the radio signals, to plot the orbit and velocity of a satellite. This particular one is employed when creating gravity maps of planetary bodies. This requires having an on-board clock that is fairly accurate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FellipeC","CreatedById":77983,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-14T10:00:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EApollo had 3 systems: The primary was radar from Earth, that measured position and trajectory, then send the info to the Guidance Computer.
