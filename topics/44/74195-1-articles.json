And just because these guys say we can\u0027t afford Mars, it doesn\u0027t mean its true. It\u0027s a \u0022Congressional Report\u0022 which means its politically driven - whether or not you think the political goal matches up with a desirable scientific goal is a matter of opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo summarize history:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Bush administration pushed the Constellation mission, which included the Altair lander and a return to the moon, and then some unspecified goals towards going to Mars eventually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe technical side of the program ran into some issues. The program was expensive and potentially technically inadequate to meet the stated goals. As a result there was opposition support for the alternate DIRECT program (which the future SLS is based on)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObama is elected and mandates changes to almost everything, including NASAs plan. Constellation is scrapped and the SLS is announced, and we\u0027re set upon the current plan of capturing an asteroid and studying it (and again, unspecified goals of going to Mars eventually with no development of hardware specifically for that)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe congressman and lobbyists who were with the majority during the Bush years and who supported Constellation are still there, just as the minority party now. They\u0027re going to fight back against the changes, because that is how politics work now, it pretty much takes impending government collapse to get cooperation now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis report serves that function. This is the pendulum trying to swing back the other way, saying \u0022we shouldn\u0027t have changed course, this isn\u0027t working out.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, maybe its right. I don\u0027t know. They have a point about the dead-end technology not aiding in the path to mars - an asteroid capture platform doesn\u0027t really lend much to a Mars mission beyond giving the Orion something \u0027cool\u0027 to do while they prove the platform. There are some benefits to the asteroid mission outside of a Mars program, though, so it\u0027s not exactly wasted money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing the report says is that NASA should set its focus on Mars and do everything it can to get there and \u0022avoid changes in its strategy\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt then goes on to recommend changing strategy and pursuing a Moon program again. So it\u0027s a little confusing, and the inclusion of the moon recommendation seems to be a poke at the current administration in that context.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, nothing we didn\u0027t already know. We know that we\u0027d need a bigger budget before they start really trying to go to Mars. We know that NASA is poorly served being a political ping-pong ball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion, the notion of \u0022picking a course and sticking to it\u0022 is the best one - cancelling SLS and starting over on another program would be a huge waste of money in the same way Constellation was. I wish that NASA had the ability to set its roadmap without having to conform to a political agenda from ANY white house, past or present. Let the science and tech requirement guide the mission and the political structure figure out how to make it happen (which will always include fat paychecks for the space industry establishment, of course)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo my non-astrophysicist mind it seems that a Moon mission would better prepare us for Mars than an asteroid mission. A NASA official is quoted in the Post article saying otherwise - that landing on a small airless moon doesn\u0027t really help solve the technical challenges of Mars heavier gravity and troublesome atmosphere. It\u0027s a shame that we didn\u0027t spend the 18 month study solving that question rather than rehashing the political one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mdatspace","CreatedById":83778,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-05T20:45:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Augustine report comes back to haunt us.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-05T21:27:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe problem is we spend 3.2 million dollars on a study to tell us the obvious. how does a study cost 3.2 million freaking dollars?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emurica needs to stop spending money on buffalo chips.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-05T21:57:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInternational cooperation is the way to go.
