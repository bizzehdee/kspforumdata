A static gravitational field cannot be used to accelerate you away from an object, as the gravitons emitted by a static field have zero energy and so a static field would just attract you.

I believe the answer is yes, certainly. Conductors and dielectrics change the electromagnetic waves passing through them by having charges that can move in response to the electric and magnetic fields in an electromagnetic wave passing through it. So a piece of matter that has masses (gravitational \u0022charges\u0022) that move in response to the passing gravitational wave should likewise modify gravitational wave propagation through it. So you should have materials that can absorb gravitational waves or slow them down. Boundaries/surfaces should also exist that have non-zero reflection coefficients too, so that allows the reflection of gravitational radiation too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll such effects are going to be incredibly, immeasurably weak. Gravity interacts extremely, extremely, extremely weakly with matter, as compared to the electromagnetic force. Gravity is so weak that we almost never even observe the gravitomagnetic side of it, and only the fact that there are no negative gravitational charges allows us to observe it at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
