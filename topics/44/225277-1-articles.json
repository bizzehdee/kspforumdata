Now I have created an entire future timeline in which time travel (and editing of my past timeline) is possible. In all of those future possibilities, all of which involve \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Echanging\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E the past, at some point someone will go back into the past and make a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Echange\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E which will\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can \u0022change\u0022 something only by excluding at least one dimension from the Universe to use it as a reference co-ordinate axis, to distinguish two states of the rest part of the Universe as \u0022before\u0022 and \u0022after\u0022, or \u0022from\u0022 and \u0022to\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI.e. this assumption is by definition applicable only to an incomlete Universe, lacking a technically infinite number of its possible states.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you don\u0027t arbitrarily exclude something, there can be no \u0022before\u0022, \u0022after\u0022, \u0022from\u0022, and \u0022to\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere is a static unchangeable hologram-like infinite set of states, including all logically possible states of the Universe, when \u0022you\u0022 as physical Observer are a laser beam, reading a CD-R, where you can read everything, but can change nothing, but your current reading position.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, you can pass to the state of the Universe when the cup is broken, or the state where it is intact, but you can\u0027t break the cup because both states of the Universe are possible, so they exist, and the cup state is a Schroedinger\u0027s superposition of the cup states.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus, you just can reach any \u0022point\u0022 of the space-time continuum by infinite number of ways, and can leave it by infinite number of ways.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSome ways to leave the point are more probable, due their less difference from the existing state, and probably due to the way which you had reached the current state.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, in a complete Universe there is no such thing as the time machine, just not because of causality, past changing, or so, but because it is a CD-R which doesn\u0027t know what\u0027s the \u0022time\u0022, and why some co-ordinate is more important than another.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s also why is the multiverse interpretation superior to the usually used Copenhagen interpretation. The latter excludes at least one dimension, while the multiverse interpretation includes them all, making the Copenhagen just a particular case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Terwin","CreatedById":139655,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-17T16:00:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny process humans are capable of performing can also be done naturally (ie without intelligent action).\u00A0 As such, if travel into the past is possible, then all of causality is broken.\u00A0 And considering the scale of the universe, natural\u00A0 paradox will happen.\u00A0 What impact do those two have on your universe?\u00A0 Can it even exist?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-19T07:00:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224408465\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022225277\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221721232050\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022139655\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Terwin\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 7/17/2024 at 7:00 PM, Terwin said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny process humans are capable of performing can also be done naturally (ie without intelligent action).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike natural woods of SLS rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe humans are the natural way to make things naturally by nature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey are a developed, self-organized part of the Earth lithosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-07-19T07:00:37Z\u0022 title=\u002207/19/2024 07:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 dy\u0022\u003EFriday at 07:00 AM\u003C/time\u003E by kerbiloid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
