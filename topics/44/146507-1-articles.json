Ever since I\u0027ve been trying to acquire the DvD (or better yet, the BluRay) of that single-episode show, to no avail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll I am finding is the American version called \u0022Alien Earths\u0022 which is almost identical, but I do not like the Narrator and I really want the UK version called \u0022Alien Worlds\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI found it on Youtube, and in case ou are wondering what I am talking about, it\u0027s this (see below):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if anyone knows of\u00A0a place where I could get my hands on the DvD/BluRay...
