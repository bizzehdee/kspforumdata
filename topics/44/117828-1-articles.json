Oil vaporizing wouldn\u0027t be a concern either: the vehicle could use a [dry lubricant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_lubricant).

Different fluids as water or amoniac can help to passive height control, because they boil at different temperatures and you may keep the desired pressure inside to counter the outside pressure using the venus heat.\n\nThe good of this approach, that you dont need cooling device, if your temperature start to reach the chip, then the prove rise height and cool it.\n\nBut it will be much easier to make a airship that can float between 5 km to surface.\n\nThe only problem is how you generate energy? If you dont have an anchor, you cant generate energy from the wind.\n\nIf we have stones is easy to desing an anchor, but if the soil is like in the first picture, then we are in trouble. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E To power a Venusian rover what about microwave radiation?

Low wind speeds should be offset by high atmospheric density.\n\nIs the same thing we are talking about.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Huge radiator panels on the interplanetary cruise stage could be used. Just before Venusian atmospheric entry, these could be staged off along with the cruise stage.\n\nBut look how much extra mass you need to add a RTG... it really worth it?\n\n\u003E 1.

But not sure the efficiency to extract heat from a 250c source to a 450c \n\n\u003E \n\u003E 2. What material are you planning to use for your envelope?
