You can guarantee that Sol has had much closer encounters with other stars in the past. Also, this star whipped past us really fast, so its gravity had very little time to act on the solar system.\n\nThe star could have perturbed some comets our way (though the chances of them hitting Earth are slim). Wikipedia claims that it would take about 2 million years for perturbed comets to reach the planets/Sun. I verified this by plugging a 0.4 light-year semi-major axis length into the formula for orbital period- it gives 4 million years. Divide that by two to get the amount of time it takes a comet to fall into the Sun from 0.8 light-years away - 2 million years. I suppose some comets could have gotten a boost and could arrive a bit sooner, but probably not a lot.\n\nIt\u0027s too bad that this encounter happened 70,000 years in the past instead of 70,000 years in the future.

They\u0027re not looking at a time window and checking if something came close in that window.\n\nThey\u0027re calculating the orbit of a star around the galaxy (or more precisely, the tagential and radial velocities with respect to Earth). From that, they can predict where the star has been and where it will be in the future with pretty good accuracy. So it doesn\u0027t matter if it was 70 thousand or 70 million years in the past - if the star ever comes or came anywhere close to the solar system, then it\u0027s double- and triple-checked with the highest possible confidence.

Scientists have *not* stated that this is the closest that any star has ever come to the solar system its entire 4.6 billion years of existence. In fact, there are probably hundreds of stars out there that have come closer to the solar system than this star did.
