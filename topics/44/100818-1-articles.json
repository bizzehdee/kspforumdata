Also the Soviets had less resources then Nasa so they couldn\u0027t pump out ships like they did.\n\nAnother reason for cancellation was delays, the Voskhod had an advanced life support for 21 days in space with two crew and other features however it wasn\u0027t ready until 1966 when Nasa was about to start Apollo\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nHere is a list of the cancelled Voskhod missions:\n\n3- 2 man 20 day mission, high altitude in the van allen belt, biology research.\n\n4- 3 man biology mission, 4 days, at least 1 doctor performing surgery on a rabbit.\n\n5- 2 woman crew, woman eva, 15\u002B days, biology research\n\n6- 2 man crew, eva with tests of jetpack, 15\u002B days\n\n7- 2 man crew, eva with tests of jetpack, 15\u002B days, also artificial gravity experiment involving cables.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-26T23:30:50Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2015 11:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by xenomorph555**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T02:48:46Z","Content":"Voskhod was only there to eat the US in 2 man and 3 man crews, as well as the first EVA.

They could fly three people in it, but there was no room for the airlock with three people, thus when they did the first EVA they flew with only two. Also, to save weight, they removed the ejection seat system that Vostok had. It was not a terribly great vehicle, had no emergency rocket to abort a launch, and it is probably for the best in my view that only five people flew it. If anything had gone wrong there would not have been a way to save the crews, at really any stage of the mission."},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T08:45:56Z","Content":"Yeah, the Voskhod missions were incredibly rushed. I remember an old interview with Leonov where he explains how he got stuck in the airlock trying to get back into the capsule. He had to let out some of the air from his suit to be able to actually get back in.\n\nIt\u0027s quite amazing that Soviet program had as few fatalities as it did."},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T10:29:01Z","Content":"Voskhod was a deathtrap which is why it was cancelled."},{"CreatedByName":"Pawelk198604","CreatedById":35539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T10:50:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Voskhod was a deathtrap which is why it was cancelled.\n\nDeath trap?\n\nAre you referring to Leonov space walk, when he had problem with entering back into spacecraft?"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T11:30:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Death trap?\n\u003E Are you referring to Leonov space walk, when he had problem with entering back into spacecraft?\n\nThey had to sit down sideways, without a spacesuit ( on the 3 man mission), and no abort mechanism.

It was originally going to be a one man version 2 of the vostok with new computers, sensors, eva and other hardware. It would have been introduced after 9 or 10 Vostok missions to advance the manned program but Apollo made them drop and change a lot of plans."}]}
