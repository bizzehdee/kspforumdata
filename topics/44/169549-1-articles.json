The blog itself is based on a report titled \u0022Economic Assessment and Systems Analysis\u00A0of an Evolvable Lunar Architecture that\u00A0Leverages Commercial Space Capabilities and Public-Private-Partnerships\u0022\u2014or just\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nss.org/docs/EvolvableLunarArchitecture.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E Evolvable Lunar Architecture\u003C/a\u003E. Recently I took a thorough read through the second part of the report for a big project I was working on, the part discussing the idea of an authority to help develop the Moon (the first discusses the more technical aspects of a moon base). With their approach, they believe it is possible to put people back on the moon in 5-7 years for $10 billion, and build a moon base a decade after that for $40 billion, considerably cheaper than any other approach.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe authority seems to solve the issue of unsustainable long-term planning in government and the high risk factor for\u00A0private enterprises.\u00A0I can\u0027t say I find any major issues with the idea apart from the few outlined in the report, but I can\u0027t say I have a thorough understanding of business either.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m curious as to what everyone else thinks of the idea. Personally, it seems like implementing the ideas from the report would make space travel in general a lot cheaper, and with it a lot more\u00A0development in space with propellant depots and larger, more permanent space stations. The system could probably be applied to other projects as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: If you don\u0027t what to read the report, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.thespaceshow.com/show/14-aug-2015/broadcast-2528-special-edition\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis podcast\u003C/a\u003E has the PI of the report discuss the key points of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere are \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2795/1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Etwo\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2015/07/evolvable-lunar-architecture-is-well.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elinks\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0to articles on the report as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-16T04:26:55Z\u0022 title=\u002201/16/2018 04:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 16, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by SaturnianBlue\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded another article link\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-13T23:32:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith something 100 pages long I hope your are not hoping for a comprehensive response.

The advantage of the whole authority idea is that the authority can make more decisions themselves than NASA, so there aren\u0027t constant turnarounds in long-term priorities and less\u00A0contract cancellations. Additionally, the fact that the authority is funded by multiple nations means that it isn\u0027t as bad if one nation decreases their support for the project to focus their priorities elsewhere. The authority is sort of like CERN or a Port Authority.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHonestly I haven\u0027t looked at the moon base itself as much\u2014I tended to focus on the organization itself. Of course new developments will appear\u00A0during a long-term project, but couldn\u0027t the plan be readapted then?\u00A0In some ways, the report partially does this by noting that\u00A0the Delta IV-Heavy and the Atlas V\u00A0is going to be replaced by the fully-upgraded Vulcan, which is more capable with its refillable ACES upper stage, which could be a customer for an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E propellant plant.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crew of four are on six-month rotations.

Fuel at EML2\u00A0is more valuable, and the Falcon Heavy would have to use a lot of delta-V to get there\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. The fact\u00A0is, they didn\u0027t do a proper economic analysis for propellant\u2014the study is limited in scope and fairly low-budget ($100,000) as well, so they didn\u0027t consider the other options, like asteroids, Deimos,\u00A0and from Earth\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, it was mentioned the study was more about achieving goals cheaper with a strategy (much like the COTS program)\u00A0for deep space in general.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn hindsight it was probably a poor idea for me to add \u0022A Cheaper Way to the Moon\u0022 for the title, since that isn\u0027t really what the study is about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething I found interesting from the podcast was the idea that billionaires but also countries would pay for a ticket to the moon, I suppose like how it is done on the Soyuz. Probably wouldn\u0027t be enough to pay off the base, but an idea nonetheless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-16T01:39:10Z\u0022 title=\u002201/16/2018 01:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 16, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by SaturnianBlue\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
