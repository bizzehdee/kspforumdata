All you need is to join it to a dcent battery and you can trickle charge the battery and pulse the station for all but continous station keeping. The other problem is using it as an interplanetary drive. That needs more pwer than cells can produce. Either Nuclear power will be needed or solar cell energy per have to become much for efficient per mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
