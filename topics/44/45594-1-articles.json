For those of you that don\u0027t know, that is a terminal illness. Maybe its just the fact that I don\u0027t want to face losing him, but I had an absurd idea (bear with me, you\u0027ll see where I\u0027m going in a minute. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe know that:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Electric current, not voltage, is what causes death by electrocution\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Ohm\u0027s law (V=IR) allows us to predict either the voltage, current, or electrical resistance of a circuit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Resistors produce heat when current is passing through them. The higher the resistance, the more heat is produced\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-More or less anything can be a resistor, including flesh and bone \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Cells will die if exposed to enough heat (This fact is used any time you cook meat to prevent food poisoning)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat my idea is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInsert two electrodes into the body on opposite sides of a tumor. Then send a VERY high voltage, LOW amperage DC pulse through the tumor. The result (hopefully) will be a large temperature increase in the localized area, ideally killing any cancerous cells in the vicinity. Repeat for every tumor seen until the victim seems to be in remission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGist of the idea:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECook the cancer using the victim\u0027s body as an electric oven.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblems I can see:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Bodily fluids acting as a coolant. This should be negligible due to the small amount of blood flow through capillaries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Pain. Fixed with a simple anesthetic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Electrodes arcing in the air instead of through the tumor. Solved by coating the copper electrode with a plastic insulating wrap almost all the way to the tip. The tip will be sharp enough to penetrate the skin similar to a hypodermic needle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPros:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Cheap. Only expendable supplies for this are the electrodes and some electricity. The anesthetic shouldn\u0027t be mandatory, but I don\u0027t think anyone would attempt it with out. So one working with expensive, and sometimes, dangerous chemicals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I am NOT a doctor, oncologist, or electrical engineer. Please excuse me if I made some basic oversight due to my sophistry on the subjects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts or did I just become overly optimistic?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Awaras","CreatedById":15671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-11T04:47:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am pretty sure it would be very difficult to \u0027cook\u0027 a tumor without causing serious damage to surrounding healthy tissues. :/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BigFatStupidHead","CreatedById":44217,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-11T04:52:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy condolences; I feel very badly for your dog. One of my pets died in the past year from a terrible lung cancer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the worst things about cancer is that it is a disease that can come about from a single cell. To fully wipe out a cancer, each and every cancer cell in the whole body must be killed, or it can, and probably will, recur. Also, because cancer cells can migrate through the body, there is no way to be certain of killing them all with a focused method like you\u0027ve detailed. The reason that our usage of radiation and chemotherapy is effective is because cancerous cells spend an inordinate amount of energy on division, and much less on resistance. The radiation kills the cancer slightly faster than it kills healthy cells, and the chemotherapy prevents cell division to keep the cancer in check. (It is actually the chemotherapy that causes hair to fall out, and not the radiation treatments.) Because cancer cells are less robust than normal cells, they are also more suseptable to death from viral invasion - I believe that a great deal of anti-cancer viral research goes on in Russia.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-11T05:22:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere was an interesting story a while back about using \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/10/health/a-breakthrough-against-leukemia-using-altered-t-cells.html?pagewanted=all\u0026amp;_r=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edeactivated HIV to cure leukemia in humans\u003C/a\u003E.

So in order to get a fixed amount of heat power, given by IR\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2, you have to apply enough voltage to drive a high enough current. You are likely looking at lethal levels here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, there are workarounds. Electricity has been used as method of depilation for a while. The idea is to use current to kill a hair follicle without damaging surrounding tissues. This is achieved either with heat or galvanization. For the former, the solution is to apply AC instead of DC. You can easily deliver a lot of heat to the needle without significant current. With galvanization the cells are effectively killed chemically. This one is done with very low currents, just above sensitivity threshold, and all you have to do is get polarity right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn either of these cases, you do want a better way to regulate current than simply messing with voltage. Slight changes in moisture can throw things way off. For the DC method, you have to use a current regulator, for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn principle, this approach should work for cancer. The problem is that you can only kill a small region of cells surrounding the needle. Killing something as large as a tumor is far more problematic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
