There is going to be self-interference, but this can result in a number of outcomes. Effect of time loops can actually be demonstrated with lasers quite elegantly, because a photon can be delocalized enough to interfere with itself along an earlier part of the beam. You can easily set up a grandfather paradox situation, for example and show that in QM it\u0027s trivially resolved without contradictions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GeneralVeers","CreatedById":148918,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-31T07:43:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDoes anyone else here get the feeling people are arguing in this thread just to be arguing.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, with me it\u0027s the sense that most people in this thread have forgotten that the concepts being argued are almost entirely theoretical.

There are three hypothetical ways in which this can go down (that I can think up anyway):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The time traveller \u0022rewinds\u0022 along with everything else (Groundhog Day style), and Physics is deterministic, meaning that any given event has a single, calculable outcome (but perhaps difficult or impossible to measure)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The time traveller \u0022rewinds\u0022 along with everything else (Groundhog Day style), and Physics is nondeterministic, meaning that a given event has an element of randomness affecting its outcome (and thus information can be lost forever, a horrifying concept for modern physicists)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The time traveller does not rewind along with everything else: time travel in the style of \u0022The Time Machine\u0022 or \u0022Harry Potter\u0022. I\u0027ll leave a discussion on this for another time, partly because while it entails a closed timelike curve in a technical sense, it\u0027s not really a \u0022time loop\u0022 as generally understood.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the first situation, every single time the loop \u0022loops\u0022, the exact sequence of events occurs the exact same way, including any and all information that may or may not exist. Thus people within the loop will experience the same sequence of events in exactly the same fashion - not like in \u0022The Time Machine\u0022 where the first time his wife is shot and the second she is run over; spacetime does not care whether an event is \u0022important\u0022 or not. Rather everything will happen the exact same way in every reference frame within the curve, and the people will even have the same memories and sequences of thought. In such a situation, the curve itself is undetectable by anyone. It could be happening to all of us, right now, and we would have no way to tell or reason to care. So for all practical purposes, the loop never really counts as happening to begin with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the second situation, every time the loop \u0022loops\u0022, there is a nonzero chance (big or small as you like) that any event might be slightly or significantly different. So you might stub your toe the first time, but just barely avoid stubbing it the second. Whether or not you remember previous iterations, if the loop is allowed to repeat infinitely, there is a 100% (or at least infinitely close to 100%) chance that an event will occur within the loop that breaks the loop, i.e. prevents further iterations from occurring. Thus the loop will inevitably cease to exist sooner or later. Since the nature of a time loop is such that its \u0022start\u0022 and \u0022end\u0022 points are not separated by any distance in time in the outside universe (a closed loop), this means that as soon as any CTC forms, in that same exact instant it will collapse and cease to exist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is currently only a logically-based hypothesis, but if true (I have a good feeling), it means we needn\u0027t worry about whether or not we generate CTCs - we\u0027ll either not care or they\u0027ll take care of themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-01T04:41:20Z\u0022 title=\u002211/01/2015 04:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by parameciumkid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Silver_Swift","CreatedById":123500,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T10:00:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022parameciumkid\u0022 data-cite=\u0022parameciumkid\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think I get it now, if I understand Silver_Swift\u0027s story about the drones correctly.\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I guess all of us on the doubting team were right in our hunch that it wouldn\u0027t be easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I think part of the confusion is that (like K^2 mentioned) even though you can use every \u003Cem\u003Ekind \u003C/em\u003Eof FTL communication to travel through time, you don\u0027t get time travel from every individual \u003Cem\u003Einstance \u003C/em\u003Eof FTL communication.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso worth mentioning, for purposes of science fiction stories I think you could get around the problem by throwing relativity out of the window and outright stating that FTL communication can only happen in one specific reference frame (that might make it hard to use FTL if your star system is moving at high speeds in that reference frame, but that could be a plot point). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022parameciumkid\u0022 data-cite=\u0022parameciumkid\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso, if I understand everything correctly, C will not self-destruct, because it is programmed to do so only after receiving the order from D, which cannot occur until C has itself informed D, regardless of whether A1 occurred.
