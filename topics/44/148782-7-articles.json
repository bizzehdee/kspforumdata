I thought it was pretty obvious that I was talking about governments, given that I specifically mentioned multiple government stations when talking about Antarctica and I was discussing a colonization model which obviously depends on the government (more so than usual, anyway) to function at all. The point was that if you could really build a Mars base for about the cost of a space station, the United States and China, at least, probably would, and the ESA and Japan might, either by themselves or together with the United States. India or Russia might or might not join in, they have smaller budgets than the other four. And there might be others that would ride on coattails.

If there were not treaties forbidding people from taking ownership, then nations and businesses would do that if for nothing other than \u003Cem\u003Eoil\u003C/em\u003E. There is an economic driver for actual settlement, and Antartica is many orders of magnitude easier and more hospitable than Mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, they almost certainly wouldn\u0027t. Yes, the Antarctic Treaty exists,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ebut\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Antarctica is a very harsh environment which\u00A0is extremely difficult and expensive to extract resources from, to the point where it is not economically viable. Just look at the trouble Shell has had trying to do offshore drilling in the Arctic, and remember that the Arctic is\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eeasier\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0than the Antarctic--there are permanent inhabitants, for one, there are fairly well-established transport routes, they actually\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Edo\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eon-shore drilling there so they have a base of experienced people, and so on--yet they just couldn\u0027t make it work out, and ended up spending billions of dollars and writing off billions more in assets once they gave up. Resource extraction from Antarctica is not viable because of the economics, not the Treaty, so countries are only\u00A0establishing scientific stations so that if it\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Edoes\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0become viable they have a shot at making some money from it, not because they\u0027re just waiting for the Treaty to expire so they can start taking that sweet Antarctic oil.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut you could say the same about Mars. Currently, extracting resources (or performing any other economic activity) on Mars doesn\u0027t make any sense. There\u0027s always the possibility that something might emerge that would change that, though, so there\u0027s an incentive to stake a claim (Outer Space Treaty or no), just in case and, hey, Mars bases\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0have some scientific and propaganda value in the shorter term, just like Antarctic bases. Right now, even that would cost a tremendous amount of money, so no one has done it (or even staked a claim on the Moon, which is obviously much easier in a lot of ways).\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EIf\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0costs can come down, though...well, as I said, if you could bring them down to space station levels, then it becomes conceivable.

Considering that the MAV and sample return orbiter are just as important and less technically mature, I doubt either would cost much less, so optimistically you\u0027re looking at a cost of at least $6 billion or so for the full mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, by contrast, consider a human mission. Most realistic estimates put the cost of building up a humans to Mars capability\u00A0in the range $100 billion to $1 trillion, and most mission plans that I\u0027ve seen envision returning about a metric ton of samples. Assuming that the cost of the first mission is at the very high end of that range, you end up paying\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ealmost the same\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0for each kilogram of samples--about a billion dollars--as you did with the robotic mission...and if the cost of the robotic mission is higher or the cost of the human mission is lower or both, the humans come out ahead. And that\u0027s not mentioning the fact that humans don\u0027t need to be babied by Mission Control as much as rovers, so they\u0027re likely going to be able to travel farther, collect a more diverse set of samples, and so on than the robots, so you would get more out of your billion dollars per kilogram than with the robots.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main reason why robots are in fact better than people is that it\u0027s practically impossible to get anyone to spend a trillion dollars on putting people on Mars, whereas it\u0027s only very difficult to get them to spend six billion on putting robots on Mars. If it only cost six billion to do the human mission, somehow, then you would very definitely rather have the humans, and they would very definitely be more efficient than robots.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, this is all rather beside the point of this thread, I believe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-28T18:22:00Z\u0022 title=\u002209/28/2016 06:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Workable Goblin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"monstah","CreatedById":95210,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-28T18:25:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222778258\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022148782\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221475086813\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002282292\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mitchz95\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 minutes ago, Mitchz95 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t forget, return to Earth is free on the colony ships.
