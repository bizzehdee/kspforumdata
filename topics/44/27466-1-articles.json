A race at this point has achieved an \u0022hunter-gatherer\u0022 way of life, and is starting to construct their own shelter. Civilzation is organized into small tribes, based on family connections. Humanity was at this point at around 10,000BC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EType Ib; At this point, the race will have developed agriculture, and may or may not have developed religion. Their shelters are more sopshicated, and other buildings are built for more trival purposes. Hunting is still a way of life, and ranged weapons are developed. Wide-scale goverments are built to accomendate rising populations and large cities. Boats and sea-going craft are developed. Writing and literacy are achieved. Humanity was at this point during the times of the Ancient Sumerians.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EType Ic; During this period, civilization is widespread. Larger boats take to the oceans, science begins to develop, and trading economies are developed. Humanity was at this point up to around the fall of the Romans, when Europe slightly regressed to Type Ib due to the Dark Ages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EType II ; Pre-Industrial Age\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EType IIa; At this time, small-scale exploration is underway. Gunpowder has been discovered, but this might vary if the other non-Terran civilization does not have the elements to create this. During this time, the science and literature is well developed. Also, at this time, trade is extending.
