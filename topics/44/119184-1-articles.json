What I\u0027m much less convinced about, is whether that computer will ever be anything more than a copy of a human brain and so ever have more than human intelligence. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might be that intelligence (however we define that) does turn out to be a simple function of processing power - i.e creating a superintelligence becomes a question of simply throwing more electronic neurons at the problem. But if not, we\u0027re going to need some fairly fundamental understanding as to how the huge collection of neural circuitry in the human brain actually combines to produce a human consciousness. And that, I suspect, is going to be a lot harder than \u0027merely\u0027 making an electronic copy of that brain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERead the other answers, also the OP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022gpisic\u0022 data-cite=\u0022gpisic\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOne thing i\u0027m sure of, the way of making an super AI is not to mimicry the human brain with electronics.

The point has always been that the tools we build today make tomorrows work easier than yesterdays tools. Note, a tool is not JUST hardware. A CPU just sitting there is not a useful tool. A CPU running a program to solve a problem is a useful tool. A CPU running a better program to solve the same problem is a more useful tool. Further note, the usefulness of a tool is not just directly related to the existence of the tool, but in how many of it are being used. A simple example is a PS4, a powerful computer in its own right, but in the 4,000\u002B Air Force cluster, a force to be reckoned with indeed. A more pertinent example is how we are in this fascinating state where items like 3D printers and the \u0022Maker/Hacker\u0022 ideology is suddenly acting like a force multiplier when it comes to inventiveness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESort of a mathematical example. You have 1M engineers, of which 10% are interested in inventing things, and of which 2% actually have the resources to actually create the item they have thought up. That is 2,000 active inventors and 98,000 that just shrug and wistfully imagine the glory of their idea without going anywhere. Suddenly, someone invents a 3D printer that those engineers can buy. You get an extra 2% that suddenly have the resources to explore their idea. You are now at 4,000 inventors. But perhaps now also you get an extra 1% from the original 1M that explore this new interesting curiosity. So the new math says 4,400 inventors. Another person invents a new coding system that makes it easier and more intuitive to program robots or other automated systems, apply the 2% and 1% again. You now have 7,200 inventors. Plus, now that you have these people playing around with all of these things helping them improve, and now they are quite cheap to utilize then for a variety of reasons (inspired youth, non-engineers poking their heads into certain aspects of the field, etc) we can suddenly add 1% more to our original million engineers meaning that after these two little steps we now have 7272 inventors. All of these things feed back into themselves, and sure, you DO have an upper boundary limit that is just equal to your population total but even once you reach the saturation point there is a LOT of inventing going on. Invention isn\u0027t even just making the tech in columns A or B better, it is also creating column C by realizing you can combine A/B. The more people creating new things, the more chances there are to combine things. Imagine in a way that inventing humans are neurons and the tools that they create/use are the connections. The more of both we have the more \u0022intelligent\u0022 we are. And the greatest thing about easier and more intuitive, yet powerful, tools is that they drop the bar of entry to their use drastically. Perhaps an example. Let\u0027s say you have a teenage girl, (apologies about this specific example women of KSP) and she is that stereotypical doesn\u0027t care about school, just wants to have fun, type teen. Very into the makeup and such. Well, as a gift her father buys her a device (that is getting a bunch of VC money incidentally, it\u0027s a real thing) where she can select any colored pixel on her computer screen and print of any makeup type (lipstick, blush, etc) in that color. Let\u0027s even say it has the option to let the user play with the ingredient mixtures so they can make a given item more smooth, textured, etc. This girl that has no interest in engineering suddenly has this simple to use tool that lets her craft colors of makeup that were never able to be bought previously, and perhaps after hearing from one of her friends that adjusting the balance of chemicals gave them a desired look, this teen starts adjusting the balances on hers and spreads that info around. You now have a non-engineer engaging in invention without even properly realizing that she is adding to the cumulative knowledge of humanity. THIS is the power and driving force of the singularity, when humanities ability to actually use our capabilities becomes so trivial and widespread that simply the act of going about your day ends up furthering us all even in some small part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd we are at the point where we are finally starting to ramp up that tool curve for the last part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
