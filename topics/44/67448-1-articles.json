I highly recommend it for your beginnings in calculus as it tends to describe things in a way seldom used in more formal calculus courses and leads to an excellent basis in ones ability to understand the reasons for the equivalence between the different methods of integration and derivation. Although its heavy in classical mechanics (I assume this will be a non-issue as it was for me since you are taking calculus at such an age, ability to understand mechanics and ability to understand algebra/trigonometry/calculus tend to go hand in hand) it is also very math oriented and in my opinion is a must-read for anyone even considering taking any calculus course.

It starts with fairly straight forward concepts, doesn\u0027t get too abstract, and has many good examples. At the same time, it covers all the bases in terms of limits, differentiation, and integrals in Riemann Integral sense.
