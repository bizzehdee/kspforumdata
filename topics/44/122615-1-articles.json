Parafoil recovery is also not new, being dobe since the early days of spaceflight, though with smaller payloads. I know about the low reliability, but it could still reduce vehicleular costs due to reusability, with minimal extra mass required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also like to know if it would work to have a Atlas V CCB with landing wheels, to land on an aircraft carrier, for example (with a little bit of extra fuel to help the booster to the boat, or to abort a landing.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T03:09:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027d have to seriously re-engineer the CCB to withstand the new loads, and that would cut into your payload fraction. And for ULA, the savings from reusing the booster would be completely negated by the reduced payload capacity and the expenses of inspecting and refurbishing the stage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
