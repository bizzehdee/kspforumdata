We\u0027ve already agreed that you can\u0027t simply \u0022drop\u0022 a rod from an orbiting body and have it just drop to the earth. It would require some kind of propulsion to get itself into an impact trajectory. Since the projectile would have to de-orbit on its own, a launching satellite wouldn\u0027t need to be directly overhead of any target city. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, in a lower than geosynchronous orbit, the satellite would have to \u0022drop\u0022 the rod well before getting directly overhead. This would be in order to allow the projectile to de-orbit and reach the surface in time. Because of orbiting speed to a lesser extend planetary rotation, dropping an object directly overhead would cause a scenario where the projectile would not only have to slow its orbital speed to zero, but end up accelerating in retrograde direction to counteract the distance it traveled while slowing down in the prograde direction. That is an awful lot of Delta V capability, and completely unnecessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA satellite in orbit could easily be maneuvered over a certain location (provided it was between certain lattitudes between north and south poles of the body being orbited.) could remain thereabouts for several minutes depending on the actual range of position the sat would have to be in in order to still launch. A geostationary orbit has two requirements, must have zero inclination to the equator and have a circular orbit of just under 24 hours (like earth\u0027s rotation period) then the sat could stay there pretty much indefinitely with only minute corrections. If it were north or south of the equator though, even with the same orbital period as earth\u0027s rotation, it would only be over certain parts of the earth (the same parts) once every day for a few minutes. This could be altered so that it was over a new location, but would still only be over said location for a few minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope I was clear enough, I have a tendency to overstate and restate points.

It\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s at speeds we puny humans may relatively easily manage to accelerate something like that up to.

There are two possibilities/concerns here: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. If the intenden \u0022release\u0022 imparts enough energy to the projectile for it to reach the atmosphere on it\u0027s own, so it would deorbit properly, but not more energy for this than bare necesary, then the projectile would come in at a very shallow angle. This in turn would result in a mucher longer period of aerobreaking, resulting in a much lower speed, possibly as low as terminal velocity, and this again would mean appaling precission contra to actualy let something fall straight down, where it would experience a lot less time in our atmosphere, and at a much higher speed, before hitting it\u0027s target. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB.
