And for the record, by my calculations eschewing the Orion LAS (and replacing it with nothing, which is not an option.) saves you somewhere in the region of 1000km/s in dV. But again, that means diddly because its all a matter of what you can do with that dV. That difference means a couple extra tons in any given location, or the same tonnage as before goes slightly farther. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trade off is either putting your crew and capsule at extraordinary risk or spending huge amounts of development time and funding making Orion (And SLS for that matter) do something its not meant to do (nor needs to do) for no other point than to slightly increase the performance of the system overall. The former is not even an option, period, and the latter would completely fail because a Dragon style LAS would make Orion far heavier for the entire duration of the mission, whereas Orion\u0027s current LAS only penalizes a small part of the mission where Orion basically hasn\u0027t even been activated yet. And ultimately when it comes to the mission Orion has, the extra dV still means diddly one way or the other, as you\u0027re adding more dV to a spacecraft that already has more than enough to meet its mission requirements, which is actually a waste.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYou can sit there and stick your thumbs in your ears all you want, but fact of the matter is you\u0027re ignoring the facts of why this system was chosen and focusing on \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Earbitrary numbers that don\u0027t actually mean what you think they mean.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELol, ...? first it weight 6.8Tons 80% of the capsule mass; and the dragon-Style only adds a 40% of the capsule mass.\u003Cp\u003EMake the math with the info of dragon. A complete failure of your part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I said, you know nothing of engineering. Dragon\u0027s LAS only being 40% of the total mass DOES NOT translate to Orion and vice versa. Just the simple mass difference between the two capsules means that taking the system from one and putting it on the other isn\u0027t going to result in a negative mass difference, never mind the fact that you\u0027d have to tear Orion apart and rebuild it (With a LOT of extra mass) just to do it anyway. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe simple fact that Dragon is meant to actually land somewhere and not splashdown in the ocean means it needs a completely different structural design than Orion. You can\u0027t just stick landing sticks on Orion and make it work. You have to rebuild the capsule so that its interior structure could support the entire capsules weight, including any downmass (IE, astronauts, cargo, etc), and be able to absorb the stress of landing on land (Be it a soft touch down or a literal drop from such and such height). And the capsule still has to be able to splashdown in water as a reserve. THEN, you have to built into the capsule more fuel tanks as well as the engines themselves and all the structural and electronic elements to support them. This would likely require that the capsule be enlarged to maintain the same interior volume, or you sacrifice the interior volume for this capability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoing all of this to Orion IS going to add near twice the weight of the current LAS, because what you\u0027re doing is essentially taking the LAS Tower and the Service module and cramming them into the Orion capsule. And you still have to add a separate service module for anything past LEO, which is more weight. And then, you also have to design the capsule so that its all reusable, because otherwise THERE IS NO POINT IN DOING ANY OF THIS. And all the while, the SLS\u0027 performance goes down because now on an Orion launch its dealing with a significantly heavier payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECost wise this becomes unfeasible really quickly, and no amount of reuse of even just ONE capsule is going to make up for it nor justify what ultimately decreases overall performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd on that note, after having thought out everything that would actually have to be added to Orion to make this possible, my initial mass estimate was wrong. We can say that the mass increase for this on Orion will be closer to 16 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn the whole topic I never compare functions, I clarify this in all post.
