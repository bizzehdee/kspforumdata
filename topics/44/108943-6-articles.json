However, I can explain it in simpler terms.\n\nSimpler Terms:\n\nSpoiler\n\nIt is re-usable, therefore, it can be used again. A [linear aerospike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospike_engine) is a real engine concept that has been extensively developed. [Blended wing bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blended_wing_body) and [Lifting bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifting_body) are both real things that actually work. It holds fuel, and lands with parachutes. If you do not know what those are, you should not be on the KSP forums talking about rockets. Passively cooled TPS means that its thermal protection system does not ablate or have coolant pumps.\n\nSimplest terms (using the XKCD [simplewriter](https://xkcd.com/simplewriter/))\n\nSpoiler\n\nThis space engine has fire shooters that have three sides, and can be used again. It has stuff inside for burning. After it falls off of the space car, it flies with wings or can land with a big sheet that slows it down. It is controlled by a computer, and has an outside that cools itself down as it falls. It has a special shape that gives it lift, and its wings are part of its body.\n\nAlso, I have some back-of-the-envelope stats:\n\nDry mass: ~2.394 t\n\nWet mass: ~61.8 t\n\nDelta v: ~9398 m/s without cargo\n\nPropellants: LOX/RP-1\n\nThrust: ~909 kN\n\nTWR: 1.5, fully fueled, but without cargo.\n\nTwo of these would be almost capable of satisfying this challenge."},{"CreatedByName":"DerekL1963","CreatedById":57091,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-15T17:57:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 51 minutes ago, RocketSquid said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Fine.

TWR was taken from the space shuttle stats, and thrust is from the published stats for the XRS-2200.\n\nEngine thrust= 909 kN. 2 thirds of 909 is 606. 606/9.8=61,836 kg, or 61.836 t. An RP-1 tank weighs 1% of the weight of the fuel it contains. If we assume 1.836 t is left for avionics and engine mass, the fully fueled tank weighs 60 t. 60/11=0.594 t dry mass for the tank alone. Add that to 1.836, and you get a dry mass of **2.394 t**.

I **can** know the TWR, since that is the starting condition of the booster. Additionally, I can derive the mass through an alternative method: Two of these should carry at least 60 t. Since each engine can lift roughly 95 t, each booster can weigh at most **61.836 t.** I estimated the mass of the aeroshell, avionics, and engine to be 1.836 t, leaving 60 t for fuel and fuel tanks. Since this thing will be running on RP-1, the mass of the tank is roughly 1% of the mass of the fuel.

The boosters could SSTO, or nearly SSTO, without cargo. With cargo, not so much. It probably wouldn\u0027t be useful for asparagus, since my current plans call for LH2 fuel in the orbiter.

Why has it been like pulling teeth to obtain those numbers?  \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, RocketSquid said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I **can** know the TWR, since that is the starting condition of the booster.\n\u003E \n\no.0  No, you can\u0027t *know* the TWR unless you know the mass.  I cannot repeat and emphasize this enough, it\u0027s one of the most basic axioms of rocket design.  (You can *assume* the TWR, but that\u0027s treading on very, very thin engineering ice.)  The **mass** is the starting condition for the booster and the foundation for all other calculations.  \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, RocketSquid said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Additionally, I can derive the mass through an alternative method: Two of these should carry at least 60 t. Since each engine can lift roughly 95 t, each booster can weigh at most **61.836 t.** I estimated the mass of the aeroshell, avionics, and engine to be 1.836 t, leaving 60 t for fuel and fuel tanks. Since this thing will be running on RP-1, the mass of the tank is roughly 1% of the mass of the fuel. Since this is a **back-of-the-envelope calculation,** it is both approximate and theoretical by intent.\n\u003E \n\nThat\u0027s not an alternative method - **it\u0027s the only method.**  That being said, those numbers look way off, two tons of aeroshell (even without TPS) isn\u0027t going to buy you much in the way of structure.   (And I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if your thrust web ended up eating a significant fraction of that.)  And are the control surfaces included in that?  Where is your recovery system (parachutes and landing gear) in your weight estimates?  For that matter, what is your recovery method?  \n\nYour tank estimates seem similarly off - you can\u0027t use conventional rocket numbers as these tanks will have to take stresses in directions that a conventional rocket doesn\u0027t, meaning your tanks will be heavier as will your structure.  \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, RocketSquid said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E At this point, you are delving into an ad hominem attack rather than offering constructive criticism.\n\u003E \n\nI have tried repeatedly to offer constructive criticism, only to be shot down because you don\u0027t seem to grasp what I\u0027m saying.   Serious question, is English your native language?  Because we have a communications gap, and it\u0027s either language or you really don\u0027t grasp the engineering as well as you think you do and don\u0027t (or won\u0027t) grasp the existence of the gap.  (And no, this is not *ad hominem.*  I have yet to make such an \u0022attack\u0022, nor do I plan to.   Pointing out the errors in your design process is not an attack.)"}]}
