That would be quite an exciting aerial ballet with the two side boosters dropping off and doing a symmetric pirouette back to the launch site. We\u2019d need to have another landing spot for the two boosters and then a third one for the center core. I think most of the Falcon Heavy missions will see the center core land on a ship most likely. Its really going ridiculously fast. The transfer energy of Falcon Heavy will more than double that of Falcon 9.

The core (makes sense consider how fast it is going) would land on the barge in the ocean, the boosters would fly back to land. The second stage, I wonder if they could do orbital re-entry and recovery testing for it as well?

This is to ensure that the fixes and repairs done to the craft won\u0027t suddenly undo themselves in flight. For old airframes, this goes double, since older airframes typically has higher chances of failure, due to wear and tear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have to make a slight adjustment to what you said here.

In theory and practice, an old airframe has had the proper maintenance performed on it and thus does not require extra care. Wear and tear has literally been removed and replaced. There are aircraft 5 years old and 25 years old going through C checks. The crew does not go \u0022oh crap, this is an old plane! We\u0027re in for overtime!\u0022 With properly scheduled maintenance, a 25 year old plane is the same as a 5 year old plane. As to SpaceX, their job now is to determine what the \u0022properly scheduled maintenance\u0022 is. In a sense age does not matter. Specific parts may need replacement, but that is all part of the maintenance plan. The only time age matters is when the OEM stops producing those parts and an engineer is required to certify the aging parts, or a suitable replacement for flight. It is a measure of whether it is cost-wise to do so. SpaceX is going to have their hands full with developing a maintenance schedule and i wish them all the best!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
