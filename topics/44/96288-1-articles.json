It seems unlikely that life could evolve in a puddle of methane, perhaps, but we really do not seem to know enough about it to say exactly what is needed for the formation. Sometimes when we see complex and powerful systems, we can attribute their success to any number of the myriad unique qualities of the environment of their formations.

At Titan\u0027s temperatures, methane is actually the perfect solvent.

Either something\u0027s metabolizing it, or there are some geological processes going on that we have no idea about. Either way, studying Titan should be very high on our list of priorities. I\u0027d also label it as most likely place we know of to have life that has evolved separately from our own. While Mars is a more likely place to (have) harbor(ed) life, we\u0027d be hard pressed to exclude cross-contamination with Earth, since life here and there would have to be pretty similar. With Titan, if we find life there, we\u0027d know that life evolved on two separate planets in one Solar system. Having life on Earth tells us nothing.

Even if there\u0027s not life on the surface, still the moon itself is promising because of its interesting environment and water-lava. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and also think about it, it would be so cool to live on Titan -as a natural local of Titan-.

Computers do have intelligence, not naturally -and yes! That\u0027s why we call that artificial intelligence- and that\u0027s the reason why we are not using our table to play KSP instead of our couple hundred of bucks worth computer. When you examine DNA or RNA itself, it seems pretty stable and pretty unalive and also if you, let\u0027s say, observe a bacterium that does not have its managing molecules then it seems pretty unalive too. But when you combine them, boom! There is energy transformation/transition, growth, reproducement, waste production, substance consumption and all. So what I\u0027m trying to say is that we know what life does, but we don\u0027t know what causes life to exist. A virus has a managing molecule, an isolated body but yet it can do anything with them rather then robotically transforming its genomes to an organism and making more of itself pointlessly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-14T18:10:42Z\u0022 title=\u002201/14/2015 06:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by miracmert\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ecorrected sentences that didn\u0026#039;t make sense grammatically\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T18:49:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps life, like intelligence, is something that is best understood as a gradient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhile Mars is a more likely place to (have) harbor(ed) life, we\u0027d be hard pressed to exclude cross-contamination with Earth, since life here and there would have to be pretty similar.
