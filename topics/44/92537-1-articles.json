It\u0027s just at a certain distance those effects become soo small that they\u0027re either inconsequential or indeterminable. To be able to understand the true effects, we\u0027d have to account for all matter in the universe, all their locations, states, distances, directions, velocities, etc....which is impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGravity from the edge of the observable universe is affecting us, just in ways too small or too impossible to understand. Then there\u0027s interference patterns with things like gravity too, which \u0027cancel\u0027 each other out or alter each other slightly. Like ripples in a pond. It\u0027s like if you have something suspended between two magnets. All the matter surrounding us in the universe is pulling on our planet, and themselves, and every other celestial body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, even without a frame of reference, a particle would still have motion. Think of it like this....you\u0027re on a train, you look at the floor.....it\u0027s completely still from your frame of reference. But.....does that mean the train isn\u0027t in motion? Of course it is in motion. Even sitting in your chair, you are moving at high velocities through the universe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless you were moving the same speed/direction as the only particle in an observable universe, you would become the only point of reference. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETechnically, we don\u0027t even know our true velocity in the universe. Our biggest reference point is the speed galaxies are moving to/from each other. But imagine you\u0027re on a train once more, stirring a glass of water with beads in it, the beads representing galaxies. Sure, you can probably tell how fast they\u0027re moving in relation to each other in the cup, but if you don\u0027t know the speed of the train, you can\u0027t exactly know their true speed now can you. So all the galaxies could be spinning around a giant black hole in the true center of the universe, and we simply don\u0027t have any frame of reference to determine how fast we\u0027re actually orbiting that black hole.....and that\u0027s assuming that universal black hole isn\u0027t in motion either. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut based on the reference points we have access to, i.e. our velocity of the suns orbit, the velocity of our solar system, the velocity of our galaxy, etc......you are at our best estimates, moving through the universe at over 2 million miles per hour at any given moment......and if the galaxies are orbiting something, and that something is also moving at X velocity, we could be traveling much faster through space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere could be soo many more levels to the universe than we can ever determine. Galaxies are essentially like planets orbiting a sun, but instead orbiting something much much larger, and even a universal black hole could be just one of many, orbiting something even more massive, like a fractal. This could possibly go on infinitely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople talk about multiple universes, but technically, even if universes were like planets orbiting something much larger, it would all still technically be one universe.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-11T13:29:09Z\u0022 title=\u002212/11/2014 01:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by trekkie_\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-11T15:20:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy point was that if there is a delay caused by the speed of light, eventually stuff moves so far apart that even the speed of light is not enough to allow an effect to transfer due to universal expansion, it\u0060s why we will just see a dark sky with no stars eventually from this point in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0060s at that point when *all* other matter is too far away to affect the subatomic particle, even if the force travels at the speed of light, that is the point I am talking about. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, when stuff moves fast, time goes faster meaning if you go at the speed of light then you would instantly find yourself at the end of time because of time dilation.
