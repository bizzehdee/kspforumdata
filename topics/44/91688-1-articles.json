If you look at an aircraft you will notice that the ailerons are typically at the outer edge of the wing. Same with the elevators they aer as far back as they can be. This is so they can achieve the greatest leverage around the COM/COL. The Concord is an exception to this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starman4308","CreatedById":122674,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-01T01:18:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EControl surfaces have to be far from the CoM in the appropriate axis to be effective. Many ailerons, for example, are not very far from center-of-mass for pitch: trying to use them for pitch will mostly just cause greater drag, while providing very little pitch authority. Elevators aren\u0027t used for roll authority for the same reason: they\u0027re too close to centerline.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if you had a long delta design, you could have elevons (elevator-ailerons), but with traditional wing and tail layouts, there\u0027s a good reason that ailerons and elevators are separate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"softweir","CreatedById":2795,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-01T01:28:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat they said, but in more detail: Delta-wing planes such as some fighters, Concord and the space shuttles HAVE had control surfaces with combined functions, known as elevons, so it can be done if the wing-plan is appropriate for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason they are usually separate is because their jobs are very different and so they are best placed at different points: ailerons need to be spaced fairly far apart and out from the CoM of the craft, while the elevators are better placed as far back as possible. In most conventional subsonic craft, the best place for the ailerons is on the main wing where they can be placed far apart, while the elevators are best placed on the tail where they are as far back as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn delta-wing craft the shape of the wings means there is only one place to put control surfaces, and that is at the back of the wing - which is fine because they can be placed far apart enough to act as ailerons, and far back enough to act as elevators.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Modern fighters are rarely these days built as simple delta-wing craft. This is because the simple delta-wing shape is too stable, and prefers to fly straight because the wings are so far back; what is wanted is a craft which is very nearly unstable, usually to the extent that the fly-by-wire avionics are fighting to \u003Cem\u003Ekeep\u003C/em\u003E it stable! This makes for a much more maneuverable and responsive fighter. As a result, the elevon model is becoming rarer.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I type so slow I got ninja-ed twice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-01T01:47:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAren\u0027t elevons elevators on the wings rather than the tail plane?
