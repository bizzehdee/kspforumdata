Because as of right now there are No space ships capable of landing on Mars and returning to orbit. The more fuel one has for reorbiting, the less drag/mass is produced by that mars atmosphere. The lander weight needs to come down and some means of slowing down the lander so that it can retain adequate fuel for reorbit. I have made ION drive craft capable of landing on Mun (at very great risk) about 0.2g is the limit before a whole lot of things pile on top of each other.

Each tank carries 7000 units. Presumably the drives could be replaced by a scaled down VASMIR (then nukes are not powerful enough) require much less gas (argon instead of xenon). Vasmir however is very heavy compared to ION drives.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sphere tank lattice is made up of 6 pieces (for scalability and because of the non concave collision mesh restriction for single parts)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery thing else that is not stock is a scale mod, there are no exploits, 2x rescale Factor get 8 mass, but on 4 fold power (e.g. ION Drive, or solar panels), Other than a trim of empty mass here and there for more efficient part design. One point the ION scale mod is primarily used for launch stability, so its better coupled to a 2.5 meter decoupler for the next stage.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-28T08:35:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou do know that KSP is not realistic when it comes to dV, and that ion thrusters are way overpowered in the game, dont you?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Albert VDS","CreatedById":74055,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-28T10:01:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222381636\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022130367\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221453889337\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022110849\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kaos\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n23 hours ago, Kaos said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect\u003C/a\u003E adding to the Delta-v of a high thrust system but not for a low thrust system.

It makes landing possible but it undervalues the potential dV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I look at ION drives as way underpotentiated, based on latest research, even what is being used is about a half as powerful and a quarter as efficient. In fact Ion drive systems are the only deep space propulsion that actually works (proven unlike the RF resonance drive) that is as underpotentiated in terms of its current use. The Nerva, for all its worth lacks testing in a repeat use scenario, its basically been tested on a single burn, not a repetitive burn scenario after the engine is idled for 2 years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSO lets say thrust is a tenth, and of course earth has a GM/r at minimal orbit 10 times that of kerbin, if you can break orbit in a quarter of a pass then you could break orbit in 25 passes at perigee. This lack of power has more than just inconvenience, looking at Mars entry one has to do a near perfect transfer out of earth, otherwise dV would be to high to reverse a flyby trajectory, this removes 39 day scenarios, unless alot of gas is spent on pre-SOI burning. So this basically removes ION drives from consideration from short trip scenarios, this is why I keep saying, for the technology that we currently have, a mars trip is 4 to 5 years. It gives very good reason for separating the transfer processes\u00A0 Few people, lots of supplies, a small thin craft of the design I put forward. from the landing processes/reorbit processes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou may note that I went with a single person capsule and a halfweight crew supply package, it would be about the size of a cross over SUV on the inside, which means only 1 crew. The power supplies dissipate heat at the square of the radius whereas power density increases by the cube. This also has connotations, you can not scale up in 3 dimensions, a power package can get longer, not wider, which means craft take on extremely long dimensions, or excessive weight additions for radiators. So it is not smart to send crews in one big ship but many smaller ships. This can be considered an exploit, because you may note that NASA stacks the TNGs and you would have to have huge areas of TNGs running in a wide spanning lattice to power the craft without generating so much local heat as to destroy the power unit. I have a system of piping crafted now to do this, but its an exploit to launch it, because it has impractical drag, The only way to practically use TNGs is to build the lattice in space, and each unit needs to have a shield to protect the crew. Thereare are ways to do this, you can radiate the TNGs away from the capsule. If you have to bridge the TNG over several 100 meters of axial crossection, then its better to use expandable panels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe undeveloped technology is to embed the TNGs into the retractable radiator, the only problem there is keeping the cool until you get into space. So the basic problem is very simple, ION is great, wheres your power supply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the basic idea of using ION power works, but my point is that its not one ship, its multiple ships to complete a mars mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-28T15:22:02Z\u0022 title=\u002201/28/2016 03:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Matuchkin","CreatedById":135127,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-28T15:32:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would go with VASIMR, because I actually know its capabilities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThough, if anyone has a mega-laser-shark-zombie-kraken-spacecannon-warpdrive-tyrannosaurus\u00A0rex-fluxcapacitor-jet-beam-shockwave-cruiser with them, I\u0027ll gladly consider it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-28T15:35:39Z\u0022 title=\u002201/28/2016 03:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Matuchkin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kaos","CreatedById":110849,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-28T16:53:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222383397\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022130367\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221453990762\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002274055\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Albert VDS\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Albert VDS said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt all depends on the TWR the more efficient propulsion has.
