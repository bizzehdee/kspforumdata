(how strong will it be to pressure along the grain)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat will it look like? (by my understanding it will look somewhat like graphite,as a single sheet gulps up 1.2% of light the needed amount to reach that thickness it will have quite a lot of layers).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill multiple layers better of worse its photovoltiac properties?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso if the sheets slide out of place is a problem will it help if we dope it with metals or other?(And and if we dope it with cobalt will it give it a future-ish blue tinge,:rolleyes:or is that just for the oxide)?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-13T19:42:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would be very anisotropic - different physical properties along different axes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suspect it would be very brittle.
