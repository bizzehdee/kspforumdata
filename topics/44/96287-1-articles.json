There is no change possible at all. Even if someone could reverse timeflow it would flow exactly back to the same situation you started from. Every of your actions and moves and everything around you would be rewinded back like you would rewind a vcr tape. Hell you wouldn\u0027t even remember anymore that you reversed time to some point and you would also not percieve that you are travelling back in time, we humans have no organ that could tell us. Beside from that it is not possible, you would brake a few fundamental physical laws if you could reverse timeflow in such a manner. So that example in your graphic is simply wrong for the fixed timeline scenario. And IMO it is the only real existing scenario, so far we never observed anything else then this fixed timeline.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt got pretty popular in SciFi movies to include time travel scenarios and many people are tempted to believe that it has to do anything with science. Unfortunately it is complete bulls**t. We found out that time indeed is something you can tamper with it to some degree like you could slow and accelerate time and you might even be able to stop the passing of time to a complete stop but one thing there is we never will achieve and that is reversing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that the science world out there is speculating about time travel scenarios by using FTL drives or wormholes to make a time travel into the past possible.
