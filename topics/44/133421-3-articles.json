You already have to have a preburner or gas generator to run your turbopump, so beef it up slightly and run it to your compressor. Cool the incoming airstream only as much as is needed to keep your compressor from melting, and inject the pressurized air into the exhaust stream.

Trains certainly benefitted a lot of nations, including US, Russia, and Europe - coast-to-coast US/Russia can be done under a week, European nations uses them on steep mountains. Even so, when mechanical engines becomes smaller, catchment areas of station becomes larger, and economy fallen, trains becomes less competitive. This is the case in US (where in the US you end up with unbeliaveable huge catchment areas, and expanding train network isn\u0027t as easy as expanding road network - also, have you ever consider how slow your freight trains are ?) and GB (say, Beeching Axe, Privatization, even now it\u0027s a problem yet again), so trains there slightly fell of the competition.
