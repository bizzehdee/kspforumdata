It\u0027s technically science/engineering.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI accidentally put too much pressure on a little copper part within my multimeter. It is a part that makes a connection between the wheel/setting selector and the board while putting it back together. It split the copper in half at both ends and no longer can act as a connector reducing proper function of the multi meter from what I can tell. It\u0027s literally beeping constantly when set to voltage..

I think I\u0022m actually missing two in this case. I actually need to figure out how many it should have and which slots it should be in.

They are based on tension. They have just enough to take the force of the ball bearings and the plastic ridges being pushed while turning the wheel and to hold themselves onto the plastic bits which also use tension. And the spacing to connect is very thing without creating a short or cross. Every time the wheel turns it is literally on a new mini pad. So, it cannot change position.
