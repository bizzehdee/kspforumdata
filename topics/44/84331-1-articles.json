You are at a fairly high magnetic latitude (i.e.closer to the magnetic north pole than many other locations in the lower 48). For your best chance of seeing them, get out to somewhere very dark at midnight. 1:00 am might be a bit better because you\u0027re probably currently in daylight savings time. If there happens to be a strong aurora at that time, you\u0027ll see it. You just have to take the chance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake a camera and a tripod if you do go out.

The red line on the top plot is the important one. You want Bz values below -5 and ideally near -10.

There was also very strong auroral activity ~16 hours before that. The trouble was that the first episode, although visible from much of the Canadian prairies, wasn\u0027t as strong as the second episode and the second episode only lasted a bit more than an hour. The second episode would probably have been spectacular from Scandinavia, northern Russia and maybe even Scotland. There was also a corresponding aurora down south, but unless you were on Gough Island or a ship, you probably wouldn\u0027t have seen it. Australia, like North America, were in the wrong half of the planet, given the timing. (You can still see the start/end of the favorable conditions for the second episode in the ACE data plot below. Bz only goes from strongly positive to negative at about 2000 UT and everything ends abruptly just after 2200 UT.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t speak to whether or not the second CME has reached us yet, but the aurora forecast app on my phone is predicting strong auroras again in about 8-10 hours from the time of this writing.
