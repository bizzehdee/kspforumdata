Energy can formulated by finding the area under a force curve with respect to distance (equivalent to a constant force multiplied by the distance over which it acts) and in the case of an object sitting on a table you have an electrostatic force that repels the physical object and the physical table that results from the charges and distribution of those charges in the structure of materials at the atomic and nuclear level, but this repulsion is in equilibrium with gravity by pulling the materials close enough together that the repulsive force between them equals the force of gravity and forms a stable state of equilibrium. In this state of equilibrium the sources of the forces do not move relative to one another and hence there is no* energy input or output.
