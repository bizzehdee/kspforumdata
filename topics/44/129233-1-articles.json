However, that\u0027s hardly reasonable assumption for a model rocket. Unfortunately, there is no formula you can simply plug this into to get the distance. Even if we ignore the engine thrust profile, and you simply shoot model rocket from a slingshot, air resistance is significant, and there is no analytic solution for ballistic trajectory with drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat means, the only thing you can do is plug the numbers into a computer model and run a simulation. Quadratic drag with constant drag coefficient gives reasonable approximation for a model rocket. Drag coefficient can be acquired by simply playing with the number until you get correct altitude for the given rocket motor. Of course, that assumes a known thrust profile, which you can usually get from rocket motor\u0027s manufacturer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
