The energy content per gram and about 1/4th that of Oil and with the dilution it would be about 1/7th. That is the bad points\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe good point is that more of the fuel goes into expansion than into heat because of the high water content, the problem is that in a rocket engine your gas accelerations are tremendous. To get those large accelerations you need also tremendous dV/dt, T = f(V\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E) v = velocity of gas relative to the comoving coordinate space in the gas. Therefore as the system is heated the ability for gas to accelerate increases. An excellent example of this is action is the speed of sound. As the temperature increases so does the speed of sound, suppose a projectile with a flat leading edge reaches the speed of sound. The molecules of air cannot move fast enough to move around the leading edge, they begin to stack up on the object until the density phase transition is a fusiform shape (taking into account turbulance) such that the air molecules that are not inside the high density phase can accelerate around the that phase. On the edge as those molecules that have stop slide off and accelerate they expand the phase transition maximum width creating a much larger dynamic pressure on the leading edge and the side that immediately follow. So basically inside a nozzle gas may accelerate to 30,000 m/s within the space of say 0.5 meter which means that acceleration is roughly 3,560 = a * t and d = 0.5 = 1/2 a t^2. 0.5 = (3560)t^2/t = 3560t roughly t = 1/7120. This does not seem to bad until we calculate a. 3560 = a/7120 which means a = 2 * 3560^2 or 25347200 of 2.5M g forces on our little gas molecules. Thats a hell of alot higher than the forces on air at the top of a rocket which means we are going to need a much higher temperature. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould we guess at what that might be, e and T are a function of v^2 so if we are generating 1/7th energy we might guess that v would be SqRt (1/7th) so about one third. So in otherwords the amount of thrust is going to be cut down to about 1/3rd the exhaust gas will be substantially cooler and less energy wasted, but that is only because you burnt far less energy and lost alot of power. Its probably not so bad because you could take more syrup and less oxygen, but still you will be less than half the thrust per mass. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bottom line for rockets is not so much about efficiency but thrust production per mass consumed the more thrust you get on these will determine the ability to efficiently carry a load up. Of course if you have to use a engine 1/2 the mass of the fuel that is going to substantially reduce the efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that you can make 3M sucrose, for example this is how syrup is made, its viscosity is in the 10s of thousands. You would have to heat it and keep it heated to keep if from crystallizing in your fuel lines. Corn syrup is made of dextrose, which interconverts to its aldehyde form which is much more reactive and can react with metal oxides and fuel lines, etc. So its not as stable is sucrose and at higher temperatures more of it will be in the less stable aldehyde form. At room tempature corn syrup is about 1500 times more viscous than water. So some of the weight would have to be fuel line heaters that kept the viscosity high. Another problem is that because syrup would not be a gas at the rocket inlet, some would burn before reaching the combustion chamber and would leave residue on the sides of the inlet potentially reducing flow to the engine and might even gum up the side of the chamber close to the outlet (though the temperature of the gas should ionize this).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-02T16:39:31Z\u0022 title=\u002210/02/2015 04:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-02T16:44:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am interested in this, because it sounds like it can be used as homemade rocket fuel...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-02T16:44:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou certainly couldn\u0027t use it in a regenerative engine-it would coke and clog up the cooling pipes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shynung","CreatedById":101096,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-02T16:46:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have ClF\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003E, anything can be used as rocket fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat thing burns \u003Cem\u003Esand\u003C/em\u003E.
