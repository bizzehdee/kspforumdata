The only relevant movement is the one of Dave and Carol at slower than light speeds. The information can be magically transfered, teleported, Uri-Gellered or transfered via Warp drives.

Space is up/down, time is left/right, in the diagram.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emutualdilation.gif\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe paths O1 and O2 take through spacetime are the colorcoded arrowed lines. The events in spacetime that each considers \u0022simultaneous\u0022 and \u00228 seconds after the start\u0022 are along the thinner, non-arrowed colorcoded lines. So we see that, each of the three observers thinks the other two have slow clocks, and that if we are allowed to move faster than a lightcone, we\u0027ll end up going \u0022pastward\u0022 in somebody\u0027s reckoning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe can trace out the shots on this diagram, also. Step through it one more time: if green shoots at 8 seconds out, the shot will go along the green \u0022line of simultaneity\u0022, and hit blue at 4 seconds elapsed. If blue returns fire from there, it will return along a line paralel to the blue \u0022line of simultaneity\u0022, and catch green napping at 2 seconds elapsed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see more about spacetime diagrams, and more about the notion of \u0022lines of simultaneity\u0022 at\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E sr-ticks-n-bricks.html sr-twin-01.html \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, FTL still can can bite you in non-instantaneous cases; where we\u0027re only going a \u0022little bit\u0022 faster than light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIf you warp out, go to Tau Ceti, then with normal reaction engines accelerate away from earth, warp out again to go back to earth, you will indeed get back before you left.
