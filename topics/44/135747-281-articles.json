But more specifically the Jet airline industry later on.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSpaceX needs to get the right kind of plants in operation not just for production but also for maintenance and testing of already used stages. They already do that, I know but I mean in a way to try identify problems before they happen kind of way.

Think about cracks due to multiple refueling operations, re-exposure of the same parts many times over again in between near absolute zero and 2000\u002B Fahrenheit (depending on what stage we talk about)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFailure during x many times wouldn\u0027t be bad ofcourse, even if he manages to launch the thing only once it is a achievement, but I\u0027m talking more long term here. Elon mentions a active maintenance program, but I haven\u0027t really been able to understand how that would look like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason I bring this up is because although we managed to recover a rocket stage it has never been tried to use that same piece that many times in order to get that desired price tag that Elon Musk has sugar coated for us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat are your expectations where failure because of re-use could go wrong, and how would a maintenance program look like to tackle these issues before it creates a problem?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr is what SpaceX is doing simply a trial and error aproach in this only? Like, see how many times it works, then investigate and see where to improve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile you obviously only go to Mars if your willing to die I think it is important to have already active implementations in place in how to identify problems before they cause havoc and how to solve them.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe same maintenance solutions should also still work if you need to re-apply them like on a airplane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow else are you going to get that desirable price tag? Getting 100people killed IRL is like your reputation slider in KSP drops from max to negative.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny thoughts, or better yet real intel? We\u0027re trying to do something that I think has a higher mortality rate then the Ships that crossed the atlantic in the late 15th century and carry even more people.

Genetic engineering can create fast-growing crops and trees, geoengineering can make previously inhospitable areas inhabitable, and various technologies can improve our resource extraction capabilities. In short, we can intensify the processes the we require to get resources enough so that a smaller area can feed a bigger population than it was before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, Mars doesn\u0027t have the resources we are used to collect from our surroundings. Contrary to popular belief, Mars has no arable land, nothing to plant crops on. There are no easily accessible water on the surface; one must look for water by drilling a well, which takes time and energy. And more importantly, it doesn\u0027t have a breathable atmosphere, nor does it have a planetary magnetic field to protect its inhabitants from space radiation. The atmosphere is also very thin, which means there are little protection from incoming projectiles; falling space rocks are a dime a dozen. Compared to Earth, Mars have little to no Carrying Capacity to speak of; we\u0027d have to build infrastructure to expand it ourselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd here\u0027s the kicker: anything we invent to give Mars some Carrying Capacity would be usable here. Using technology initially earmarked for colonizing Mars would make the hottest of deserts habitable. Efficient soil-less farming techniques would enable agriculture in even the harshest environments on Earth, opening more areas for settlement. Efficient water extraction, processing, and recycling technologies would help sustain cities that have limited water supplies, and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short, whatever we do to make living on Mars possible, it would improve our own planet\u0027s Carrying Capacity further. And we don\u0027t have to haul our carcasses all the way to another planet to get these benefits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, if our goal of shipping people to Mars was to set up an outpost, say, for scientific research, then it starts to make sense. There are some knowledge that we can\u0027t acquire by any way other than spending some time living on Mars. This might be something like knowing environment characteristics, accurate data on resource location and richness, and some other things This knowledge may later help us colonize Mars, when we can\u0027t stretch Earth\u0027s Carrying Capacity any more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor this purpose, building a space-railroad to Mars is unnecessarily expensive if a simpler, cheaper vehicle can do the job.

Space does not feel hot or cold. You are either net radiator or absorbed of solar energy. On the outward facing side and shielded from the sun and from radiation from the ship one can develop temperatures a few degrees above kelvin. On the sun facing side, depending on the material you can reach smelt furnace temperatures. So managing temperature is all about guidance and engineering. On the messenger mission they folded solar panels as to reduce the incident angle of the sun relative to the panel. Solar panels can also be used a shields. Theoretically if you traveled at the speed of the solar wind and 100% reflection of sunlight you have a temperature of about 3\u0027K.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2nd. Its not impossible to engineer a nearly passive cryogenic fuel storage system as part of a transporter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3rd. I should mention that if you wanted to transport millions of people to Mars, that a slow transporter such as Mg ION drive in which the propellant is a solid wire that can be fed into a solar driven drive is the most efficient and needs no cryogenic. You might take 5 years to transport to mars but again if you are transporting facilities and supplies for millions, you only need fast transport for the living, not the non-living materials (which will be the overwhelming majority of mass used to provide for the colony). Given the higher requirements of reaching Mars in terms of mass dedicated to solar panels (and in particular going back to earth) that occupation is in search of lighter weight and more efficient panels, capable of generating several MW of power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs stated in my previous post, without nuclear such a colony is untenable. On mars with current technology you get about 100 watt per meter of solar panel (not factoring dust), this is not adequate to run an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E to make fuel, provide power for probably buried greenhouse for LEDs and heating, let alone essential life support on the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get a viable subterranean colony you need drills and equipment that used 100s of KW as part of standard operation (soil and rock excavation), tunneling equipment, etc. We are nowhere near getting a viable power supply for these things. Our deep space power supplies are about 300 to 500 watts once broken in, and from another post, there is only enough nuclear fuel left for one of these.
