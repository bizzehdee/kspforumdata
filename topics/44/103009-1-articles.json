You should at least be able to see Jupiter and its moons and maybe get Venus\u0027 phase in even the crappiest store-bought telescope. I know becasue I had one when I was in high school. I could also \\*just\\* tell that Saturn had little bumps on its side (It happened at the time to be perfectly tilted. I think it\u0027s heading toward that that now as well?)\n\nDoes the telescope have a finder scope? The first thing you need to do is align that (use the Moon, or any far away target during the day like a distant water tower). Then, get something (I like Google Sky for Android phones) that will tell you where the planet you want to see is. Center the planet in the finder scope and then look through the main scope. Do a few sweeping passes and your target will fly through the center eventually. Be patient, moving the scope in tiny increments around until bam. There it is. Then focus.\n\nIt\u0027s an art more than a science getting these things working, and the payoff can be little.

Use the 5mm eyepiece and a distant object to do it.\n\nThe smaller the eyepiece you use the harder it is to get a good view at night. So after you point it at something like Jupiter you should start with your 20mm eyepiece first. With that eyepiece you have a 35x magnification which is more than enough to see good stuff. Depending on the light pollution in the area the 20mm eyepiece is best for looking at something like Andromeda. (Which will fill the whole view easily. I didn\u0027t realize until I saw it with my own telescope, it takes up more space in the sky than the full moon.) After you can find and focus something like Jupiter with the 20mm eyepiece, only then should you go to the smaller eyepieces. Since your eyepieces came with the telescope (I assume) you shouldn\u0027t need to refocus after changing eyepieces. (In general this is true for eyepieces that come in a set, or eyepieces of the same type by the same manufacturer.)\n\nThe smaller the eyepiece the higher the magnification (Focal length/eyepiece) but the more difficult it is to focus. The aperture is the important stat. The bigger it is, the more light you collect, the easier to see faint stuff and the easier it is to focus. The 5mm eyepiece gives you 140x magnification but with a 60mm aperture the best you can do with it is viewing things on the ground during the day and very bright things like the moon at night. That isn\u0027t to say don\u0027t try to view Jupiter with it, sometimes it is bright enough, just don\u0027t expect crystal clear pictures.\n\nIf you live in the city, check to see if your telescope came with some eyepiece filters. One of them is usually for filtering out light pollution. It isn\u0027t magic, but it does improve things a bit.\n\nMore expensive telescopes can give you a better view but also come with other things you need to learn like cullimating the telescope. Just out of curiosity, what is the brand name of the scope you have?"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T07:39:41Z","Content":"Guys, i\u0027m thinking about purchasing something better than my beat-up binocular.

Other than you can observe a wider area at once (compared to others with the same diameter), lower f/D means simply more light, for the same diameter. Would also helps you if you choose to take astrophotography - lower f/D means faster exposure times. Mind that the later needs motor at the mounting for very best results ! You don\u0027t need it if you\u0027re taking it at fraction of seconds.\n\nBinoculars mostly have lower f/D compared to telescopes.\n\nEDIT : If all else fails (or you want to utilize what\u0027s there), try to use lower-power eyepieces first (that is, those which yields lower magnification - so longer focus). Familiarize yourself with the movement of the telescope, and the movement of objects seen from the telescope. Using your 20 mm eyepiece with 700 mm telescope, Jupiter might still be only a little more than a dot - so just refer to the \u0022real\u0022 sky, those directly visible to your eyes. With time and patience, you should adapt better - your pointing should improve, and your eye limiting magnitude might increase a bit (hence why at last I prefer naked eye over telescopes for daily watching).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-31T09:30:15Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2015 09:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by YNM**"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T13:47:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I just rechecked the specs.

Sometimes though, you can supposedly transform a cheap telescope from an unusable piece of junk into a usable piece of junk just by getting better eyepieces. What size is the eyepiece barrel? There are generally two sizes that cheap telescopes come in for eyepieces- 0.965\u0022 (24.5 mm) or 1.25\u0022 (32 mm). If the scope uses 0.965\u0022 eyepieces, it\u0027s really junky, and the eyepieces that the telescope came with are likely to be plastic pieces of garbage. However, if you upgrade them to 0.965\u0022 eyepieces with actual glass lenses with antireflection coatings, it supposedly can help out a lot. If the telescope uses 1.25\u0022 eyepieces, you\u0027re in better luck, because the telescope itself is more likely to be of usable quality, and there is a vast array of quality 1.25\u0022 eyepieces to chose from. (2\u0022and 1.25\u0022 eyepieces are used in quality telescope- generally, a quality telescope will accept 2\u0022 eyepieces and come with an adapter that allows it use 1.25\u0022 eyepieces too.)\n\nAlso, look at the front objective of your telescope. Do reflections in the objective lens look colored (like blue or green) or are they just normal-color? If there is no coloration, it means the lens is not coated with any kind of anti-reflection coatings, and it\u0027s of an extremely low quality- it could even be a plastic lens!"},{"CreatedByName":"moronwrocket","CreatedById":134908,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T15:35:56Z","Content":"Hey, don\u0027t sell the Moon short just because you can see it without a telescope.

The best telescope is the one you\u0027ll use. I don\u0027t use my 25\u0022 scope much because the weather is so awful, and because I\u0027m only willing to use it from dark skies, which require a 3.5 - 4 hour one-way drive to get to because there are almost zero public lands in dark areas of the state I currently reside in (it also takes about an hour each to both set the telescope up and tear it down, largely due to all the stupid dew heating crap I have to attach to it to keep it free of dew in this stupidly humid state). We do get some clear weekdays, but rarely do we get clear weekends during new moon. And a lot of the weekends that we get that are fairly clear are not clear enough for me to risk a 4 hour (again, one-way) drive. So there is also something like dark-sky envy- you can get spoiled by dark skies so badly that you are unwilling to even observe under suburban or mildly-polluted country skies. To me, if the site is not dark enough to see the [Gegenschein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gegenschein), I\u0027m not happy with observing under it. And truly, the difference between mildly light-polluted country skies and near pristine dark skies is no small difference, and I also tend to look at the kinds of low surface brightness objects that even small amounts of light pollution can ruin. Even higher surface brightness objects have low surface brightness regions that are ruined by even tiny amounts of light pollution. I always feel like I have to go after something new or I\u0027m wasting my time, so I\u0027ve \u0022advanced\u0022 in the hobby so much that I have a hard time even doing the hobby anymore. I wish I could cure that and return to the \u0022newbie magic\u0022 I had as a kid... but of course, it was easy to always look at new, radically different objects when you\u0027re just starting out. Oh and yes, there are hundreds of thousands of galaxies within reach of a 25\u0022 telescope- maybe millions of galaxies- but after a certain faintness they all look the same. Regardless, these days, that\u0027s what I typically look at to get my allotment of \u0022new objects\u0022 in to make the observing session feel like a success. (Of course, I still look at all the bright \u0022eye-candy\u0022 objects, but again, if I just look at \u0022eye-candy\u0022 the whole session, I feel like the session was a \u0022failure\u0022.)\n\nAnyway, though, for a beginner, your sentiment is very true. A beginner does not need a big telescope. A beginner should not seek a big telescope. I started with 10X25 binoculars when I was 9 years old, and moved on to a 60 mm spotting scope. A few years later, I moved on to my first real telescope, a 4.5\u0022 reflector. I had a **GREAT** time, and found lots of galaxies and nebulae (just some I can remember spotting with my 4.5\u0022 scope were M81/M82, M65/M66, M51/NGC 5195, M31, M33, M57, M42, M78, and of course numerous star clusters). So small telescopes can do quite a lot! For someone interested in deep sky observing, I\u0027ve always recommended a 6\u0022 or 8\u0022 Dobsonian, but it really depends. You can have fun with nothing but a 60 mm spotting scope, as I did, though you\u0027ll quickly run out of objects to look at if your sky is not very dark. The most important thing is that the telescope is usable and that it is used.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-01T17:21:15Z\u0022 title=\u002204/01/2015 05:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|**"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T18:13:04Z","Content":"You\u0027ve pretty much summed up my own thoughts Velocity ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Weather at my place is terrible for amateur astronomers most of the year. Even if there is no rain, then usually sky is covered by partial or complete cloud layer. I feel happy if i manage to catch five clear nights in a month. It was mostly for that reason i kept using my old, trusty binoculars for many years. I\u0027ve seen no point in investing into something gathering dust for most of the year. Unfortunately recently i noticed that one of prisms became chipped ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif) It still serves great at day, but stars and planets became blurry smudges. Apparently its time to buy something new. That Celestron is small and light enough to be set up quickly on almost any surface, can be used at day to watch wildlife ( a perk of living close to a forest ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) ) and with maximum magnification of 75x it should let me see some interesting details."},{"CreatedByName":"-Velocity-","CreatedById":74097,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T18:50:43Z","Content":"Well, again, I\u0027m not a big fan of Maks. Can you link the Celestron?\n\nPersonally though, if I were really going for a cheap, small Mak that can crossover for terrestrial use, I\u0027d probably get something like this- [http://www.telescope.com/Telescopes/Cassegrain-Telescopes/Orion-Apex-102mm-Maksutov-Cassegrain-Telescope/pc/-1/c/1/sc/14/p/9823.uts](http://www.telescope.com/Telescopes/Cassegrain-Telescopes/Orion-Apex-102mm-Maksutov-Cassegrain-Telescope/pc/-1/c/1/sc/14/p/9823.uts)\n\nOr the otherwise similar and slightly cheaper 90 mm version.\n\n70 mm is quite small, and the quality of it might be a little suspect, even if it is Celestron.\n\nPersonally, I think a small apochromatic refractor might be a much better choice, such as maybe this-\n\n[http://www.telescope.com/Telescopes/Refractor-Telescopes/Refractor-Optical-Tube-Assemblies/Orion-ED80-80mm-f75-Apochromatic-Refractor-Telescope/pc/1/c/10/sc/346/p/9895.uts?refineByCategoryId=346](http://www.telescope.com/Telescopes/Refractor-Telescopes/Refractor-Optical-Tube-Assemblies/Orion-ED80-80mm-f75-Apochromatic-Refractor-Telescope/pc/1/c/10/sc/346/p/9895.uts?refineByCategoryId=346)\n\nI have a 100mm achromatic refractor, and the chromatic aberration on the planets is annoying enough that I\u0027d definitely recommend an apochromatic refractor if you can afford one. If I remember correctly, those Orion 80 mm apos got decent reviews when they first came out a few years back.\n\nAnyway, remember than you get what you pay for. IMO, it\u0027s better to send a couple hundred dollars (or the Polish equivalent ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)) and get a quality telescope you can use for the rest of your life than something cheap and flimsy that breaks and doesn\u0027t really do well what you want it to do.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-01T18:53:00Z\u0022 title=\u002204/01/2015 06:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|**"}]}
