So if something happens and the fusion power plant has to shut down it will need some initial energy input to get things running again. So you need some backup energy source to restart the reactor. Also the costs running such a plant are probably much higher then other conventional power plants. At the current stage of development they still get no more energy out of the fusion process then they have to input to start it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe constant power input is actually a build-in safety feature.

One in every 6400 hydrogen atoms is a deuterium isotope. This means that if you filter an olympic swimming pool for heavy water you can extract a large bathtub full of the stuff. That\u0027s enough to keep a nuclear fusion reactor running for months. The oceans contain enough deuterium to keep us running for millions of years, even if we take into account the exponential power increases of the past centuries.

If u have 1m\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 with 20%efficiency you can produce 200W with that. If your roof is 10mx10m you can have 100m\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 of cells producing 20.000W.

The nuclear waste produced from Deuterium-Deuterium fusion is ultimately just non-radioactive helium (D-D fusion also produces Tritium which is a fusion fuel that is relatively short half-life [12.32 years] and is moderately radioactive. A D-D fusion reactor can burn in place the Tritium it generates, producing additional energy via a D-T fusion reaction, and end up only producing non-radioactive helium, as its nuclear waste). This system is currently being evaluated for development and funding by the California Energy Commission (proposal CEC TN-72616).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The current pure fusion CEC TN-72616 proposal is a lot like classic two stage thermonuclear weapon designs that enjoyed early success in military applications. To produce practical fusion technology that can have an impact in less than 10 years, it is important to try to stay close to ideas that have a track record and have shown their value. The current (CEC TN-72616) pure inertial confinement hybrid D-T/D-D fusion design uses a staged design target that allows a minimum amount of Tritium in a D-T capsule to ignite a much larger amount of pressurized deuterium cryo-liquid held in a long thin pressurized cylinder. The D-T initiator or \u0022sparkplug\u0022 is tiny: only 170 microgram of D-T in a spherical fusion capsule which is ignited by the fusion driver. The D-T initiator in turn is used to initiate a detonation wave of in the long thin pressurized cylinder of cryogenic liquid Deuterium (D-D fusion). The majority of the energy produced by the hybrid staged small fusion device is from cheap, sustainable, deuterium D-D fusion. The two stage CEC TN-72616 minimizes both the amount of tritium that has to be produced and stored to make fusion targets and also makes possible a tunable yield \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 conveniently adjusted to best economic size just by changing the length of the pressurized cryo-deuterium cylinder. The current CEC TN-72616 concept should sustainably produce the tritium needed shot to shot by collecting unburned tritium left in the reactor cavity from the last fusion mini-explosion. Inexpensive operation should be obtainable without requiring Lithium to breed tritium: using instead the recovered unburned tritium remnants of D-D fusion available after each shot to provide the tritium needed for future shots as the fusion reactor operates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Staying pure fusion with no fission initiator should help reduce regulatory obstacles and allow this hybrid fusion concept to be potentially used even in the 13 states that now have laws against building new reactors until an NRC approved approach to waste handling and storage is identified.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E A hybrid fusion reactor based on TN-72616 technology ignites on average one 250 GJ yield fusion device every minute - this does not leave a lot of time to pump down the reactor cavity (cylinder 11 meters diameter x 50 meters long) and prep the system for the next fusion burst. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E ICF Fusion reactor (proposal TN-72616) \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 \u003Ca href=\u0022http://bit.ly/1fTRJWY\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://bit.ly/1fTRJWY\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E TN-72616 pure fusion MSR hybrid reactor proposal is based on concepts first proposed by Professor Friedwardt Winterberg and Dr. Ralph Moir -\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CInertial Confinement Fusion Using Only Deuterium\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://home.comcast.net/~aeropharoh/Winterberg_ICF_deuterium.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://home.comcast.net/~aeropharoh/Winterberg_ICF_deuterium.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Dr. Ralph Moir \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CPACER Revisited\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 - \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.ralphmoir.com/pacer/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.ralphmoir.com/pacer/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Energy Longer than the earth has existed or the Sun will shine - \u003Ca href=\u0022https://goo.gl/XL534\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://goo.gl/XL534\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Documents relating to PACER fusion - \u003Ca href=\u0022https://goo.gl/ZKGuQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://goo.gl/ZKGuQ\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-22T07:35:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022phoenix_ca\u0022 data-cite=\u0022phoenix_ca\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESolar power is not economically viable in areas that are at high latitudes.
