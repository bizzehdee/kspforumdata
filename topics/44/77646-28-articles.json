Your common everday mirror with glas pane infront. The glas has the same temperature as your space craft and radiates the heat.

It is a pipe filled with a liquid. When heat is high the liquid evaporates, as the outer surface should be cooler than the core the liquid condenses on the wall and thereby transfers heat. This heat on the outer surface is then radiated into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird option is a heat sink. When you are in earth orbit, you will have shadow and sun cycles. So in worst case during a shadow phase you would even need heater not to freeze. Better is to use a heatl sink. Usual aluminium, as it is lightweight and has high heat capacity. If the surrounding is hotter than the sink it absorbs the heat, when the surrounding is cooler it gives of heat, leveling your temperature fluctuation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if your structure is made of aluminium fine, but maybe you need some more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is, I do not think you can not surpass the thermal calculations, because every components has certain heat capacities, absorption rates and every temperature changes influences the surroundings, so sooner or later somebody needs to tell the computer to do the math. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost universities have free licences for very expensive software (example ANSYS), you need somebody who knows how to use the software, provide a CAD model, have material properties and provide expected heat loads.
