The four outer F-1 engines detach early in flight and (in principle) are recovered, with the fifth, center sustainer F-1 carrying the vehicle the rest of the way to orbit. Payload estimates put it at somewhere around ~22,000 kg to 28-degree 200x200 km LEO, which is comparable with Shuttle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can find lots of \u0022cancelled\u0022 Saturn family rockets out there. Various contractors and organizations did a ton of design studies in the 60\u0027s and early 70\u0027s, trying to work out what could be done with the tech after Apollo. The silliness of the proposals ranged all over the place, from \u0022we strapped some solid boosters onto it\u0022 (e.g. Saturn IB-D)\u00A0 to things like the Saturn V-B.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
