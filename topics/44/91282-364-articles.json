Natural erosion processes also occur, even cracking stones in halves. Thus the ballast needs to be renewed or replaced periodically. Renewing includes filtering out undersize stones and adding fresh ballast to balance the lost amount. Some filtering machines use rubber beaters rotating at high speeds. Sufficiently large stones get thrown a small distance by the beaters while too small, lighter stones fly farther and are discarded beside the railbed. They should be caught and funneled down though, as big-ish rocks flying at high speeds in open areas are a safety risk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"darthgently","CreatedById":204885,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-25T11:12:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224410166\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002291282\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221721891322\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002276902\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022monophonic\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, monophonic said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbut no-one has been able to devise a treatment that makes wood survive even half as long buried in ground\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey should look into farming Black Locust trees for sleepers then.\u00A0 That wood will last over a century buried in wet ground with no additives and has about the same strength properties as oak (iirc)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"farmerben","CreatedById":190194,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-25T12:37:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224410234\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002291282\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221721905969\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204885\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022darthgently\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, darthgently said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey should look into farming Black Locust trees for sleepers then.\u00A0 That wood will last over a century buried in wet ground with no additives and has about the same strength properties as oak (iirc)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve got lots of Black Locust on my property.\u00A0 I love it.\u00A0 It is undoubtedly the best untreated wood for this purpose in North America.\u00A0 That said it does get crummy with age.\u00A0 I\u0027m not sure it lasts longer than creosote soaked wood.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever I\u00A0 doubt is steel reinforced concrete sleepers will last 100 years either.\u00A0 They tear up and rebuild automobile roads much more frequently than that.\u00A0 Fiberglass reinforcement might be better than steel from a longevity perspective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-25T15:42:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRebar made of spun basalt is a thing\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-25T18:24:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224410252\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002291282\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221721911058\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022190194\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022farmerben\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, farmerben said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFiberglass reinforcement might be better than steel from a longevity perspective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224410326\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002291282\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221721922136\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002289439\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022StrandedonEarth\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, StrandedonEarth said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRebar made of spun basalt is a thing\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile these are a thing, and I don\u0027t know the details of all the magic that goes into selecting rebar for concrete, the problem is matching thermal expansion coefficients. Typical value for concrete used in construction is about 10E-6 cm/cm/\u00B0C. Steel is usually a touch higher, but very close, and the two can be tuned relatively easily, so you can match rebar to concrete almost perfectly for pretty much every practical need.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGlass fibers tend to be closer to 5E-6 cm/cm/\u00B0C. There are, apparently, ways to bring down the thermal expansion coefficient of concrete closer to this value, but it\u0027s on a threshold and limits the kind of mixes you can use. I\u0027m sure there are use cases where the ability of the rebar to withstand corrosion are drastically more important than being picky with the concrete mix, but it\u0027s still important to keep in mind that it is a significant limitation. I have no idea if this is relevant to the railroad ties (sleepers), but if you\u0027re asking a question about, \u0022Why are they not using fiberglass for X?\u0022 this is often the cause. Cost is the other factor, of course, but less so when you\u0027re going for longevity builds, as you normally wouldn\u0027t use the cheapest steel rebar for these projects anyways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe are probably going to be seeing a shift away from steel for reinforcement as the time goes on, and we might abandon it entirely at some point in the future, but we\u0027re definitely not there yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"farmerben","CreatedById":190194,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-25T21:19:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem with steel rebar is that once oxygen or moisture gets in, it\u0027s game over.\u00A0 Rust expands and damages the rest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFerrocement boats use the best cement available.\u00A0 But these boats don\u0027t last forever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-07-25T22:03:46Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2024 10:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002217 hr\u0022\u003E17 hours ago\u003C/time\u003E by farmerben\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-26T03:25:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleable_iron\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleable_iron\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cast iron doesn\u0027t get rusted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"monophonic","CreatedById":76902,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-26T08:46:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224410234\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002291282\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221721905969\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204885\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022darthgently\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 hours ago, darthgently said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey should look into farming Black Locust trees for sleepers then.\u00A0 That wood will last over a century buried in wet ground with no additives and has about the same strength properties as oak (iirc)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFully buried in constantly wet terrain is no problem.
