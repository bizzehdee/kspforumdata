I have a design based on this principle please see this sound.wave@gm x. dotcom   Wesley 01.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E SSTO seem to me as possible if you use S/SM/E (s) and this stage principle which means you can still use three stages like stages in today\u0027s rockets but keep them inside. I have done the numbers and they seem indicate a comparable good SSTO vehicle. Thank you. Wesley 01.\n\u003E \n\nFalcon 9 is two stages only, think many of the smaller launchers are 2 stage too. Yes if you are going higher than LEO you will need an circulation burn too but this is always done with upper stage."},{"CreatedByName":"fredinno","CreatedById":143381,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-07T23:06:59Z","Content":"Oak\u0027s words echoed:\n\n\u0022There\u0027s a time and place for everything.\u0022\n\nThis is not the time for SSTOs."}]}
