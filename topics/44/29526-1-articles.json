This is an Occult philosophy, based on hermeticism (Hermeticism is older than christianity), and christians call hermeticism an heresy, for obvious reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my point is: The Evolution is older than Darwin, and the theory of evolution is totally side by side with most ocultic teachings...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if the church censored this kind of teaching for centuries, it\u0027s because its something they don\u0027t want ppl to know xD Just saying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you think i\u0027m making this all up, there are plenty of Rosicruxian books and foruns all around, and there are Lodges of the rosicruxian order in almost every country in the world (They look like Freemansons but are not, trust me!)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-27T14:47:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou realise there never was a Christian Rosenkreuz, and the manifestos are proven forgeries, right?

Evolution is mainly about speciation. Speciation is about small differences in anatomy leading to a difference in chances of survival and reproduction for those carrying the differences. Ultimately these differences become so great that the original species and the mutants can no longer interbreed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother difference between Rosicrucian theology or any theology and the theory of evolution is that theology makes declarative statements of truth without evidence and scientific theories make testable predictions of observable data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHermeticism is, as you stated, an occult philosopy meaning it is \u0022hidden\u0022 world view.
