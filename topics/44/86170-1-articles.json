AlcoLOX really isn\u0027t the best fuel mix, it was all they had in the early days, since the alcohol most commonly used is essentially a very high quality vodka (and Russian rocket techs reportedly used it for that purpose, too \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ) and LOX isn\u0027t anything new, either. Once they developed better, purpose-made mixtures, AlcoLOX became completely obsolete, though it recently resurfaced as a proposed RCS propellant for the PPTS, because it\u0027s still cheaper than KeroLOX (somehow, I don\u0027t think loading ethyl alcohol onto a Russian spacecraft is a good idea, though... Especially as an entry orientation propellant).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
