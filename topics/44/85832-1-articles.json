The confusion about centrifugal force stems entirely from first-year physics teachers. I mean, centrifugal force \u003Cem\u003Eobviously\u003C/em\u003E exists; you can experience it easily simply by spinning around and feeling the force that tends to lift your arms away from your sides. You could put a strain gauge or even a spring scale on a centrifuge and record how the force imparted by a mass resting on the scale increases with increasing angular velocity. What causes the spring to compress in the non-rotating frame is the reaction force that the mass exerts on the scale when then scale pushes on the mass to curve its path. And this very real reaction force has precisely the same magnitude as the centrifugal force in the rotating frame. So, in this case, the \u0027centrifugal\u0027 force is utterly real. Where it breaks down is when an object is not acting under centripetal acceleration and thus is not subject to reaction forces; it will appear to accelerate radially from within the rotating frame, but is either stationary or moving inertially in the non-rotating frame.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-03T17:38:20Z\u0022 title=\u002210/03/2014 05:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Mr Shifty\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-03T16:01:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tommygun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tommygun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFrom what I have read it\u0027s a weird American corruption of the word that started in the 19th century and just kept on going.\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not seen much outside of the US.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like it should go in the same bin as nucular.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EdFred","CreatedById":108599,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-03T18:13:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI always thought that was called inertia.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tommygun","CreatedById":41293,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-04T01:32:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WestAir\u0022 data-cite=\u0022WestAir\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve lived from the West Coast to the East Coast, and one of my jobs keeps me in earshot of something like 65,000 (new) Americans every day.
