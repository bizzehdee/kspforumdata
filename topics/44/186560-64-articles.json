Some pols like to talk that way, but the reality is that some programs get supported by Congress, then they will survive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConstellation was reasonably serious (I know a couple people who worked on it back in the day), but they had some serious issues getting the design to work\u2014and they were overlapping with the Shuttle program, that got a large chunk of budget to maintain. So in that sense SLS/Orion is more serious (they are in effect getting all the money that used to go to Shuttle), and since SLS/Orion are serious, Artemis is serious since SLS/Orion needs \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen again, there was/is the unrealistic goal of a 2024 Moon landing, which implies the program doesn\u0027t have serious (non-domestic political) motives behind it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not about an international peeing match, it\u0027s a thing that exists (SLS/Orion) and since NASA \u003Cem\u003Emust\u003C/em\u003E fly it, it might as well do something.
