A few years later someone did a few calculations and realized that you don\u0027t actually NEED to model every atom in the universe. Think of it a bit like The Sims.

The idea was that the universe only renders macro-scale objects until there is a reason to go smaller. IE, the computer only models atoms when you are somehow directly observing them.
