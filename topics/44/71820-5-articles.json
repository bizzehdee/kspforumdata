What it was: a resonant cavity WITHOUT slots cut into one of the ends to produce asymmetric refractive indexes for the microwaves. They still passed appropriately-tuned (resonant frequency) microwaves through the specially-designed metal cavity in both versions of the device.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe necessity of these slots was the basis of some controversy- the original British inventor of the drive thought they weren\u0027t necessary, whereas the American (Fetta) who produced his own, slightly re-designed and re-named (\u0022Cannae\u0022) version of the originally British EmDrive drive design included these slots- as he thought they would be necessary for the drive to work with some of the other modifications he made to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe differences between the British version of the drive tested in China and the American version tested in China could easily explain the thousand-fold difference in observed thrust between the two experiments.

The underlying drive appears to work perfectly well in either circumstance- which is what so many people who didn\u0027t do their research properly before writing criticisms of the drive wrongfully interpreted as \u0022both the null and functional versions of the drive producing thrust\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m more concerned (and you should be more concerned) about the fact that they didn\u0027t perform the test in a vacuum.

There\u0027s nothing unconventional or unproven about the measuring equipment- there\u0027s a reason NASA had the equipment in the first place (it works).\u003Cp\u003EAide from criticizing the motivation of the scientists themselves on rather fuzzy logic, the only REAL criticism is that the \u0022null\u0022 and \u0022experimental\u0022 devices both produced thrust- a criticism that popped up once on the internet, and seems to have been mirrored many times since.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, what the people making that criticism did NOT understand, is that the \u0022modification\u0022 (slots/roughening on the end of the device) was controversial in the first place. While Fetta (the American scientist to build HIS OWN version of the EmDrive and re-name it the \u0022Cannae Drive\u0022) included these slots, and thought they were necessary, other previous versions of the drive included no such slots, and appeared to work perfectly fine. Thus, the \u0022null\u0022 version of the drive (the use of the term null comes mainly from the critics, not the article itself) was not actually a null-version. It was an alternative, simpler version of the drive that was proven to work just as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ACTUAL null version of the drive was the \u0022RF load\u0022 the abstract of the data talks about. THIS TEST was an actual null version of the drive designed to replicate the same electricity consumption, RF frequency emissions, etc., and produced no thrust- thus validating the test of thrust production.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing an actual scientist in real-life, with experience in an equally controversial area of research (Stem Cell Research- you could actually find my name in the scientific literature if you knew my real last name...), I can tell you from stories I\u0027ve heard from a number of professors that critics have an extreme tendency to twist the words in your abstract to mean things they were never meant to mean. One little ambiguity, and it will be taken as proof that nothing you say is valid, if the reader doesn\u0027t want to believe your data/results. This is a VERY good reason to take the criticism with a grain of salt, just as the critics are taking the abstract with a whole boat-load of it...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the input (didn\u0027t knew there\u0027re some other version of the engine) - I did also amazed by some other papers regarding high-energy lasers and a form of inverse-square law that doesn\u0027t really fit what I know. Well, still a high school student... But safe to say they didn\u0027t ensure that it will works in vacuum. Although the test is conducted in a vacuum chamber, the fact is that even they had closed the door, they kept the inside of it at ambient pressure and temperature. Surprise.

Exactly how they do that tends to be different though. The description I remembered from Harold White\u0027s version was that they were going to have a capacitor that was oscilatting back and forth (physically). It moves to the front of the ship, gets charged, moves to the back, discharging as it does, then moves back to the front. While the capacitor is charged it is able to \u0027exert force on the virtual particles\u0027 but because it is not charged when the capacitor moves forward, there is a force imbalance that you can consider \u0027forward thrust\u0027. Normally if you move a mass back and forth in space all you do is move your ship back and forth slightly. For all intents and purposes (this is a pseudo metaphor, not an actual explanation) while charged, because of the interactions with virtual, the capacitor can be thought of as being \u0022heavier\u0022 than it is when discharged.
