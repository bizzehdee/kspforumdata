The day becoming dark during an eclipse effect really only happens during totality when the sun is completely blocked. Here\u0027s a video that shows the change in light level during ~85% eclipse quite nicely:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/IFaZ3q6BXSo?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So many cool images by you guys. =)\n\u003E That\u0027s a good question. My camera settings for the direct eclipse photographing was:\n\u003E \n\u003E F-stop: f/27\n\u003E \n\u003E Exposure time: 1/4000. sec.\n\u003E \n\u003E ISO: 100\n\u003E \n\u003E So in my case the camera received as minimal with light as technically possible without resorting to any solar filtering... in fact I didn\u0027t even have any filters at all. Was afraid if I tried experimenting with any longer exposures multiple times in a row it\u0027d risk damaging the sensor. The region was mostly covered by heavy clouding, but there was some moderately clouded patches that allowed me to photograph the event.\n\u003E \n\u003E Probably will a picture of the then just recently peeking Sun give an idea about the scenario:\n\nWhat kind of camera did you use? If the lens is pointed at the sun it doesn\u0027t really even matter if you\u0027re taking a picture or not, the lens is focusing sun\u0027s light into the camera all the time anyway, and if it\u0027s not a mirror/ovf camera or you\u0027re using live view on one, the light is being continuously focused on the sensor through the lens\u0027 maximum F-stop. And if it is a mirror camera, the light is focused to the focusing screen in the optical viewfinder assembly. Usually, this does not cause problems unless a long focal length lens is pointed at the sun; think of taking a landscape photo with a wide angle lens, if taking such a picture with the sun in the frame fried the camera we\u0027d all have cooked cameras ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) Small sensor cameras usually have very small physical apertures in their lenses, like a couple millimeters wide. With a bigger lens or telescope the physical aperture can be a hundred times larger in diameter and then the whole ordeal becomes a different story.\n\nIf you\u0027re at all interested in observing \u0026 photographing the sun, eclipsed or not, I highly recommend purchasing a sheet of filter film such as baader astrosolar - an A4 size piece costs like 15\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C2\u00AC and is enough to make half a dozen camera lens filters, a couple pairs of goggles and still have some left over. Beats welding glasses or any silly diy filters like soot-stained glass in both safety and optical quality anytime and really isn\u0027t expensive.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-22T10:43:16Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2015 10:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by kurja**"},{"CreatedByName":"Space Viking","CreatedById":92569,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T21:57:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Here\u0027s a video that shows the change in light level during ~85% eclipse quite nicely:\n\u003E -vid-\n\nWow, really cool!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E What kind of camera did you use?

I did consider in a retrospect if the sensor would fry while using the original objective with a max focal length of 55 mm, It would have happened long ago already.
