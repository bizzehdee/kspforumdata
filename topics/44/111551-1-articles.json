I\u0027ve read that neither instrument can really detect \u0022any\u0022 element, and I know they don\u0027t work differently but I\u0027ve read that an APXS can only detect around 20 different elements. \n\nAnyway, I was hoping maybe someone could shed some light on this? Or point me to the right place to find this information?"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T08:15:03Z","Content":"According to [NASA](https://pds.nasa.gov/ds-view/pds/viewInstrumentProfile.jsp?INSTRUMENT_ID=GRAND\u0026INSTRUMENT_HOST_ID=DAWN), GRaND can detect \u0022major, rock forming elements, such as O, Mg, Si, Al, Ca, Ti, and Fe; incompatible elements, including K and Th, detected by gamma ray emissions from the decay of long-lived radioisotopes; and H, C, N, and Cl, which are constituents of ices and products of aqueous alteration of silicate minerals.\u0022\n\nSo most, if not all, of the elements you\u0027d be interested in and you could perhaps infer the presence of some simple compounds too. That NASA page includes a pretty decent summary of the science behind GRaND too.\n\nAlpha Proton X-Ray Spectrometers can be used to detect elements heavier than fluorine via [particle induced X-ray emission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle-induced_X-ray_emission). They can also detect elements via [Rutherford backscattering spectrometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_backscattering_spectrometry) and I would expect heavier elements to be easier to detect by RBS than lighter elements."}]}
