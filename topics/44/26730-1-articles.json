NASA is politically limited to an insufficient budget to do anything truly innovative (and organizationally limited, culturally stagnant, operationally and bureaucratically stuck in large aerospace corporation mode). In all likelihood SLS will be cancelled and replaced by a private launch services contract sometime around 2016.

HOWEVA! We do have all of the technology for this available to us right now. The only thing I\u0027m not sure about would be communicating through the ice to the surface (and then to an orbiter... and then home...). The obvious solution of leaving a wire behind you would be heavy (3 to 16 miles long!), as well as easily disrupted by a single icequake on Europa (we don\u0027t know how stable the ice is, but it is covered in huge cracks). If the sub is powered by a nuclear reactor instead of just RTGs, it should have plenty of power for very strong, ice-penetrating radar which could be used to communicate with the orbiter (maybe?). That, to me, is the biggest challenge. Most of the other problems are solved if we can simply use a small nuclear reactor on board.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T10:41:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scotius\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Scotius\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EActive cooperation between SpaceX, Bigelow and Ad Astra would be pretty cool.
