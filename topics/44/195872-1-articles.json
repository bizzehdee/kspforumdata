That part of a reply was more of an \u0022what if?\u0022 What\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eif\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0something provided a gentle push to slowly raise Moon out of Earth\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E? It doesn\u0027t look to me like we\u0027d have collision risk for a good while after that. Instead, Earth and Moon will occupy the same orbit around the Sun, with moon going to slightly higher or slightly lower orbit during each approach, resulting in a planetary game of tag. Like I said, we see it with Janus/Epimetheus. Though, masses of these two are more similar, and they are moons. So maybe perturbations on Earth/Moon dynamic will be stronger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027d be kind of an amazing setup if it can be stable, though. To have another planetary body that\u0027s within almost as easy of a reach as Moon is now for a few decades out of a few centuries, and then being harder to get to than Mars for the rest of that time span, because it\u0027s effectively on the same orbit on the other side of the Sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fact that we don\u0027t see these arrangements more often does suggest that it won\u0027t be\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0stable, of course. But a few million years is an instant when we\u0027re talking about billions of years over which star systems evolve, and it\u0027s still a huge amount of time on civilization scale. There\u0027s probably a planet out there with population that\u0027s looking at the former moon coming in for another close approach going, \u0022Now! Now is our chance to go there and plant a flag on it!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow much C3 does it take to inject into an elliptical solar orbit with a period of half a year, bounding case?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m away from my orbital parameters spreadsheet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
