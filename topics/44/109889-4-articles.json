What can possibly go wrong when you\u0027re ignorantly arguing about matter-antimatter rocket with a particle physicist?\n\nEven taking into consideration the lepton production, with bulk of losses caused by \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00BC\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00BC\u0027 production, you can still get almost 99% of the impulse. In other words, I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E is still closer to .25 c/g than .24 c/g.\n\nee\u0027 and \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00BC\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00BC\u0027 production is also the reason that you really can get up to 0.6 c/g using superconductor magnets. This isn\u0027t fiction. It\u0027s simple, high school physics. Now, TWR in that scheme is going to absolutely suck given current technology, so what we have isn\u0027t practical for interstellar. But this is why I\u0027m pointing out that we can probably get higher thrust in the future.\n\nBut going back to simply having a led damper and a plasma injector, which is not just something we can build, but something we have built, the TWR is limited by your ability to absorb and radiate heat. Since we\u0027re looking at over 2 decades in transit anyhow, acceleration of 0.1m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 is more than sufficient. That means we need to dissipate 30MW of power per 1kg of mass. At 3,000K, this is trivially accomplished by about 7m\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 of radiator surface. Tungsten wire with sufficient surface area will take up a tiny fraction of the mass. Similarly, led damper (in thin tungsten shell - molten led is just as good at absorbing radiation) has constant thickness regardless of thrust, so it does not really add to the payload.\n\nThe only part of ship\u0027s construction that\u0027s going to eat into your useful payload is the anti-matter storage tanks. And that becomes less and less significant for larger ships.\n\nLong story short, there is absolutely nothing to prevent us from building an interstellar matter-antimatter powered ship with effective I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E very close to 0.25 c/g other than antimatter supply problem.\n\nBut hey, I\u0027m sure that won\u0027t stop you from making up more numbers to convince yourself that you\u0027re still right."},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T14:59:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Indeed, the 4 designs I linked are all very massive and would require hundreds of launches - and billions of dollars - to construct.

So what\u0027s your solution? How do you think solar sails can achieve interstellar speeds?\n\nYeah, does calculation was already done it by many researchers, like mattoff, zubrin, adam crowl, etc. Each one with different parameters on sail density and sun periapsys.\n\n[http://crowlspace.com/?p=1882](http://crowlspace.com/?p=1882)\n\n[http://crowlspace.com/?p=1585](http://crowlspace.com/?p=1585)\n\n[http://nextbigfuture.com/2013/02/carbon-nanotube-sheets-for-solar-sails.html](http://nextbigfuture.com/2013/02/carbon-nanotube-sheets-for-solar-sails.html)\n\nWith CNT or graphene, temperature is not an issue no matter how close you want to be, first because graphene can stand 3000 degrees, at that temperature even if you absorb all the radiation (which you dont, because the surface is reflective), you will be able to release the same amount as heat.\n\nThe things that limit how much you may close to the sun are:\n\n-if you are too low, you should dodge the magnetic fields (mainly black spots).\n\n-sun atmosphere, it will not decelerate, but the particles may damage the sail or instruments.\n\n-acceleration (g-force) This may be the main concern.\n\nAcceleration is a problem for humans because is not constant in each atom of our bodies (with the gravity field exception).\n\nA solar sail by other hand, as it can be visualize as a 2d structure, all atoms are under the same acceleration, so in theory should not be a problem.\n\nAdam crowl calculation with lower densities than mines using quarter wave CNT:\n\nAt 0.0045 Au, the acceleration is 8000 G aprox, 0.11c max speed \n\nAt 0.019 something as 1000 G aprox, 0.056c max speed.\n\nLets imagine that one small part of the sail is 1% less reflective than the average.\n\n95% to 94%.\n\nDensity: 0.01g/m2\n\nPeriapsys: 0.007 au.\n\nPower by m2 at periapsys: 1360w \\* (1 / 0.007)^2^ = 27877551 w/m2\n\nForce by m2: 2\\*27877551/c = 0.18 N (95% aprox) --\u003E 94%? --\u003E 0.18N - (0.49% because the force is absortion \u002B reflection) = 0,179N\n\nAcceleration 95% reflection: 0.18N / 0.00001kg = 1800 G --\u003E94%? --\u003E 1790 G\n\nSo we have 10G of difference between sail sections, So the real speed limit for a solar sail depends in how average is the reflectivity and the mass distribution.\n\nIf we add the strenght of graphene plus my idea to active mass distribution and control with magnetic rails and superconductors may be possible.\n\nThe superconductors will be in the sail shadow, and they will be reflective. Not sure how to get and keep the power needed to manage the magnetic rails. \n\n**A different method to keep the acceleration constant for longer time once we gain distance:** \n\n(the angles will be different of course in direction of our prograde at periapsys)\n\n![multiple_bounce_sail_acceleration.jpg](http://s21.postimg.org/49ggm8p3r/multiple_bounce_sail_acceleration.jpg)\n\nYou launch a heavy solar sail that goes to jupiter, use gravity assist and returns to the sun at high speed, that sail will reflect and bounce (for longer time because it has speed) the radiation that receive the sail probe multiplying the force depending the number of bounce you achieve, we can add extra solar sails at the side to increase the radiation over the probe.\n\nThe first sails does not steal energy (shadow) to the sail probe because the sun is so big in comparison that it will not matter."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T01:05:11Z","Content":"Let me just ask:\n\nWhat does a starship need?"},{"CreatedByName":"baggers","CreatedById":143067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T01:09:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Let me just ask:\n\u003E What does a starship need?\n\nLet\u0027s be precise:\n\nWhat sort of starship?"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T01:12:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Let\u0027s be precise:\n\u003E What sort of starship?\n\nJust a general starship.\n\nLet\u0027s say one that can get to another star within a human lifetime."},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T02:40:53Z","Content":"Every probe we\u0027ve sent on a solar escape trajectory so far is technically a starship.\n\nIf we\u0027re talking about getting to a nearby star in a human lifespan, aside from the \u0022basic\u0022 systems of a spacecraft, you need a propulsion method to get you to at least 5% of the speed of light (Alpha Centauri, almost 100 years of flight at that speed), as well as some way to power the craft for duration of the trip.
