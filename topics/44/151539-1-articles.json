With this material, you could make some really fancy stuff...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut considering an air-breather for the moment:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThermodynamics starts to set a hard ceiling. Essentially, the faster your regime, the hotter the air entering the combustion process -\u00A0simply by being compressed by the passage of the craft,\u00A0apart from any required compression within the engine. The hotter the air incoming, the more energy you have to dump into it in order to get a decent expansion and extract work, and as you get faster, chemical combustion stops being able to provide enough energy to raise the temperature of incoming air very much. At this point we are in or near the regime where we are talking about temperatures that will ionise atoms and split molecules apart, so even getting combustion to *work* gets harder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are also issues involved with the fact that your aircraft will now be travelling around as fast as molecules in a reaction, which makes sustaining combustion even harder, possibly can be tackled with fancy engineering, though anything that adds even a hair of drag is going to be dragging that ceiling down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is where SABRE engines generate a significant part of their benefit - even though they (nor any other engine) do not operate anywhere near these limiting conditions - by cooling incoming air you are increasing the amount of work that can be done by the engine for a given core temperature. (SABRE also gets benefit from not having to operate at limit-conditions, so lighter metals can be used in construction, significantly benefiting its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo even if you had a perfectly heat-resistant scramjet (which also needs to be lightweight and assuming you have solved the supersonic combustion problem itself) you will still hit a limit set by the amount of energy that can be stored in chemical bonds. You might find some new exotic fuel that gives you a few more joules per oxygen molecule burned, but it will only be incremental benefits.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-07T17:06:05Z\u0022 title=\u002211/07/2016 05:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by p1t1o\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-07T19:48:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222839388\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022151539\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221478346615\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002225468\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SargeRho\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 11/5/2016 at 7:50 AM, SargeRho said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as I know, High-Bypass turbofans, that\u0027s the ones used by passenger aircraft, stop working at the speed of sound, Jet Fighters use low-bypass turbofans, or turbojets, and have specially shaped intakes, and intake flaps to slow down the incoming air.
