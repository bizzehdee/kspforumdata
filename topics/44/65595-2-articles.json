Something along the lines of what they have now and what Darpa is developing. Basically a suit that can allow a soldier to do basic tasks that require much more strength than a human can provide. They already have these for industrial applications, but I think they could be scaled up (I\u0027m thinking along the lines of Ripley\u0027s Loader in Aliens). If one could be made mobile enough to keep up with infantry, it could provide a lot of advantages in an urban combat setting. (Clearing debris, carrying heavier objects, easier 2nd floor access, improvised building entrance, etc.) It wouldn\u0027t be armed, or if it was, would just have a small arms.
