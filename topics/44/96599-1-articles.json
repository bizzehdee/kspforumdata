The amount of salt in our oceans is only enough to lower the freezing point by about 2 degrees centigrade. This combined with density effects definitely affects our climate, but it\u0027s not required for planetary habitability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat really stops the oceans from freezing is the fact that water ice (at least ice Ih, which is the phase encountered at temperatures and pressures found on Earth\u0027s surface) is less dense than liquid water, making the oceans take much, MUCH longer to freeze than if sea ice sank and exposed the warmest water on the top of the water column.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is, however, an effect where fresh water has a density maximum at 4-5 *C above freezing, which effectively prevents ice from forming on freshwater until the entire water column is that cold. This is not the case for seawater, which is densest at its freezing point. This makes it even harder to get bodies of freshwater down to 0 *C, but as mentioned saltwater has a lower freezing point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese phenomena almost certainly have huge effects on the pattern of currents in our oceans, but Earth is warm enough that our oceans would remain liquid at basically any salinity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T03:47:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe difference in gravitational acceleration caused by our Moon across the diameter of the Earth is about 2.2x10\u003Csup\u003E-6\u003C/sup\u003E (which is about twice the value caused by our Sun).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe difference in gravitational acceleration caused by Vall across the diameter of the Laythe during closest approach is about 1.02x10\u003Csup\u003E-4\u003C/sup\u003E ...which is about 46 times larger than the Moon\u0027s tides on the Earth. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe difference in gravitational acceleration caused by Tylo across the diameter of the Laythe during closest approach is about 8.01x10\u003Csup\u003E-5\u003C/sup\u003E ...which is about 36 times larger than the Moon\u0027s tides on the Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo things would be REALLY fun on Laythe if Vall and Tylo align in the sky opposite Jool (but if Squad has the orbital resonances of Laythe, Vall, and Tylo set up the same way as Io, Europa, and Ganymede, then Vall and Tylo could never both be in opposition to Jool at the same time, so the worst-case scenario could not occur).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/B0oB86b.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022B0oB86b.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that tides in Laythe\u0027s oceans would not be like the high/low tides we see on Earth. On Earth, the oceans bulge upward on the sides of the Earth facing toward and away from the Moon (let\u0027s ignore the solar tides for now...also, the tidal bulges do not face directly toward or away from the direction of the Moon because the rotation of the Earth carries them to an equilibrium position off to the side of the direct Earth-Moon line). Places on Earth experience high and low tides as the Earth\u0027s rotation carries those places through the tidal bulges and the low tide areas 90 degrees from the bulges. The alignment line of the bulges slowly shifts as our Moon moves in its orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Laythe, which is tidally locked to Jool, the highest tide bulges would form (during oppositions of Vall and Tylo; opposition relative to Jool, that is...when each moon is directly opposite from Jool in the sky of Laythe) at the same places on Laythe all the time: the sub-Jool location and the spot 180 degrees away from Jool. The belt on Laythe 90 degrees away from the Jool-Laythe line would only experience massive LOW tides during oppositions with Vall and Tylo. This belt of lowest tides runs all the way around Laythe from the north pole, to the forward facing point relative to Laythe\u0027s orbital motion on Laythe\u0027s equator, to the south pole, and back up through the equator at the trailing point. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe high tide points will move from east to west along Laythe\u0027s equator as the outer moons approach opposition, but they\u0027ll grow to their maximum size quite quickly at the points directly toward and away from Jool when the outer moon passes through opposition.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-14T09:31:26Z\u0022 title=\u002201/14/2015 09:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Brotoro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T07:28:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf Laythe was real.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would go crazy.
