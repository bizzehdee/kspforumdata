Plus, assuming the silk stretches to its maximum, a stopping distance, it will be a fall of about the height of the Eiffel Tower. The impact force on the silk rope as they slow down would be about 35 times their weight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#333333;font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\nWhich is about six times greater force than when Spidey is just hanging around on the end of his line of silk. But taking into account the length of the fall (240m) and the extra force, he will need 1.3 kg of silk to catch his fall.

You cant build a machine out of bricks, that can\u00A0manipulate objects much smaller than bricks. I can see micro-suckers or gecko setae as a solution to this though)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this creature going to have bones and muscles?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe gecko stuff - this could introduce interesting complications around how different materials interact with the electrostatic function of the gripping surfaces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh yes it has bones and muscles, looks human, just the skin and hair are colors humans don\u0027t have.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the suction plates, good idea. If mini enough, they could be used to manipulate small items much like fingers, even delicate stuff like tweezers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOctopus suckers are very flexible, and the alien ones could be smaller with the added feature of full 360 rotation for ALL suckers, being able to choose selectively which ones and how, besides the sucker pinching that octopuses already have IRL.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis allows for them to use the suckers to rotate an item on their palm or even stand it upright, all without using their thumb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood ideas! You helped salvage an idea I was gonna regretfully scrap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow with these mods the mitt can at leasr compete with the human hand, besides beibg superior for climbing walls (greater surfae area/suction/adhesive fluid optional).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main problem will be flossing their teeth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be a proper nightmare. Unless they all have bad breath due to not flossing, or perhaps their mouth and tooth bones are nore acid resistant and regrow their whole lifetime if broken? Perhaps they just swish acid in their mouth and spit to clean between the teeth?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps the feature comes in built, which means yes they can spit acid if they want, used primarily forcleaning hard to reach places in the mouth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-02-27T12:14:40Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2020 12:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
