The wings are less efficient than a simple tube for carrying fuel, the extra drag of wings/tail(s)/control surfaces would also increase the required delta-v to get into orbit, a complex winged body seems more difficult (and thus expensive) to design than a simpler rocket (especially because space planes are usually designed to take a more shallow trajectory, and thus spend more time in atmosphere, where aerodynamic stresses could create issues), the shallower trajectory seems less efficient than a rocket\u0027s (again, more delta-v), and the use of multiple kinds of engines (either on separate aircraft (SpaceShip One), separate locations on the same plane (i.e. a space plane with a set of turbojets and a set of rockets), or combined into a single \u0022engine\u0022 (i.e. Skylon)) would seem to increase complexity, and thus costs. Also, with a multi-vehicle design (SpaceShip One), the use of two different vehicles would probably increase launch costs and require a larger crew to control both craft (again, this would lead to greater costs), and could increase the cost of infrastructure. Finally, most space plane designs I\u0027ve seen have lower payloads to LEO than rockets (especially compared to beasts such as the Falcon Heavy), which would seem to prevent them from realizing economies of scale as effectively as heavy-lift vehicles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, this is just what seems to be the case from my point of view. To me, space planes would seem to be less efficient, more costly, and more complex than rockets. Of course, there are several rocket designers with much more aerospace knowledge than me looking at building space planes, so I\u0027m not so sure I\u0027m correct.

This enables the usage of engines with TWR of less than 1, but far more efficient. Plus, VTVL rockets need a horizontal component to their velocity to reach orbital speed (hence the gravity turn), otherwise they would fall back to Terra.

The problem is, as you said, maintenance and infrastructure will be the most important factor in a reusable launch vehicle. The thing is, currently getting permission to use an NTR in space would be extremely difficult. Using one in atmo, particularly one that had already been through the stresses of launch and reentry, would probably require the vehicle\u0027s operator to take the entire engine a part and inspect every piece with a microscope between flights, if it was allowed at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGas-core reactors?

It\u0027s inaccurate to compare it to chemical rockets; such a design would most likely be competing with space elevators, railguns, or beamed power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA chemical-rocket-only SSTO is certainly possible; many first stages could in theory be turned into one. The problem is, the payload fractions would be awful, and the vehicle would still be expendable, so a multi-stage rocket ends up actually being cheaper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA reusable rocket-only SSTO is either impossible or would have such a low payload fraction that despite its simplicity, air-breathing SSTOs and multi-stage reusable rockets would mop the floor with it. Consider the following: with an ISP of 465 (near the upper limit for hydrogen) and a dV of 10 km/s (that extra 500 m/s is for landing and orbital manuevers, assuming you use parachutes or wings and therefore only need a few tens of m/s for landing) needs to have a wet:dry mass ratio of 9. The space shuttle orbiter and external tank have a wet:dry ratio of only about 6.4, and that\u0027s with the fuel tank being thrown away. Using dense fuels would make the vehicle slightly less painful to heatshield, but your mass ratio requirements become higher: for an ISP of 340 s, about what you\u0027d get for kerolox using high-performance engines, you would need a mass ratio of 20! The Falcon 9 v1.1 first stage barely beats that, and it\u0027s only designed to survive reentry from less than half orbital speed.
