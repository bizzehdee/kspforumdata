my fairly well informed opinion that Space Elevators are a horrible, no good, very bad idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, there are details I don\u0027t know. \u00A0But I feel that the facts I do know are so damning to outweigh any positive element that could be proposed. \u00A0Here\u0027s what I think I know :\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. \u00A0The elevator cable has to be at\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eleast\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E35,786\u00A0kilometers long. \u00A0This means if there is a break\u00A0anywhere on this cable, the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eentire apparatus\u00A0is destroyed.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E2. \u00A0\u003C/em\u003EThe elevator cable has to somehow be launched from a rocket while unspooling in flight, and it needs to mass thousands of tons in total. \u00A0This means if it\u0027s lost, it will not be cheap to replace. \u00A0(I understand that the first rocket launches a \u0022leader\u0022 cable that is reasonable in amss\u00A0and then you would have to add additional cables to the bundle by having climbers carry them)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. \u00A0The cable is under so much structural stress that the only proposed material that is plausible are extremely long\u00A0carbon nanotubes and extremely strong bonding between the separate molecules\u00A0to prevent them from delaminating. \u00A0 Oh, and it needs to be flexible so you can spool it as well...It can\u0027t just meet the strength requirements, it has to be flexible, resistant to external wear, manufacturable for a cost you can afford, and have enough longevity to last decades... \u00A0It\u0027s one thing to ask material scientists for unobtanium. \u00A0It\u0027s another to ask for 5 more desirable characteristics when the first one is already just a hair less than impossible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. \u00A0Due to 4, you need 35,786 continuous kilometers made to near nanoscale perfection. \u00A0Any flaw could potentially result in a catastrophic failure. \u00A0There won\u0027t really be any other commercial use for elevator length cables, so you\u0027re talking about creating an entire industry of R\u0026amp;D and engineering and factories just to manufacture these things. \u00A0A product that has to be perfect costs exponentially more than a product that has a moderate acceptable failure rate. \u00A0This is why Xboxes cost a tiny fraction of the cost of the same capacity computer in a missile. \u00A0(and actually no missile has nearly that much processing power or memory)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. \u00A0Currently, the entire energy of orbit flight is supposed to be beamed to the elevator cable using lasers on the ground. \u00A0Solar cells can only be so light, so the transit car crawls it\u0027s way up. \u00A0This is horrible for 2 reasons\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0a. \u00A0An elevator represents an immense capital asset, probably hundreds of billions of dollars. \u00A0Yet since the cars can only crawl up over a period of days, it means you are not getting that much payload into orbit for your money per day. \u00A0Like any asset, it depreciates and the elevator will need to be replaced, so for it to be worth it, it needs to deliver more payload than the same money could buy in mass produced conventional rockets. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 b. \u00A0The climber cars put mechanical wear on the cable surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. \u00A0Even optimist economics of something like an elevator or laser launch are only cheap if there is large launch volume. \u00A0But space, as an economic endeavor, isn\u0027t profitable for large volumes. \u00A0Once you have enough communication satellites to saturate all the available RF spectrum, and enough spy and weather monitoring satellites to meet everyone\u0027s need, there isn\u0027t actually much market for space travel. \u00A0There is no evidence that low gravity manufacturing will \u003Cem\u003Eever \u003C/em\u003Ebe better than machines on earth. \u00A0Raw materials are too expensive to recover\u00A0- retrieving enough platinum to pay for an asteroid redirect mission would crash the market price for platinum....(note I do think it will eventually be worth it, but you need self replicating machines so that you only need to launch a factory massing a few thousand tons and it then copies itself with asteroid or lunar mined material thereafter. \u00A0That is radically advanced technology of the future. \u00A0And, if you had self replicating machines, you still might not build elevators. \u00A0You could instead build an array of thousands of automated factories making big dumb boosters in parallel...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7. \u00A0A space elevator, a national asset worth hundreds of billions of dollars, needs a single purposeful break to fail. \u00A0A single missile, launched by a rival nation state or terrorists, need only break it at a single point to cause it to snap. \u00A0\u003Cem\u003EProbably \u003C/em\u003Ethe pieces wouldn\u0027t be dangerous to people on the ground, but it\u0027s essentially a financial asset that is indefensible (it can\u0027t move or hide\u00A0itself, missiles can be stealthed with radar absorbing materials\u00A0so you can\u0027t see them incoming) that is trivial to destroy. \u00A0(a 1-10 million missile knocks out hundreds of billions of elevator cable)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf a missile sounds too unlikely, keep in mind a simple shaped charge against the cable is enough. \u00A0That in turn means security and near strip searches of anyone permitted near the cable, which reduces the economic value of it because of all these costs and delays...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, TLDR, I don\u0027t see why anyone ever wasted any time on the space elevator as a concept. \u00A0It fails the most basic analysis of feasibility. \u00A0There are other ways to reach space, and some of those ways could be potentially made very cheap with advanced technology.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan

Only one point of the cable is stationary (the one 36.000km up), the rest (below) wants to go ahead, parts farther out stay behind. So you either keep it under tension with some sort of engines or with a heavy part farther out, but these would tend to stay behind and so come down rather quickly .... or the weight has to be accelerated all the time.

on this cable, the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eentire apparatus\u00A0is destroyed.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E2. \u00A0\u003C/em\u003EThe elevator cable has to somehow be launched from a rocket while unspooling in flight, and it needs to mass thousands of tons in total. \u00A0This means if it\u0027s lost, it will not be cheap to replace. \u00A0(I understand that the first rocket launches a \u0022leader\u0022 cable that is reasonable in amss\u00A0and then you would have to add additional cables to the bundle by having climbers carry them)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. \u00A0The cable is under so much structural stress that the only proposed material that is plausible are extremely long\u00A0carbon nanotubes and extremely strong bonding between the separate molecules\u00A0to prevent them from delaminating. \u00A0 Oh, and it needs to be flexible so you can spool it as well...It can\u0027t just meet the strength requirements, it has to be flexible, resistant to external wear, manufacturable for a cost you can afford, and have enough longevity to last decades... \u00A0It\u0027s one thing to ask material scientists for unobtanium. \u00A0It\u0027s another to ask for 5 more desirable characteristics when the first one is already just a hair less than impossible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. \u00A0Due to 4, you need 35,786 continuous kilometers made to near nanoscale perfection. \u00A0Any flaw could potentially result in a catastrophic failure. \u00A0There won\u0027t really be any other commercial use for elevator length cables, so you\u0027re talking about creating an entire industry of R\u0026amp;D and engineering and factories just to manufacture these things. \u00A0A product that has to be perfect costs exponentially more than a product that has a moderate acceptable failure rate. \u00A0This is why Xboxes cost a tiny fraction of the cost of the same capacity computer in a missile. \u00A0(and actually no missile has nearly that much processing power or memory)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. \u00A0Currently, the entire energy of orbit flight is supposed to be beamed to the elevator cable using lasers on the ground. \u00A0Solar cells can only be so light, so the transit car crawls it\u0027s way up. \u00A0This is horrible for 2 reasons\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0a. \u00A0An elevator represents an immense capital asset, probably hundreds of billions of dollars. \u00A0Yet since the cars can only crawl up over a period of days, it means you are not getting that much payload into orbit for your money per day. \u00A0Like any asset, it depreciates and the elevator will need to be replaced, so for it to be worth it, it needs to deliver more payload than the same money could buy in mass produced conventional rockets. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 b. \u00A0The climber cars put mechanical wear on the cable surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. \u00A0Even optimist economics of something like an elevator or laser launch are only cheap if there is large launch volume. \u00A0But space, as an economic endeavor, isn\u0027t profitable for large volumes. \u00A0Once you have enough communication satellites to saturate all the available RF spectrum, and enough spy and weather monitoring satellites to meet everyone\u0027s need, there isn\u0027t actually much market for space travel. \u00A0There is no evidence that low gravity manufacturing will \u003Cem\u003Eever \u003C/em\u003Ebe better than machines on earth. \u00A0Raw materials are too expensive to recover\u00A0- retrieving enough platinum to pay for an asteroid redirect mission would crash the market price for platinum....(note I do think it will eventually be worth it, but you need self replicating machines so that you only need to launch a factory massing a few thousand tons and it then copies itself with asteroid or lunar mined material thereafter. \u00A0That is radically advanced technology of the future. \u00A0And, if you had self replicating machines, you still might not build elevators. \u00A0You could instead build an array of thousands of automated factories making big dumb boosters in parallel...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7. \u00A0A space elevator, a national asset worth hundreds of billions of dollars, needs a single purposeful break to fail. \u00A0A single missile, launched by a rival nation state or terrorists, need only break it at a single point to cause it to snap. \u00A0\u003Cem\u003EProbably \u003C/em\u003Ethe pieces wouldn\u0027t be dangerous to people on the ground, but it\u0027s essentially a financial asset that is indefensible (it can\u0027t move or hide\u00A0itself, missiles can be stealthed with radar absorbing materials\u00A0so you can\u0027t see them incoming) that is trivial to destroy. \u00A0(a 1-10 million missile knocks out hundreds of billions of elevator cable)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf a missile sounds too unlikely, keep in mind a simple shaped charge against the cable is enough. \u00A0That in turn means security and near strip searches of anyone permitted near the cable, which reduces the economic value of it because of all these costs and delays...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, TLDR, I don\u0027t see why anyone ever wasted any time on the space elevator as a concept. \u00A0It fails the most basic analysis of feasibility. \u00A0There are other ways to reach space, and some of those ways could be potentially made very cheap with advanced technology.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso bad ideas,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.

Not on Earth, at any rate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-07T08:36:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it weren\u0027t for the moons of mars, it would be much more feasible on mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn orbital ring gets around many of the materials problems of a space elevator\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_ring\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_ring\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, to get positive tension with a space elevator, you haave something above the altitude for geosynchronous orbit: The mass \u0022wants\u0022 to move to a higher altitude because its velofity is too high.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, that requires a very very very long cable, which requires a very very very strong cable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you had something circling the earth at an altitude lower than geosynchronous orbit, you could put a cable on it and have it move faster than orbital velocity to get tension on the cable. The problem now is that the period at which it revolves around the earth needs to be much higher than the time for earth to rotate once. So you either need a track going around the equator on Earth, and the attachment point moves around the earth... not very convenient for loading stuff, but I suppose you could have a parallel track where you load a high speed maglev freight train, and mathc speeds and rendevous with the attachment point...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr you have the rotating track in space... an orbital ring, and then you anchor it with \u0022mini space elevators\u0022 that are essentially cables to maglev trains that run on the orbital ring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe requires multiple much much much shorter space elevators, and a constant power supply to keep the maglev system running and the orbital ring spun up. But now you\u0027ve got elevators space evenly around the world for loading cargo, and you\u0027ve only got a journey of a few hundred KM to space... not a ridiculously long travel to geostationary orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you get to the top though... the station is not in orbit... its sitting on top of something that is moving about orbital velocity though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou would need a second maglev train system on the track (no cable attached) that will then accelerate the payload along the ring to orbital levoity, release the payload, then travel \u0022anti spin\u0022 along to ring back to the cable anchored station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt sounds more complicated, but the required material properties are much lower, steel cable would be sufficient. As with many concepts... the engineering challenge to get something like this started (even if its fairly straightforward once its built) is staggering.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGetting even a small starter ring (basically just a circular cable) to orbit, and spinning it up without being anchored would be very difficult. Such a ring would be unstable, and would need to be anchored very quickly to stabilize it ... I suppose you could have active stabilization using rocket propellant... but that would run out pretty fast. Using beamed power to get higher Isps could buy you some more time to get the other things attached...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd you\u0027d need a stable worldwide peace to build and operate something like this.... and strong terrorism defenses...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
