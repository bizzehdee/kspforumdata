Ammonium perchlorate isn\u0027t that hard, but the binders such as hydroxy terminated butadiene might provide problems. Aluminum, another component of the fuel, depending on the date might have been more expensive than gold.

Liquid fuels use relatively cheap materials, and the machining that goes into it is simplish, at least in relation to petrochemical engineering. I mean heck, they had nitric acid and gasoline/kerosene at the time, World War One could have inolved ICBMs developed by our mad rag tag rocket team.
