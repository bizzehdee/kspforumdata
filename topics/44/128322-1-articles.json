The thing that takes the core past criticality are neutron reflectors (to increase the neutron flux over the fuel rods past criticality), that are kept misaligned whenever the reactor is not in operation. That is how they control the power output, and how they make sure that even is the reactor suffers a catastrophic hydrogen explosion that mangles it, you don\u0027t get a dirty nuke out of it, just a shower of nasty stuff that is activated only if the reactor has already been turned on. So actually carrying NERVAs to space should be much safer than, say, launching RTGs already full of radioactive material.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yes, a NERVA such as the one studied on the sixties would be a wonderful in-space engine, coupled with a secondary thruster system for operations in proximity to other manned vessels (i.e. space stations). But NERVA wasn\u0027t the \u0022thrustiest\u0022 NTR you can build, some other studies have looked at making TWR\u0026gt;\u0026gt;1 engines, for SSTO applications, and apparently you can actually lift off vertically with enough fuel on top to make orbit, plus a very significant payload. Good luck getting permission to activate one of these reactors inside the atmosphere, though.
