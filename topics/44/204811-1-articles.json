Some minerals do exist that are naturally magnetic, such as the aptly named magnetite, but it would be very surprising to see an entire planet with a high enough concentration of those minerals to make having magnets in your limbs be beneficial enough to counteract the effects of metal poisoning you\u2019d get from trying to store that much free iron inside a living body.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso consider that iron is used widely in biological systems- such as haemoglobin in blood, the \u201Chaem\u201D part refers to the iron at the centre, and\u00A0a variety of metabolic enzymes crucial to energy production- and sticking magnets into the mix could cause problems; also consider the potentially horrendous internal damage that can be caused by swallowing magnets which then stick together and punch holes through internal organs and then you realise that having magnets inside you is probably A Bad Idea- you could get stuck to something and be unable to escape without ripping the magnet(s) off or just cause damage to yourself or someone else without even realising it if you were asleep.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for electromagnets rather than permanent magnets- yes, some organisms can generate considerable electric currents (electric eels, for one) but that\u2019s a relatively fast burst and is usually focussed outside their own body, and used to stun or kill prey by frying their nervous systems. Trying to produce a sustained current strong enough to support their own weight with magnetism on a surface that might only be marginally magnetic without ruining your own nervous system or consuming huge quantities of energy would be a real challenge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anything, stick to conventional adhesion systems- clever microscopic structures such as on lizard feet, suction type stuff as for cephalopods or using appendages such as claws to hook into a surface.
