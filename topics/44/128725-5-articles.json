Even if Soyuz V gets off the planning stagehand is built (which is going to be a while) it would still have a baseline 10T capacity. Yes, Russia is getting rid of many of their launchers- but they\u0027re being replaced by Soyuz-2 variants (a 3T to LEO version, 7T to LEO Version, and 8T to LEO version.) The Soyuz-2 has been modified for this, and is now modular. The differences between Soyuz 2-1V and Soyuz 2-1a or b are similar to the differences between Falcon 9 and Five- they are based off the same rocket, but have modifications to fit their niche better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Proton is being replaced by the Angara A5, while Rocot is being replaced by the Angara A1.2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe payload capabilities of Russia are remaining roughly the same, the only difference is the change towards modular rockets- rockets derived off each other. There is not conslidation towards using all heavy-lift rockets.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...Also, Russia actually is keeping Soyuz Alive for the same reason the DOD has a 2-launcher requirement. What happens when an Angara fails? At least if Soyuz is alive, you can launch many of your payloads without losing ALL your launch capability. Otherwise, Soyuz-2-1b and v would never have even been made. They would just make \u00A0Soyuz 2-1a (the one desginated for Soyuz and Progress launches), and not any of the other versions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSame goes with Vulcan. Vulcan, designed as a modular replacement for Atlas/Delta, has an adjustable payload from 9/10 T to 18T to LEO, just like Atlas (as far as we know). The death of the Delta is not a consolidation of launchers to a single, non-modular rocket (like what you are saying we should do).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSame thing applies to Ariane. Ariane V actually only has 2 upper stages- ECA, used for GEO launches, and the ES. The ES has only been used for ATVs, and will be used for a few Galileo MEO sats. Yes, Ariane 6 consolidates this into 1 upper stage (ES version is rarely used), but that\u0027s really a small consolidation. ArianeSpace actually built Vega and introduced Soyuz so that it would be able to efficiently launch all kinds of satellites. You know, since using Ariane V, a 21 T to LEO rocket for a 1.8T IXV payload is a \u003Ci\u003Elittle\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0overkill.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, yeah, Ariane 6 is being built with 2 variants- one with 2 boosters, to replace the ArianeSpace Soyuz, and one with 4 boosters as a HLV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, you know, how about SpaceX?
