As a quick aside to begin with, I don\u0027t think we need unobtanium, just a habitable world that\u0027s bigger than Earth but with comparable density. But that wasn\u0027t really the point of the thread so I\u0027ll move on. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1).\u00A0 It would certainly be tough, especially at the start. In general, the human body is pretty economical with its resources. If you\u0027re living in zero-g, your system adapts to the reduced loads by losing surplus (for the current environment) bone strength and muscle tone. The human body can adapt back to 1g conditions (regain muscle tone and bone strength) after extended periods in 0g but it\u0027s not easy, as any astronaut returning from the ISS will tell you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have no idea how well that works the other way. Weightlifters and other \u0027extreme strength\u0027 athletes can do some pretty crazy things, so I\u0027m guessing that your skeletomuscular system can adapt to higher gravity given time and could probably be helped along the way with steroids and the kind of drugs that are used to treat osteoporosis. However, the rest of the squishy bag of water that you call your body ( \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ) might not be able to adapt as easily. Your heart might not cope well with pumping heavier blood day in, day out? Your lymphatic system (that drains excess intracellular fluid from your tissues) essentially relies on \u0027passive pumping\u0027 caused by normal movements to work - that might not work so well either in higher gravity. Even little things like your eyeballs distorting under higher gravity might lead to complications later on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.\u00A0 It would probably depend on the sport. Not all muscle fibres are the same, so muscles adapted for living in high G might not be whatt you want in a sprinter for example. My best \u0027pulled out of thin air\u0027 guess, is that our astronaut might be competitive at weightlifting and jumping, probably less so at running.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.\u00A0 Possibly, although it would be highly dependent on how much the fetus could adapt \u003Cem\u003Ein utero\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 If it is possible, the poor newborn would probably have a really rough time of it, and all the normal bumps and falls associated with learning to walk are going to be nasty in high G. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E You would probably be better off delivering by c-section too - being delicate about it, giving birth naturally with muscles adapted to high-G living might not be a great plan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-29T12:48:14Z\u0022 title=\u002202/29/2016 12:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RizzoTheRat","CreatedById":123362,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-29T14:09:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d have thought a relatively small increase in g would be adapted for relatively easily.\u00A0 Our bodies can already adapt to an increase in bodyweight by probably 25-50% without major problems (ie on earth you can get that big and still move around, and this would be fit people without cholesterol blocking their arteries), but it would take time as we see with astronauts adapting to 1 g again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever as you get heavier you\u0027re going to start having much more trouble,\u00A0 If you compare human bones to those of heavier mammals the bones are considerably thicker for a given length, this is because the bone material has a similar structure strength, so it needs to be thicker to support the weight.\u00A0 There\u0027s\u00A0a limit to how thick that bone can become and still maintain movement in the joints, and the required muscle mass around it, strong enough tendons, etc.\u00A0 Bigger animals are generally less agile, and the really big ones need to be supported by sea water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there\u0027s the question of how you\u0027re carrying that weight.\u00A0 Someone may be able to lift their own bodyweight in a deadlift, or carry it in a rucksack, but how far could they lean over before their back gave way?\u00A0 Could they break their fall if they tripped over at 2g?\u00A0 Could they get up again?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy glasses start to slide down my nose at about 2.5g so there\u0027d be no room on a high g planet for us speccy types \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-29T14:11:16Z\u0022 title=\u002202/29/2016 02:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by RizzoTheRat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-29T14:11:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm.
