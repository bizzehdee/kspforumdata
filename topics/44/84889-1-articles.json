Solid Rocket Boosters for Ariane 5 are largely manufactured in France and French are behind latest POD-X tests to improve European SRB technology. As for the new liquid engine - it\u0027s nothing related to Ariane 6, and experimental engines got little to deal with industry itself as they\u0027re made on individual orders. It\u0027s quite opposite to the contracts for the engines of operational launch vehicles, they are not signed on yearly basis but rather multi-year timeframe, so yes - it does make a difference, especially if you\u0027re trying to push budget as far they do with Ariane 6. At some point there were plans to upgrade Vulcain to the new manufacturing standards what could allow them to share at least part of the infrastructure and personnel with Vinci manufacturing further decreasing costs.
