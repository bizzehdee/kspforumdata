That\u0027s why you need to know what you\u0027re doing.\n\nYes, aerodynamic is complicated, the main issue of putting multiple winglets behind each other is why not use an larger one? If you use moveable winglets the airflow will get hairy as they will interact different at different angles. This is only done in KSP as we lack larger wings and control surfaces. \n\nThe NACA scoop don\u0027t work well for jet engines but works very well for other uses, especially cars who moves much slower, they have other benefits on cars like nothing who stand out and can be damaged or damage others and have low drag in moderate speeds where they are not needed."},{"CreatedByName":"EzinX","CreatedById":118288,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T00:39:51Z","Content":"Ok.

But that\u0027s because your brick wall is stalling pretty hard. If you instead put your wall at an angle of, say, 10 degrees, and then put your wings in the \u0027shadow\u0027 of the wall - by which I mean, if you shine a light straight along the horizontal, then put those wings in the shadowed portion - then they\u0027ll have some real aerodynamic effect.
