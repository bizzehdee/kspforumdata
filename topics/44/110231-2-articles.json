However, the key distinction is the existence of liquid water. As scientists who have studied the life question will tell you that is the fundamental question that determines whether or not you are likely to find life. Well then, Europa has more liquid water in its sub ice ocean than all the oceans on Earth.\n\nAny actual scientist will tell you that what you need is a good solvent for the given temperature range. At 300K of typical Earth life, you need pretty strong bonds in things like DNA and complex proteins to hold them together against thermal excitations. And to break these apart, you need a strong, polar solvent. Water is by far the best option, and the only available one that\u0027s naturally abundant. So at terrestrial temperature ranges, life means water.\n\nIn contrast, if you are at less than 100K, such as on Titan, hydrogen bonds are frozen solid. Your complex molecules will be held together by van der Waals forces. A polar solvent would ript that stuff to shreds, and no life would be possible. Fortunately, there are non-polar solvents, such as liquid methane. So if we are talking cryogenic life, life means liquid methane. And that makes Titan a perfect place to look for cryogenic life.\n\nGranted, life at high temperatures has huge number of advantages. There are more potential energy sources, all of the processes are faster, and you can dump excess entropy way easier. Which means life will be more complex and far further evolved on Earth than it could ever be on Titan. I would not expect anything past simplest bacteria there. Something similar to Earth\u0027s Archaea.\n\nSo finding life on Titan would tell us two things. First, that our definition of \u0022habitable\u0022 is a bit too narrow. Second, that two planets within a single star system have developed completely different life independently. And while former has very limited impact, because planets/moons like Titan are unlikely to ever produce complex life, that second statement is extremely powerful.\n\nWe live on Earth. Which means odds of us finding life on Earth are 100% ab initio. There is no way any species could ever find itself in a barren star system. Which means that us knowing that there is a habitable planet here is absolutely useless. Even if there is just one in all of the universe, we\u0027d be on it. But two planets? Odds there being very few habitable planets out there, yet there being two, so vastly different, in our star system are minimal. If we find life on Mars or Europa, we\u0027d still have to figure out if it had the same origin as life on Earth. For all we know, it did. Panspermia isn\u0027t very appealing on global scale, but within confines of a single star system, it\u0027s quite plausible. But if we find life on Titan, we know it didn\u0027t come from Earth. We know it\u0027s not contamination from one of the probes. Life on Titan cannot exist in water, and life from Earth cannot exist on Titan. Simple as.\n\nIf we find life on Titan, that\u0027s two data points from which we extrapolate a very simple fact. When you look up into the sky and look at the stars, more of the stars you see probably have life than don\u0027t. There is nothing we can find on Mars or Europa that would be anywhere close to this impact."},{"CreatedByName":"heng","CreatedById":126869,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T11:48:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E yep, it\u0027s worth remembering NASA\u0027s budget is only 2-3% of the military budget.\n\nPft. just wait until we find (or are found by) hostile aliens and the two budgets get combined :-D\n\n\u0022Hostile Aliens\u0022... that might be us.

I felt the same way about the \u0022documentary\u0022 feel, but then I learned that it was all filmed on a (relatively) very low budget, so it\u0027s pretty impressive that it\u0027s as high-quality as it is.\n\nAnyway, the Europa lander: That\u0027s amazing, I can\u0027t wait. In my opinion, the best-case scenario\\* is that exploration of Europa plays out a little like it did on Mars, with a series of \u0022Ooh that\u0027s interesting, let\u0027s take a closer look!\u0022 missions, culminating in an under-ice mission. That\u0027ll make for an exciting next few decades.\n\n\\*More accurately, the best-case scenario that actually has a chance of being funding. Strictly speaking, the *absolute* best-case scenario is that all war stops and we divert all military funding to NASA and get into a nice pattern of launching a new billion-dollar space mission every few months. But I\u0027ll settle for the more-realistic incremental approach."}]}
