A small steel raft doesn\u0027t match the height of the stage...\n\nShuttle: probably among the most reliable and flexible on paper, they suffer from the requirement of a plane just to take the engines back (hence why they need to retrieve things from orbit to make it count).

Even if you have 24 launches per year, with a fleet of 6 vehicles you can take 3 months to refurbish/restack them, which is more than enough. If you need a higher flight rate, it\u0027s easier to simply grow your fleet than to redesign the system for faster turnaround.\n\nFast turnaround is only important if you reach insanely high launch rates and each vehicle is super expensive.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The cost rise a lot due the time it takes you to launch the next rocket and all safety test that you need to do, more stages = more possible fails.\n\nI agree with that increasing staging events means increasing failure modes, but it\u0027s can be cheaper to have 3 people refurbish a rocket in 10 weeks than to have 30 people refurbish it in 1 week.
