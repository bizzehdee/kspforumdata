There is a nice mountain range near KSC, if you had a nice big nuclear reactor and plenty of energy... how realistic would it be to launch non God sensitive \u00A0cargo into orbit using electromagnetic acceleration? \u00A0I realize you\u0027d be talking about hypersonic speeds near sea level, so as a offshoot how about just an initial boost with SRB providing sustaining thrust and orbital circulation?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-11T17:26:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo optimal efficient velocity is when drag roughly equals the force of gravity which results in 4200 dV to reach space, about 1200 dV used basically to counteract drag.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is a speed profile of 100 (0), 160 (5000), 256 (10000) to about 18000 (Mach perterbations limit) meters (safely) then 1000 to about 32000, 1500 to about 45000 alt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you doubled that speed you would triple the force of drag so instead of needing 1200 dv you would need 3600 dv again at low altitude at Mach you would have restrictions the went up very rapidly\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you doubled that speed again it would be more like 14400 dv required. Since that dV is all going into heating you have to consider that this is going to translate into heat on the surface, explosive heat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, shooting an object into space does not place you in orbit, either you escape SOI or you are on a hyperbolic trajectory that intercepts the planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird, So lets say we apply 20000dV, lets say the viability limit is 300 m/s OK 20000/300 = 66.66 seconds and so distance is 1/2 a t 2 = 667km. IOW you would need to have a hole through the center of mass of kerbin and 67km the other side to have enough distance to accelerate the object to reach the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFlat answer no, you cannot do this from KSC. To determine which altitude you could do this see how much dV it takes starting with 0dV at a given altitude to reach space, the determine the energy diffeential between orbit (apo = peri = 671000, Vo = SQRT(u/671000)\u00A0 and sitting on kerbin (apo = 600km radius, Vo ~ 175 m/s, peri = 1 or 2 km, calculate the semimajor axis, the keplars area rule can be used to determined)), this then defines the energy between the two states and can be used to calculated dV. The dV not used is a combination of waste \u0027hoovering\u0027 and drag.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI might be possible to do from KSC if you reduced the coefficient of drag on the parts, but to be fair you would have to make much longer parts which are much heavier. Drag is composed of two parts, the part caused by collisions and the part caused by sliding. You can reduce the collision drag, but not the slide friction, some propose ejecting hot gas along the surface of an object to reduce sliding drag. You would have to make the parts extremely resilent to heat and you could not turn after launch below 36000.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Buster Charlie","CreatedById":157768,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-11T17:58:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did see one interesting light gas gun idea which involved a long floating underwater gun under water so they could change the angle of launch.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom a game play standpoint, \u00A0I think it would be interesting to basically have a launch sled as a root object, and treat it like a fairing base. \u00A0Anything you launch would have to attach to the launch sled object and \u00A0fit within a fixed fairing envelope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you said you\u0027d need a rocket stage of some sort to complete the orbit so maybe this would still \u00A0be worth looking into as a first stage replacement.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as heat and shielding, maybe the gun is only designed to get the launch sled above 32k, at which point it sheds it\u0027s fairing and air brakes away from the ship itself \u00A0(optional parachutes for stage recovery? )\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDowsnide would be the payload would need to withstand launch get forces and fit within a fixed size envelope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlus side is it would provide a fast and reliable way to get the payload to 32k?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I suppose one could make a launch clamp like part that provides a single impulse of thrust to the sled part, maubergine borrow the code from the orion nuclear engine but make it one shot and insanely powerful.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe realism issue is these guns would tend to be longer than is practical to render in game.

Sorry I typed most of this on my phone so it\u0027s not expressed the best way. I was just saying If you did a space gun, instead of it being a pure craft, because of the potential length it should probably be handled as a KSC building, and the bonus of that is it\u0027s capabilities and cast can progress at a rate to keep it from being \u0027easy mode\u0027. SO if the first tier cost 12,000,000 and the second tier cost 125,000,000 and the third tier was 5,000,000,000 or whatever then that would make sure people fully explore the fun of traditional rockets, before they could just fire a supply mission on a ballistic course to\u00A0Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really like the electromagnetic orbiter, but either it would have to be in geostationary orbit, or you\u0027d have to have an easy or automatic way to synchronize it\u0027s orbit with your projectile. Also, IIRC planets are not movable in this game, just asteroids. So in theory if you could tie the KSC build upgrade mechanic to actually inserting a new planet... Then in theory Tier 3 of the space gun could spawn a new \u0027planet\u0027 in geostationary orbit at the right phase angle for space gun intercept at that altitude (Since it would be rather high up). The planet could be very small and basically be a place to stick your orbital magnetic circularizing device. And I guess you would have to make it so if any object enters it\u0027s SOI then it gives it a enough boost to circularize it\u0027s orbit somehow.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222404985\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022131879\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221455261752\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154334\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hannu2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, Hannu2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that this would not fit very well in KSP\u0027s current scope. Railgun would be optimal for very frequent launches of hundreds of payloads, for example automated supply transports to colonies or sending automated mining systems to bring resources from asteroids to kerbin. But there is not such possibilities in KSP. KSP concentrates to earlier phase of space technology where single missions are important and player plan them and execute them. Railgun would fit better to game where basic piloting is automated and player manages larger scale logistic operations in solar system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree, but being that this would be a mod, it would fit in with say USI or other colonization mods, or anything with life support or in space launchpads.

Or to state simply, a hoovering verticle ascent above the launchpad below maximum safe dynamic stress velocity is as wasteful as can be (just look at the dm/dt). One of the biggest problems in launching ships where T/W is close to m*g is that they are not very stable over the launch pad, they tend to want to roll and there is no steering currents around the ship. As has been discussed here before, also raise the atmosphere to say 5000 meters also improves the performance of draggy loads, they are trying to gain speed as the atmosphere thins.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-12T23:39:03Z\u0022 title=\u002202/12/2016 11:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 12, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
