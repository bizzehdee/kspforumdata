HD 34445 is a large G-type star of 1.38 R\u003Csub\u003ESun\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0and 1.07 M\u003Csub\u003ESun\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0with twice our Sun\u0027s luminosity and a high metallicity of \u002B0.14 [Fe/H]. Back in 2009, a gas giant of 0.79 Jupiter masses orbiting in an eccentric (e=0.27) orbit at 2.07 AU was found. Now, after analysis of 19 years worth of radial velocity data, Steve Vogt and his team have found five more gas and ice giants, with orbital periods between a few weeks and a decade. All six worlds are 16.8, 30.7, 53.5, 37.9, 250.0, and 120.6 times the mass of Earth and orbit every 49.18, 117.87, 214.67, 676.8, 1,049.0, and 5,700.0 days. Two are in the system\u0027s habitable zone and could have potentially life-friendly moons. This is an absolutely amazing find, as it not only shows that spaced-out systems with multiple planets around Sun-like stars do exist, but that they can be fundamentally similar and different to our own Solar System. Planetary systems like HD 10180 and Tau Ceti are also great examples, the latter of which is rather similarly structured to our own inner system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nData for the system on NASA\u0027s Exoplanet Archive:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/DisplayOverview/nph-DisplayOverview?objname=HD\u002B34445\u0026amp;type=PLANET_HOST\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/DisplayOverview/nph-DisplayOverview?objname=HD\u002B34445\u0026amp;type=PLANET_HOST\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVogt et al\u0027s paper on the system:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.07337.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.07337.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-29T08:00:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, all-gas-giants system \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Another weird member of the planetary menagerie.
