Your example might well be true in some cases but it\u0027s certainly not going to be true in all cases, probably very few cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr maybe I want to go into business for myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn which case I\u0027m going to need money and probably lots of it, to get my engine to market. So I\u0027m going to need investors. But those investors are going to need some certainties before they give me any money. My patent is a big help there because it stops Big Engine from taking my idea, making their own version and squeezing me and my investors out of the market before they get a chance to recoup their investment. Without the patent, they\u0027re much less likely to invest. Far from \u0027only being useful to large corporations\u0027 if you\u0027re in the business of manufacturing something that isn\u0027t lines of code, patents are one of the few tools that a start up company has to compete with the large corporations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what happens if I don\u0027t have a patent for my engine? Somehow, I scrape together the cash to start a company. I start selling my engines. A.N.Other Corp copies them and starts selling them too. I can\u0027t compete with their economies of scale, marketing budget, distribution networks - all the good stuff that comes with being a large company - and I go out of business. But hey - net win for humanity right? My engine is still out there being used? I shrug my shoulders, go invent something else and try again. Same thing happens. Caring a little less about humanity this time, I try again with a third invention. By this time, I\u0027m a bit more business savvy, so I do things a bit differently, a bit smarter. Makes no odds. A.N.Other Corp gets another windfall and my third company goes bust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScrew humanity - I\u0027m done with this.

On any patent gained by someone, such as Raytheon, where they discovered the patent-able item while fulfilling a government contract then Raytheon get\u0027s total ownership of the patent, however the government gets the right to use the patent as though they owned it. Now, while this technically means in many ways what you say it does, in actuality it is implemented in the way that a lot of open source hardware licenses are today. Yes, on a given contract with a Raytheon competitor, like Lockheed, they could just hand Lockheed the patent info and never pay Raytheon a dime. But that doesn\u0027t make any sense, because Raytheon already has the infrastructure to produce the hardware/software in question. So they\u0027d be stiffing Raytheon to save money that they immediately spend having Lockheed build a copy of the infrastructure that Raytheon has. Far easier, and cheaper, to just pay Lockheed the cost of purchasing the equipment from Raytheon. They do not need to compel Raytheon to fulfill this order, because we\u0027d want to. It\u0027s \u0027free money\u0027 even if it means helping out a competitor on a contract we had wanted. Because the alternative is just that we get zero money, and the project goes ahead anyway because the government can just have someone else produce the items in question, but now we seem like jerks which WILL be taken into account on future contract bidding processes. (IE: If we have a history of being obstructionist with our patents that they paid for us to get, then they are not going to want to give us the opportunity to get more patents.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd similarly, even though the government has the ability to just kind of do whatever with non-government assisted patents, it still ends up being far easier to just pay for the product from the company that owns the patent in the first place. Why should they pay to set up a production line to make computer mice for themselves when they could just buy them in bulk from a normal company? And they cannot force a company to provide them with goods/services free of charge. Correction, they COULD do so, but without a VERY VERY good reason you\u0027d have just about literally every other business in the nation pouring money into that companies legal team to sue the government, and they WOULD win because even in drastic circumstances (war time and such) the government has to reimburse companies for goods/services provided. While I am sure there are plenty of anecdotes of situations where they got away without doing so, they are vastly in the minority compared with the rest of the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA nice example of using someones product without paying for it is that piece of software the Navy (Airforce? one of the two) got caught using. They had paid for like 5 licenses of the software, and when the company forced an audit to happen, they found out that the government had installed something like 15,000 licenses across their computers. The company tried to get the government to pay for each of those licenses, which would have cost over 1 billion dollars (VERY expensive software), and only got about a third of that. But that was mostly because the government looked into why it happened and discovered that it was because of a breakdown in their protocols for telling people \u0022We only have 2 licenses, no more.\u0022 than any actual malicious behavior.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I don\u0027t think our current patent system is that great, but I agree with the need to have one. I\u0027d make two changes to it in the US if I could. Change number 1 is that software patents have a lifespan of 5 years, with an additional 3 that can be gained if the patent requires specialized hardware, as opposed to the full 20-ish for normal. 5 is certainly long enough to roll out a software product and hit peak saturation rate, and the extra 3 covers the time it should take for you to spin up production lines for hardware. The second thing I\u0027d add, which I recognize is largely unfeasible especially given that I have friends inside the patent office that yell at me over it, is that we go back to the old days when you were required to submit either a working demonstration or an accurate model with your patent. This was a check to ensure that people actually worked on their ideas instead of hording them. They dropped the requirement largely because of storage and processing limitations on the models.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
