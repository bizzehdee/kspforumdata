So, you can find the mixture ratio by systematically attaching each engine to a procedural tank and hitting \u0022configure,\u0022 then recording the amounts of fuel and oxidizer in each.\n\nThis may or may not be faster than actually looking up the stats for each engine."},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T04:58:32Z","Content":"Yes if you have real fuels installed just assemble the stage and with FASA your good to go. But if you do need to edit the fuel amounts right click the tank and hit \u0022tank ui\u0022.\n\nIf I may... A question myself. What I want to do is using procedural parts and faings make custom rocket stages with individual fuel-oxidizer tanks. With a given engine how would I calculate the needed amounts in each tank for an even burn?"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T05:19:02Z","Content":"Yeah, I actually tried to do just that, but everytime I went to launch, it showed I had NO fuel in the tank!"},{"CreatedByName":"andrewas","CreatedById":24662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T12:33:34Z","Content":"Right click on the tank, and at the bottom of the UI theres a selection of fuel/oxygen mixes used on your rocket. Hit the one appropriate for the engine that tank is feeding.\n\nSome fuels boil off, so if you\u0027re using Kerbal Construction Time they may be gone by the time the rocket gets to the pad. Using launch stabilizers is meant to prevent that, but it sometimes boils off anyway. The launch stabilizers in that mod include fuel pumps so you can use them to refill the tank."},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T16:54:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yeah, I actually tried to do just that, but everytime I went to launch, it showed I had NO fuel in the tank!\n\nTried... What I said? It works you gotta get tricky with fuel lines and make sure the interstage has crossfeed enabled. I just need to know how much fuel to put in each tank depending on what engine(s) I use."}]}
