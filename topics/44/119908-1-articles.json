I think the quantum wormhole article is worse, not because they are wrong, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut because they don\u0027t lay out that string theory is largely rejected in the world of physics, and most of what they are saying they have accomplished is in-silico analysis (which in most other fields of science, can\u0027t even get referees to review the manuscript). Before you can believe it you first have to fix a whole bunch of inconsistencies of string theory with observations, and then have to go about replicating the in-silico stuff in real measurement style experiments. Seriously do black holes halve? where it the energy to halve a black hole going to come frome . . . . . \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe wormhole explanation for entanglement may be right, but for the wrong reasons, for reasons not which they give, which means a fight will be instore if others confirm the observation, you will have mainstream physics trying to fight the up hill battle that non-string explanation is better than a string explanation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
