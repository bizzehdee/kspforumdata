A probe encounters an event, learns something, improves itself. The outcome is almost always positive.\n\nWe were talking about random events as a source of new information in self-modification. Without them, self-modification can\u0027t create new information.\n\nExternal observations are not based on random events. They extract information from the input or the environment, depending on which formalism we\u0027re using. If the information comes from external observations or experiments, self-modifications does not help at all, because a non-self-modifying machine can extract the same information.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You are confusing low risk with no risk. The premise was that you need many probes due to the risks, while I said that you probably only need a few because the intent is to replicate anyway. Exploring a full system will certainly have very risky parts, but there is no need to dive in straight away.\n\nReplication is the riskiest part of exploring a new system, because it involves a plenty of exploration, construction, resource extraction, and experimentation. Once the probe has managed to build the first copy, the hardest part is done. It can just keep doing the things it has already done.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The most relevant field to physical production is actual physical production, which I do happen to know.\n\nPhysical production is only a small part of the activities required for self-replication. Others involve physics, chemistry, geology, and various branches of engineering.\n\nStill, the main problems for von Neumann probes are methodological and not directly related to any of the aforementioned fields. The problems related to the capabilities of the probe as a whole are computer science. Other problems belong to artificial intelligence, statistics, economics, and perhaps even theoretical biology.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You stated that a more complex product would require an every increasingly production facility. I have given examples, digital manufacturing through CNC machines and 3D printing, for instance, why this is not necessarily the case.\n\nAnd I said that building those CNC machines and 3d printers increases the overall complexity of the production much more than they reduce the complexity of the final facility."},{"CreatedByName":"SomeGuy12","CreatedById":103022,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T19:15:34Z","Content":"\u003E And I said that building those CNC machines and 3d printers increases the overall complexity of the production much more than they reduce the complexity of the final facility.\n\nJouni, ribosomes and the metabolic paths in an e-coli have finite complexity, despite being capable of producing products accurate to the atomic level.

If you earn a certain degree of flexibility, you do not require ever increasing complexity to get the job done. You can simply adapt your somewhat less efficient solution to fit your various needs, rather than needing a huge array of efficient solutions that are together much, much more complex.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [...]\n\nDespite many repeated requests, you have produced no evidence or sources and therefore your argument is invalid.

While mutations are the only source of new genetic information, their short-to-medium term effects are mostly harmful and rarely beneficial. Cells have a plenty of mechanisms for preventing mutations, and for repairing the damage if a mutation happens. There is also a lot of redundancy in the genome, which helps to minimize the effects of mutations.\n\u003E In a large population, which can afford to lose a plenty of individuals, a low mutation rate can help to increase the genetic variation in the population, increasing its fitness in the long term (after hundreds or thousands of generations). In short-to-medium term, the primary adaptation mechanism is recombining the genetic variation that already exists in the population. Recombination is much less likely to have adverse effects than mutation, because individuals have already lived with all of the genes involved.\n\u003E \n\u003E Replication is not as simple as copying a piece of data. It involves adapting the resource extraction and production activities of the probe to the conditions in the new environment. Many of these activities may involve location-specific risks that are not always apparent in advance. If the probe can\u0027t afford to take risks, it may not have access to all the resources it needs, or it may not be able to process them in the forms they occur in in the current environment.\n\u003E \n\u003E Computer science is the science of systems, processes, mechanisms, complexity, information, and similar things. It\u0027s a methodological science with a similar role in the 21st century science as statistics had in the 20th century science. Its English name is kind of unfortunate, because computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes. In many other languages, people use more appropriate names, which translate as e.g. computing, informatics, datalogy, information processing science, and science of computation.\n\u003E \n\u003E Computer science is simply the most relevant field of study to this discussion.\n\nYes, as a VNP probe will be likely to operate alone any mutation is likely to be negative, also it will have far more single source of fail that an living being. \n\nLast the obvious beneficial mutation for the probe would be remove the cap on replication. This is also the nightmare scenario for the developers. \n\nIts also pretty easy to avoid mutation in code, simply compress it and encrypt it so any bit fail will scramble the data, you then use redundancy and error corrections to avoid errors. \n\nYou use an similar method for patching. \n\nIts most likely that the NVP will use asteroid mining for resources, at the time we are able to build one we will have enough knowledge about this to have an database who cover issues, have the computer fill in the gaps.\n\nVNP is also likely to be an evolution of automating mining and production facilities used in the solar system for an long time. It would be useful to give them self repair functionality and to let them make as much of new versions as possible. It would hardly be practical to make an true VNP for this nor is it likely that everything would be integrated into one ship, they would also focus more on volume production. But it would be an obvious starting point."},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T20:52:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yes, as a VNP probe will be likely to operate alone any mutation is likely to be negative, also it will have far more single source of fail that an living being. \n\u003E Last the obvious beneficial mutation for the probe would be remove the cap on replication.

I made a universal statement, which you replied with an opposing existential statement. While it\u0027s generally possible to prove a universal statement false or an existential statement true, it\u0027s generally impossible to prove a universal statement true or an existential statement false.\n2. If you want more evidence for my statements, be more specific in your requests. I still don\u0027t know what you\u0027re asking for. Write a few paragraphs, where you clearly specify which of my statements you find problematic, and mention the reasons for that.\n3. If you can prove me wrong, it may ultimately lead to publishable results. It\u0027s kind of counterproductive to be right in a scientific discussion, because it usually means that you didn\u0027t learn anything new."},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T22:04:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This, by the way, means that a realistic probe might in fact have incredibly sophisticated software systems, equivalent to cramming an artificial neural network emulating the mind states of a 100 people or more into it. If you had the equivalent of the minds of 100 people, you would be able to do very intelligent experimentation and engineering. You do realize that this probably would fit into 100 kilograms or less of computing machinery, assuming you had 3 dimensional, nanostructured hardware. (the brain weighs 1.3 kilograms, and obviously you don\u0027t need many of the brain\u0027s systems for this, also, you could make equivalent circuits with a lot less mass because they don\u0027t have to be alive and self repairing nor use proteins...)\n\nIf I allow myself to free-wheel a bit, I can imagine things like multiple probes forming larger neural networks, each acting as a massive neuron or node. Each can function as a discrete unit, but accelerate their collective capabilities when combined with others. You might even get system wide neural network, who knows. \n\nA question is whether it is ethic to consume everything until there is nothing left but your machines. I can see quite a large problem existing with the premise that you are discover the universe by destroying it. It reminds a rather lot with the imperialist views and tactics of previous centuries, including the introduction or foreign species into a habitat. \u0022Nice system you got there - but do you know what would be even better...?\u0022 Maybe the machines should limit themselves to a fixed maximum percentage of all mass encountered, though I can see trouble when two separate branches of probes enter the same system. You would need some central claiming mechanism, or possibly local tags to show what has been claimed.\n\nAs has been discussed before, I can imagine that any of those tactics will not please any locally present life. Having your probes randomly claiming everything and anything could generally be considered not being a good neighbour ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) Even with a limit, you would just be a bit less imperialist, but not *not imperialist*.\n\nNow why does this incur visions of a fleet of Roombas taking over the neighbour\u0027s house?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [...]\n\nNo comment.
