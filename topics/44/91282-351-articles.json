Next generation vehicles like Vulcan and Ariane 6 weren\u0027t being actively worked on, and evolved variants of existing vehicles were loosely tossed around but didn\u0027t get traction, while commercial spaceflight was in its infancy. Furthermore, NASA and the US were reeling from the Columbia tragedy, which did anything but endear the public to a brand new, and expensive program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConstellation was also a slightly bigger Apollo (if with explicity more ambition in shooting for Mars), for a roughly equal total cost, and no ferver within the government or public to support spaceflight like during the space race. NASA rolling along with its usual funding, and eventual redirection to SLS/Orion, then into Artemis was working within this environment, and making use of what was available. So something would have to change to make this happen earlier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe certain politicians/NASA directors are elected/appointed over others who are able to provide more funding and direction. But there aren\u0027t really any space race revivals happening around this time. China was in the middle of maturing its space program, and Russia was still recovering its economy. So there would have to be something else to drive public and government support, and you might have to reach further back to create the knock on effects that change the early 2000s. Mars direct stirs up more support, successful Shuttle upgrades bring public interest back, Energia isn\u0027t cancelled and survives the USSR\u0027s collapse, leaving Russia with a SHLV, and has some inertia to work with, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AckSed","CreatedById":224249,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-26T13:09:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey cared, but not enough to spend the staggering amounts of money needed.
