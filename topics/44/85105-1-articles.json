So you can only launch in the correct orbital plane twice a day. Those are your launch windows. If you launch outside your launch window you end up in an orbit that has a very big inclination to the ISS\u0027s orbit and it would be too expensive on the dV budget to ever fix it. Therefore you can\u0027t time your launch so you have a nice and quick rendezvouz.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes the ISS is on the other side of the planet after your launch. So you need to either be in a higher orbit so the ISS catches up to you, or a lower orbit so you catch up to the ISS. In real life they always use a lower orbit because this is cheaper dV wise, so you can haul more stuff to the ISS. This catching up takes a lot of time though. The ISS orbits at 350km and a typical parking orbit is something like 200km. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.calctool.org/CALC/phys/astronomy/earth_orbit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESome simple math\u003C/a\u003E shows that the difference in orbital period is only about 3 minutes. So if you are unlucky and you ended up right in front of the ISS you\u0027ll have to orbit around the planet about 30 times before you catch up to it. At 1.5 hours an orbit this takes you nearly 2 days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt gets even worse later on because you aren\u0027t allowed to fire the main engines near the ISS so as to avoid contamination of the sensitive instruments. So when you get close you have to raise your orbit and close the gap very gently. This can easily take another day.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TythosEternal","CreatedById":117821,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-21T20:58:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI find it very encouraging, and exciting, that they\u0027ve successfully managed to up the launch tempo with so few problems.
