If the situation is dire enough that you can abandon your satellites, ASATs will always be enough to keep away invaders (unless said invaders take the form of a large deliberately directed meteor). If you want to protect your satellites too, it becomes more complex - you\u0027ll need infrared space telescopes staring at every orbital maneuver the aliens make. If they make a hostile move, response would probably take the form of a sophisticated spacecraft injected onto an orbit that will coincide with the alien spacecraft\u0027s path, rendezvous as close as possible, and detonate itself, like Soviet coorbital ASATs IS-A and Naryad (Briz KM).\n\nEDIT:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E An ODST platform would allow you to get boots on the ground practically anywhere in the world in an extremely short period of time compared to other transport methods.\n\nActually an orbital spacecraft is one of the worst ways to do that.

Against enemy of humanity, we get virtually no limit on resources and technology, since by that point everyone is (hopefully) going to get together to do something about our space invaders. On a nation vs nation scale, it becomes a matter of economics and politics and such, with limited access to all tech available.\n\nIf thinking of fighting aliens are too problematic, then let just say they are space terrorists that has a base on the dark side of the moon and all that tropes and they want to nuke earth."},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T21:50:06Z","Content":"Yeah, we can throw rocks, guided rocks, or guided nukes. Lasers, currently, would pretty much cook themselves before they cooked anything else (awful energy transmission efficiencies), except bomb-pumped X-ray lasers, but hose we would have to really develop from mostly scratch, and are single-use. If any adversary has the same tech level, they can do the same, only they have access to more stuff (all of the solar system except Earth, presumably), and they have the gravity well working as an advantage to bomb us. Us, on the other hand, have to counteract their mobility with guided warheads, and are on the wrong side on a 9.5km/s gravity well, which we currently can barely escape.\n\nIn less fancy words: we are screwed.

In real life, if you had a species that was willing to cross interstellar space for a chance to fight us, we\u0027d be in some deep $%^\u0026. The most likely attack would come in the form of relativistic kill vehicles, pummeling all industrial and population centers. Our casualtys would number in the billions, and chaos would sweep through the civilised world. Soon after, there would be a fleet of warships in orbit to mop up whats left of humanity, and some ground forces to capture whatever individuals remain (maybe sticking them into zoos).\n\nPeople like to fantasize about waging guerilla warfare against hostile aliens, but the truth is, we\u0027d never get the chance. They would pound us from orbit, bomb us back into the stone age. By the time they deploy ground forces, the aliens would for all intents and purposes have won. If you really want to beat a hostile force of aliens, you\u0027re going to need a military grade supercomputer (like skynet).

Completely unrealistic in that the ships were manned and that the aliens did exactly all they shouldn\u0027t have done, but hey, it\u0027s sci-fi. On a more plausible scenario, the same aliens would have dropped a couple KBO\u0027s on Earth to create a short nuclear winter, at the same time as they seeded LEO with debris to take out all our space infrastructure, and probably dropped a few more precisely targeted kinetics on big industrial and population centers before they even got past the asteroid belt and to where we could take a good look at them, for good measure. If they had any sense, *that* would be the first indication of hostile aliens in our solar system, stuff blowing up in orbit and the skies darkening with shoot as the forests burn... if you are lucky and not close to an impact site.\n\nGranted, you have to wait for a couple hundred years for the dust to settle before you can claim your new pristine ape-less planet and start growing alien crops.
