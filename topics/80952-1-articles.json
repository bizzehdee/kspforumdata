Well, because if we had such a model, we could solve it for Kerbin (and other planets, ofc). Once we have the climate data, we could implement a mod that adds winds and storms. For obvious reasons of CPU load, we could solve the model offline and then fetch the simulation results from pre-made files, so the cpu load would be greatly reduced and we would be able to run this in real time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, we don\u0027t really need a true climate model: we could generate a random climate using coherent noise and call it a day... but where\u0027s the fun in that? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
