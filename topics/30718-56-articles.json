Apart from Elton of course but he\u2019s quite different.\u201D Erlin rubbed his jaw. \u201CI\u2019ll be calling in Gusemy too. He\u2019s a good friend - and he knows Obrett of course, which will help I think.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBoss. If you\u2019ll excuse the expression, what the Kerm are you talking about?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErlin\u2019s expression was unreadable. \u201CA plan. And if the Director of the Berelgan would extend me a \u00A0favour, I\u2019d very much like to run through\u00A0it with him.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb drained his glass, pushed back his chair and walked over to the bar. Helping himself to a handful of crispy greenleaf stems from one of Jorfurt\u0027s well-stocked snack trays, he perched himself on a stool and waited to catch the landlords\u0027s eye. Further along the bar a group of kerbals were calling orders for food and drinks. Jeb winced at one request for a creva chilli with extra firewhisker in the rice, before a call for a round of RT5 caught his attention. He looked over at the group, noting their dark green jackets emblazoned with the logo of a prominent local haulage firm. Nodding in satisfaction, he dipped a greenleaf stem into the spice bowl and took a bite.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What\u0027ll it be, Jeb? Same again, or can I interest you in something a bit different?\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb glanced at the group of hauliers but they either hadn\u2019t heard the landlord or were too busy with their food to notice. \u201CSomething different but not too strong if you don\u2019t mind, Jorfurt.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot too strong, hmmm? Well, since you boys haven\u2019t been building any new engines lately, I figured I\u2019d start a new Rockomax line.\u201D Jorfurt gestured over his shoulder at a row of barrels. \u201CDoesn\u2019t sound like you want a mug of 1P or 2M then.\u201D He reached under the bar for a coffee cup and filled it half full of a foaming ruby ale from the first, much larger, barrel in the row. \u201CGive the 1G a try. The first couple of brews were nothing to much to write home about but I think we\u2019re about there with this batch. Just a hint of blackberry to balance out the sunfruit and a slightly darker malt to give it a bit more body.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb sniffed at the foam. \u201CMmmm, you notice the blackberry.\u201D He sipped the beer, rolling it around his mouth before emptying the cup with a happy smile and wiping his mouth. \u201CI don\u2019t have Genie\u2019s palette but I reckon you\u2019ve got a winner there! A mug of 1G it is please.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bar began to fill up. Jeb ordered a bowl of \u003Cem\u003Edjan\u003C/em\u003E chips and sat nursing his drink, chatting with a steady stream of kerbals who came over to greet him, whilst keeping half an ear on the other conversations filling the room. He took another sip of beer and was somewhat surprised to find an empty mug in his hand. As he set it down on the bar, Jorfurt materialised in front of him.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMug of LV-1 to finish the evening, Jeb?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBob might take you up on that but I think I\u2019ll pass on the root beer right now thanks.\u201D Jeb smacked his lips. \u201CI think I could go another half mug of 1G before curfew, without losing my wits. That blackberry finish really works.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSounds good to me. Make that two half mugs please, Jorfurt.\u201D Bob slid onto the stool next to him. \u201CGene\u2019s on his way, Jeb, assuming he can extract himself from his group of grumpy farmers.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb cocked an eyebrow at him. \u201COver-inspected and under-staffed farmers?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob took a \u003Cem\u003Edjan\u003C/em\u003E from Jeb\u2019s bowl. \u201CYep. One kermol swore he\u2019d never be growing redfruit again if the blithering idiot - or words to that effect - inspectors were going to make him empty out his entire truck one fruit at a time.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb looked thoughtful. \u201CPatbro said something similar about his white bean crop but then he had the bright idea of unloading them through a fencing wire sieve. You could probably do something similar with grains and such like.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo we\u2019re going for the fruit and veg growers then.\u201D Bob took a pull of beer. \u201CMmm, you were right about that finish.\u201D He shook his head. \u201CSorry. Yeah, fruit and veg growers, or anyone hauling anything much larger than a breadfruit.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat should cover tubers then. Fine - we can work on the cereal guys later, once we\u2019ve been out there for a bit. Evening, Genie.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEvening. Mug of RT5 for me, Jeb, next time you catch Jorfurt\u2019s eye.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb grinned. \u201CRough time with the kermol?\u201D He slid his drink over to Geneney. \u201CTry before you buy?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney took a cautious sip from the proffered mug. \u201CMmmm, that\u2019s not bad.\u201D He took a larger sip. \u201CThat\u2019ll do nicely in fact. Blackberry and redfruit?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYep. One of Jorfurt\u2019s latest.\u201D Jeb affected a mock indignant look. \u201CFrom his Rockomax line no less. This is the 1G - apparently the 1P and 2M are a bit more substantial.\u201D Jeb spotted Jorfurt bustling past and held up a coin before pointing at the first barrel in the row. \u201CSo it looks like there\u2019s a market for our little plan then?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney nodded. \u201CI would say so.\u201D He was interrupted by a large, green-jacketed kerbal weaving his way towards them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHeeyyyyy - its the interplanetary boys! Jeb, my kerb - how are ya?!\u201D The newcomer attempted to clap Jeb on the shoulder but only succeeded in stumbling sideways into Geneney and narrowly missing Bob\u2019s mug with one flailing arm. Geneney offered the stranger a steadying hand whilst Bob removed his drink to a more prudent distance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAhh, thank you my friend!\u201D The newcomer peered at Geneney, brow knotted in concentration. \u201CSay - aren\u2019t you that Geneneneneny fellow? I\u2019ve seen ya on the TV, sitting behind that fancy desk with all the shiny buttons on.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHoy, Len! Quit bothering those folks and get this mug of water into you before you make a bigger fool of yourself.\u201D Another green-jacketed kerbal strode towards them, coming to a sudden halt as he caught sight of Bob. \u201CGreat Kerm above - haven\u2019t seen you boys in here for an age. Thought you were all busy getting us set for flying out to Duna?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob made a face. \u201CWish we were. Need to build something to fly first and getting all the parts for that with transport the way it is right now\u2026?\u201D He shrugged and reached for the snack tray.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou getting caught up in that grolnisch too?\u201D The other\u2019s face darkened. \u201CWe\u2019ve got produce rotting in the trailers one way and goods backed up back to the blighted port the other way. Trucks are needing extra maintenance, they\u2019ve been taken apart that often.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI hear that,\u201D Geneney put in sourly. \u201CClose the door too hard these days and half my car falls apart. Kerm knows what\u2019ll happen if I hit a decent pothole.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat are the haulers doing about it?\u201D asked Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot much to do. More hands would be a start; quicker the inspections get done, quicker the goods get moving. Can\u2019t hire them for love or money though, seems they\u2019re either joining up or heading for the hills.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow about volunteers?\u201D asked Bob, through a mouthful of jerky. He was answered with a snort.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat would be right. Who the hell volunteers to sort through rotting cabbages by hand, looking for Kerm seeds?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood point.\u201D Bob inspected the bottom of his mug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnyway - we\u2019d better be getting this one back home before he starts tripping over his own feet. Good to see you folks.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou too,\u201D said Geneney. He clapped Len on the shoulder. \u201CTake it easy, friend.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb stood in the doorway scuffing at the already-worn floor covering with the toe of his boot and watching a familiar truck pull up in the car park outside. Two kerbals jumped out and began unloading the long, flat packages lashed to the back. The grumbling wheeze of tailgate hydraulics reached his ears and he smiled despite himself, remembering a much younger Calzer and Tomcas unloading kegs for a long ago beach party. He leaned against the door frame for support, eyes losing their focus as the rest of the evening came back in a rush: \u00A0Ornie gesticulating at distant kerbals, explaining the rules of shepherdball, Ornie squatting by the barbecue pit, trickling spicy sauce over meatcakes. Bob\u2019s singing, a blurry image of the bottom of a beer mug, bitter reminiscences with Ornie\u2019s the voice of reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb wiped the corner of his eyes, forcing a cheerful grin onto his face as the two kerbals staggered past, lugging a slab of cardboard packaging between them. \u201CWait up - I\u2019ll get the doors!\u201D He squeezed past into the bare reception area and swung open the double doors leading into the main building, kicking a door wedge under each. The cloying smell of new paint mingled with the sharp, resinous odour of fresh sawdust enveloped them all amidst a clamour of sawing and hammering. A radio played a raucous tune in the background.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAngle brackets dotted the concrete floor, marking out a central corridor with office spaces to either side and a larger, communal area at the far end of the room. Jeb skirted around a group of kerbals squatting by a junction box set into the floor and past a larger team of kerbals busy assembling the partition walls. He saw Camrie standing by a window, scribbling notes on a large whiteboard and walked over to join her. \u201CHow\u2019s it going?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCamrie frowned at a list of names on the whiteboard before underlining a handful of them. \u201CGood. Be better when we can move a couple of filing cabinets across and I\u2019ve got a desk to work at, but so far, so good.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CVolunteers still coming in?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh Kerm yes. We could use a few more with cars and I\u2019m not convinced that some of them know what they\u2019re signing up for, but we\u2019re not going to be short when we open for business.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb studied the whiteboard. \u201CSorting through rotting cabbages by hand apparently. Which reminds me - have you got half an hour this afternoon to brainstorm a couple of morale boosters?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAlready on it but sure. Once we\u2019re properly up and running, I\u2019ve primed the logistics teams over at the VABs to send us a two-weekly breakdown of any imported components and whatever hardware they\u2019ve gone into. As soon as we\u2019ve got a marketing team put together, I\u2019m planning to have them to work up some cardboard cutouts of the major parts - engines, tanks, capsules, stuff like that.\u201D Camrie gestured at the far end of the room. \u201CI figure we\u2019ll have ourselves a trophy wall in the communal area.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COf everything they\u2019ve helped to build?\u201D Jeb nodded. \u201CGood plan. I was thinking back to those RT-5 tables we built for Jorfurt back in the early days and wondering if we could do something similar here but it didn\u2019t seem to fit somehow. I like your idea better.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCamrie tossed her marker pen into a box on the floor. \u201CWe\u2019re getting ahead of ourselves though. First thing we need to do is sort out the paperwork and get this company incorporated. Which reminds me - have you had any bright ideas for names.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNothing that you\u2019d want to paint on a sign.\u201D Jeb scowled at the floor then looked up with a sudden sparkle in his eye. \u201CHave you got a waste paper basket around here?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CProbably. Why?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb grinned. \u201CI\u2019m thinking we\u2019ll do this the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E way. Get everyone to scribble down a name on a slip of paper and pull one out of the basket.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCamrie rolled her eyes. \u201CSure. Just as long as we don\u2019t end up calling ourselves the Kolus Kabbage Kompany or some other wild inspiration.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPoint. Management reserves the right to draw three names and pick the best. Okay, you find a basket and I\u2019ll go speak to the troops.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb walked over to the radio and switched it off. \u201CMorning folks!\u201D The general hubbub died away as everyone turned to face him. \u201CGood to see so many faces \u00A0here - takes me right back to the old days. And just like then, what we need to start this company off, is a good name!\u201D Jeb watched Camrie passing out pens and slips of paper to a group of quizzical looking builders. \u201CWhich, I have to confess, I\u2019m needing a bit of help with. So - have a think over lunch and if anything comes to mind, scribble it down, and hand it back to Camrie or me. We\u2019ll draw three names, Camrie\u2019ll pick the one she likes best and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll go with!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb spotted a raised hand. \u201CYes?\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA serious looking kerbal stepped forward. \u201CI\u2019ve been thinking some about names myself, Jeb, and I was wondering if you had a minute to hear it? It\u2019s my cousin gave me the idea see, so I can\u2019t properly write it down as mine - that would seem wrong.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb blinked. \u201CUhh, sure.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other nodded in thanks. \u201CAppreciate that. Now my cousin Halby - he\u2019s a lumberkerb down in Veidd and he tells me one of his jobs is cleaning up after a storm. He takes a walk through the forest and checks all the fallen trees - anything dead or rotted, he marks with a red cross but anything sound gets a white cross. Seems to me, that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing here; cleaning up after the storm, sorting out the rotted goods, helping folks ship what\u2019s sound. So I was thinking that the White Cross Company would be as good a name as any for us.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA murmur of voices rippled across the room. Jeb caught Camrie\u2019s eye and received a discreet thumbs-up in reply. He beckoned her over to join him before taking a place on the floor. Camrie cleared her throat. \u201CWell that just saved us some time. I think we\u2019ve got a winner there, people.\u201D The murmur become a rumble of approval. \u201CMoving right on, the next thing we need is a proper logo to go with the name.\u201D She pointed at Jeb. \u201CEveryone remembers the tilted rocket, even if they couldn\u2019t tell you anything about the Spaceship Parts Company other than the kerbal who started it. The White Cross Company needs something memorable too.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the electricians climbed to his feet. \u201CI\u2019m figuring that my cousin might be able to help out there. She does signs and that sort of thing.\u201D He looked at Camrie. \u201CI\u2019ll ask her to drop by, boss, see what she can do for us.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you,\u201D Camrie made a mental note to speak to him later. \u201CIn the meantime, if anyone\u2019s got any ideas, I\u2019m all ears. Doesn\u2019t have to be much - quick sketch will be fine so we can tell what we\u2019re looking at. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, good kerbals, I\u2019ve got some articles of incorporation to fill out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHoy! Wrong lane, ya\u2026\u201D The trucker leaned on his horn and wound down his window. \u201CYou blind or something?! Road freight only in this lane - says so on that big sign back there ya fardling\u2026\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother, equally irate voice came back at him from the truck in front. \u201CAnd yourself, mate! Quit bothering the hired help, get your thumb off the horn and shove it back up where it belongs!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThese are with\u003Cem\u003E you, \u003C/em\u003ELen?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYeah they are. So back off and let them work!\u201D Len rolled his truck into the inspection bay and set the parking brake. He picked his manifest off the passenger seat and scrambled out of his cab, as the white car pulled up behind him. Handing the documents to a stony-faced inspector, Lem set about undoing the long row of buckles holding the side curtain of his trailer closed. He hauled the curtain open and secured it. With a rumbling whine, a forklift truck slid forward and began unloading the pallets of fruit crates from the back of his trailer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFive boiler-suited kerbals hopped out of the white car and formed an orderly queue at the nearest wash stand. One at a time, they scrubbed up, four of them pulling on blue rubber gloves before waiting by the nearest inspection table.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo sooner had the the first crate had been unloaded, than the fifth kerbal had helped Len heave it onto the inspection table. Under the watchful eyes of the inspectors, the other four rapidly emptied the crate of redfruit, held it up for inspection and began re-packing it. One of them retrieved a roll of tape from his pocket, tore off two strips and stuck them over a corner of the crate. Spotting the frown from one of the inspectors, he held up his hands. \u201CIt\u2019ll come off. I\u2019m just marking the finished lots, so we don\u2019t get them mixed up.\u201D The inspector stepped forward and peeled up the tape. He shook his head and stuck it back down before rejoining his colleagues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time a fraught-looking official inspection team arrived from across the bay, the forklift operator was loading the first pallet back onto Len\u2019s trailer, each of the crates stacked atop it marked with a white cross. They watched one of the boiler-suited kerbals dig her fists into the small of her back and stretch, before turning her attention back to the redfruit. Len spotted their confused looks and walked over to join them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThere\u2019s another table over there if you\u2019re looking for something to do?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe eldest worker yawned, not bothering to cover his mouth. \u201CLong shift - \u2018scuse me. Are we even supposed to be here? Looks like you\u2019re covered for this load.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLen shook his head. \u201CNope - I\u2019m due a stint from you yet. Besides, the faster I get through here, the happier the boss is going to be.\u201D He jerked a thumb over his shoulder. \u201CAnd the happier those boys out there are going to be.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut who are those folks at the table?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLen shrugged. \u201CBlighted if I know. Hired help is all the boss said and I ain\u2019t complaining. They don\u2019t say a lot but they\u2019re shifting the freight quick enough and that\u2019s good enough for me.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other eyed the white car parked behind Len\u2019s truck. On the door, a stylised hand clutched a dripping paintbrush which had apparently just been used to paint a white cross on a tree stump. \u201CGot themselves some fancy paintwork, whoever they are.\u201D He shrugged. \u201CWhatever. I was told to get over here and you reckon you\u2019re still due a stint?\u201D The worker turned to his companions. \u201CRight you lot! I want to see that spare table set up and I want to see crates off pallets if it\u2019s not too much trouble!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith three full inspection tables working flat-out, the checked redfruit crates quickly began to pile up and, after a brief altercation with the fork-lift operator, Len decided his time would be better spent stacking pallets and supervising the loading, rather than sorting fruit. He tapped one of the jump-suited kerbals on the shoulder and explained. The other nodded and flashed him a quick smile, blue-gloved hands busy unloading yet another crate. Len glanced at his watch, eyes widening in pleased surprise, and went back to work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMug of \u003Cem\u003Edjeng\u003C/em\u003E for the road, mate?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLen cinched up the last buckle on his trailer, wiped his hands on a rag and turned to face the worker. \u201CDon\u2019t mind if I do.\u201D He took the mug and drained half of its lukewarm, stewed contents in a single gulp. \u201CThanks.\u201D He glanced at the last of the jump-suited kerbals standing, clipboard in hand, beside their car and sighed. \u201CBest get the paperwork sorted then.\u201D Mug in hand, he walked over to him. \u201CWhat am I signing?\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other looked up at him. \u201CJust our order confirmation and tracking form, sir. Twenty-four pallets of redfruit to Barkton depot, nine of them packed and marked by us.\u201D He checked his watch and carefully wrote down the time. \u201CCould you sign here please, by your company name?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLen read over the form, nodded and scrawled his signature on the indicated line.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you, sir. Speaking for the White Cross Company, it was a pleasure doing business with you. Oh - and if you could possibly keep the crates marked during storage, we\u2019d be grateful.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLen looked at him askance. \u201CMind telling me why?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CQuality control, sir. Your boss has us contracted to help move the same pallets out to Kallahat. It sounds a bit corny, I know but once a crate is marked with a white cross, well we feel responsible for it. And if any other \u00A0bunch of seffleks\u2026\u201D Len\u2019s eyebrows shot up at the unexpected vulgarity, \u201C\u2026starts painting a white cross on their crates and then doing a slipshod inspection job - well we want to know about that too.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLen stared. \u201CYou aiming to shop them to the Inspectorate?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHopefully it won\u2019t come to that but yes, if necessary.\u201D A blue gloved finger pointed at the inspectors. \u201CIf we do our job right, maybe those good kerbals in the uniforms will start letting folks like you get away with a single inspection.\u201D The finger flipped over to point at the queue of trucks still waiting to get into the inspection bay. \u201CWhich is about the only way we\u2019re going to knock those queues down to size.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd put you out of business.\u201D Len received a crooked smile in reply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMaybe one day. Right now, if you could put the word around that we\u2019re looking for customers, we\u2019d be grateful.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLen shrugged. \u201CSure. You do good work even if my old grandad would tell you that you\u2019re crazier than a gronnek with its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Part Action Window\u0022\u003Epaw\u003C/abbr\u003E in a trap.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrett waited for the young leaves to lift clear of her scalp before easing out from underneath them and climbing carefully to her feet. She straightened the bedcovers and turned to her companions, a rare smile tugging at her lips. Erlin blew out his cheeks in relief. \u201CIt\u2019s all right?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CVery much so,\u201D Obrett answered. \u201CIt didn\u2019t recognise me as its Keeper - which is a good sign all by itself - but once it got used to me it started chattering away, talking about \u2018things gone\u2019 and \u2018happy kerbals\u2019. I recognised the shape of your test plots too, in all the babble.\u201D Obrett\u2019s smile turned faintly wistful. \u201CIt\u2019s been a long time since my Kerm was that young.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalsy leaned forward, hands on his knees. \u201CSo you\u2019d say it was healthy?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes I would. A normal, healthy young Kerm, grown from a frozen seed.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CElton will be pleased at the success of his last experiment.\u201D Halsy exchanged a look with Erlin, sitting opposite him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019ll need to tell the Council too, boss.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u003Cem\u003EYou\u2019ll \u003C/em\u003Eneed to tell the Council,\u201D Erlin corrected. Halsy looked at him unhappily.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI guess. Now that its healthy and all.\u201D He shook his head. \u201CThis wasn\u2019t a promotion I was looking for.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusemy coughed. \u201CI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m following this conversation,\u201D he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErlin patted the Kerm trunk by his side, as if for reassurance. \u201CIt\u2019s quite simple,\u201D he said. \u201CNow that we know that a frozen seed can produce a healthy Kerm, there\u2019s only one more step to take.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe smile fell from Obrett\u2019s face. Gusemy sat bolt upright in shock. \u201CYou must be joking!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COn the contrary,\u201D said Erlin, \u201CI\u2019ve never been more serious in my life. Halsy and I have discussed this at length and he\u2019s kindly agreed to take over responsibility for the Berelgan in the interim.\u201D He raised his hands. \u201CPlease don\u2019t go to the trouble of trying to dissuade me, dear friends - my mind is quite made up. Its a necessary step and one that we already know is possible. Unlike Jonton, I will not be taking a leap into the dark.\u201D Erlin\u2019s tone softened. \u201CHalsy will make an excellent Director and the Berelgan, agriculturally speaking, is effectively isolated from the outside world. If anything should happen - to the Kerm or myself - we\u2019re in a rare place where we will not harm anyone else.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusemy buried his head in his hands. Obrett opened her mouth to speak, then closed it again at the expression on Erlin\u2019s face. \u201CYou are going to speak to Enely and Jonton first.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErlin nodded. \u201COf course. Neither did I intend to do this alone.\u201D The question hung in the air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u003Cem\u003EYou\u003C/em\u003E will need a Keeper.\u201D Obrett steeled herself. \u201C\u003Cem\u003EI \u003C/em\u003Ewill need to return to my Grove first\u2026and put everything in order before we plant the thirty-eighth cutting.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cu style=\u0022color:rgb(53,60,65);font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:underline;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cfont\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#0b0114\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-115-now-and-forever/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=3269747\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 86\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E \u00A0 \u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cu style=\u0022color:rgb(53,60,65);font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:underline;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cfont\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#0b0114\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-115-now-and-forever/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=3390910\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 88\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-01T15:14:05Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2020 03:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DualDesertEagle","CreatedById":161533,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-10T09:55:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the one thing that sucks BIG TIME\u00A0about having caught up: Having to wait for MOAR!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022;.;\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, ur not gonna get me out of this thread so easily\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-10T16:02:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m hoping to get a good chunk written this weekend.
