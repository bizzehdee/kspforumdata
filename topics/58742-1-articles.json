I get into orbit and want to do EVA experiments (Spacewalking, checking goo etc), I click the EVA button on the portrait and the guy appears outside the pod, now sometimes I get the \u0027Let Go\u0027 Option, sometimes I don\u0027t (which I find a bit strange) but even when I do get the option, I can\u0027t get him to let go. I managed to do it once but then I couldn\u0027t get the guy to move and the ship ended up moving too far away for me to re-board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo Firstly, is there any reason or situation in which I wouldn\u0027t get the \u0027let go\u0027 option appear and secondly, when I do get him to let go, how do I control it and is there anything I need to be careful of?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vetrox","CreatedById":69796,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T18:04:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might not always get the let go option because sometimes you get thrown out of the ship for some reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo move around with an EVA press \u0022R\u0022 then try moving around\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T19:14:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbal should spawn on the ladder of the module, but sometimes it spawns already in space.
