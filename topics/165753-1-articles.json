I figured it was just some random boot error, and did the old turn-it-on-and-off-again fix. The grey screen came back for a second but disappeared and I logged on as usual. I haven\u0027t had a problem until tonight, and the screen did the same thing. I turned the computer on and off again two or three times before I was able to log on with a normal screen. I\u0027ve backed up most of my important documents, but I have several copies of KSP and a bunch of other random stuff on my HDD. I use an HP Pavilion dv6 running Windows 7. A Google search pulled up no useful results, and I\u0027m wondering if anyone else has ever seen this or knows what in the world it is. My thinking is that it\u0027s the LCD screen itself or something with the video card.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPicture of my screen:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/jYe0W\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/jYe0W\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qzgy","CreatedById":160994,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-23T05:29:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWonder if it\u0027s an issue with a wire between the motherboard and the screen...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-23T05:46:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf possible, connect your notebook to an external display and watch again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-25T13:58:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my experience, laptop screens are very vulnerable to physical damage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeems to be the only thing that makes sense, if it was a software issue severe enough to do that, you probably wouldnt get gaps in between where you can log\u00A0on normally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving said that, my dual-screen setup sometimes works and sometimes doesnt (reverts to 600x800 on secondary monitor) and for the life of me I cant figure out what causes it (everything confirmed in normal working order), but I can always fix it by turning off-and-on until it starts up in the correct configuration -\u00A0so its possible I dont know anything!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheKosanianMethod","CreatedById":163034,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-25T18:44:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223178363\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022165753\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221506145614\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129408\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerbiloid\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 9/23/2017 at 1:46 AM, kerbiloid said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf possible, connect your notebook to an external display and watch again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHadn\u0027t thought of that.

That\u0027s damage to the wiring between the laptop body and the screen, and if my experience with my own HP pavillion laptop with the same issue says much, it\u0027ll get worse and worse if you don\u0027t fix it. My computer has had the same issue for about an year or two now, and the screen is barely hanging on and it only doesn\u0027t flicker and bugs up in a very specific position where it\u0027s held up against a wall. The issue has nothing to do with software from what i can tell, it\u0027s purely physical. If you get it fixed soon it should be an easy fix, although if you just never bother fixing it you could end up with a broken screen hinge that excacerbates the problem (I fiddled with mine until it broke and made the screen loose).

As I can still click on stuff while it is frozen, but it only loads when it unfreezes.
