Seriously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn vanilla, Kerbals can only do a few things that unmanned probes cannot.

KAS lets them pump gas. Kethane lets you convert Kerbals into rocket fuel. I can\u0027t think of any more off the top of my head.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in any case, all of these things are just menial labor. There is thus no reason to pay Kerbals more than minimum wage, nor give them any more training than making sure they know which way to turn rover lug nuts. And given all compartment labels and sticky notes I see in the IVA views, and the fact that Kerbals are measured for stupidity instead of intelligence, makes me think they\u0027re incapable of learning any more than this anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow consider that even without any life support requirements at present, all parts capable of carrying Kerbals weigh more than their corresponding probe cores. Even the lawn chair is a net weight gain because it requires you to have a probe core or crewed pod first. Thus, taking Kerbals along means you need a bigger, more expensive rocket than you would otherwise, and for this you just get a limited amount of menial labor in very special circumstances. And this situation will only get worse if or when life support becomes part of the vanilla game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then on top of this, if putting a Kerbal in space imposes a requirement to bring him home eventually (or awards you bonus points if you do), you\u0027ve got an even worse situation. Now you have to build a return capability into your rocket, making it even bigger, heavier, and thus more expensive to launch than it would be taking Kerbals on a 1-way trip. Combine this with life support requirements and you\u0027ve now got a severe limitation on mission duration, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s no escaping any of this. So, for a moment, shift your mental focus out of the capsule with Jeb and into the corner office of KSP. After all, your true role in the game is that of the top suit, the CEO/CFO of the whole space program. You\u0027re not flying the rockets yourself, you\u0027re trying to run a space program efficiently. You now have to cost-justify every design decision and there are no rival superpowers on Kerbin so pure propaganda stunts like planting flags on other worlds are totally valueless. Given the above, there are hardly any grounds upon which you can justify sending Kerbals to space. About the best case you can make for them is if you\u0027ve got a huge fleet of probe rovers on a world that are continually breaking wheels. Then it might be worthwhile to send 1 Kerbal there permanently as an on-call repairman. But it would probably be more cost-effective to design better rovers or reprogram their probe cores to be more careful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But what about career mode?\u0022 you ask. Well, that depends on whose career you\u0027re talking about. As the top executive of KSP, I\u0027m worried about MY career, not Jeb\u0027s. Jeb is an expendable workerbee. I however, have a multi-million Kollar mortgage, am going through a divorce, have a pregnant mistress, am putting 3 kids through Ivy League universities at once, and just lost a fortune in a stock market crash. I can\u0027t afford to lose my job so I don\u0027t want to get fired for bankrupting the KSP. I want my organization to stand up to a Congressional grandstanding witch-hunt when an election year happens to coincide with a recession.

Keep in mind though, that the further from the Earth/Kerbin you get, the more effective a Human/Kerbal is at performing science over an unmanned probe. You need to include a boat load of extra stuff, but look at a Mars mission. 20\u002B minute lag time, so you need to automate the crap out of stuff. You are still limited to doing a very small number of tasks during a Sol. A human on the other hand in situ doesn\u0027t have to wait around 20 minutes to get the feedback on an action performed. They can collect sample, run spectrographic readings, drill a rock core sample, take atmospheric readings, magnetic readings, cosmic radiation readings, decide a sample 2 rocks over looks better than the one he just started drilling, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA human in place on Mars likely could conduct 10-30x as much \u0022scientific\u0022 work in a Sol than a robotic rover could and especially could cover a lot more ground. That wouldn\u0027t necessarily be true somewhere like the Moon/Mun where lightspeed lag is nice and low (~4s round trip), even then though the bipedal ability of a human and general flexibility makes it easier to perform some tasks than a robotic probe can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, you also have the penalty of all the life support, living space, etc. That makes the mission much more expensive, but there are potentially huge pay offs for boots on the ground. For the Moon the pay offs are much more limited. Mars and especially outer planetary moons/Kuiper belt objects...pays are HUGE compared to a robotic probe. Even simply an orbiter with no boots on the ground. The New Horizon\u0027s probe has a 64Gbit solid state data recorder (8GB). It\u0027ll take I think around 6 months to stream back all of the data it collects after it passes Pluto and at best Scientists will be able to adjust its course slightly and program in a few tasks as it gets close, then it is purely automated. Have a crewed mission and yes, mass and dV would jump hugely, but the science you could perform would also be orders of magnitude higher. You\u0027d have real time repositioning and retasking instead of a 2-way loop of, what? 8\u002Bhrs? 12\u002Bhrs? Even the sneaker net aspect that you could acquire a lot more data (IE 6 months to stream back 8GB, or Terabytes upon Terabytes by sneaker net). You could do that with a probe as well, but the command loop would massively slow things down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoots on the ground is sometimes about being able to get the data in a shorter period of time. Assuming 3 years out and 3 years back, data is a pretty tiny amount of mass, in 6 years plus 3 months there you could collect easily 1,000x as much data as New Horizons could on a straight outbound mission.

If the thing doesn\u0027t need to be told every little thing, but can at least handle its basic functions and daily chores all by itself, then there is no time-based benefit to having crew there. Plus, you can cut your staffing expenses at KSC because you don\u0027t need to babysit the thing 24/7. All you have to do is give the probe some general orders and a list of priorities and let it go from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut this is sort of beside the point. Just talking about gameplay mechanics, there\u0027s no real difference from the player\u0027s POV in having a probe ship or a crewed ship. The player still navigates it, the player still decides where to land it, the player activates all the moving parts, etc., in exactly the same way whether there are Kerbals aboard or not. So, unless you\u0027ve built a whole complex, multi-component mission or base around using KAS to move resources between units, the Kerbals and the heavy parts that hold them are just dead weight. Their only purpose is to pose for screenshots beside their flag, and maybe fix the odd flat tire. If you can live without those things, then in vanilla you have no incentive at all to make crewed ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that I\u0027m not saying I\u0027m happy with this because a great part of MY enjoyment of KSP stems from the antics of Kerbals, the unexpected disasters they can cause on EVA, and the desperate attempts to rescue them from all sorts of predicaments. But that\u0027s all in sandbox mode where everything is freely available in unlimited quantities. When you start putting pricetags on parts, fuel, research, Kerbals, whatever, suddenly all this changes. No longer will you be able to shrug it off when a lander crashes and set about mounting a rescue mission. And you might not be able to afford the increased lifter size required by a capsule compared to a probe core anyway. So, putting zero Kerbals in space means smaller, cheaper rockets, no need to ever mount a rescue mission, and no explaining to the press how you managed to kill or maroon Kerbals, without sacrificing any significant mission capability or even changing how you interact with your rockets. This is all good business sense, and if you\u0027re paying the bills and generating the revenue, then you\u0027re running a business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I suppose Squad could increase Kerbal functionality by inventing new \u0022science\u0022 things that only they can do in vanilla. But how long do you think it would take modders to make parts that can do these same things? So unless there\u0027s some \u0022ironman\u0022 gameplay option for career mode that locks out mods, there\u0027d still be no functional incentive to send Kerbals anywhere. Another option would be that you get bonus points for sending Kerbals and planting flags, even if they don\u0027t actually do anything for you. But this reduces Kerbals to mere propaganda tools, and propaganda requires some sort of adversarial context. On peaceful, unmilitarized Kerbin, however, this context doesn\u0027t exist, so such a use of Kerbals would be rather artificial. Now, if KSP was assumed to be a private business, and there was a rival, AI-run business over at the easter egg KSC, and you could have a real space race with them, and you attracted customers by out-doing each other, then propaganda stunts would have a proper context without bringing war into it. I\u0027d really enjoy a game like that, especially if it was like Spore where the AI used uploaded designs from other players \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut until that day comes, I think career mode will be more about the career of the KSP CEO than about the career of an astronaut.

It\u0027s plausible to me that a robot could be more productive than a human, as they don\u0027t have to get all EVA\u0027d up just to do anything. Getting prepped for EVA takes several hours, and packing up afterwards a similar amount, plus all the workload of routine maintenance and testing on suits and equipment. EVA time itself is constrained by consumables and radiation exposure. So each hour of actual work done in EVA would have a large overhead in terms of support and maintenance. Humans might be able to work fairly quickly and very flexibly, but the actual productive part of their work would be short, with large amounts of time and effort sunk into supporting that productive work. Meanwhile the busy little robot could be methodically working 24/7 if its power source allowed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETortoise and hare situation? Quite possibly.

The only difference between probe and crewed, at any point between VAB and landing, is that the crewed rockets have more mass and thus (in vanilla) also higher part counts. And after that point, it\u0027s pretty much all the same, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, as you sit there in front of your monitor with your beverage of choice, it can\u0027t help but occur to you that KSP probes fly just as well as Kerbals because you\u0027re doing the exact same things with both and have to make zero allowances one way or the other. And it also can\u0027t help but occur to you that if you didn\u0027t have to waste time moving Kerbals from lander to rover, risking total destruction every time a Kerbal lets go of a ladder, you could accomplish the mission faster and in greater safety. And furthermore, it becomes impossible to ignore the fact that the only benefits Kerbals provide are fixing the odd flat tire and occasionally being able to flip rovers back right side up if the gravity is low enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe result of all this is the realization that your Kerbals are only providing menial labor that is only occasionally useful. Do you need them to design the rocket? No. Do you need them to fly the rocket? No. Do you need them to carry scientific instruments around on some other planet? No. You can do all the above with just probe cores. So why include Kerbals given that the vast bulk of what they do is merely adding unnecessary mass to payloads? How can you justify gaining any more research points for doing this when it goes against all economic sense and there are no rival superpowers to 1-up, and the Kerbal is only capable of menial labor anyway?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-24T00:11:01Z\u0022 title=\u002208/24/2013 12:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Geschosskopf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-24T01:27:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat may be the case now, but in the future...even just in the next update, kerbals will be doing a lot more than just the simple tasks they do now.
