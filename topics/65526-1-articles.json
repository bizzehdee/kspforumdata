I have made sure, that no collision boxes overlap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut still, when i speed up my craft on the runway, it starts to violently slip sideways, tear off winglets and crash. If i manage to bring it in the air, it behaves nicely, until the landing gear touch the ground.

The lander just seems to be consistently shoved to one side, forcing me to compensate constantly with the thrusters just to keep dock alignment. Then, even after having docked, the whole ship will gradually try to spin off-axis, as if it were in atmosphere. and its orbit will become increasingly elliptical over time, resulting in an eventual escape from the SoI, or impact with the ground. Staged decouplers suddenly explode and zoom off-screen as if they had been ejected in atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s some kind of drag force being applied here, and it never used to happen before. Worse, it seems there\u0027s no real answer for what causes it or how to fix it. I\u0027ve seen responses that indicate any orbital velocity under 750m/s can result in this phenomenon (krakensbane), but that doesn\u0027t really make any sense to me, because that\u0027s above escape velocity from the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, and I\u0027ve had massive multi-part ships orbiting anywhere from 12km to 50km up, moving at about 500m/s without issues before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPerfectly fine and stable for more than 2 years of game time\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/v0WbV87l.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022v0WbV87l.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOver 1 year in orbit without issues here, too.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-jxchK7WG_20/UvQRs7yEEUI/AAAAAAAAYlQ/QnvUADli-X0/s640/screenshot349.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot349.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ENow this one, much smaller and with a smaller part count, is experiencing the drag issues...\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xNpitPzA8A8/U1lRQ3WKrbI/AAAAAAAAZhE/jn7Czg7S9m4/s640/screenshot940.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot940.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice the periapsis of 14,214.

The elliptical orbit is my own doing, experimenting with getting up to 800m/s (before discovering that was beyond escape velocity), but now the PE has risen of its own accord due to whatever weird drag is being applied. :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-hbttVanQ53w/U1lRPziBqFI/AAAAAAAAZg0/DBvJTbLhCTc/s640/screenshot939.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot939.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven worse, the effect doesn\u0027t seem to be attached to any particular ship.

Originally, the plan was to fly out there, then assemble the station on-orbit with the landers, moving the crew compartments up to the lower four-way dock near the top. The landers are kept stable with a decoupler linked to the main vessel with a strut. It was when I initially staged those decouplers that I saw the weird \u0022explode and zoom away\u0022 effect, followed by the landers all drifting away sideways. Even after I stopped their relative motion, they\u0027d just eventually resume their sideways drift, accelerating as they went.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThinking the problem was with the ship, I sent the one lander with crew down to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn surface, along with another automated one, then de-orbited the rest of the vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, I went back to the VAB, re-designed the thing so that it didn\u0027t need to be assembled later, and removed the resulting extraneous parts, including the strut-linked decouplers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I got back to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn with it, all seemed to be okay at a glance, but bringing the crewed lander back up, I saw it drifting sideways again. NavyFish\u0027s docking indicator was twitching badly; certainly far more than it should have been with those small and stable landers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething has changed in the persistent file to cause this, I\u0027m sure of it, but I\u0027m completely at a loss as to what setting I should be looking at as a potential cause.[/TD]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/TR]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/TABLE]\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
