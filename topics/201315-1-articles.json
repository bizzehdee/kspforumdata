I reinstalled the game after a period away and the screen resolution was set wrong. You also have an option to play (or not play) in windowed mode but it sounds like you know about that already?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther than that check your graphics card as sometimes resolutions can be changed there as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
