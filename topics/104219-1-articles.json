For example, I want to build a colony on Laythe, but it is important to send an engineer that already know how to fix wheels.\n\nLooking at the persistent.sfs file, we can see that there is a CAREER\\_LOG, that records the exp that the kerbal already got from going back home, and there is the FLIGHT\\_LOG, that shows what he already did but is yet to be granted as exp when he lands on Kerbin.\n\nWhat I propose is an in-flight window where you can list all your kerbals, giving information about where he is at the moment, skills and level, (like in the Astronaut Complex), and also expand his Career Log and Flight Log, showing what he already done, what was already granted as exp and what is waiting him to go home to be granted. Also would be interesting if you could select one kerbal and have the option jump to the craft where he is.\n\nI was planning this to be my first mod, but after researching a little I discovered that first I must learn to program in C, something that is not possible right now. From what I saw it is not as \u0022simple\u0022 as making a new part. So I would like to know if someone already had this idea, if there is someone already developing it or if it would be difficult to make."},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T06:25:00Z","Content":"There are at least two such mods, but I can\u0027t recall them at once, until getting to home computer."},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T07:56:28Z","Content":"Related: there are mods that will let you level up Kerbals in the field, if that\u0027s what you want.
