Then, to make KSP load it when asked to start an existing game, its name has to be changed in \u0022persistent.sfs\u0022, therefore overwriting the persistent.sfs with the error.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout the reported error: the savegame seems be missing one of the very many objects KSP deals with, while loading them and not finding one as expected an error is shown. Can\u0027t tell what is missing unless that savegame (and best, also the output_log.txt/player.log) are uploaded to some file hosting service and then linked here for anybody to check.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
