I\u0027ve read a few threads on this forum about the topic: from players and developers. Most of them seem to say it\u0027s not possible. At this point I\u0027m keen to believe my fellow programmers. The past few weeks have been a mix of excitement and disappointment. That said, I have managed to create a Multiplayer plugin for KSP... sort of. Watch the video (skip to 00:20 if you don\u0027t want to wait) and come back (more information in the video comments):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/-xLXAhaQzmA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you just watched is in fact two clients interacting with each other over TCP/IP. It is also just two vessels rotating in space. But, it\u0027s multiplayer by definition! Which brings me what this actually is meant to be. As mentioned, this project was meant to be a proof of concept. I never expected, or still expect, to see something robust and actually working. I don\u0027t really believe it\u0027s even possible at this point without some changes to the engine itself. I also don\u0027t know enough about how KSP handles vessel positions and orbits to say \u0022yes it will work\u0022 or not. This is also a learning exercise for me to get familiar with the APIs and also learn a thing or two about client/server interaction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo why am I even posting about this? To a degree I want people to see this and feel hopeful, even if I just got your hopes up for nothing.

They\u0027re a smart group and they have a great modding community to get ideas from. Even if no one ever makes it happen here, I\u0027m sure those guys would figure it out, if willing. That said, the timewarp issue is a big issue but for now I\u0027m just worrying about the basics.

I know there are a lot of threads about this already but I think discussion is important to get these ideas out and figure out what might be the best way to handle certain situations. There may not be one solution to the timewarp issue... we may have to take into consideration multiple scenarios and implement differently based on individual situations. Let\u0027s just be civil and not beat a the dead horse though. As mentioned above, timewarp isn\u0027t something I even want to think about working on right now.

Yes, timewarp is solvable, but doing it properly will require a lot of work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have to admit that my multiplayer project did not have something like this to show off, since i spend most of my time yet doing network and serialization stuff (always wanted to try implementing it myself, but ofc thats not reasonable unless its a private project for \u0022fun\u0022). Anyway, i nonetheless already did a lot of research. Doing a multiplayer should be possible (for me), but doing so properly will require a lot of work. And i\u0027m not even talking about the timewarp stuff. Here are my mayor problems:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Proper synchronization and collision. My plan is to skip collision, at least for now. That also makes it not very important to a proper sync. But bocking will require some work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Syncing PartModules.
