Ok, now that\u0027s in the right place and is the right size, I\u0027ll just lock it there and oh look, Donate again. Ok, now that\u0027s done, let\u0027s just launch this vessel which means when the launch scene initiates, that Toolbar icon won\u0027t be there which means hooray, more settings tweaking and I get to see Donate again, how wonderful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery single time I want to make one small change to a setting, it\u0027s there staring me in the face. Even if I replace the icon, I know what it\u0027s replacing and there\u0027s a conspicuous black box at the bottom of the settings menu. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RedAV8R\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RedAV8R\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou\u0027ve got to have a guilty conscience for that to be bothering you this much.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWow, assumptions much? I just don\u0027t like seeing \u0027Donate\u0027 buttons in a game I\u0027m playing.

If I could get rid of them altogether, I\u0027d be fine, hence my original question.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
