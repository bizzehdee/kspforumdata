It may be confusing for those who haven\u0027t seen the previous episodes and don\u0027t know the story but that shouldn\u0027t matter too much. I\u0027ll give you a heads up anyway:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe war\u00A0between the K.U.C and S.I has been going on for many years and the sheer numbers of the K.U.C forces begin to overpower the more technologically advanced S.I. As a precaution S.I. manage to procure a piece of tech that can alter the fabric of space and time. This trailer starts off at that point where the tech has been installed onto a large space ship with heavy ordinance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI learnt quite a few things while doing this trailer during the editing and doing kerbal green screen effects.\u00A0I\u0027d love to hear what people think and any mods you\u0027d think would be good for a collaborative warfare series in KSP 1.1..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
