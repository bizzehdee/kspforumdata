Undocked to lander, and now the camera wont zoom in properly towards the lander. It\u0027s like 50m off.

Have you really tried all camera angles (chase is usually the best with \u0022V\u0022) and the rest with \u0022Home\u0022?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, try your num-table. The num-arrows seem to be hard-wired to the camera, too, which is annoying when using these for flying as a lefty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
