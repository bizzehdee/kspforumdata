Is surviving the match considered the same as getting a kill? Not really, right? It\u0027s just means you didn\u0027t *get* killed.\n\nSo I guess the question is, which is more important: shooting your foe, or staying in the air? The two scenarios can coincide, of course, but they\u0027re not mutually inclusive. One does not directly lead to the other, but the consequences of one can affect the other."},{"CreatedByName":"Alphasus","CreatedById":147173,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T19:05:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Iirc,the Vulcan is 5500 rpm, GAU 4000 rpm or so?
