That\u0027s when it nearly comes apart and start shaking like there\u0027s an earthquake. And, rather than settling down onto the pad, the shaking and rolling continues to build, getting worse and worse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis could be part of the reason a lot of my larger rockets are exploding as soon as the screen loads (there are other reasons, I\u0027ve found) or at the very least sit there and shaking themselves apart.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have NOT run it a hundred times after various game relaunches and computer restarts to try to narrow it down (way too frustrated at this point).\u00A0 I\u0027ve got vessels coming apart as soon as they reach the launchpad even though they were just fine 2 minutes earlier when I checked them before moving them back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to put Kerbals on them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve got a video taken with the Windows Xbox Gamebar recording posted on imgur, but the \u0022Insert image from URL\u0022 button won\u0027t accept it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
