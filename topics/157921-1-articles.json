The drill by itself pushes the craft up when deployed. My landing legs are shorter than the amount of height that the drill pushes the craft. Got bigger legs now. This maybe should be mentioned in the Mining Guide to avoid this frustration :).

With my Rhea Base on the Mun, my drills, when extended, are too close to the ground and push the base upwards. Is this happening with you? If so, it means you have to either rebuild the base or just simply replace the original drill module with a new one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-20T09:56:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to Gameplay questions, maybe it\u0027ll help others \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dangerhamster","CreatedById":146944,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-20T17:13:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is why any mining unit I build gets field tested on the pad/runway.
