Anyways, not quite best of all, the take off is less than 250 meters! The plane has no special flight procedere so the worst of pilots can fly it. The only thing is you have to do is drop the tanks and put it in 1/3 throttle for best turning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you have fun flying it\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www./?s3gux99z9xgvvvl\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www./?s3gux99z9xgvvvl\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS sorry for any spelling mistakes\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"9t3ndo","CreatedById":75703,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T20:08:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a clever design \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeb Cubed","CreatedById":70444,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T01:00:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00229t3ndo\u0022 data-cite=\u00229t3ndo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s a clever design \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClever!?
