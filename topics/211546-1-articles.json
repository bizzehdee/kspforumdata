Not everything is on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, but in most of those cases you should either merge the mod\u2019s GameData folder with KSP/GameData or copy the mod folders directly into KSP/GameData. Make sure you only ever have one version of ModuleManager.dll, the newest one. If you have a GameData inside KSP/GameData, you\u2019ve done it wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo create a mod, it depends on what you want to make: tweaking/copying existing parts can be done relatively easily with ModuleManager patches, making new parts is a lot harder unless you use an existing part model; likewise tweaking existing planets is a lot easier than making a new planet altogether. In both cases you can learn a lot by looking at existing mods to see what they do, and breaking them. There are mod-making guides in the Add-Ons section of the forum that could help you get started.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-19T20:14:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to our forum. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EI myself do not mod, though, so I can offer no help with that.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AtomicTech","CreatedById":210823,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-19T21:05:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224220618\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022211546\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221673945964\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022223976\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022emord-nillap\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 1/17/2023 at 2:59 AM, emord-nillap said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the title says, I would like to learn more about modding ksp.
