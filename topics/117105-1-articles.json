An insulator to isolate the thermally sensitive parts from the high-temperature parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can deal with the second part with a quick .cfg edit to the stock passive radiator, but the first and third parts, the reflective shadow shields and insulators, are beyond my comprehension of how the game tackles incoming heat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone feel up for the challenge?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T20:47:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I use \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118189\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHeat Management\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E.
