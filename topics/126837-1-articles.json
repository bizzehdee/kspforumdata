The goal is to maximize the delta-V of this craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s say out of this 10 ton payload, 2.5 ton is mission hardware, eg the reason why you\u0027re going into space in the first place, so you can\u0027t change this part.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou start with a nuke engine, which is 3 tons, this leave you with 4.5 tons to play with. This happens to fit two Mk1 jet fuel tanks perfectly. These two tanks weights 4.5 ton, of which 4 ton is the fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the dry weight of your craft is 2.5 \u002B 3 \u002B 0.5, or 6 tons. Plug 10 ton wet mass, 6 ton dry mass and 800s ISP into a delta-V calculator and you get 4007.59m/s of delta-V\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow suppose instead of a nuke engine we use a LV-909 Terrier instead. It has same vac thrust as a nuke but only weights 0.5 ton, it has a lot lower ISP though at 345s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause the engine is now 2.5 tons lighter, we free up 2.5 tons of payload capacity on our launch vehicle. Naturally since we want delta-V we devote all that 2.5 ton to more fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP fuel tanks have a 9:1 wet/dry mass ratio. So a hypothetical 2.5 ton fuel tank will have a dry mass of 0.278 tons. Good thing bipropellent has the same combined density as jet fuel as this makes calculation easy.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo now, our chemical engined spacecraft has a dry mass of 2.5 \u002B 0.5 \u002B 0.5 \u002B 0.278 tons, or 3.778 tons. We plug 10 tons wet mass, 3.778 tons dry mass and 345s ISP into delta-V calculator again and we get 3283.27m/s of delta-V.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo as you can see, despite having much more

But at the same time, it is \u0022less efficient\u0022 in terms of what money you invested, and it made the launcher necessary to haul it out of Kerbin\u0027s gravity well and all the way to Bop larger and more expensive as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want a scenario where the Ants actually expend less reaction mass in addition to costing less, you need a smaller payload so that the total vessel mass is dominated more by the dry mass of the LV-N. The one thing that works out in the Ants\u0027 favor is that they have so much less dry mass, which means that in order to maximize the advantage, you want to minimize the influence of masses which do not belong to the drive sections - in other words, the payload. This smoothly results in what everyone intuitively understands already: Ants are best used for small probes, while the LV-N excels at hauling mass cargo. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-02T11:09:24Z\u0022 title=\u002212/02/2015 11:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technion","CreatedById":85380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-02T11:10:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t understand how everyone is still fitting nukes.
