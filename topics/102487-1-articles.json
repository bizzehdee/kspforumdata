Hopefully someone can change the code to allow modders, or hell, even the KSP devs, to generate asteroids elsewhere. I think it\u0027d be great to see random asteroids show up in belt orbits, or Jool trojans, or whatever. Would help make the rest of the solar system really come alive."},{"CreatedByName":"michaelsteele3","CreatedById":127113,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T18:48:07Z","Content":"What we need are more boxes."},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T22:38:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Where are the meteor showers, comets and asteroid belts??\n\nI know exactly where they are.
