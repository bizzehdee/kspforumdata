Environmentalists, by way of eliminating global dimming. The above isn\u0026#39;t a \u0022maybe\u0022 either.

Yup.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nExcept, of course, that\u0026#39;s not how thermodynamics works. Dimming can have short-term effect by reducing amount of radiation deposited to ground directly. Unfortunately, there is a slower process riding on top of that. If you\u0026#39;ve ever flown an airplane and payed attention to outside temperature reports, you might have noticed that it\u0026#39;s a hell of a lot colder up there. The reason for that is that the atmospheric circulation with higher pressure at the bottom and lower at the top works like a refrigerator. When you shift heat exchange to higher altitude, which is what really happens in \u0022global dimming\u0022, that works like turning the AC around and sitting on the hot side of it. It takes a [i]while[/i] to kick in, but by far the worst thing we could possibly do is make upper atmosphere opaque. Ground temperatures will eventually reach the same differential we observe now, resulting in global temperatures going up by tens of degrees. Might sound extreme, but there\u0026#39;s a reason why led melts on the surface of Venus.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nCO2 effect is far, far subtler, because it does [i]not[/i] block incoming radiation, allowing radiation equilibrium to establish at surface level, and it only blocks a small fraction of IR going up. And many of the models greatly exaggerate the impact of CO2, because they do not take into account altitude distributions and convection, but until we actually have better models to account for all the factors, it\u0026#39;s hard to say how much predictions are off by.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne thing\u0026#39;s for certain, though.
