If you look just under the window on that cockpit there are those tube-like things, those are the kind of streamlined nozzles I am talking about, there are also some on the Mk1-2 capsule. I use the one with double ports in the last pic for a Dreamchaser-type plane that tends to want to veer off when launching vertically.
