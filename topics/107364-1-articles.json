Problem is that it does not show up as an new base, even if launched after I got the contract. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERoom for 7 kerbals lab, power, antenna and landed on Mun is checked only launch new is not checked. Wonder if this is because I docked it with an old base in Mun orbit before landing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond is mining 550 ore on Mun, I have 600 but still don\u0027t get credit, is this because I was away then it crossed 550?

The second one - I\u0027m pretty sure you have to recover the ore back at Kerbin. Not too sure though...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reddeyfish","CreatedById":142160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T07:20:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) you might have forgotten docking ports\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rakutenshi","CreatedById":40086,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T07:24:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had a similar problem with getting credit for the explore Bop contract. The only thing I can think of is that the upgrade to 1.0.2 somehow borked it, I launched a new unmanned probe with a detachable lander, even after landing the probe and sending science back from both I got no completion credit for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand reddeyfish - I think Magnemoe had a docking port on it since he did dock it to another base, but likely that one is because of the docking...were those contracts active before you upgraded to 1.0.2?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kuu Lightwing","CreatedById":142724,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T07:25:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDocking port?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPower?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAntenna?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"samstarman5","CreatedById":12469,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T07:33:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid you actually designate it as a base (under the rename vessel button)?
