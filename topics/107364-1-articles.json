Problem is that it does not show up as an new base, even if launched after I got the contract. \n\nRoom for 7 kerbals lab, power, antenna and landed on Mun is checked only launch new is not checked. Wonder if this is because I docked it with an old base in Mun orbit before landing?\n\nSecond is mining 550 ore on Mun, I have 600 but still don\u0027t get credit, is this because I was away then it crossed 550? Or is I missing something?"},{"CreatedByName":"Bilfr3d","CreatedById":75448,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T07:00:46Z","Content":"The first one about the Mun base - most likely because you docked it with something else that it doesn\u0027t check it as new. The second one - I\u0027m pretty sure you have to recover the ore back at Kerbin.

The only thing I can think of is that the upgrade to 1.0.2 somehow borked it, I launched a new unmanned probe with a detachable lander, even after landing the probe and sending science back from both I got no completion credit for it.\n\nand reddeyfish - I think Magnemoe had a docking port on it since he did dock it to another base, but likely that one is because of the docking...were those contracts active before you upgraded to 1.0.2?"},{"CreatedByName":"Kuu Lightwing","CreatedById":142724,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T07:25:25Z","Content":"Docking port?\n\nPower?\n\nAntenna?"},{"CreatedByName":"samstarman5","CreatedById":12469,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T07:33:42Z","Content":"Did you actually designate it as a base (under the rename vessel button)?
