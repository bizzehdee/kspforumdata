It doesn\u0027t have a mighty compressor and precooler to compress air until it starts to liquefy and push it into  the combustion chamber of a rocket engine, replacing the source of liquid oxygen. So it just uses the exhaust of a rocket engine to heat up some intake air and make it expand in the nozzle for extra thrust.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air-augmented_rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air-augmented_rocket) here is the difference between liquid air cycle rocket and an air augmented rocket.\n\nDo you know what a bypass ratio of a jet engine is? It means that some compressed air from the compressor doesn\u0027t go into the combustion chamber, it goes directly to the nozzle to create thrust. Air augmented rocket has a 100% bypass ratio, it\u0027s just a rocket engine in a long tube  ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-06-01T05:03:16Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2024 05:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jun 1\u0022\u003EJune 1\u003C/time\u003E by Manul**"}]}
