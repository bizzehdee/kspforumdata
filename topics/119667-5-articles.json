Are you stating my point, that the weight of the radiator system dominates the whole thing? For a given thrust, you get a given jet power (the energy in your exhaust). And if you pick an engine, then you have a given efficiency in heat-to-thrust conversion, so you also get a set waste heat to get rid off. For nuclear-electric drives, that means \u003Cem\u003Eat least\u003C/em\u003E more than half your total wattage output is waste heat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AngelLestat\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AngelLestat\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou dont gain nothing doing that in space. what are the benefics?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can get some parts of your ship to stay \u003Cem\u003Eunder\u003C/em\u003E the temperature of your radiator.
