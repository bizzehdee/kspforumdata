Have ranges been increased or can you scan while time warped?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe scanning mechanism is about the same, the map though is a hex grid overlay over the planet / moon you are scanning. It is still kind of slow and you cant max timewarp and leave it for a few minutes as it will miss hexes. It isnt too bad though, a decent angled orbit at about 4x speed will give you a decent idea of where Kethane is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you quit Kethane due to the slow scanning before, you will probably quit again which is a pity as it does really add to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alskari","CreatedById":57638,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T14:37:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ASnogarD\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ASnogarD\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you quit Kethane due to the slow scanning before, you will probably quit again which is a pity as it does really add to the game.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDamn.

And getting 100% map is honestly rather pointless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those of you that think scanning is slow please do 2 things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1)Stop trying to scan like this is ISA..its not, and that mod sucks anyway =)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2)Read back in the thread, there are about 100 different convos disscussing how to scan fast with kethane (also just a good idea to follow threads of mods you use....)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
