About 18days to the moon, moon should be arround here. Then cape carnavaral should be around such and such, so that when I overspend my initial orbit (with a ~200km Pe, and a 3k AP, because of the many engines having only 1 ignition), my high AP should be arround the DN/AN node. It worked, after initial orbit I planed a manouvre node that raised my Ap on the DN node (which was somewhere near my Pe, but not really), and got a pretty good capture at the moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, as I am planning to go to mars, I expect it wont be as much forgiving.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuestions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Is there a launch window planner for RSS out there? Can only find stock ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Is there a good way to plan it without a launch window planner just telling you what to do where? As we can\u0027t see DN/AN nodes before we launched. Nor plan manouvre nodes before we are decently in orbit, its kinda hard to estimated imo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.

One solution is to have a probe in Low Earth Orbit (at say 200 - 400 km) that is already on the correct plane (20-something degrees). You could do this via hyperedit or - if that feels cheaty - by launching a small probe with a ton of monoprop or a restarting engine, targeting the Moon and adjusting inclination until AN/DN are at 0\u00B0. You can then easily use this probe\u0027s orbit as a guide: when your launch site passes under the orbit\u0027s path it is time to launch into the same 20-something degree inclination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor interplanetary, I haven\u0027t really found it essential to launch into the precise optimal inclination for the transfer (although Transfer Window Planner\u00A0Gaarst cited above will tell you what this inclination should be).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mainly use the equatorial sites. They give you the best dV-to-orbit reduction and allow you to reach almost any inclination you want, directly.
