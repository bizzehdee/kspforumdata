Very little trolls, everyone is super helpful no matter the issue and ideas are always free flowing.

Last night I successfully made a few orbits in a modified stock Aeris 4A but unfortunately didn\u0027t have quite enough fuel and my trajectory was wrong (rookie mistake of not accounting for atmospheric drag) so I splashed down in the ocean just west of land (again, poor Jebediah).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027ve been lurking and reading a lot of posts and can\u0027t wait for 0.23. Thought I\u0027d finally drop a line and formally introduce myself. Hope to be a regular poster here. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drakoan","CreatedById":97205,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T18:09:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello there Jguy i\u0027m new here too may your rockets fly straight and your parts stay attached.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seanoog","CreatedById":8599,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T19:15:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t often lurk in the Welcome Boards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut when I seen Jguy\u0027s, thread title, I couldn\u0027t help myself; This place is awesome. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell as a season veteran too, KSP.
