I find the lack of sleek Mk3 cockpits disturbing so I decided to remedy just that. As of now, I\u0027m only working on a cockpit, and I wanna finish it with full IVAs before anything else, but depending on how it goes I might consider more parts in the future. This is still som way from being ready for a test release, but I thought it might be a good time to get some feedback at least in terms of the concept and the looks of it, so here it is. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E The idea of this is a near-futuristick cockpit for heavy but sleek spaceplanes (with a huge panoramic window)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENOTE: I\u0027m having issues with the CFG file and with collision meshes.
