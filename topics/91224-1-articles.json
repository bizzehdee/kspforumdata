In general, you want struts to be as symmetric as possible and placed far from the attachment point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, Wanderfound is right: off-axis orbits are usually just piloting error. Keep your eye on the trackball and keep moving along the 90 degree axis. An unstable design might make it difficult, and you might make a joke design which must go in a certain direction, but it\u0027s mostly just sticking to 90 degrees on the trackball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, you would probably benefit a lot by replacing your radial Mainsails with a stack of 2 Jumbo-64 tanks (or 4 32 tanks) with a single Mainsail and a couple SRBs (Solid Rocket Boosters). For stock ascents, you usually want your launch TWR to be between 1.6 and 2.0*, and for the amount of fuel and payload you have, you get 1.4 TWR from a single Mainsail, which can be boosted with a couple cheap SRBs until you burn some of the fuel off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*The most fuel-efficient vertical ascents occur when you are traveling at terminal velocity (force from gravity equals force from aerodynamic drag). As such, for the vertical part of your ascent, you would want TWR to be slightly greater than 2 (1 for gravity, 1 for aero drag, a little remainder for acceleration); however, as you burn fuel, your TWR will go up past your launch TWR, requiring you to slow down (look Ma, wasted engine mass!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo quickly calculate TWR and delta-V, I would strongly recommend the Kerbal Engineer or MechJeb mods.

While the original goal was to see if I could get it into orbit with the resources available, I was not expecting to have over 1/2 a tank of fuel left once I got into a 100k orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll my flights have been done using the Kerbal Rocketry School of Hard Knocks. No Mechjeb, Kerbal Engineering, or other building aids. (Not to be critical of those aids, they have a useful purpose as you gain experience with the limitations of the parts you use.) Just building something, testing it, and if it works, improving on the design to make it work better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Haxsis","CreatedById":129981,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-26T19:17:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eoh well there you go, use it if you want, i dnt care i cnt copyright a design in this game for one thing, and if it helps out for tutorials/ your own missions whatever then im glad, however i have a feeling this might be able to be expanded on as a basic design\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
