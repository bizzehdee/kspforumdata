However, i\u0027m still getting extreme lag when playing with ships with a high part count. I am playing at 4k, but KSP is a processor heavy game so I\u0027m sure that\u0027s not the reason. All mods are up to date. Any tips? I also have crashes sometimes that state the error as an access violation by KSP.exe, and the same error also states that i have 0 gb of memory in the system."},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T22:01:42Z","Content":"What sort of number do you mean by \u0022high part count\u0022? The physics simulation in KSP is single threaded and is a complex problem when dealing with large numbers of objects. There are also various inefficiencies in the game that cause some vessels to lag much worse than their part count should imply. The switch to Unity 5 should improve the physics simulation some and the rewrite of the UI related code for Unity 5 should also help matters. Hopefully Squad will also take the opportunity to fix some of the other long-standing bugs and inefficiencies at the same time.\n\nAs for the crashes, you will need to provide the details mentioned in the \u0022How to get support\u0022 sticky thread in this sub-forum for us to be able to give you a definite answer but it sounds like the game is hitting the memory limit of a 32 bit process. Reducing the number of mods and/or the texture resolution and monitoring the memory usage and restarting the game before it reaches 3.5 gb is about the best you can do at the moment."},{"CreatedByName":"DeenGulberry","CreatedById":146920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T22:35:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What sort of number do you mean by \u0022high part count\u0022?

You can find it in your Kerbal Space Program folder as the file \u0022output\\_log.txt\u0022\\*.

My KSP on the launch pad is using 30% of processor power by itself (total of 35% used across the machine) and 3,500 megs of memory (total of about 60% across the machine). \n\nI guess KSP is hitting a memory threshold and that\u0027s what\u0027s slowing it down? Is playing in Linux the only way to actually play KSP with mods? I\u0027m only using about 40 of them, though some are big mods like Astronomers and EVE.\n\nEdit: Nope, not a memory issue, or not entirely. I uninstalled Astronomer\u0027s and EVE and got an extra 500 megs sitting on the launch pad (sitting at 2,900 now) but no improvement in frame rate.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-25T21:16:34Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2015 09:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shiv**"}]}
