However, i\u0027m still getting extreme lag when playing with ships with a high part count. I am playing at 4k, but KSP is a processor heavy game so I\u0027m sure that\u0027s not the reason. All mods are up to date. Any tips? I also have crashes sometimes that state the error as an access violation by KSP.exe, and the same error also states that i have 0 gb of memory in the system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T22:01:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat sort of number do you mean by \u0022high part count\u0022? The physics simulation in KSP is single threaded and is a complex problem when dealing with large numbers of objects. There are also various inefficiencies in the game that cause some vessels to lag much worse than their part count should imply. The switch to Unity 5 should improve the physics simulation some and the rewrite of the UI related code for Unity 5 should also help matters.

Reducing the number of mods and/or the texture resolution and monitoring the memory usage and restarting the game before it reaches 3.5 gb is about the best you can do at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeenGulberry","CreatedById":146920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T22:35:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Padishar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Padishar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat sort of number do you mean by \u0022high part count\u0022?
