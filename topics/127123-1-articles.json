It weighs 2.44t full and 1.39t empty. The flea has an ISP of 140 asl - 165vac. Using the asl ISP I got 772.0166 delta v. From here I used some kinematics equations and figured that the speed at the end of the burn should be 685.16m/s and the maximum height of the flight would be 23926.72m \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022line-height:normal;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u00A0When I tested it out in the sandbox with drag turned off I ended up going 29606m high and the speed at the end of the burn was 704m/s\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022line-height:normal;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003ESo I think the numbers were off because as the rocket flys up the ISP improves meaning I actually had more delta v than calculated. Another thing I thought might have affected it was the force of gravity changing the further away from kerbin I got (I used a constant 9.81).\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003EHow do I improve my calculations to account for changing ISP and gravity?
