But the problem is I can\u0027t launch the said rover. I spent a lot of time trying to create something to let the rover land and I did it but now I have no idea how to launch it. Pictures are here so just tell me what to do.

Right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst thing I\u0027m going to say is that the roundified RCS tanks aren\u0027t going to do you any good without any RCS. Unless I\u0027m missing the ports somewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to recommend putting a BZ-52 on the underside of the rover for the sole purpose of giving you an attachment surface to a booster. Make sure to place it directly under the assembly\u0027s center of mass or it\u0027ll tilt and be a royal pain to fly. Stick a stack separator on that and you\u0027re golden. You\u0027ll probably have to strut the whole thing down to the booster, of course.

But it\u0027s not a problem at all. Even on Kerbin I could drive away before they collapse so it should be fine on Minmus. I tried those Zenith lifters and I have much trouble with controlling the ship because my capsule is placed horizontaly and because of that, the navball is rotated in a strange way (I\u0027m facing 180 degrees at launch, and I can\u0027t see my paragrade).
