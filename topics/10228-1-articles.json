It works best if you\\\u0027re oriented directly up. If you are, then the I/K is upwards/downwards on the navball, and J/L are right/left on the navball respectively. Also, if you need to apply some extra downwards thrust for whatever reason, or you feel like landing purely with RCS, you can use H/N for up and down in the vertical direction.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-06T07:41:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should be able to see them firing.
