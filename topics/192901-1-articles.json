I am currently using KSP 1.7.3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mods that concern this issue are as follows:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Realism Overhaul (not likely)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- ROTanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Procedural Fairings\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Procedural Fairings, For Everything\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThough I will be referring specifically to the process of MECO and first stage detachment, this issue occurs in every instance at which an interstage is used in such a fashion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsider the usual\u00A0launch vehicle, with an ROTanks first and second stage. Upon the first stage rests a procedural ribbed interstage. To the detachment node of this interstage is attached a procedural parts thrust plate (engines irrelevant), which itself is appended\u00A0 to an ROTanks second stage. The second stage has an SIVB engine mount, which is considered to be part of the tank and is the result of an option that comes with ROTanks. The gap between the ribbed interstage and second stage is covered with a procedural fairing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, consider the following scenario:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpon MECO, the inert first stage is detached (as per usual). Both elements of the aforementioned interstage - the ribbed interstage and the procedural fairing - are decoupled simultaneously. Upon this event, the second stage enters into a spin from which it may take minutes to recover with the currently installed attitude control thrusters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe above description occurs on all launch vehicles. Observe the example\u00A0below, wherein I disable ascent guidance and simply allow the second stage to attempt to kill rotation:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022[video-to-gif output image]\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.33\u0022 width=\u0022600\u0022 src=\u0022https://im7.ezgif.com/tmp/ezgif-7-095a1257f0e5.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, were I to keep guidance engaged, the RL10A4s would have ignited and recentered the stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpon inspection, I have come to the conclusion that this issue is a result of part clipping: the interstage fairings clip into the mount and bottom of the second stage wall. Upon decoupling, the fairings and second stage tank become two separate objects, violently snapping out of each other\u0027s collision boxes upon the slightest movement. As the volume of overlap between the fairings and tank is relatively small, this effect puts the second stage into a spin rather than ending in the usually destructive collision box glitch. I have reached this conclusion upon launching the second stage with no fairings. Note how my first attempts to alleviate this issue included splitting the fairings into two sections, decoupling them from the first stage, and placing eight retrograde thrusters onto the first stage. As you can see, this did not work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe issue is that, at this point, I am at a loss of what to do. Were this to be another issue, I would be able to alter a setting or\u00A0game configuration and solve it. However, as collision boxes are a core game mechanic, do not know how to proceed. Of course, I know that this issue can be fixed, as everyone else on these forums seem to be able to create interstages that do not produce torque\u00A0 upon detachment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anyone replies to this, thank you for your help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
