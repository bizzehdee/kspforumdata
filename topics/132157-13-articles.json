Squad has provided one option for mod hosting, other companies provide others, and the community has provided still more. No one is forced to use a host they don\u0027t want to. Modders can host in multiple places for redundancy in case there is a problem with one host (the sudden takedown of KerbalStuff should be a vivid example of the danger of relying on a single host).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kertech","CreatedById":156079,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-16T13:26:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe search function on curse is rubbish though\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s irritating that to work around this through google\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ted","CreatedById":26298,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-16T13:41:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222412674\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022132157\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221455628700\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002212858\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 minutes ago, Red Iron Crown said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents ipsClearfix\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- snip -\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was about to post something replying to a few of the most recent comments but this really hits the nail on the head.

Yet they allow you to come here and express your opinion, even though posts like yours are looking to me like a well organized propaganda campaign. They could also end this crap very easily, at any time by just taking some of the money they have made and investing in Denuvo, closing down the game to modding all together. And you also seem to ignore the fact that Squad has in fact invested money in the modding community several times. Many of the developers working on 1.1 as we speak were once modders. I just hope enough people are able to see for themselves the real truth, Squad is not the bad guy. They aren\u0027t the ones who hold grudges.
