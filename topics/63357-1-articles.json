This is the root cause of my performance issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERAM: 8 GB of DDRsomething RAM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo about my graphics card...something with even 200 parts will start to eat away at the framerate, not to mention a solid 7 FPS at sea level Kerbin with no other ships on rails or loaded and with a one part spacecraft. I really want a better graphics card \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith integrated graphics, there wouldn\u0027t be an actual discrete graphics card. So I\u0027m curious as to what that actually was? Just an adapter to have all the connection on i guess (assuming that that is what you meant by potato LOL). And yes the HD 2000 was just awful... In fact so awful that Apple skipped that generation of Intel processors entirely because they got MUCH better performance on the latest Core 2 Duos. My MacBook Pro was actually affected by that too and I\u0027m happy that they chose to go that way. So yeah, Geforce 320 M is said to offer something like 4 times the real world performance as the HD 2000 counterpart even though the thing is a year older.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly after HD 3000 and onwards, Intels integrated chips got acceptable, but those were STILL slower than the 320 M. With HD 4000 they got quite good and with the new Iris and Iris Pro, Intel built something quite amazing imo...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways... As long as your motherboard supports it, go for a budget ATI or Nvidia card that fits your computer and the performance will be magnitudes better still. You should be able to disable the integrated one, or use both at the same time then...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheFactory","CreatedById":101579,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T11:13:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIm using a laptop too!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESony Vaio i7 with 4Gb of RAM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnything upto 500 parts is fine, I\u0027ve not built anything bigger though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does kick out some heat when its playing though!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fastbikkel","CreatedById":101702,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T18:42:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDual core 2.4ghz\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4gb ram\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGeforce 8800GT\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGame runs quite well i must say, but it crashes after 3 launches or so, depending on how big the rocket was the previous launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP also does not like saving a lot, nor does it like switching back and forth between space and the center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have quite a load of these error dump dirs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jas1126","CreatedById":99760,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-18T01:16:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI run a Quad core I7-2600 overclocked at 3.40Ghz\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E16 GB ram\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWindow 7 64\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAMD Radeon R9 200 Series\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this game still runs ridiculously slow....

We\u0027d all love that to happen but due to the outdated implementation of these things in the Unity 3D game engine, this is rather hard, or impossible, to change at the moment.

They usually share system memory i.e. RAM as a frame buffer, but sometimes have a small dedicated buffer, which is much faster (we\u0027re talking around 64MB maybe of DDR5). Dedicated GPUs have their own VRAM onboard, often very fast. This is the much faster and better solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if your GPU is not too powerful, more than 512MB is really not needed...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll do a search on how powerful that GPU is later and reply based on that. In Intel systems the shared VRAM is determined by the total amount of RAM on the system. An Intel HD 4000 chip would use 512 MB of 8GB i believe. If you were to upgrade your system to 16GB, your Intel HD 4000 would utilise 1GB. Sorry you\u0027d have to Google about your system, I\u0027 a Mac user and not familiar with AMD/ATI.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
