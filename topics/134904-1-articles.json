I have been playing a career game for a while, and suddenly I realized something: Jeb was missing! In all of my manned launches, my ship was flown by Valentina or some other random pilot.

So I hastily threw together a rescue rocket.\u00A0\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u0022IMG]\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022?ref=2mchtz4\u0026amp;quot;%20target=\u0026amp;quot;_blank\u0026amp;quot;\u0026amp;gt;\u0026amp;lt;img%20src=\u0026amp;quot;http://i63.tinypic.com/2mchtz4.png\u0026amp;quot;%20border=\u0026amp;quot;0\u0026amp;quot;%20alt=\u0026amp;quot;Image%20and%20video%20hosting%20by%20TinyPic\u0026amp;quot;\u0026amp;gt;\u0026amp;lt;/a\u0026amp;gt;\u0022 alt=\u0022a\u0026amp;gt;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i63.tinypic.com/2mchtz4.png\u0022 alt=\u00222mchtz4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll post more as I go along.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZedSlasher48","CreatedById":160801,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-25T02:14:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBro you should make a youtube videos about your journey\u0027s also if you do ill watch them but dont have commentary unless you have a okay mic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GluttonyReaper","CreatedById":59429,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-25T12:20:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaha, yeah, there\u0027s something I find really fun about coming back to a save after a nice, long break. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u00A0Last time I did that in 0.90, I ended up mounting a rescue mission for a long-forgotten failed Jool-5 mission.
