It would likely be a very energy-intensive process that would require a lot of heavy equipment, and would only be useful on vehicles that travel great distances. Fighters (when used in concert with a carrier) would never need to go large distances, and in fact may need to double at atmospheric fighters (making weight more important). With this in mind, and considering that if warping did exist as a technology, it seems equally likely that smaller more mobile technologies would also exist to protect said fighter from most damage (at least on one side). This, coupled with high agility and computer assisted controls (if not outright computer controlled drone fighters), means that fighting would likely be pretty boring. The more advanced and well-armed fighter would take up a stationary position, and simply reorient to track the target and keep the forward shield in between it and it\u0027s target... while the less advanced or less well-armed fighter must attempt to maneuver behind it. (or more likely, outnumber it) For anti-carrier attacks, the fighters may attempt to maneuver into less heavily defended approach paths, but other than that, not much could be done but get close and shoot (or shoot from further away).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T06:42:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EImagine all you want, but it still ain\u0027t gonna happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnything that a manned space fighter can do, a drone or missile can do better.
