To do the latter after you\u0027ve fired all stages shut down the engine (right click menu), create new stage if needed and drag engine icon to new stage. Firing it should complete contract if that was required.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scoop","CreatedById":121961,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-14T19:34:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks. I\u0027ve done several exploration contracts and a couple of rescue contracts but this was the first part contract I\u0027ve taken a run at. It looked easy for a ton of money but I was pretty frustrated feeling like I was doing everything it asked. I\u0027ll try that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-15T00:11:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr don\u0027t try it and wait until you have enough science points to unlock the nuclear engine. The reason is, while the contract is active, you can put the nuclear engine in any ship you build (think of it as prototype testing). Once you finish the contract, you won\u0027t be able to build anything with the nuclear engine until you unlock it with science points.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
