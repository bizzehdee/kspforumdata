SpaceX won\\\u0027t be ready for a while, for the really big satellites. SpaceX is still developing, and does not have the confidence of clients yet (especially DoD ). They have to launch more; so far, spaceX has flown only 2 falcon 9\\\u0027s. None of which this year, and it\\\u0027s looking mightely like they won\\\u0027t launch anything this whole year at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven when they are flying, it isn\\\u0027t like USA gets to decide - We\\\u0027ll all use spaceX! Certain departments will buy services from them, just like you buy a service from mcdonalds. Others will prefer burger king. ULA will still launch. Energia will still launch. Rockets are still being launched while spaceX doesnt. They have a small fraction of the launch market ( growing, but still ) . Ariane 5 is the biggest sat launcher right now, possibly Proton. These will continue to fly even after spaceX. Space isn\\\u0027t the golden bullet for all problems with launching rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, price is not everything. Going for a rocket company from your own country really has it\\\u0027s own benefit; price becomes less of a concern when most of it flows back into your own economy, and government is quite a big fraction of payloads. Also, retaining of certain skill items, or industrial base. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWho won the space Race?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepends on where you cut it off. Russians won the early part. NASA did the moon, but Russia did space stations. If you look at capability now, russia wins. If you look in a few years, commercial wins. It\\\u0027s better not to see it as a technological race, really. Russia abondened plans for the moon as soon as america got there; imagine if they had eventually developed a system as cheap ( relatively ) as the soyuz for moon travel. But this didnt happen. America did not improve on moon either. Buran was arguably superior to the shuttle, and would be cheaper as well; but, it was still too expensive.
