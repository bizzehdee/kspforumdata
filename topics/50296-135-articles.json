I had to copy all the values into Custom.cfg and change it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, I tweaked those even. I changed temperatureExponent to 1.50. That allows me to fully reenter in that orbit from the Mun, by setting my reentry altitude to 38-40k (I use FAR). Before I had to enter at above 40k, or else I\u0027d burn up, but then I\u0027d \u0027skip\u0027 out and have to make another round.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, is it normal to burn up before the ablative shield is worn down?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the Mk1 pod, I would burn up between 40-43k if I had the pe set to 38k (coming from Mun), yet the ablative shield only used about 3 units (247/250). Temperature at disintegration was 1166C. I tried angling the pod, and letting the air take it. Hence the change above. IIRC, reentry speed was about 3.2km/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought the point of the shield was to take the heat away from the pod, at least until it was gone?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I reenter with my modified settings above, I still only use about 3-5 units of the shield.
