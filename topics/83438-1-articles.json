After that, you can either transmit the data or return the experiment (the part) to Kerbin. For the contracts, you need to return it. This means that if you attached the part directly to the lab - ie no decouplers or docking ports in between - then you either need to de-orbit your entire station or send another experiment up to complete the contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe prcocedure is exactly the same for all experiments, with the only difference being that for others you\u0027ll need the other components from the mod (cyclotron, etc)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
