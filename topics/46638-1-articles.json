In the map view you can change your focus to different objects, which is awesome, but can you arbitrarily pan your map around? I find myself fine tuning manuever nodes (yes via mechjeb) and wanting to dial in burns to go between planets, I can always do a second burn when I\u0027m partway through, but occasionally my inability to zoom in on closest encounter makes it very difficult to correct for when it looks above like it\u0027s close but ends up being a little high and low (very difficult to see from the side because of other planetary orbits). Heck if someone has a tip for dealing with that, even if I can\u0027t pan that\u0027d help! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, woohoo I\u0027m finally figuring out (with the help of online calculators) how to do these things without just telling mechjeb to do it\u0027s thing, two successful landings pulled off, one despite a damaged middle stage and accidentally lining a bulls-eye up on Ike with my mid-course correction (which is the other cause of the question) \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-27T07:50:44Z\u0022 title=\u002209/27/2013 07:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by docfish\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-27T03:07:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s possible to pan around the map (shifting focus and rotating are the only controls I\u0027m aware of), but I think I still have some info that might help with your problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP simulates orbits using a technique called \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patched_conic_approximation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Epatched conic approximation\u003C/a\u003E.
