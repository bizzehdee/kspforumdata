What distro should I download?

That said, I\u0027d again prefer the ability to run Linux as a shell from within Win7 if possible, so as to maintain access to other Win7 programs while playing KSP. As I use MSE for my antimalware, running Steam and / or KSP64 from Linux as a hard boot would necessitate some form of antimalware solution, which again, is a duplication of effort that I\u0027d care to try to avoid if doing so would not be too Rube Goldberg-ian.

First off, I established a proof of concept in a VM environment and did manage to load to the KSP title screen. As was repeatedly suggested to me, this instance had poor performance, but like I said, it was the proof of concept and Linux-learning laboratory I needed. (For the record, not only did I never disbelieve the advice suggesting that this wasn\u0027t the way to go, I also kinda knew it to have been the case from the outset. What made me -- admittedly -- very visibly chafe was the from-some-sources-sarcastic insistence on \u003Cem\u003Epointing out\u003C/em\u003E that it would not be a sustainable solution instead of actually answering a question.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor other unrelated reasons that are very unsexy and outside the scope of this forum, I already had a slowly brewing excuse to reformat anyway, though in the process I did lose some raw Fraps footage I\u0027d generated of a really awesome (and successful!) station deorbit.

Because of your \u0022old\u0022 GPU, you\u0027ll be limited to using the open source Radeon driver or a legacy proprietary driver. I\u0027d recommend going the Manjaro route so you\u0027ll have the most up to date kernel and Xorg to increase 3d performance with the Radeon driver -- that\u0027s the exact reason I\u0027m going over to Arch (I might use Manjaro if I can figure out how to install it to a ZFS root).

If you go Arch Linux via ArchBang...for the love of dog do not mention you installed Arch that way on the Arch forums...you\u0027ve been warned...you\u0027ll need to put on your best flame retardant suit if you decide to mention Bang or Manjaro on the Arch forums.

I\u0027m currently running Mint 17 and I reference the Arch documentation more than Ubuntu documentation when issues arise. The only place with better documentation is Gentoo, only be prepared for \u003Cem\u003Eshell\u003C/em\u003E shock and a very steep learning curve if you want to install it.

Once you get used to the linux way of doing things, Windows just seems so clunky, backwards, and unnecessarily difficult to do simple things.

At the time, my PC was crap for games and all I really needed was a safe and stable way to browse the internet and type up reports, so I updated from Win2K (Best MS OS ever) to Debian. Really happy I made that decision. Honestly, I never actually figured out Windows 8...I just used Classic Shell and made it as close to Win2K as I could.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-06T03:56:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022skeevy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022skeevy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDebian -- Stable, not the fastest, power user community, not the hardest to install but some basic knowledge helps.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EI certainly haven\u0027t noticed any observable speed difference between the Debian based distros, if you ignore the overgrown desktop cruft.
