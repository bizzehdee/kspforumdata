Managed to go to quite a lot of planets and moons. I managed - ONCE - to stick my ship into an asteroid, just to find out that it was a tad too big for my engines. I am trying again to do that, this time with a better ship. Problem is... I really can\u0027t really approach the asteroid on a manageable distance, like I do when I build huge ships with docking ports. I always end up with humongous distances between ship and asteroid. I usually use protractor to reach planets and moons, and trial and error on my space builds - If I mess it up the orbit will take only a few minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there an easy way to reach the asteroids?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vector","CreatedById":80152,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-25T02:46:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI usually go for them outside Kerbin\u0027s SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithin Kerbin\u0027s SOI, look at where the asteroid is relative to Kerbin. Go in that general direction, costs about 1000 m/s delta-V to get out of kerbin\u0027s SOI. Don\u0027t spend too much delta-V, just enough to get out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI. Once in solar orbit, you have plenty of time to optimize your approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust outside Kerbin\u0027s SOI, I aim for an approach of about 10,000 km. Then a couple days away from approach, make finer adjustments to get within 100km. Then just watch your retrograde marker and the pink target indicator to follow it the rest of the way in.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"demian_travis","CreatedById":90563,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-25T02:59:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI managed to get 600 km of separation.
