A thought just struck me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat if, instead of unlocking parts through purely science points and money, but unlocking them through a testing process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe parts would become available\u00A0as they do now\u00A0for missions, however the missions will be non-optional (which by the way, is like I believe the milestones should be. I\u0027ve been begging for milestones to be standard missions that aren\u0027t accepted, but given, ever since the new mission system was added).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTaking the parts outside of a broad testing area would cause the experiment to fail, and perhaps the part to fail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, if the mission requires that a part be tested between 10,000 and 20,000, but the part it taking up to 70,000 instead, the part could simply stop working, \u0022fail,\u0022 as it had not been properly tested and thus had failures shaking and fixed out of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI of course recommend this only as an optional play mode, not something to be forced upon everyone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd before people recommend I just don\u0027t unlock a part until I\u0027ve tested it now: 1. I\u0027m already doing that. And 2, I\u0027m not guaranteed to get all tests. Like, test at this altitude, then the next, then the next, and at splashdown, etc. I feel each part should go through a standard series of tests in this play-style, which one is not guaranteed to get, as best I can tell, in the current style.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sasuga","CreatedById":119064,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-24T20:43:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps players could choose from the science tree what part they\u0027d like to begin testing on next. Then, do the series of tests required to unlock it before it becomes standard-available. And while the testing process should be somewhat standard and predictable, each part\u0027s testing could be slightly different based on its purpose and specialization.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI noticed SpaceX in real life tested their heat shielding with just a tiny, handful of heat-shield-cells on one of their regular resupply of the ISS launches. Hauling parts into space and back can be a pain, but its what the missions already ask us to do, and its what we\u0027d be signing up for if we choose this play-style.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother idea would be parts-failures. Perhaps, all parts could have a failure rate, and the more they\u0027re tested and used, the more the failure rate could be decreased. So, the more we use a part, the more its perfected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-24T22:19:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake a look at Scrapyard and Oh Scrap, may already do what you are looking for\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-04T17:29:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI already avoid the testing contracts.
