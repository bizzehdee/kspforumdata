I have been having problems building a spacecraft. Now that I have built one, the radial decouplers have stopped working lol. I use liquid fuel boosters, 2 of them, and obviously radial decouplers. I have always make sure that the fuel tanks are attached properly to the decoupler and I still face this problem. I do use struts just so that nothing wobbles. Is this because of that? It would be amazing if anyone knew what I could do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/jI4L9\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/jI4L9\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-14T09:51:15Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2016 09:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Helix Wletcher\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-14T10:43:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour clipped in too far. the decoupler shoes need to be completely visible otherwise the boosters will stay attached to the tank when you decouple.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v499/swampmonster/Kerbal%20space%20program/screenshot32_zpslvcihlgu.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot32_zpslvcihlgu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Helix Wletcher","CreatedById":164177,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-14T15:13:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have used the tool...

I would delete the outboard subassemblies and restart building the boosters from scratch - making sure your placement is straight on the decoupler.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
