So, the tracks I have not tried to tweak the scale of because they\u0027re obviously a bit more complicated than the wheels. The wheels however, using the last known release of TweakScale, are working perfect with the steering even being maintained extremely well. Heck, even the repulsors work really well with scaling. And that\u0027s without any updated configurations for the scaling of operation values, just the basic size change. So, I really have no idea why that would change the steering. However, if somehow the wheels are getting attached in the wrong orientation after being scaled, that would be the issue to consider. A few minutes ago I answered a post about the ERS wheels not launching from the SPH to the runway correctly, clipping with the runway and not turning correctly. It\u0027s been an ongoing discussion and the last complaint on that issue was that they weren\u0027t steering right. He was turning the wheels and instead they were tilting sideways. Well, what happens when you take a horizontal steering mechanism and put it on its side? It tilts. Not saying this is the problem here as I\u0027m sure you\u0027re careful to orient things right, but it\u0027s something I struggle with every time I use a wheel \u003Cem\u003Eespecially\u003C/em\u003E from the SPH where almost everything comes out at the wrong angle from the get-go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m curious lo-fi, do the stock wheels, when hooked to the KF plugin, function like stock wheels? Or do they exhibit the steering and suspension effects (within their own extreme limits) like your specialized wheels do?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, an optional MM config would be the best option I would say. If you need a hand at that, I can take a hand at writing some if you can make a template of what needs to change. Might even be able to re-use some of the data in the configs and make your MM patch be more universal instead of customized for each wheel. I\u0027ve already got the KF wheels undergoing a few personal MM customizations (makes updating your latest changes a lot easier if I don\u0027t edit the cfgs directly) and have become rather proficient at making MM configs as long as no advanced (aka. Regex) commands are required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I must weigh in on the speed thing. I discovered the max rpm thing myself and what I\u0027ve done is just use an MM config to multiply the current \u0022maxRPM\u0022 by a small value to give the wheels some more breathing room. Yes, that produces some of the run-away wheels when not attached to the ground, but otherwise you loose out on being able to make a small rover with a super-powered engine that can make it catch air when going over the runway sideways... without using boosters that is. They still tend to limit me from getting too fast (unlike when I made a \u003Cem\u003EHUGE\u003C/em\u003E LLL-hulled rover using those giant stock wheels and found that if I held the key down it would continue to accelerate ever so slowly) but I don\u0027t run into the maximum rpm thing limiting me from going any faster and hyper-switching status in the right-click menu. They still have their curves untouched, which preserves \u003Cem\u003Ehow\u003C/em\u003E they accelerate, but they have the chance of flexing that to the limits without being held back as much. It works pretty well for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, now the crawler stuff. Yeah, I like that idea better than my old idea of just having a \u0022recenter\u0022 command in the action group settings. If they could just orient to the direction defined by those keys, like you were doing linear translation in space (except without the third dimension of movement) then it would become extremely intuitive. However, to gain fine control over that, the speed at which it aligns with the new heading should be slow enough that you can stop pressing that button and continue moving at whatever orientation they currently sit at, waiting to be re-oriented properly when the correct button is pushed.

So, the tracks I have not tried to tweak the scale of because they\u0027re obviously a bit more complicated than the wheels. The wheels however, using the last known release of TweakScale, are working perfect with the steering even being maintained extremely well. Heck, even the repulsors work really well with scaling. And that\u0027s without any updated configurations for the scaling of operation values, just the basic size change. So, I really have no idea why that would change the steering. However, if somehow the wheels are getting attached in the wrong orientation after being scaled, that would be the issue to consider. A few minutes ago I answered a post about the ERS wheels not launching from the SPH to the runway correctly, clipping with the runway and not turning correctly. It\u0027s been an ongoing discussion and the last complaint on that issue was that they weren\u0027t steering right. He was turning the wheels and instead they were tilting sideways. Well, what happens when you take a horizontal steering mechanism and put it on its side? It tilts. Not saying this is the problem here as I\u0027m sure you\u0027re careful to orient things right, but it\u0027s something I struggle with every time I use a wheel \u003Cem\u003Eespecially\u003C/em\u003E from the SPH where almost everything comes out at the wrong angle from the get-go.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m just working through this, playing with the ERS wheels at this moment in time.

Just setting KF up to drive them and see what happens, though the odd surface attach symmetry is annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe latest changes to the suspension movement in my code will probably mean that TS configs will break the wheels for the moment. I\u0027m adapting the plugin so TS can tweak a value to fix this, though I need to get myself up to speed properly with it. I know it was working fine before, but I changed it about because it set limits on design I wasn\u0027t happy with, so opted for a different method. All to do with whether the suspensionTraverse object is moved within its parents local space using transform.localposition, or moved using transform.translate, which moves it locally on its own axis. This difference is subtle, but important. What seems to happen if TS or RescaleFactor is applied is the translation moves the object a set amount, not an amount appropriate for what the RescaleFactor is set to. It won\u0027t be hard to fix, but just so you\u0027re aware.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m curious lo-fi, do the stock wheels, when hooked to the KF plugin, function like stock wheels?

If you need a hand at that, I can take a hand at writing some if you can make a template of what needs to change. Might even be able to re-use some of the data in the configs and make your MM patch be more universal instead of customized for each wheel. I\u0027ve already got the KF wheels undergoing a few personal MM customizations (makes updating your latest changes a lot easier if I don\u0027t edit the cfgs directly) and have become rather proficient at making MM configs as long as no advanced (aka.

I discovered the max rpm thing myself and what I\u0027ve done is just use an MM config to multiply the current \u0022maxRPM\u0022 by a small value to give the wheels some more breathing room. Yes, that produces some of the run-away wheels when not attached to the ground, but otherwise you loose out on being able to make a small rover with a super-powered engine that can make it catch air when going over the runway sideways... without using boosters that is. They still tend to limit me from getting too fast (unlike when I made a \u003Cem\u003EHUGE\u003C/em\u003E LLL-hulled rover using those giant stock wheels and found that if I held the key down it would continue to accelerate ever so slowly) but I don\u0027t run into the maximum rpm thing limiting me from going any faster and hyper-switching status in the right-click menu. They still have their curves untouched, which preserves \u003Cem\u003Ehow\u003C/em\u003E they accelerate, but they have the chance of flexing that to the limits without being held back as much. It works pretty well for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll revisit the maxRPM thing, and enable the GUI RPM readout again to make tweaking easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, now the crawler stuff. Yeah, I like that idea better than my old idea of just having a \u0022recenter\u0022 command in the action group settings. If they could just orient to the direction defined by those keys, like you were doing linear translation in space (except without the third dimension of movement) then it would become extremely intuitive. However, to gain fine control over that, the speed at which it aligns with the new heading should be slow enough that you can stop pressing that button and continue moving at whatever orientation they currently sit at, waiting to be re-oriented properly when the correct button is pushed. Personally, I\u0027d rather have the standard rover controls as they are and put the other movement functions either in the numpad or require the alt key to be used to alter the functionality of the directional keys.
