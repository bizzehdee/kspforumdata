I played KSP until 5:30 and went to bed; however, the sun was already shining so I could not fall asleep or even become tired. After one hour of pointlessly lying in bed, I decided to give up my futile attempts to fall asleep. I drunk some tea at 6:30 and now I\u0027m sitting in front of my PC again (7:50).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope that I will be tired in the evening so that I can finally go to sleep early.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-09T06:28:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsually you will feel sleepy a few hours before your usual sleeping time. Your body has went past its resting period and goes back to wakefulness period. You can push it again for a 48 hours of wakefulness, or even more, but it will kill you eventually. So, go sleep early for the next few days to return your sleep debt. You don\u0027t get back all the sleep from just one night.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-09T07:08:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCongrats?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129077-raindreamer/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022129077\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129077-raindreamer/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@RainDreamer\u003C/a\u003E said, sleep is not something you gain back in one night.
