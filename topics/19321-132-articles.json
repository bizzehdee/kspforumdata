Seemed like the adapter in the front and the one on the back had almost identical drag (at 25k back was 49kN front was 53kN). It\u0027s consistent with a lone can or mk1-2 pod, but it just seems odd that you\u0027ll get almost same drag on each side. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to why heat shield has so much lower drag, I have no clue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thorfinn","CreatedById":8349,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-26T23:33:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EAnyway personally only thing which bothers me from realism PoV, is the excessive shape drag on the back.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, that\u0027s a problem when you build shuttles, with all the idle engines at the back of the glider the tendency to lawndart can get really strong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t remember, is there an extra drag boost specifically for engines or just for any unattached node at the back?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-26T23:35:57Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2014 11:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by thorfinn\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-26T23:39:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@Aedile: \u003C/strong\u003EI\u0027ve got a fix in the works for the adapter, since that shouldn\u0027t be happening.
