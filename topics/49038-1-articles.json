A capsule, I assume and it\u0027s on the top, maybe with a parachute or docking port on it. Drag the bulk of your lander (say, the decoupler it\u0027s sitting on) down and away from it, and drop its ghost on the screen somewhere. We\u0027ll come back to it later but for now it\u0027s just in the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Grab your capsule (your root part) and note anything you have attached to it, so you can build it back up later. Probably just a parachute and maybe a com dish, and some goo canisters or something at most. Drag it over to the parts list on the left to delete it. Now you have no root part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Select a probe core. Anything will do. It will become your new root part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Reconstruct what you threw away. The capsule and a parachute, under this probe core. NOTE: You can\u0027t put the parachute on top if you had one, but if you had a docking port on top you\u0027ll be able to use that, unless it\u0027s the one with the doors that open. And other than that, your craft will be complete eventually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Now that you have your original capsule not as the root part, reattach the rest of your lander to the bottom of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Grab your capsule (not the probe core) and save it as a sub-assembly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Any time you use it, just remember to reattach the parachute to the top \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-17T22:38:20Z\u0022 title=\u002210/17/2013 10:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by 5thHorseman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eclarified the first 2 steps\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
