I had no problems with it and got it into orbit. I made a save on the pad just in case something went wrong, but when I got into orbit I quit the game and went to bed. The next morning I logged on to see that I launched at a not very optimal transfer window, and reverted to the pad and waited a couple (hundred) days and launched again to find that the same craft suddenly has a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of .94 I changed nothing with the craft and inspected it to find it exactly the same, and luckily I was recording the initial launch so I looked over the footage and found everything to be alright. I have no idea what is going on here, but the icing on the cake is that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E says that it would have a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 1.12 in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, but it just decreases. Did I encounter a bug or something?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-25T22:05:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheck your throttle\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slasher","CreatedById":180479,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-25T22:08:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223709800\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022190009\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221574719553\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129964\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022linuxgurugamer\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 minute ago, linuxgurugamer said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheck your throttle\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMain engine was throttled down, dont know how that happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-25T22:09:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDefault\u00A0 setting at launch\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
