The North Koreans switched to a solid-fueled variant after the liquid-fueled version kept failing (exploding, falling short, etc.) with no solid pointers as to what engine it originally used (Nodong, the R-27\u0027s engine, etc.).\n\nNow, if the North Koreans would\u0027ve been nice enough to state the fuel mix for the engine (N2O4 / UDMH or IFRNA / Kerosene) then the list of candidate\u0027s would\u0027ve been much shorter.\n\nWhen I made this thread (over 2 years ago!), they were testing the liquid-fueled variant. If you look at the picture in the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221. Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it. 2. Overpowered. A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E, you can clearly see that the engine\u0027s liquid-fueled (\u0022clean\u0022 flame / less smoke than the solid-fueled version).\n\nThey\u0027ve also seemed to have abandoned trying to use the R-27\u0027s powerpack for their new missiles. They\u0027ve all but stopped testing Musudans, and their new IRBM and ICBM (Hwasong-12 / 14) utilize a \u0022domestic\u0022 (with speculation that it\u0027s based off either the SS-18\u0027s powerpack or the Chinese YF-20) powerpack.\n\nPS: There was quite a furious debate after an armscontrolwonk article wonk article on the KN-11, where some people were claiming that the missile had a 1.5 m diameter (same as the R-27) and others were claiming 1.25 m (though not much disagreement about its length, which they assumed was similar to the R-27\u0027s, if I\u0027m not mistaken).\n\n[http://www.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/207631/dprk-slbm-test/](http://www.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/207631/dprk-slbm-test/)\n\nIt doesn\u0027t matter much now. They\u0027ve developed a solid motor capable of propelling the KN-11 / KN-15 MRBM, even if their ability to control the missile accurately is dubious (since they haven\u0027t bragged about thrust-termination systems, etc. often utilized to accurately / reliably control a solid-fueled ballistic missile\u0027s trajectory).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-17T07:53:15Z\u0022 title=\u002207/17/2017 07:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 17, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by andrew123**"}]}
