The team has a 100% hit rate on long development periods for seemingly little delivery, delays and reductions in scope for a given release, and I\u0027ve seen no evidence or new trend of behavior showing it\u0027ll change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Datau03","CreatedById":223270,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-26T11:01:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224352166\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022221790\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221703579992\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002241508\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022chefsbrian\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, chefsbrian said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor what its worth, they\u0027re in the planning process for the 0.3 release, not for colonies - IE, they\u0027re figuring out what they can actually fit into the release on whatever timeline they\u0027re aiming for, what features that are in flight/undeveloped that they absolutely need to fit into a first pass colonies release, etc. This would include bundling in the stuff they\u0027ve already developed, and getting it to a fully connected state - They may have most of the models/assets in a first pass ready for game state (Modeled, early textures, but missing LODS and animations for example) but only some of them defined as workable parts in the colony builder. Colony builder might still be fired off by console commands, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is probably just a case of accurate but poorly defined communication misrepresenting the situation on the ground. Full kickoff into dev just means going from whatever core team was backboning it being the only resources on hand, to throwing most every artist, programmer, UI/UX designer that isn\u0027t working on the new fonts, etc into the kitchen now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat seems very plausible as they must\u0027ve been working on colonies before the EA release a lot already and we have already seen some footage of them. Early access wasn\u0027t even intended until 2022 and they were propably focused on things like interstellar, colonies, resources and multiplayer until their focus had to shift to making the base playable quickly when they decided for Early Access. I think all the other features are at least in a working framework with still missing real gameplay with UI/UX integration state, so they still need to get connected together with the rest of the, UI/UX and some polish, so basically what you said\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-12-26T19:27:18Z\u0022 title=\u002212/26/2023 07:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Dec 26\u0022\u003EDecember 26, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Datau03\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
