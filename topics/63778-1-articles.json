For fun I put on the shielded docking on my refueling craft. When I got the the ship in orbit I struggled to dock it as it seemed the two docking ports seemed to bounce off each other. That said I was able to eventually dock so they aren\u0027t entirely broken and I\u0027m not the best at docking so really I\u0027m asking the more seasoned dockers if there is an issue with shielded docking port.
