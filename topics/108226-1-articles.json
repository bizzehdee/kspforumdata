It looks like 24 sides for the main nozzle. with that many sides you will mainly make the model hard for you to work with(ie. Many segements close together) and it wont look much smoother (thanks to smooth shading and small cross section) i would suggest 8 12 or 16 sides. also good for not spending too many polys where it doesnt help the model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enr 2: cylinder segement numbers not sync between detached parts (the tubes going around the main nozzle) this makes the segementing more apparent even tho there are lots of segements. Detached cylindrical parts should retain the same amount of segements as the main part. Horizontal segement amounts look good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENr 3: (related to nr 1/2)No scaling of segement amounts in relation to radius/size. Ie: as pieces get smaller they should recieve less segements. both to reduce polycount and to make the model look more \u0022even\u0022. id suggest 12/16 sides for the nozzle, 8 for the mid sized cylinder\u002Btouruses on the right (cooling loop pipe?) And 4-8 for the smallest tubes)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enr 4: detached parts with matching geometry wastes uv space. Id suggest joining those tourus shaped tubes to the nozzle and pipe detail. The other intersecting/detached geometry is completly fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehope its readable. Im writing on my phone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind this is pretty harsh criticism for a beginner. and more meant as pointers that you can use to become more efficient as you progress in your modeling. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is a nice model.
