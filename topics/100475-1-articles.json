However, I am running into a fairly serious problem in the editor with it. Namely, once I\u0027ve touched the 3d mouse, I can no longer grab any new parts out of the part menu. Specifically what will happen is as soon as I grab a part, it will get immediately dropped, and I am unable to pick it up again.\n\nHere is the exact error from the output log\n\n    (Filename: C:/BuildAgent/work/d63dfc6385190b60/artifacts/StandalonePlayerGenerated/UnityEngineDebug.cpp Line: 49)[EditorLogic]: Selected Part was lost for unknown reasons! This is possibly unwanted behaviour.\n\nAnd the complete pastebin of the entire log is here: [http://pastebin.com/rmXHgs2v](http://pastebin.com/rmXHgs2v)\n\nI am using win7 x64 (KSP is 32bit), and I have tried it with KSP running in directX 9, 10, 11, and opengl modes. Leaving the VAB/SPH (happens in either) and returning allows normal function until I manipulate the 3d mouse, at which time it breaks again. Manipulating already placed parts is not affected. Also I went back and tested an old 0.25 install and the bug was not present. I\u0027ve tried multiple installs, including a brand new one I made just for this test, the same result is present in all .90 installs.\n\nHere\u0027s a quick video showing the bug in action:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/xKOwu8ArrKo?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nThoughts?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-25T02:13:08Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2015 02:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Yargnit**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T14:55:24Z","Content":"It looks like a known issue to the devs, but it was not caught in time for .90\n\nPlease see **this thread** for more ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
