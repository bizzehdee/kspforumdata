However, I am running into a fairly serious problem in the editor with it. Namely, once I\u0027ve touched the 3d mouse, I can no longer grab any new parts out of the part menu. Specifically what will happen is as soon as I grab a part, it will get immediately dropped, and I am unable to pick it up again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the exact error from the output log\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E(Filename: C:/BuildAgent/work/d63dfc6385190b60/artifacts/StandalonePlayerGenerated/UnityEngineDebug.cpp Line: 49)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E[EditorLogic]: Selected Part was lost for unknown reasons!

Leaving the VAB/SPH (happens in either) and returning allows normal function until I manipulate the 3d mouse, at which time it breaks again. Manipulating already placed parts is not affected. Also I went back and tested an old 0.25 install and the bug was not present. I\u0027ve tried multiple installs, including a brand new one I made just for this test, the same result is present in all .90 installs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a quick video showing the bug in action:\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/xKOwu8ArrKo?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-25T02:13:08Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2015 02:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Yargnit\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T14:55:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt looks like a known issue to the devs, but it was not caught in time for .90\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease see \u003Cstrong\u003Ethis thread\u003C/strong\u003E for more \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
