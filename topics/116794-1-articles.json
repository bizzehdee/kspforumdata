I am a bit surprised because the processing rate doesn\u0027t seem to go up much. I bring up another 3 Level Scientists and can then confirm that they have had no effect on the science processing rate, which has maxed out at 3.375 science a day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first I think it\u0027s a fault in recognizing what does and does not constitute a part of the station, that it is only counting the 15 scientists in the pods that were directly connected to the lab in the same stack, rather than the 10 in another part that is docked to it. But I moved Bob Kerman from one part of the station to another and this did not affect the processing rate at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did the math based on the data provided in the wiki, and 500 data and 0.0675% per day per level 1 scientist with an output of 3.375 per day matches the output of 10 scientists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo are the number of scientists who can work a single lab capped at 10?

So, it comes to reason that three shifts of two scientists each will utilize the workstations to maximum, allowing time for proper rest, recreation and work that can be done outside the workstation (planning, analysis, brainstorming, reading materials on the subject).
