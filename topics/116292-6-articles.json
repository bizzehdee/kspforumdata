(Especially on vehicles like the N1, look at those crazy Russians and their 30-engine first stage rocket.)\n- Make sounds a bit better\n- Other stuff I\u0027m not thinking of off the top of my head.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Hi there!

Even more happily, many mods I use are supported. This with [Engine Lighting](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121987-1-0-4-Engine-Lighting-%281-4-0%29-The-Decoupler-Update-%2830-June%29) sounds like it will be amazing!\n\u003E And I know you already have a bunch of mod capatability and probably don\u0027t want more suggestions, but I have to throw out two others. [OMSK](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112419-OMSK-Space-Products-Stockalike-Atlas-rockets-more!-Omich-L-Beta) and the enigmatically updated [KSOS](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68429-0-90-Kerbin-Shuttle-Orbiter-System-v4-13http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68429-0-90-Kerbin-Shuttle-Orbiter-System-v4-13).\n\u003E \n\u003E Anyway, I can\u0027t wait to give it a try!\n\n(As far as I\u0027m aware) Neither SmokeScreen, ModuleManager, or RealPlume use any OS-dependent functions, as long as KSP works, RealPlume should work.\n\nThose do look like good mods, if you\u0027re so inclined, adding a plume to an engine is a pretty easy process, [I have a guide up on the RealPlume wiki](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealPlume/wiki/Adding-a-Plume-to-an-Engine), or generically, there\u0027s only three steps (specifics in the wiki link above).\n\n1. Make a config file for your part with the stuff in it RealPlume needs\n2. Launch the game, tweak the plume / flare size \u0026 position\n3. Save your changes to the config file you made in step 1.\n\nI\u0027ve tried to keep the process simple to make it so that anyone can add a plume to an engine if they feel so inclined.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027d like to see homegrown rockets too! I tried adding plume to stock engines, did pretty decently until I saw the work done here and just used that.\n\u003E HGR rocket plume would be awesome! Pretty please!\n\nAbsolutely! Though if you like, I wouldn\u0027t mind if you went through and added plumes yourself. I know for sure I\u0027ll have my hands full making the tweaks to the generic plumes that I outlined above, to improve the overall appearance of the plumes added by the mod.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Nice mod.\n\u003E But I have to say a few words about sounds here because I cannot find a thread related to RealPlumes mod itself. The samples are good, the ones for SRBs make you feel all the power under the \u0022hood\u0022. But when played in a loop some of them feel a little monotonous like steam machines: \u0022choo-choo, choo-choo\u0022. I think stock engine sounds are played in a loop too but haven\u0027t such a noticable effect because they lack any significant peaks or distinct sounds that make ears catch the rhythm. May be the better way would be to play the samples in portions arranged in a random order rather than simply loop over the whole sample?\n\nHrm, now that you mention it, that\u0027s probably something I could do. It\u0027ll require a change to the SmokeScreen plugin, and it\u0027ll require some tinkering, but it\u0027s probably doable. What you\u0027re hearing is the ever so slight offset in multiples of the same sound files playing at what the game thinks is the same time. However, because it\u0027s a game and single-threaded, they\u0027ll always start playing sequentially, which means you\u0027ll end up with some \u0022beats\u0022 within the sound, like you\u0027re describing. I\u0027ll see if I can figure out a way to get SmokeScreen to recognize if more than one copy of a sound file is playing, and force a (random?) time offset in the looped sound file. It should make a much better sound.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E First af all, this mod is one of the greatest ones, besides Scatterer.\n\u003E http://imgur.com/zqKnYAK[http://i.imgur.com/zqKnYAK.png](http://i.imgur.com/zqKnYAK.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E But can we actually have hot air effects in KSP? Most games use transparent particles with normal maps for them.\n\nThat would be nifty! As was mentioned by Avera9eJoe, [BahamutoD is working on it](https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/3asn9a/working_on_heat_refraction_for_exhaust_wip_mod/). Hopefully there\u0027s no conflict between SmokeScreen and his mod when it comes out, because that would be **awesome**.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This, I\u0027ve said it three times now in this thread xD Thankfully others are seeing it. @Felger do you think you could add something in the OP telling people they can reduce the particle amount to help with frame rate?\n\nYeah, I\u0027d better put an FAQ section in the OP and start it out with that. Wish this were like Github where @Felger would actually notify me that you\u0027d said my name. Oh well.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Oh, there! LOL\n\u003E Thanks. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E edit: *maybe* it should be noted in the first post that the only way to set the particles would be installing the toolbar mod, because other than that, you can\u0027t access smokescreen\u0027s properties. I\u0027ve spent an hour trying to figure this out.\n\u003E \n\u003E edit2:\n\u003E \n\u003E If this\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/MDb7gbM.png](http://i.imgur.com/MDb7gbM.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E could do this\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/449584613100697137/EDA88A47CF3F01B24492BD22709301B7F4FD8ACB/](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/449584613100697137/EDA88A47CF3F01B24492BD22709301B7F4FD8ACB/)\n\u003E \n\u003E it would be so cool.\n\nIndeed! It\u0027s actually not too hard to add a plume to an engine, I have a [whole wiki page dedicated to it](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealPlume/wiki/Adding-a-Plume-to-an-Engine). If you feel like giving it a shot, dive in! Otherwise, you\u0027ll probably have to wait until I (and my extraordinarily free schedule) get around it.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Is there a config file where I could specify the particleMaximumAmount for not have to alter it on every launch?\n\nSmokeScreen should store it automatically when you change it in-game as a config file, though you might have to relaunch the game for it to take effect. Otherwise it\u0027s in the SmokeScreen Folder in GameData.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Have a possible bug report. When running realplume my Turbojet engine model is reduced in scale, and its connection node is out of position. I am not running Ven\u0027s stock revamp due to the amount of memory crashes I got with it, so my game is mostly stock with regards to parts. I suspect that might be the issue as Ven\u0027s revamp changes the model and realplume may be calibrated for it and not the stock model. Anyone else experience this?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I have the original ION sound wav that could be included\n\nHmm, I should go through the stock game sounds and see about adding them to engines where appropriate. Not all of the stock effects are terrible.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I just submitted a pull request that includes a fix for the weirdo turbofan scaling caused by the file Justicier mentioned. You can either download it through the RealPlume Github repo or download [this](http://www./download/mkayxe5fd8cqnju/RealPlumeTFFix.zip) file and just overwrite your GameData with it.

I\u0027m submitting a pull request as we speak for the added config so the next update will have them or you can grab it from the repo.\n\nThis is strange, I\u0027ll have to poke around at the turbojet effects and make sure they\u0027re working as I intended them.
