Especially in my current career game this got very important since I sat funds to 60% when starting the game which not only significantly lowers mission income but also seems to raise upgrade costs for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E facilities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my current cash cow is a 5-Kerbal passenger cruiser which I use for various missions in the Kerbin system. The current version has a launch weight around 33t and I usually do roundtrips Kerbin-\u0026gt;Minmus (land)-\u0026gt;Kerbol orbit-\u0026gt;Mun (land)-\u0026gt;Kerbin (land) with it so that the passengers will have level 3 at the end. On these roundtrips many different missions can be completed so each roundtrip is usually worth a couple 100K funds. Also this gives me the science needed since I always land in different biomes to collect science data on these roundtrips.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI usually collect multiple Missions for one roundtrip.
