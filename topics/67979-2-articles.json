The distance from your landing site only really matters for when you\u0027re first scanning for a science spot. Once you\u0027ve found it, the two spots are set with lat/long coords and a method is used to calculate the distance between them in real time. As long as you quick load and the science spot is still where it should be (for example eastern USA) and the distance calculated is the distance between you and that science spot (and is correct), then all should be fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-06T05:41:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2014 05:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by theSpeare\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snillum101","CreatedById":34419,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-08T12:46:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBeen having great fun with this mod.

I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll have time to test it out for now; and I\u0027m more or less relying on feedback if it\u0027s causing any issues. I will during this weekend hopefully just recompile it against 24.2 and maybe look at integrating RoverScience to the stock AppLauncher. I may even shuffle the costs around so that you spend money instead of science to upgrade the brain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know if there are any issues running RoverScience on 24.2 and if there are I\u0027ll try to fix it and mark it 24.2 compatible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Climberfx","CreatedById":57126,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-27T19:49:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI made this part a long time ago, to use as my MechJEb one, but if you please it, i can made it yours for this mode only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/7jnt3u83twf0sor/ClimberFX.zip?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/7jnt3u83twf0sor/ClimberFX.zip?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/f1sHYK\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2830/9194208879_58a2b49fa1_o.png\u0022 alt=\u00229194208879_58a2b49fa1_o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/f1sHYK\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/a\u003E by \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.flickr.com/people/58264651@N06/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EClimberfx\u003C/a\u003E, on Flickr\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/f2GiEe\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7450/9208175133_5a6a4ea8b8_o.png\u0022 alt=\u00229208175133_5a6a4ea8b8_o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/f2GiEe\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMechJeb Eye\u003C/a\u003E by \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.flickr.com/people/58264651@N06/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EClimberfx\u003C/a\u003E, on Flickr\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/f2Wykh\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3782/9210956062_30cdd699a6_o.png\u0022 alt=\u00229210956062_30cdd699a6_o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/f2Wykh\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMechJeb Eye\u003C/a\u003E by \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.flickr.com/people/58264651@N06/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EClimberfx\u003C/a\u003E, on Flickr\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Veelay","CreatedById":122147,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-05T17:50:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love the idea of this mod and you\u0027ve done a wonderful job with it!

I\u0027ll take a look at the source when I get time but unfortunately there won\u0027t be a fix for this at the moment; one thing you could always try is just add the stock wheel onto Modular Multiwheels and just set the stock wheel parameters to zero (speed and whatnot).
