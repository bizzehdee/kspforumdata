Depending on how you closely packed you want your armada, you can setup a \u0022bead of pearls in orbit\u0022 of ships and then launch them in turn with ejection angles that are very close to the optimal one : plan trajectory, burn one ship, switch to the next one, mess around with maneuver node, burn, rinse, repeat. Of course, the longer the ejection burn, the more you have to space your ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut this can quickly become a task switching fest as you add ships, especially as they will also tend to arrive at the same time at their target...\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I forget about pure efficiency, and don\u0027t mind a few tenths of degrees wrong on my ejection angle and space apart launches by at least one orbit and more commonly 6 or 8 hours just to be cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe loss of delta v is not so bad, and it leaves much more time to adjust orbits and aerobraking trajectories without sweating too much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mr.Rocket\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mr.Rocket\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E4. Any other tips?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, if you go for closely packed armada during your mass invasion of Duna, here is a quick and dirty trick I often use is to \u0022copy\u0022 one ship trajectory by setting it as a target and zeroing your relative velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis works well with dense armadas, but also on ships launched with fairly different trajectories : my Moho dual probe launches had been spaced by ~10 hours and each disrupted differently by the Mun. A few days after the launch, I found a (big) correction for my first probe that saved at least a net 1500 m/s in plane change at the cost of an inclined Moho orbit. I applied the same correction the second probe by using the first as a target and got more or less the same intercept for more or less the same delta v savings...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers and happy new year!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-01T03:35:24Z\u0022 title=\u002201/01/2014 03:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by el_coyoto\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"celem","CreatedById":91132,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-01T11:51:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI generally sort out arrival order mid-course. They depart based on dV spare, the guys with tight mission profiles get the launches closest to the optimal window. Once in flight, tiny burns will shift arrival time considerably.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it comes to armadas I tend to treat them like el-coyote above. I generally have the whole fleet in parking orbit and chuck them outwards as each ship approaches ejection angle. Low TWR interplanet stages means i\u0027ll often let a ship do another lap so that I can start a burn properly before the node (i like to split my burns 50/50 across T\u002B0).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would add that you should be wary of spacing the arrivals too tightly, especially with Duna as destination (im assuming you will aerobrake). You need enough time for each vessel to complete its brake before the next one starts, since only the vessel you are \u0027riding\u0027 will actually brake (the rest will rip through on rails and escape).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr.Rocket","CreatedById":80241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-01T16:03:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys.
