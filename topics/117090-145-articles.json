I followed your instructions, and it worked! I think what confused me was that I never knew that the command module staging icon actually did something.

After some experimenting I was able to figure out how to set up the staging and action groups exactly how I wanted them to work. I don\u0027t like using my mouse during launches, so I wanted to jettison the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E through staging with the space bar. I set the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E to have JettisonMotor as its default mode, with the decoupler staging disabled. I disabled all the staging options for the command module except for port staging. For the actions groups, I set up the abort action group to have the Command Module \u0022decouple Service module\u0022 and I set up the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E to \u0022Activate Engine\u0022 and \u0022Switch Mode\u0022. Then I just put the command module on the same stage as the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-30T20:34:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 minutes ago, NeoMorph said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Sweet.

This is probably the most important thing that needs to be completed, and I will not be starting any new major projects/parts/module until they are in place.  Some progress has been made on them, but it is turning out to be a... bumpy and convoluted process.  Though, I\u0027ve just thought of another potential workaround that -might- allow for use of the U5 wheel-collider (which will solve quite a few problems, but likely expose others); will likely be investigating this over the weekend.\n\nSecond, its busy crunch time at work, and likely will be until Sept./Oct. or so.  During slower months I have some \u0027down-time\u0027 at work when I can make a bit of progress on modeling/coding/texturing/etc... but not during the summer.  Currently it is non-stop from the moment I arrive until it is time to go home.  Generally this leaves me mentally exhausted at the end of the day and in no state to do any coding or anything that requires intelligence, patience, or understanding.\n\nThird, the weather.  Hard to concentrate on coding when it is so nice outside, even more-so as I live in Montana and our \u0027good weather\u0027 months are limited.  Here it is like 8 months of winter, 1 month of spring, 2 of summer, and 1 of fall.  So, I\u0027ve gotta do the summer stuff while the weather here is cooperative.  Have a few more camping trips/vacations planned before the weather turns bad again, and they generally take about 2 weeks of my time for every trip (a week of prep and a week of doing).  \n\nFourth, I\u0027m still struggling with getting my car fully working again.  It is running... but poorly... so I\u0027ve been having to spend quite a bit of time (and money ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif \u0022:(\u0022) ) on getting it back into a reliable and well running state.  No fun, a bit stressful, and quite distracting.  This is likely what I\u0027ll be spending a major portion of my weekend time doing.  Hopefully I\u0027ll get it figured out though, and that should at least free up my weekends and let me begin to unwind a bit.\n\nSo... yes, development has slowed down a bit for right now (and likely the next couple months at least), but I have not abandoned the mod.  I have no plans to stop development anytime soon; still quite a few concepts I would like to investigate, and tons of ideas that I would like to see in game at some point.\n\nAnyhow, I\u0027m hoping to do a recompile for 1.1.3 this weekend (mostly just to update AVC and make sure nothing was broken in the plugin).  Have a few other small fixes and changes that should make it into the update as well, shouldn\u0027t be anything game breaking.  Not sure what day yet (sat/sun/mon)... but I should have a few free hours one of those days to get done what needs doing.\n\n-After- the wheels bit gets fixed/finished/working, I will be changing my focus to getting some station parts in place.  Trusses, hab sections, some torus\u0027 parts (torii? what is plural for torus?), and the all-important \u0027welding docking port\u0027.  At the current rate though it seems like these might not get done until this fall/winter; probably for the best anyway, as that is when I\u0027ll have time (and patience) to actually concentrate on them and do them properly."},{"CreatedByName":"rasta013","CreatedById":140002,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-01T20:11:27Z","Content":"RL interferes with everyone eventually so no worries.
