That usually isn\u0027t enough elevator to keep a plane flying unless it\u0027s balanced to the pixel (CL inside the CG sphere. A touchy balance in the best of planes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with box planes like the video portrayed or tubular fins (if you\u0027re into rocketry) is the tubes only allow so much air to pass thru them (like Alphasus was hinting at) and at a certain speed, the tubes cannot pass anymore air. So air piles in front of the tubes and you essentially have a brick wall or enough air pressure at the front of the tube to overcome the air trying to rush in, and it spills over. That\u0027s where the drag really hits tubular fins or box planes (they\u0027re essentially the same thing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was some supersonic tube fin testing done by the British in the late 1950\u0027s to early 1960\u0027s and it basically ended up that if one ran a cone that had a 3 degree taper, smaller end at the front and bigger end at the back, there would be sufficient vacuum at the rear of the tube that it would suck any air that would build up at the front, hence allowing more air to enter the tube fin assembly. Unfortunately they also concluded that the tube fin is not suitable for supersonic flight due to shock waves bouncing inside the tube, creating more pressure fronts, blocking more air, and eventually the tube fin self destructed from over pressurization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s where Grid Fins come in. They are really REALLY bad at drag in the subsonic to transonic region, but when they are exposed to supersonic air velocities, the shock waves don\u0027t build up because the thickness of the Grid Fin is so small. They are very good at low drag for supersonic flight (some missiles have grid fins, as well as bombs that are deployed at supersonic velocities).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-12T03:58:49Z\u0022 title=\u002209/12/2015 03:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GDJ\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T03:51:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome points worth noting on the box design compared to the other designs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) it had much more lifting area, which would have made it much more maneuverable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) it had much more in the way of control surfaces, which would have made it more maneuverable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) it appears to have the CoL closer to the CoM, which would have certainly made it more maneuverable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) it had 3x as much engine, which would have made all the extra drag from the extra wing area irrelevant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) wing area in virtually every direction ensures that it has some extra protection for deflection shots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) using multiple parts for the wings ensures that damage at one location doesn\u0027t wipe out a large wing part, ensuring that damage is minor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) keeping everything close together ensures that for minor damage that doesn\u0027t destroy a part, heat can quickly dissipate throughout the vehicle, effectively nullifying all of the damage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is a well designed vehicle that is clearly optimized wrt stock\u0027s aero model and BDArmory\u0027s heat-damage model, as well as being able to get guns on target to force the enemy AI to go into evasive maneuvers and become less of a threat.

If the plane has a larger wingspan, then it\u0027s a bigger target because the massive wings mean it has more \u0027surface area\u0027. The Albatross, for example, has a HUGE surface area compared to the Aeris 3A. The smaller your surface area is, the harder your plane will be to hit because it\u0027s a smaller target. On the other hand, the smaller your surface area is on a traditional two-wing plane, the less lift you will have because your wings are smaller. Box planes achieve minimal surface area, while maximizing lift, by wrapping their wings above and below the fuselage and keeping them very short so that their surface area is almost the same as if they had no wings at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAllowing wing clipping allows a plane to have an arbitrarily low surface area by placing its wings inside the fuselage, and inside each other. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022dangerouspeople1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022dangerouspeople1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EActually is there any high thrust but efficient engines in ksp?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The Turbojet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022dangerouspeople1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022dangerouspeople1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf I use aero spike engines for a fighter, will it run out of fuel too early?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing a standard rocket engine gives you the advantage that your plane will take off much faster because it won\u0027t have to spool up, but it will run out of fuel very quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-12T18:23:30Z\u0022 title=\u002209/12/2015 06:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CreativeCombat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SasquatchM","CreatedById":11888,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T18:42:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I understand the concerns about the flying boxes, but there was no rule posted that said \u0027Must look classically plane-like\u0022.
