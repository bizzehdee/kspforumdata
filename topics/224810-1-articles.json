I think if Early Access was a functional colony builder with barely-working rocket game taped to it, we\u0027d be talking about KSP2 in a more positive way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have to disagree with some of the points on Unity as an engine. I think HarvesteR might have a bit of a tunnel vision on it. No, I don\u0027t think building a custom engine for KSP2 would make anyone\u0027s lives better. I mean, it\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0make for a much better game, but it\u0027d also inflate the budget by a factor of 10, easily. And it\u0027s not just because development would take longer - people they had working on KSP2 wouldn\u0027t be able to do this. Not in any kind of condescending way, to be clear. You need a team with expertise in engines. It\u0027s almost a different profession. You\u0027d have to hire a whole another team of people just to build you an engine for the gameplay engineers to be able to make a game in it. It\u0027s a huge amount of work. It can be worth it, but not on KSP2 budget.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut you don\u0027t have to go fully custom to have a lot of custom code. Unreal and Godot let you rebuild huge chunks of the engine. Neither of them are built for a game spanning interstellar distances any better than Unity, but you can rip out the parts that don\u0027t work and replace them with ones that do. Unity\u0027s plugin system is painfully limited in contrast. HarvesteR brought up an example with the origin transposition, and it\u0027s all true, but also the KSP1 code had to keep addressing it ad-hoc everywhere it was relevant. And that\u0027s bug-prone and scales poorly. Whereas in Unreal I can build a custom root component and have it take care of the coordinate system changes, and now any actor using that component just \u0022knows\u0022 where it is. It\u0027s a better solution to the same problem with custom code in a canned engine solution. And then there\u0027s performance problems that I can dedicate probably an equivalent of a few book chapters. Bottom line, going with Unreal or Godot wouldn\u0027t solve the problems magically, but it would expand the toolkit for solving them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are other tradeoffs as well, where the toolchain and compiling pains just keep growing with Unity at a faster rate as you work on a larger and larger game. There are a lot of Unity problems that HarvesteR seems to have accepted as just game development problem in general, and they aren\u0027t really. A lot of them are much less prominent on large projects in other engines. Of course, there would be negatives to going with Unreal or Godot as well. On the net, I wouldn\u0027t call Star Theory going with Unity for KSP2 was a mistake, since the original pitch was for a smaller game. Intercept continuing on that path is a bit more debatable, IMO. But even there, it\u0027s not \u0022The mistake that killed the project,\u0022 as some people serve it. Nothing that Unity would be throwing at Intercept would be unsolvable. But allowing for adjustments in the team composition within similar budget, I am pretty sure KSP2 development would be a little smoother with another engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne last bit that caught my attention is when HarvesteR talked about Kerbals in other games. It made me feel like he\u0027d totally approve of a Kerbal Kart game, so long as it was wild and reckless kind of kart racing, which I think it basically has to be, and this warms my heart. I really hope that T2/PD consider it at some point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorj","CreatedById":201273,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-12T09:26:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGame engines aren\u0027t my area of expertise, but from what I\u0027ve heard, Godot wouldn\u0027t not have helped the game\u0027s rendering performance problems.\u00A0 Unity just has a lot more effort put into core optimization (and Unreal even more so). \u00A0 I haven\u0027t heard anyone describe Godot\u0027s 3D performance as anything better than \u0022it\u0027s acceptable now\u0022.\u00A0 And of course the huge downside of Unreal is C\u002B\u002B.\u00A0 I used C\u002B\u002B professionally for a dozen or so years, and I\u0027d never go back.\u00A0 Not to revisit the usual language holy wars, so let\u0027s just say the cognitive load for writing/reviewing C\u002B\u002B code is just a lot higher than C# for most tasks, because of all the landmines and historical baggage of the former.\u00A0\u00A0 When trying to find a complex and subtle bug, the fewer things to consider that might be wrong, the quicker the process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d just take a very different approach to this kind of game.\u00A0 For a game with colonies, I\u0027d want to effortlessly support thousands of objects in stable orbits.\u00A0 There\u0027s a way to do that with fairly simple and straightforward code, by using a solid understanding of real physics rather than doing the work with game engine physics.\u00A0 But this forum is probably not the right place to discuss that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cryptobux","CreatedById":230559,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-12T09:33:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/201273-skorj/?do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022201273\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/201273-skorj/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Skorj\u003C/a\u003E, I reckon this forum is exactly the place for (generalised) discussion on the right way to develop a KSP-like game.

He then said that what he would have done in their shoes (and actually pitched unsuccessfully to Squad) would have been to create an aviation-based prequel rather than a sequel. If constrained to make a sequel however, he would have started by building out the colony mechanics without actual spaceflight simulation, and would only then have tried to incorporate all the KSP1 flight simulation elements.\u00A0 Not quite sure how he would have managed that exactly, but I think he did make an excellent point that implies they set themselves up to fail with the approach they actually took. His philosophical statement about a good new gameplay hook being the first and most important foundational element, from which everything else ought to grow organically, also showed IMO that he apparently understands marketing\u00A0 games to folks like us better than all the suits at TT put together. Lastly, he tacitly admitted that the source code he and his team put together for KSP1 was basically the product of a years long, pedal-to-the-metal hackathon, and fell so far short of industry standards for portability that it would likely have been of little use to even his own team, much less a new one.

Whoever made that decision ultimately killed the project. After that they were stuck making the game for a community that felt actively ripped off, and nothing short of amazing was ever going to be enough to convince large numbers of people to buy it.
