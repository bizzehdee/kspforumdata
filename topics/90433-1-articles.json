It is a ballistic bomber that travels at hypersonic speeds and uses the atmosphere like a rock uses water when thrown onto it at a flat trajectory: the bomber travels at Mach 20\u002B (on earth) and is \u0027\u0027reflected\u0027\u0027 by the atmosphere - this means that after the ballistic part of the flight, the bomber glides up again and goes on a new, smaller ballistic trajectory. The bomber then drops a nuke over the USA and lands somewhere in Japan or even completely circles the planet to land back in Europe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silbervogel\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silbervogel\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo...do you think that using FAR, it would be possible to build a similar craft in KSP that flies at an almost-orbit trajectory and always \u0027\u0027hops\u0027\u0027 up into space. Like you might already have understood, each \u0027\u0027hop\u0027\u0027 is smaller than the last one due to velocity loss, and eventually the bomber stops \u0027\u0027hopping\u0027\u0027 to enter a gliding trajectory to the landing site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also could be used on other planets with atmosphere: imagine a duna or laythe lander that scouts for landing sites and \u0027\u0027hops\u0027\u0027 around the whole planet until gliding down to an acceptable landing site. Or using it as a launch platform from the upper atmosphere: I am sure the delta-v required for a rocket to enter orbit if launched from an antipodal bomber on a ballistic \u0027\u0027hop\u0027\u0027 is less than 300 m/s, this means only one stage. Even a spaceplane could abstain from the main engines and would only need its maneuvering engines to correct the trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood crazy idea?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-16T08:56:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan be done, and often is done by accident; pull up a bit too hard for too long when negating your initial reentry drop and you\u0027ll find yourself bouncing back into space.
