NASA\u0027s proposed budget orders fewer Saturn V\u0027s, and shuts down production of all three stages. To preserve launch capability independent of the Air Force Titan rocket (and without the budget for Space Shuttle) the SI stage of Saturn IB is modified to launch as the first stage below a modified Atlas with three sustainer engines. Saturn-Atlas-Centaur becomes a successful launcher, mainly to GTO. Production continues on the Apollo CSM to tend to Skylab, which will become the focus of a less-agressive (but more successful) Apollo Applications Project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout a Space Shuttle to draw attention and money, Skylab flies for much longer.
