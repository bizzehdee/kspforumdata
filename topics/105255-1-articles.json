Instead of having to rely on Nikolai Kuznetsov\u0027s less-powerful NK33, Glushko designs an RD170-like rocket engine for N1. This allows N1 to meet the eventual performance requirements without Korolyov having to fib (leading to the hasty modifications that caused four consecutive failures). When Korolyov and Vladimir Chelomey convince Leonid Brezhnev to pursue a piloted Moon landing, the capable N1 will bee quickly selected as the favored option, and Chelomey\u0027s Zond program is cancelled. \n\nThe first test-flight happens earlier, possibly before Korolyov\u0027s untimely death. Before Apollo 4. Soviet cosmonauts become the first humans to fly a circumlunar mission in 1968. The Space Race winds down quickly as Alexey Leonov becomes the first human being on the Moon in 1969, followed by Niel Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. NASA\u0027s proposed budget orders fewer Saturn V\u0027s, and shuts down production of all three stages. To preserve launch capability independent of the Air Force Titan rocket (and without the budget for Space Shuttle) the SI stage of Saturn IB is modified to launch as the first stage below a modified Atlas with three sustainer engines. Saturn-Atlas-Centaur becomes a successful launcher, mainly to GTO. Production continues on the Apollo CSM to tend to Skylab, which will become the focus of a less-agressive (but more successful) Apollo Applications Project.\n\nWithout a Space Shuttle to draw attention and money, Skylab flies for much longer. Around 1974, as USA-USSR relations thaw, Soyuz makes a visit to Skylab. A few years later (the DM still attached to one of Skylab\u0027s ports), DOS-5 becomes a permanent additional module, and Salyut-Skylab becomes an early International Space Station."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T07:15:56Z","Content":"OP was wondering about alternate histories should the Soviets have landed on the moon before the US.
