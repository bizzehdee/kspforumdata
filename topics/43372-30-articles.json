I cannot recall sorry) by venting \u0027cabin air\u0027 - no one would do that because eventually you would deplete first\u00A0all your N2 and eventually if you didn\u0027t burn yourself\u00A0you\u0027d vent all your O2 as well.

For sure spares and consumables is what limits the max size of some remote facility but I think they overestimated the spares. Suppose you need S spares for one crew (crew A) to be 99% safe. They assumed the second crew (B) needed to bring 2S spares, S for A and S for B, but chances are A wont have used all it\u0027s original spares (99% chance they wont have) and A \u0026amp; B together don\u0027t need 2S spares to be 99% safe, 2S makes them 99.99% safe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could probably reduce spares and initial mass by not trying to do greenhouses etc; which are hard, massive, unproven\u00A0etc - but I don\u0027t see Mars One publishing any comparative studies or break-even estimates.
