My first Duna landing didn\u0027t even use parachutes; looking back, I\u0027m just amazed it worked given how inexperienced I was. (I actually landed on Duna before Mun or Minmus.) It\u0027s strange; when I returned to Duna much later, using a considerably larger lander with parachutes, I had far more problems landing. The problem was that Duna\u0027s atmosphere was too thin for the parachutes to completely cancel out the incoming velocity, so since I\u0027d tried to use aerobraking to save fuel... well, it meant that I\u0027d reach ground level with a huge sideways velocity remaining. But coming straight down, without aerobraking, caused so much strain on the parachutes that they\u0027d rip off half the time. (That design didn\u0027t have drogues, though, so it\u0027s possible that a better design could work just fine.)
