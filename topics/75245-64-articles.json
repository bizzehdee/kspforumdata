You can launch manned with no problem. If you\u0027re failing, that shouldn\u0027t be a problem with RT. If you launch unmanned, you\u0027ll want the Reflectron DP-10 which has a range of 500km. It\u0027ll get you to orbit if you take a pretty vertical approach. If you do a nice efficient gravity turn, you\u0027ll possibly go out of range of KSC before you can circularize. Add on any longer range one and you\u0027ll definitely be fine, but you\u0027ll need to activate it before it\u0027ll work, and you\u0027ll want to do that via action group around the time you punch out of the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERT requires a layered communication approach. For anything more permanent or more distant, you\u0027ll also want to add a suitable length dish and activate \u002B target it before you leave range of your shorter antennas. I typically have 2 antenna and 1 dish minimum on my craft - the Reflectron which is always on, the Communotron 32 which is the longest antenna, and then a dish that has roughly double the maximum range to Kerbin so it can reach sats on the far side if need be. Since dishes can only interact with one target, if you are setting up a network, the craft that form the network will likely need multiple dishes - one active craft target, one KSC or relay target, and then one or more to target outbound craft and/or other relays for redundancy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the probe cores do come with a 3km built-in antenna, but you need to manually unlock it under the advanced unmanned tech science tree node if you\u0027re paying for parts.

I\u0027ll go through those and try and narrow the problem down a bit. It\u0027s a complex craft at this stage - a transfer stage with a probe core so that it can be re-entered (I need the money - hard career), there\u0027s the manned lander, there\u0027s my Mun mapping probe, there\u0027s a skycrane/rover combo that has both a manned capsule and probe core on the skycrane (the capsule is currently unmanned) and the rover is currently unmanned. There\u0027s a separator between the transfer stage and the various landers/probes, but the rest are all connected via docking ports, as some will return. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s probably the issue is that the whole mess was constructed around the rover as the root part, but it\u0027s unmanned (and therefore doesn\u0027t have the minimum crew) and I\u0027m controlling it from the lander. Let me poke at it a bit, iterating through which parts are in control and maybe enable/disabling some things. I think you\u0027ve got me pointed in the right direction, thank you. I may have my MM configs a bit hosed, so I\u0027ll look at those as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eskandare","CreatedById":62742,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-05T22:41:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs there a config for lack luster labs antenna?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"n01487477","CreatedById":67423,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-06T02:42:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi - Thanks for the terrific mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any way for the flight computer to remember the settings inputted when switching vessels?
