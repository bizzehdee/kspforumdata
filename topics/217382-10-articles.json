I know some delays are common and should be tolerated for the quality, but KSP 2 was getting pretty bad there even compared to the industry standards. If anything, it probably the EA probably helped the release in the long term since it forced them to focus on bugs in basic systems for a bit, before adding more features on top. I also have less faith in the vision and the roadmap because it is very unspecific - sure, there are going to be colonies, interstellar and multiplayer, which is all great, but there was very little specifics how those systems will work. Ask anyone who played KSP 1 for a bit, and they would probably come up with the same features. Making them fun is the challenge, and here the proof is still outstanding. I remain hopeful and am trying to keep open-minded (otherwise I would no longer be on the forums), but at the same time I am a fair bit more pessimistic than some other people on these boards - I think there is a significant chance the game will never get in a decent shape.\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-02T19:44:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224289775\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022217382\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221685731674\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022192494\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MarcAbaddon\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n57 minutes ago, MarcAbaddon said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t get putting all the blame on the publisher.
