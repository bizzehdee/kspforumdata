BioMass Legacy (the spaceport version) should not add much burden on your memory. Yes, BioMass integrates with other mods that use the same resources and leaves all tracking up to the life support mods that have created them. BioMass is essentially just a few extra parts with different roles when used in combination with TAC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA bit more detailed...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the models are low poly, and we do very little with our plugin dll(adds the ability to call an animation with the stock ModuleGenerator when activated). All resources are processed using stock KSP modules that we have modified to process the new resources we have introduced. Currently the mod does not track resources in the same way that TAC does, and we don\u0027t add any new windows or anything like that. BioMass Legacy is essentially created by modifying the stock parts config files and adds few new models. We leave all of the life support work up to the mods that have created them, and we try to maintain our mod in such a way that it will integrate with them seamlessly by using the same resource definitions and densities. BioMass Legacy also stands by itself, meaning it will work with or without any other mods present at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the version we are developing that is hosted on GitHub will be a different story. That version will have more more models, and more functionality added to the plugin dll which may end up increasing the memory load a fair amount.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Roboto","CreatedById":79154,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-03T02:53:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Moon Goddess\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Moon Goddess\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t understand this mod?

While the calculations behind it may not be perfect representations of realistic physics, the science behind it is plausible. Operating under the assumption that there is a constant supply of biological waste commonly found on any manned(kerbaled?) space mission, it recycles that waste through a system of modules that replicate the nitrogen and water cycles in a closed system. Essentially it allows you to create a sustained biosphere aboard your craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing that comes to mind when asked this question is suspension of disbelief. Do Kerbals die when left stranded for unreasonably long periods of time?(no) Then we must assume that there are things left unsaid. Kerbals must have supplies of food, water etc... that allow them to endure that long. It is these supplies and the resulting waste that we assume are present that allow us to maintain the cycle in a closed system. But then again... Damn it, Jim!

As for the indefinite life support it would be nice for the space station as with TAC life support you usually return the crew back to kerbin when doing some other long term mission with a lot of time acceleration. And with greenhouse you can keep the crews in space. But you have your point it may ruin the whole TAC life support idea. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHaving said that, check out the BioMass\u002B \u0022Easy\u0022 version on github.
