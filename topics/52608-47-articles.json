It\u0027s very elegantly made!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also wanted to share some of the pages I messed with, basically scribbling on the ones you\u0027ve already made (I hope that\u0027s okay...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1EzHb3D.png\u0022 alt=\u00221EzHb3D.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI edited the font and navball overlay to include a throttle gauge. (the gauge is by using the BAR formatting tag with the \u00271/4\u0027 character, after replacing that glyph with a 16x16 pixel glyph, then using half-width to give it extra fidelity.) The other change is to the TGT/SRF SPEED in the upper-right, that displays the TGT speed now if the navball, and the SRF speed when it\u0027s in any other mode. (This required a bit of black magic using offset tags)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sVbc23P.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sVbc23P.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a second page on the resources key (6), the resource names have to be hand filled in the .txt file, but it produces much cleaner formatting! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe colorcoding is such that it\u0027ll gray out any field that has no capacity for that resource, and (depending on the resource) red it out if there is capacity, but it\u0027s empty. Kethane, L. Waste, and Waste Heat don\u0027t turn red though, since it\u0027s not so bad if they\u0027re empty necessarily. \u0022L. Support\u0022 is a part of TAC, and only keeps track of Oxygen (same for \u0022L. Waste\u0022). Oxygen/Food/Water almost always have the same values, and having multiple entries clutters the fields, so this is my compromise. Again, this uses the little glyph I made in the \u00271/4\u0027 spot at half width, which gives each gauge a pretty nice fidelity of 38 units.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WJOMafd.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WJOMafd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust adding some relevant data on the descent graph, nothing fancy.

It *might* be possible to work it out in RPM, if we can see what state the animation is in, but I doubt it would perform well (the switch may pause briefly in the \u0022on\u0022 position, for instance). You\u0027re better off finding a prop maker who is willing to design a momentary switch, or use a different part (the stock square button, for instance, can be used as a momentary switch or a latching switch, since it doesn\u0027t use an animation - you can use color to display state).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bit Fiddler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bit Fiddler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd as a further bonus maybe change the text field based on the state of a button\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAG already does this, using this syntax in the vessel description:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003EAG1=On Text|Off Text\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bit Fiddler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bit Fiddler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eas a multi state button you could possibly set the label to rotate through a list and have the light color cycle through several colors to follow the state. e.g. (AG1= \u0026amp;c TEXT1 \u0026amp;/ \u0026amp;c TEXT2 \u0026amp;/ \u0026amp;c TEXT3 \u0026amp;/ \u0026amp;c TEXT4 \u0026amp;/ \u0026amp;c TEXT5) would cycle the text labels each time I push the button from text 1 to text 5 and then wrap back to text 1. and each of these states may have a configurable color for the light to go with it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis sounds like the functionality in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Mihara/RasterPropMonitor/wiki/Prop-modules#jsiswitchablevariablelabel\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJSISwitchableVariableLabel\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bit Fiddler","CreatedById":103108,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-01T11:47:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk... thanks for the info.
