I figured I\u0027d share a video I made with the new update... and kind of sort of report a bug. Somehow my ship disappeared when it was parachuting to the ground when I switched to a landed ship with [ (or was it ]? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/6uANW55VdTM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecopy paste from youtube description\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo yeah with the new update (1.7 or 0.17 or whatever) I decided to fly a plane to another planet. I flew a smaller plane to Duna but the engine didn\u0027t work and the atmosphere was thin, so I assumed that is why the engine didn\u0027t work there. Got this bigger plane to Eve since I knew the atmosphere there was really thick, I had landed there in a non plane before. \u003Cp\u003ESo flew this thing all the way there, find out the engine doesn\u0027t work, the landing zone is really far away from where the previously landed craft is... but then I find out thanks to the really thick atmosphere and the lift from my wings I drop less than 1 m/s (vertically) and go about 20 m/s horizontally. Drifted well over 90 KM to the other ship (don\u0027t know exact distance) and drifted for an hour and 10 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I finally try to land there I want a shot of my new craft landing from the already landed craft\u0027s point of view, so I hit [.
