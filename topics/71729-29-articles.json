In my experience with GPR, antenna placement is really crucial for good measurements. I\u0027ve had so much data distorted with the antenna being affected by topography. Some of my research has suffered due to poor surveying. But then again, they probably did plan for irregular topography so it is possible that the data may be corrected or unaffected by Philae\u0027s position.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-17T08:43:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, let\u0027s get back on topic here.
