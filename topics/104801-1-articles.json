This makes for an interesting gameplay element that Karbonite (and most likely Ore) fails to do.\n\nI usually agree with Alshain, but on this point I must disagree. It is \\*purely\\* a matter of opinion, but Karbonite is superior in virtually every way... like Mary Poppins. Sure, it\u0027s different... but it poses it\u0027s own unique set of possibilities, challenges, and design angles. For starters, Karbonite can be used as fuel directly or for refining into other fuels. Karonite-based vehicles have some advantages and disadvantages... they are mostly just different. They have lower ISP and higher thrust (fantastic for launch stages)...however, the lower ISP is mostly countered by the fact that Karbonite is extremely dense compared to LFO... this improves empty/full mass ratio offsetting the costs associated with lower ISP. In fact, if karbonite engines had similar ISP\u0027s as LFO engines.... they\u0027d be completely overpowered. When coupled with TACLS, there are some parts that can convert LFO into water\u002Boxygen for crew... karbonite cannot be used for that purpose (that I know of). Also, to build a karbonite mining base requires loads of investment (in career anyhow), but is usually well worth it. Coupled with the logistics hub from the MKS/OKS suite, it\u0027s a powerful tool. Here\u0027s another catch, the tiny karbonite engine is pretty horrible compared to its LFO counterparts and it\u0027s bigger Karbonite cousins (apparently Karbonite works best in large doses? Go big or go home?) \\*however\\*, tiny karbonite fuelled probes/rovers can make use of the tiny karbonite drills / generators to extend their mission indefinitely. Sure, the tiny drills are horribly inefficient... and coupled with the mini karbonite generators will only drain your karbonite/electricity... but if coupled with some other energy source (solar panels or rtgs) you can refill on the fly in situ (wherever karbonite can be found)... this can be a huge deal, maybe even worth the inconvenience of suffering smaller dV\u0027s. Karbonite\u0027s more free licensing means that more mods from other authors support karbonite (any which support CRP I imagine). Also, karbonite can be collected in numerous ways, including atmospheric scoops, oceanic extractors (for places like eve) and drills... while to my knowledge, kethane is slightly more limited. And last, (but certainly not least), karbonite is found in unlimited deposits (it can never be mined out)... which means you\u0027ll never \\*have\\* to move your base... what it \\*does\\* mean is that if you want to do anything useful, you need to choose a good site (scansat helps a lot). To contrast with kethane: kethane has deposits which are slowly consumed (at least used to be how it was), you \\*shouldn\u0027t need to ever worry about depleting it, but it isn\u0027t impossible either. I will say this in defense of kethane, I freakin love the planetary overlays... if karbonite had those beautiful things, I probably wouldn\u0027t have scansat installed (oh, who am I kidding... i like making maps).\n\nIf it sounds like I\u0027m a raving stupid fanboi... it\u0027s probably because I am."},{"CreatedByName":"PringleMan","CreatedById":1396,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T03:57:43Z","Content":"Well lets also not forget that Karbonite was developed as an assist to the MKS/OKS mods.

One of the things people liked about kethane was the logistics of transporting the mined resource to a station for processing, which with Karbonite, is a waste of fuel and money.
