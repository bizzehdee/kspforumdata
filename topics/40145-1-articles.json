Well I\u0027m gonna leave my issue in here and see how it goes for now so not to spam the forums. Basically I\u0027m using completely stock parts and despite having already designed the most awkward part which is the walk-in interior which also holds a crew module, I can\u0027t seem to find a part that will allow the 2x2 and 1x1 structural panels to meet up nicely in size. I\u0027ve been using the small girder-like cubes and the not-rockomax cube thingy to match up sizes relatively easily for the 1x1\u0027s but getting them to meet up in a reasonable manner with the 2x2\u0027s has caused me no end of trouble. Also the part count is becoming incredibly problematic already so if there is any part I could be using to optimize the craft better and make things fit better would be really handy\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
