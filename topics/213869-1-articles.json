I got big problems. With the ship, it was a lousy build, but mainly with the save ships and save game commands.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe saved ships that I had made were first not available ingame. (Which meant that the saves got corrupted and at one point i could not even save the game) That was the first thing that happened. When i looked in workspaces folder they were still there. The last save had the message that the rockets were unavailable. I could not save the Luna1 ship i was working on in the assembly hall. After restarting the game the ships came back and i managed to make a lift off. After going back to the vehicle assebly hall I loooked at the saved ships and they were all there. I decided to erase one of the ships and now I got back to the problem i had earlier. All ships disappered ingame and all saves had the wording that the ships were unavailable. I could not save the ship that I was working on either. I could make new saves but with the message that the vehicle was unavailable.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI looked in the workspaces folder and all Luna and Mun ships had disappered. Only my crappy first ship was still there.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd i could not save the ship that was in the Vehicle assembly hall.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is how it looked like. Now I am reinstalling the game from scratch.
