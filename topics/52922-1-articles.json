I don\u0027t know if not having a mesh collider on the shield model affects re-entry effects. right now I\u0027m using a decimated low poly copy of the shield as a mesh collider, but it doesn\u0027t even act like it has a mesh collider either even though everythings been done properly in unity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img109/1664/rpts.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rpts.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think you\u0027d need to jettison these at all after entry. slap a parachute or landing gear on it and land whichever way you want. it could probably serve as a really wide base for landing gear, making it easier to land huge vessels. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit should hold up for long trips across the solar system if you design properly, or jettison it whenever you please.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit would be cool if these were inflatable, with the nasa logo being an inline part and the shield coming out of it, but I\u0027m not really an animator and it would kill the attachment nodes for balancing the weight. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a big issue though. a nicely designed vessel would look even nicer with an always deployed heatshield like this, no matter where it\u0027s at, and since it also serves as an attachment hub, it\u0027s useful in designing your vessel around its nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-13T10:25:14Z\u0022 title=\u002211/13/2013 10:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by trekkie_\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tom1499","CreatedById":38308,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T12:43:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think KSP likes mesh colliders.
