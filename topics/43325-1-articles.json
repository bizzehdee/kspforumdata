It\u0027s been a VERY long road of planning, wiping saves, engineering, waiting on .21, buying a new pc, working overtime, and more, but I\u0027ve finally got the first 500 days fully planned, which means I can start the challenge!

For me, this challenge is for fun, and for the, well, \u003Cem\u003Echallenge\u003C/em\u003E of planning and engineering. I find those to be the most fun parts of the game for myself anyway.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI\u0027m a terrible pilot (but I\u0027m honest) and MechJeb will be doing a fair bit of my work for me.

It\u0027s kind of odd comparing what you\u0027re having trouble with to my mission. I think we\u0027re sort of reversed. I\u0027ve had so much experience at docking that I find that easy (And this is in 0.20.2), but have issues doing stuff in atmosphere... like, oh I don\u0027t know, flying planes, launching stuff. I had to do a lot of messing around to get my launchers working right and in the end just over engineered them. They have way more dV than they need, thus I can adjust the course as I go up... and need to most of the time. Forget timing a launch to meet a vessel in orbit! I just launch and mess around with the orbit after to get a rendezvous. Docking however, well, a lot of the time I don\u0027t bother with RCS. In fact a lot of my ships don\u0027t have it at all. I just generally use Smart ASS (or sometimes not even that, though it makes things a heck of a lot easier!) and do flips to dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure how much trouble the 0.21.1 system is with docking (haven\u0027t tried in that yet, only in 0.20.2) but I hope the new RCS system is helping you out some. Yeah, 0.21.1 has serious bugs, but I think it still helps with docking if I remember right. Still issues with SAS not \u0027locking\u0027 position and drift but hopefully it\u0027ll help. Once the Duna Challenge is over I\u0027m certainly going to give it a go. I someday want to do a Grand Tour...
