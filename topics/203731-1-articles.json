Although not really. It\u0027s confusing, but I believe that realizing it was a dream was nothing but part of the dream, therefore I never had a true lucid. I also had several dreams where I distinctly believed that said dream was reality and commented upon it. But most nights, I have no dreams, or they\u0027re so incoherent that they don\u0027t form a structure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-20T05:16:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224006902\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022203731\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221626727085\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002210883\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nuke\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, Nuke said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni find myself having minecraft dreams, but i dont recall me using a computer, im in the world doing minecraft things, not playing games on a computer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe same.
