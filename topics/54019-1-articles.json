After landing on the Mun or Minimus and returning to Kerbal, I gathered enough science to discover the parts needed to get to the other planets, but I was not able to get back to Kerbal so far. The fewer science gathered from missions when I sent satellites into lower orbits of other planets was a bit frustrating to me. I also started with orbital space stationing, but the orbital space station was more for having it than doing anything really useful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is why I would like to suggest two things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Since in real space travel, imaging plays a major role in discovering new planets in greater detail and resolution, it would be a great to have a science tool like an imaging or optical camera device to discover planets from orbit with a Satellite. The best implementation (but I know this is probably very hard to program) would be to provide a little science value, but also to have a blurry planet in low resolution but after scanning with this device the resolution improves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. An orbital space station should provide a little science amount over time with a space-lab device where scientifically gifted Kerbals could have their no gravity experiments. This really gives the player a huge push towards forming a space station in the orbit over Kerbal and this is really one thing every player should have ^^.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo these are my two suggestions, since I did not find these suggestions by a brief study of the forum/wiki, I opened a new thread. The game you made is really great and highly addictive, I like to call it space lego when I advertise your game. The most disturbing thing is that you are just in version 0.22 and the game provoked no crash or heavy failure on my Pc therefore you guys did a GREAT job there! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESincerely, Joe\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UberFuber","CreatedById":90736,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-22T19:01:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forum \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECamera and imaging devices had been suggested before (with very similar functionality as you have proposed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbital Space Station with a constant science source had been suggested before too. The issue with the constant amount of science is that the player can simply time-warp until they get all the science they need. In order for it to be balanced, the science station needs to consume some form of resource (not electricity, as that can easily be supplied by solar panels or the nuke generator) in order for it to make sense.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
