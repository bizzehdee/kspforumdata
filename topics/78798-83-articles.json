I just sent to minmus a little ship with two big tanks and three drills, landed it in a good spot (\u002B4000) and started mining. The tanks got filled instantly... Looks like a single mining ship can feed any amount of refueling stations, being the transport the only obstacle.

I really think you need to consider a more long term development goal of a primary and secondary resource system, with Karbonite the infinite primary resource, but in far rarer quantities and more difficult to extract; and then three other resources that Karbonite can be broken down into and later refineable into consumable resources, but also these secondary resources can be found in finite quantities in abundance in various specific locations in the system.
