I finally joined the forum today after a year or so of lurking and reading. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been playing KSP at a fairly obsessive pace since May of \u002714. I usually keep a stock installation and a modded installation, my favorite thing to do lately is change the mod loadout and start a new game from scratch. Right now I have a pretty good mix and I\u0027m having a good time with it. I do prefer a heavily modded installation I think, stock is great but I love all the variety and options. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFavorite mods- \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOuter planets Mod\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENovapunch \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENearFuture (all) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBehemoth Engineering\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENecrobones Mods \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI go back and forth between CTT and SETI CTT\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a self professed space nerd, and a big advocate for science education.
