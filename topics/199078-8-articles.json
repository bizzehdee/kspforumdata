But I would expect it to struggle really bad. Only 6 threads, each one with a little better than half performance of modern equivalents, and not a lot of L3 cache - all of that is going to hammer KSP2 performance pretty bad. If you\u0027re going to not be running it native on top of that, like through Proton, I don\u0027t expect that you\u0027ll have a great experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would definitely recommend waiting to see how well the game runs for other people.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gotmachine","CreatedById":163039,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-28T09:31:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI definitely don\u0027t have the background or experience to make definite statement like you do. I\u0027m aware that PhysX 4 isn\u0027t capable of guaranteeing limits and drives in RB chains, but I\u0027m relatively confident that neither are its competitors because it\u0027s not a flaw, it\u0027s still an inherent caracteristic of those solvers. I will take your word that the situation is so much better in other engines than PhysX, but yeah, KSP is a use case where you have a 50 kg docking port in-between two 500t chains, so that will never work well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy point is that the main issue here is a game design one. KSP 1 has jointed RB defined-by-function parts because that was the only sane way to make it happen in Unity in 2015 for a near-solo dev, and while I can\u0027t ignore that it bring some \u0022fun factor\u0022, the only way to make it work functionally is to actually make joints near unbreakable and with absurdly high stiffness drives, to a point where those joints might as well be merged RBs. There is no user-facing \u0022tweak the rocket structural strength\u0022 feature or gameplay, the knobs are all internal, and even if they weren\u0027t, they wouldn\u0027t make any sense to the player, because they don\u0027t make any sense from a physics standpoint either. With a bit of work, they could have built a hybrid approach, maybe with some soft-body solution, which would have been very appealing as it could be a common base implentation for the aerodynamic and thermal simulation. But, well, this wouldn\u0027t sell as much copies as interstellar gimmicks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cytauri","CreatedById":223905,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-28T10:41:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wonder if my computer can load those colossal ships that KSP 2 advertises.

Modern Havok solver, which is what\u0027s in Unity with ECS, uses an updated flow based on the work of Erin Catto. While the underlying principles are similar, the algorithmic approach is quite a bit different and results in much higher stability for long chains \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0much better performance. When implemented correctly, you should see no springiness at all outside of\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eextreme\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0mass differences in the chain. That is, if you have two 1T modules hooked up to a 1kg module in between, yes, you\u0027ll see problems, though, even these can be tuned out, and if you throw a single strut between the 1T modules, that will go away completely. The bending you see with KSP is virtually nonexistent with the new solver. You literally can slap a single constraint at every logical joint and be fine for most practical cases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing I never understood is why KSP\u00A0 did not took advantage that\u00A0 the most common connection is a cylinder connected to another cylinder of exact same diameter and merged them into single objects. A lot of the common\u00A0 bending issues could have been reduced (ok I know eventually the players get to the point where a single octagonal strut is holding\u00A0 90 tons spread in 4 different directions,\u00A0\u00A0 but at least the early gameplay would look\u00A0 more polished)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoldForest","CreatedById":77770,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-28T11:05:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224213428\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022199078\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221672224098\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022223905\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CytauriKerbal\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n21 minutes ago, CytauriKerbal said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wonder if my computer can load those colossal ships that KSP 2 advertises.

The entire rocket (some animated bits and robotics parts aside) could have been a single rigid body. If you don\u0027t care about the flex, it\u0027s very easy to solve the constraints matrix for the weld joints once and then you can compute stresses for joint limits very cheaply, and unless a joint somewhere fails, just treat the whole rocket as a rigid body. You only have to solve the constraints matrix every frame if the configuration of the ship changes every frame.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason this wasn\u0027t done early on, I imagine, was simply because nobody thought about this being necessary. The first rockets were very, very simple, and you were supposed to just use a tank of the right size for the job, not stack four of them together. By the time players got their hands on the game and started building Kraken-summoning totems out of the parts given to them, the bendy, wobbly rockets were engrained in the players\u0027 minds.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m absolutely sure that there was at least one meeting during KSP2 development where somebody on engineering said, \u0022You know, we could just make the entire rocket rigid, and then we don\u0027t have to worry about any of this,\u0022 and somebody on the design team would have to say, \u0022No, we want them bendy,\u0022 to that.

This tells you that the most basic instruction, or a cycle, on CPU takes one 4 billionth of a second (0.25ns) to complete. But overwhelming majority of instructions take multiples of these cycles to finish. There was\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ea lot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of improvement in instruction efficiency in the past years. A lot of heavily used instructions have been reduced by a factor of 2 to 3. Integer division was something like 20 cycles. Now it\u0027s 4-6. So a modern 3.5Ghz CPU runs circles around the 10 year old 4GHz processor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s just raw compute. The other huge improvements have been in cache, scheduling, and branch prediction. Big chunk of CPU performance comes from how little time it spends not doing anything useful, and it comes down to knowing in advance which operations will need to be performed (in case of a branch) and having the data available, which is what the cache is responsible for. Modern games are pretty hungry for cache, so even if raw performance of CPU is there, if it can\u0027t feed all the data for all the necessary operations because of small cache and slow RAM, well, the raw performance just doesn\u0027t matter anymore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we take that same\u00A0AMD FX-8350 and compare it to a Ryzen 7 3700X, which is pretty close to what PS5 has, a single\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethread\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of Ryzen is going to be able to do nearly twice as much work in the same amount of time as a core on FX, and Ryzen can run two threads per core. So even though FX is 4GHz and has the same 8 cores as a Ryzen at only 3.6GHz, Ryzen\u0027s performance is nearly 4x as high. And the benchmarks I\u0027m looking at aren\u0027t that cache-heavy, so I expect this will be an even greater gap in games.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis won\u0027t be a problem for a lot of the games out there, but because we still expect KSP2 to be CPU-heavy, the only real benchmark we still have is that it has to run well on gen 9 consoles. So we know the performance will be at least decent on Ryzen 7 3700X, which is why I keep bringing it up. But will one quarter of that be enough to be playable? It\u0027s very hard to say. We will really have to wait and see some real KSP2 benchmarks on variety of CPUs once the Early Access is out to start getting a measure on this. It might be that I\u0027m being entirely too pessimistic, the game will be optimized well enough to blaze through on consoles, and it will be very well playable on a good CPU from 10 years ago. But it might also not be, and at this point, I think best we can do is wait.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
