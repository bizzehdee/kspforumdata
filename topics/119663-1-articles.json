This would mean that the user would not have to switch to the vessel 3/4 times to set new coordinates especially with locations on the West Side of Kerbin that are a real pain to get to. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for rivers: since the code currently stops navigation when the biome is not water, and that all of the rivers on Kerbin are in a shores biome there is no way of differentiating between solid ground and water (even altitude/height doesn\u0027t seem to work as an indication due to the PQS stuff to do with Kerbin), so navigation across rivers is going to take a while (I just don\u0027t want to end up beaching anyone\u0027s boat). However the Library does contain coordinates for the Delta of each major river on Kerbin, so these can be navigated too but in the meantime the player must navigate the river themselves sorry \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landlocked problem I think would only be solved with a Kerbin Side base, I will look into this but I am no part modeller..nor texture maker of any kind so it may take a while.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy anyway! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I will look into Kerbin Side this afternoon and make an in game displayable map showing all the locations in the library!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: 15:03 I have fixed the logo issue in the contract pack where the logo\u0027s were not appearing correctly.

Here\u0027s what I added:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I was able to reach up to 46m/s after juggling around with water compression and engine limiters. However, I\u0027ve noticed something... It requires the ship to be at the shores, the island AND the atoll at the same time! Simply visiting all of them or even dropping one of the subships in each location did not fulfill the requirement. So, sadly, this mission is currently impossible\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"colmo","CreatedById":25950,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-09T07:59:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t fret too much about an arrestor system.

However if I can finally get this new course navigation system to work I will skip 1.1.2 and go straight to 1.2.0 with that system implemented and a method of visualizing waypoint coordinates (rather than guessing at the nearest marker!), this will probably be done by just adding a note in the contract. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I am trying my best to fix some of these issues and make the pack playable! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhitecat \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT 16:12 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay everyone, contracts are fixed, waypoint coordinates are available and the course navigation system works, all I need now is some courses...
