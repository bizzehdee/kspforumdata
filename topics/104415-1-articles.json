In pure-stock, the only effect would be to (1) cause a part that explodes upon creation or very nearly, or (2) make \u003Cem\u003Eother\u003C/em\u003E parts hotter so they either explode spontaneously or sooner upon re-entry. Neither add positively to game-play. If you are using mods, the only relevant interplay I can think of would be RealFuels, where heat can impact boil-off; the license is permissive, one is free to add this feature and patch it to RF if they wish -- I have no interest in doing so, the payoff is too little.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe more technical answer, as Gribble has provided, has two sides. On one, yes, they generate a fair bit of energy (heat), and it has to go somewhere and along the way we get useful work out of it. This means the the part gets a bit warm/hot, and that energy gets radiated out; the RTG parts have built-in radiators for this purpose (and, technically, the attachment part absorbs and radiates some...). On the other, because one can view it as resolving heat on its own, one can simplify matters by considering the part after it has radiated this heat -- in effect, the warmth of the part is of no relevance to the rest of the ship and thus not worth modelling. This ties in to reasons above, as \u003Cem\u003Ethere is quite literally no point\u003C/em\u003E. To be fair, the game should have mechanics in place to simulate the black-body and conductive radiation if one was so inclined, but I am not.
