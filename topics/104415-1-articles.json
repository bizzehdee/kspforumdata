This mod should be more stable, relying on \u0022universal time\u0022 rather than vessel flight time (for those who dock/undock at all); it uses PartResources and an additional configuration file to determine the behavior, rather than being fully hard-coded into the part/partmodule; configurations can be tweaked in editor, a feature completely lacking from \u0022R\u0027RTG\u0022.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Do fuel types have an associated cost? Some real-life fuels are much cheaper than others (but have lower efficiency to counter that).\n\nTechnically, yes. However, as I am using the provided PartResource mechanic to rely on cost it does not in practice due to the \u0027subtractive resource costs,\u0027 that the part costs a set amount and the resources provided in the config add to it.

At the time I got going, I couldn\u0027t find the exact term for it that was simple and informative, so I went with a colloquial term that suggested how \u0027vivacious\u0027 the material was in terms of its thermal output... thus, \u0022pep.\u0022 (One will note that my mod also uses the imaginary unit \u0022Zolts\u0022 in place of Watts.)

(You got it right with krontium-90, though.)

That being said, the mod is written in a way that allows (and encourages!) you do adjust things how you wish... the cfgs should be adequately documented, but I can expand on them.\n(Possible feature for future update: configurable units, so one could list power density as true-to-real-life W/kg as opposed to \u0022Zolts\u0022 [which should be \u0022Zot!s\u0022 anyway\u0022])\n\n\u003E \n\u003E BTW, these should produce considerable amounts of heat, that\u0027s why RTGs have radiators.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Do these produce heat? my experiments suggest the stock RTG does not produce heat which is just silly to me.\n\nThere are a few ways this can be answered, so I will try to address them all (most of which simply rephrase Gribble -- thanks to zir for replying in my stead).\nThe more indirect and useful answer is a question to itself: for what reason would simulating the heat be important? In pure-stock, the only effect would be to (1) cause a part that explodes upon creation or very nearly, or (2) make *other* parts hotter so they either explode spontaneously or sooner upon re-entry. Neither add positively to game-play. If you are using mods, the only relevant interplay I can think of would be RealFuels, where heat can impact boil-off; the license is permissive, one is free to add this feature and patch it to RF if they wish -- I have no interest in doing so, the payoff is too little.\n\nThe more technical answer, as Gribble has provided, has two sides. On one, yes, they generate a fair bit of energy (heat), and it has to go somewhere and along the way we get useful work out of it. This means the the part gets a bit warm/hot, and that energy gets radiated out; the RTG parts have built-in radiators for this purpose (and, technically, the attachment part absorbs and radiates some...). On the other, because one can view it as resolving heat on its own, one can simplify matters by considering the part after it has radiated this heat -- in effect, the warmth of the part is of no relevance to the rest of the ship and thus not worth modelling. This ties in to reasons above, as *there is quite literally no point*. To be fair, the game should have mechanics in place to simulate the black-body and conductive radiation if one was so inclined, but I am not. (permissive license, yadda yadda.)\n\nThis is not at all meant to be demeaning or condescending, but rather as an explanation of my rationale. I built this plugin with the intent of adding to play, not simulating reality for the sake of being parochial or pedantic."},{"CreatedByName":"panarchist","CreatedById":63336,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T05:11:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E They are, in every case I\u0027ve been able to find, mounted in such a way as to provide minimum contact to the ship, in the case of Voyager they\u0027re on the end of an extendable boom that holds them away from the ship. This was in part to keep the heat away and also to protect the ship from radiation.\n\u003E My point is that RTGs really shouldn\u0027t add heat to a vessel because 1) If the RTG is a constant source of heat, how do you get rid of it if the RTG can\u0027t even get rid of its own heat and 2) RTGs are designed to meet a temperature differential that produces energy efficiently, and this requires dumping heat off the fins, keeping its heat load self-regulating.\n\nThe exception, of course, being New Horizons, but even in that case, very little of the heat from the RTG is used on the spacecraft. [Per the website](http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/Mission/Spacecraft/Systems-and-Components.php):\n\n\u003E \n\u003E At launch the fuel produced almost 4,000 watts of thermal power; of that, New Horizons used about 25 watts of the waste heat to warm the spacecraft. Electrical power output of the RTG was about 245 watts. Some of that electrical power (about 120 watts) is also reused after powering components to help heat the spacecraft. The rest of the RTG heat and any extra electrical power are radiated into space."},{"CreatedByName":"KwirkyJ","CreatedById":62790,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T03:57:11Z","Content":"I changed my mind regarding the heat, now that I have played a bit and figured out how it works...\n\nThe module now generates heat by default!
