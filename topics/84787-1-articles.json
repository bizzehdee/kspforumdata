Such as Scott Manley completing the tech tree with over 1600 science to spare using just two launches and only going to Minmus and Mun and I think Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t want to read the entire post, I included a summary at the bottom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe currently have 7 planets we can visit, plus their moons and the sun. It takes 10,098 science to unlock the entire stock tech tree. That comes out to approximately 1442.6 science per planetary system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is to give a max of approximately 3000 science per planetary system (planet plus its moons) divided equally across all the biomes for that planet and its moons. That means we would only have to visit half the biomes in the solar system to max out the tech tree, provided all the science is returned, instead of transmitted, or a science lab is on the mission. Add another 1000 from the sun, divided between high and low orbits. If we visit every biome with every experiment, including the sun we\u0027d earn more than double the science necessary to unlock the entire stock tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESet the transmitted value for all data that is purely data, ie. doesn\u0027t require a sample, to 75% of the recovery value. Those that requires samples (soil sample, goo canister, materials bay) transmit at half value. Anything processed by the science lab negates the transmit penalty, ie. data collected and process will transmit for the same value as recovery. This part is more about making the science lab worth using instead of just taking a bunch of materials bays and goo canisters and bringing their data back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlong with this, to keep things simple, only give science for the first time you do an experiment, crew report, eva report for each biome. To further simplify thing, make all experiments and reports have the same value if performed in the same biome. So, a crew report, eva report, soil sample, goo observation, etc performed on the launchpad would all give the same amount of science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBetween Kerbin, Mun and Minumus there are approximately 73 locations between 33 biomes, 33 flying over each biome, flying in upper atmosphere on Kerbin and low and high orbits of all three bodies, thus max science from each location would be approximately 41 if every experiment and report were preformed in each location. Landed we have 9 experiments/reports (crew report, EVA report, temperature, gravity, atmosphere, seismic, soil sample, goo, materials bay) which makes them all worth 4.555 science each. While flying in atmosphere we lose seismic and soil sample dropping the total experiments/reports down to 7 making them worth 5.857 science each. In space we also lose the atmosphere reading, dropping the total experiments/reports to 6 making them worth 6.833 each. Therefore to simplify things if every experiment/report is set to a flat 5 science we would get 45 per biome when landed, 35 while flying over the biome, 35 in the upper atmosphere of Kerbin and 30 in low and high orbits over Kerbin, Mun and Minmus. Thus we\u0027d have a total of 33(45\u002B35) \u002B 35 \u002B6(30) = 2640\u002B35\u002B180 = 2855 from all locations on Kerbin, Mun and Minmus. If the upper atmosphere is also divided up by the biomes you\u0027re flying over for all reports and experiments that can be done there the total would be 33(45\u002B35)\u002B9(35)\u002B6(30) = 2640\u002B315\u002B180 = 3135. Plus the extra little bit we can get from the landed on the runway, launchpad and KSC grounds. Plus whatever we earn from contracts on these three bodies. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there are the contracts that add even more science. These should be balanced to only give as much science per contract as you could gain in the biome the contract wants you to test in. So, if a contract says to test engine X landed at Kerbin it should only give as much science as one experiment performed on the launchpad/runway. Based on the example above, all contracts would give no more than 5 science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the extra science can be used by modders to add their new parts to their own techs in the tech tree. This would also help cut down on the clutter that some mods have where they put a lot of parts into a current tech. If modders feel they need more science than this, they can add additional science experiments, or more contracts to test the parts their mod adds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure by the time the game goes gold we\u0027ll have multiple biomes on all the planets and moons and possible even science from landing on asteroids and comets (if comets are added as well).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESummary\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake all experiments and reports worth 5 science if recovered. Pure data reports/experiments worth 3.75 if transmitted. Sample experiments (soil, goo, materials bay) worth 2.5 if transmitted. Science Lab processing allows transmission of everything worth 5 points. Contracts give a max of 5 science. No more diminishing returns from repeating an experiment/report in the same location.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-17T03:07:56Z\u0022 title=\u002209/17/2014 03:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Monthar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ECorrected a math problem\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stratzenblitz75","CreatedById":108287,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-17T04:31:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIMO, what your suggesting does not balance the science system very well. Spreading out all the science points equally over all the biomes in the Kerbol System does not make the science system more fun or engaging, it just makes it more grindy and even more of a click-fest since you have to perform every experiment in multiple biomes in multiple situations to get a sizable amount of science (that\u0027s a lot of clicking!). Also keep in mind that not all of the science experiments are unlocked from the start so this would make the process even more tedious early-game.

Clicking a bunch of buttons to get ez-science is not fun. In addition, if all experiments/reports are worth the same value, then whats the incentive to travel to hard-to-reach places like Eeloo or Moho when you could just grind the Mun/Minmus/Duna for the same science return? This system encourages linear game play: Why bother spending a lot of funds on a lengthy Eeloo mission when you could just go to Duna for cheaper/quicker and get the same amount of science? \u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not trying to put you down or anything, in fact, its great that people are pointing out the flaws in KSP\u0027s broken science system and giving their ideas on how to fix it. I just don\u0027t think your way is the right way to do it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe that the devs need to add more substance to science and make it so you have to do more than oh say; send an experiment over, click it once, and BAM there\u0027s your science. Science should be more like science in real life: you should have to send missions to scan/explore a planet, make discoveries (like finding water on Duna or finding Oxygen on Laythe or detecting cryovolcanism on Vall) and then send follow up missions to study these discoveries in more detail. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86267-Science-Collection-Revamp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EI elaborate more on this here. \u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monthar","CreatedById":117764,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-17T05:18:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou wouldn\u0027t be able to just grind the Mun and Minmus, because you only get the science once per experiment/report in each location.

With earning approximately 3000 science per planetary system, You\u0027d only have to hit half the biomes, or all the biomes on half the planetary systems to get all the science you need to completely unlock the entire tech tree. Therefore, it would encourage missions to more places. With the ability to bind the experiments and reports to an action group you can have 1 button to do all of them in each location, thus less clicking.

So a cap at 3000 per system would really hurt people who stay in a local comfort zone. Science needs to accommodate all play styles.

When I say \u0022grinding\u0022 I mean \u0022visiting all/most of the barely indistinguishable biomes defined by arbitrary borders on planet/moon and doing the same experiments in each one\u0022. In a science grinding set up (Mobile lab \u002B lander with science instruments) there is NOTHING to make each landing different since you\u0027re doing the same thing every time. Honestly, whats the difference between the Mun\u0027s far-side crater and the Mun\u0027s near-side crater? Very little, other than the fact you can get a different set of science points. There\u0027s nothing interesting or unique to learn or do in these two \u0022different\u0022 biomes. This applies to other planets as well. What\u0027s the difference between Ike and Vall in terms of science? What makes Vall an interesting or unique place to do science? As it stands, nothing, both of these supposedly different moons are the same to the science system; you can use the same lander, the same instruments, the same experiments, the same mobile lab to get ALL of the moon\u0027s scientific value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure, your system encourages missions to more places but what\u0027s the point if all of these places give you the same results? I could just take my generic \u0022science grinder\u0022 set up everywhere and get all the science by repeating the same landing over and over again for every biome until I max out the tech tree. That\u0027s my problem with your system.
