And, it is more immersive, in that as KerbinDallas said the idea that a single base could use up all the resources in a couple tanks is \u0027ludicrous\u0027. \u003Cp\u003EHowever, maybe an art pass on the ORS overlay, if deciding to keep it? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally prefer ScanSat mapping, as I feel it is more immersive and I get a greater sense of accomplishment(!) in hunting out a good concentration. Stupid of me to feel that, perhaps haha.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne drawback on concentration base, is that it can hurt gameplay if a player is trying to simulate an \u0027economy\u0027, in hunting for rare elements/minerals to mine and cash it on. It removes the need to seek out and continually prospect different places, to track down a good load, and then mine it out for profit. But this is beyond the scope of this discussion, anyways. I think that is what ultimately Thurak\u0027s MoonMining Precious Metals was taking a crack at. Be cool to get the author of ORS to implement both concentration and limited based resources in his system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat options are there for the ORS overlay that you, RoverDude, are considering anyways?
