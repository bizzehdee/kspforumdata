When they start from opposite sides the planes get further away and since the guard and AI go after enemies as soon as they reach min alt you have them going 2vs2 head on. I did this test with all publicly submitted planes and with their specific settings. There was never a time were any party was being chased when they weren\u0027t able to maneuver. The ones with min alt of 150 turn quicker to the fight and if fast enough start to fire at you while you ascend but it\u0027s not lika complete turkey-shoot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the other thing.
