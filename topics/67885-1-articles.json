Mouse-wheel scrolling on the node itself to adjust the time. You can mouse-wheel adjust the widgets but not the node, which is somewhat counter-intuitive.

Mouse-wheel acceleration should be toggle-able somehow, maybe with a modifier key. Right now it accelerates just a bit too fast for minor fidgeting; slowing the acceleration rate by holding \u0022ctrl\u0022 or something would be a vast improvement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. A minor thing, but when the camera is focused on a maneuver node and you drag it to adjust the time, the focus moves as well. This is not that huge an issue, but it\u0027d be nice if the focus remained on the node\u0027s last position until the drag action was finished.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-29T20:57:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBumping to add:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. When dragging the node to adjust time, respect the current orbit offset. That is, if I have advanced the node by five orbits and then drag the node to adjust time, the time should still be adjusted five orbits ahead rather than resetting to the current orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt Snuggler","CreatedById":65092,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-29T21:35:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1 I think every one can be in favor of this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. would like to be able to add other types of nodes eg. de-warp nodes to automatically return to real time at particular points on the trajectory. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure there are other functions notes and reminders people would like to have on coarse.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-29T21:44:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Capt Snuggler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Capt Snuggler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E5. would like to be able to add other types of nodes eg. de-warp nodes to automatically return to real time at particular points on the trajectory. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s an interesting approach to the whole alarm-clock problem, I like it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-29T22:11:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Capt Snuggler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Capt Snuggler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u002B1 I think every one can be in favor of this. \u003Cp\u003E5. would like to be able to add other types of nodes eg. de-warp nodes to automatically return to real time at particular points on the trajectory. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure there are other functions notes and reminders people would like to have on coarse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love this idea!
