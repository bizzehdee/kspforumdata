I launched this station, went to the Tracking Station then reloaded the space station. Now the section with the solar panels attached is off at a whacky angle. The docking port Jr on the front of the orbiter to the left is also at an angle too. None of those parts are clipped. Everything was just attached as normal, so I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a clipping issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. I\u0027ve seen it occasionally for years, but usually reloading fixes it. In this case it\u0027s persistent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022k4WH4Zl.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/k4WH4Zl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xd the great","CreatedById":188222,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-19T06:25:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat were you doing before reloading?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes restarting help?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dafni","CreatedById":149636,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-19T06:52:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI get this too, sometimes.

I\u0027d seen it happen before but only occasionally. Not sure if something changed with 1.4.x, but it happened every time. Restarting the game didn\u0027t help. Scene changes didn\u0027t help and even slight changes to the design didn\u0027t help. Last night I tested about a dozen variations including things like removing the docking ports.
