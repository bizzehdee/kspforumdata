I will be sure to double check what I do in those areas unless you manage to sort it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut we should post in the new thread for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for tonight I will of course work on the new mods buy also meas with the orbiters aerodynamics and post what I find.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand fix those couple of problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eany more ideas or problems to sort before I upload a 1.6.1 patch?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe kos idea sounds exciting!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mike-NZ","CreatedById":142683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T02:35:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sp1989\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sp1989\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI guess that has to do with the new 1.0 heating? Or Deadly Reentry is a required mod for the Soyuz so the thermal blankets color change wont work. The soyuz just needs a proper 1.02 overhaul. I am not saying it doesn\u0027t work but functioning and working properly are two different things. \u003Cp\u003EIn other news I took the most recent update for a spin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBad News: The aerodynamics are ehhh. Takeing off is much harder than it was in past iterations. It gets into space but it seems like I was fighting it the whole time. In space I can\u0027t imagine controlling it well enough to perform a rendevous and docking. It doesn\u0027t fly very well in space either. Maybe stronger reaction wheels I imagine that could help for take off and landing as well. Reentry was actually ok it was flying in the atmosphere that really I had a lot of trouble. I tried both my way of landing and followed the instructions on the first page. It was extremely difficult both ways. I still experience quite a lot of \u0022feathering\u0022. This is all probably just me because I watched the videos on the front page and it seems like someone knows how to fly this shuttle so maybe it will jus take alot of practice. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood News: Everything looks good. I have no more complaints about the look of the shuttle. I just miss the proper texture switches but you are fixing that so that should be all good soon. Overall well done. This mod is really rising like a phoenix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand the tricky atmosphere flight but can we go into more detail on space maneuverability?

The ship flys sideways during take off so much so I went into a semi polar orbit. During reentry it just want to go nose down. No matter what I do the nose wont come up. Then once Im in the atmosphere It flys like a brick but also floats like a feather. It bleeds speed really quickly and just really doesn\u0027t want to glide at all. I know that sounds interesting especially when I say that when I go to flare it just shoots back up. It doesn\u0027t flare it just picks up and keeps going. It just needs to fly more like a plane I guess. I am very much aware that its not supposed to but it needs some more gliding capability. In space it just doesn\u0027t move like I feel it should. Its very sluggish and then you overshoot the target markers. Its not a smooth slow its like its very rough maneuvering in space. Maybe stronger SAS? The OMS tend to drift up and off the mark and I am constantly readjusting. The RCS should be stronger along with maybe a stonger reaction wheel. A balance between the two would be good. It just seems wobbly in space. I feel like I am constantly adjusting to keep it flying straight in space. I hope this all helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
