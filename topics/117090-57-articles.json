If you really want to have something that people can use, why not develop a devoted space tug to move things around in orbit. Especially if you are going to make space station components later on. You can launch the tug into space with the payload and keep it there. When you\u0027re done, you dock it up with the station, blow it up, or put it on one of the ships you plan to dock with the station to take it with you on your interplanetary journey. Eventually, this will evolve into the \u0022series c revamped\u0022 parts when you develop a skycrane and craft to use for cargo drops onto planets/moons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile we are talking about the future of your mod \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022138730\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/\u0022\u003E@Shadowmage\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0You are going to do a series of interplanetary parts, correct?

I even installed it and tried it out to see what would it do. It works, but it gives a very large amount of fuel for this mod\u0027s fuel tanks and I do mean large. What it doesn\u0027t do is switch over to other types of fuel tanks that MFT is supposed to support according to the config files that are supported with this mod, like service module and the rest. With SSTU\u0027s patch, it uses MFT for Real Fuels tank switching and configuration and limited fuel tank switching between LOX and Mono and Xenon\u00A0without real fuels. Take out MFT and the tanks use using Mage\u0027s patch to give tanks the stand alone MFT function for\u00A0LH2 it needs for the size tank you create, though it\u0027s not named cryogenic, but the tanks are there to support the engines for LH2/Ox.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike I said, a choice will have to happen on what features you\u0027d want. The only thing I could suggest is a fuel switch on the engines that use LH2 to switch back to LOX for an MFT mod install. And I feel that Mage *might* not do that, because it\u0027s more work on parts he has already worked on, especially this week. He put a lot of work into what he done and I\u0027m not complaining one bit about it. Even if I have to drop a mod in order to use this mod in the way it\u0027s he wants it run, I\u0027ll do just that and figure out the rest.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn any case, thank you for your reply, Blowfish.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have been further investigating this and realized that MFT does in fact have a utilization slider. This slider gives you whatever amount of fuel you need at a percentage rate. So, in essence, you could use Nertea\u0027s Cryogenic engine mod and use the cryogenics to set up LH2 for this mod\u0027s LH2 engines. Scale down the ridiculous amount of LH2/Ox you\u0027ll need and voila, you have a viable cryogenic engine stage, that in fact uses a boiloff due to cryogenic engines mod. I will be further experimenting with this and the SSTU parts and will give my findings soon.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-12T18:17:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ngheghe, I also just downloaded the new X2 version from Nertea \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0He is using a 15:1 ratio now though, so if you\u0027re using SSTU tanks, remove some Oxidizer to crank up your dV again due to the extra weight of the spare oxidizer now (around 25%).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-12T18:31:08Z\u0022 title=\u002201/12/2016 06:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 12, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Jimbodiah\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-12T18:40:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222358808\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022117090\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221452618275\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022152759\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jimbodiah\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n28 minutes ago, Jimbodiah said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129285-redparadize/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022129285\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129285-redparadize/\u0022\u003E@RedParadize\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Both patches were posted here and on Github.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022138730\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/\u0022\u003E@Shadowmage\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nLS:\u00A0The mass is quite low and is different between the two mods.
