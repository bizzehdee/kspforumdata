It works great unmanned. But when I tried to put a Kerbal on it I have been unsuccessful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, ladders. I thought I\u0027d just put a telescoping ladder on the side and call it good. That doesn\u0027t work. I get to the top of the ladder, the rover platform is right there in front of him, but the the only option is back down the ladder or further up of the top of the ladder. Which results in falling down to the ground. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zI4Qaal.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zI4Qaal.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI worked around this somewhat by putting a ladder segment horizontal on the rover platform. Then I take my Kerbal to the very top of the ladder, hit space and immediately hit F. If I time it right I\u0027ll flip around and be climbing \u0022down\u0022 the horizontal ladder on the platform. Then I can let go, fall down on the platform, and stand up. It works, but seems really kludgy and I think there MUST be a better way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/s4u3111.png\u0022 alt=\u0022s4u3111.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then I ran into issue #2. I can\u0027t actually control the rover. There\u0027s the seat I put on it. And I can kind of hop on top of it, and around it, but that is it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere Jeb is standing in the command seat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Y3puCeF.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Y3puCeF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo option to hit F to board, or anything like that, shows up.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-09T14:05:36Z\u0022 title=\u002211/09/2014 02:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by AengorKerbow\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-09T05:59:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEasy one first - right-click the seat and select \u0027board\u0027 ;-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe warned the navball orientation from the seat might not be the same as you were used to.

You can try segments angled about 30-degrees or less from each other and then Kerbals will follow them \u0027around\u0027. Once on top you can then \u0027space to let go\u0027 but it\u0027s still pretty unsatisfactory.

I think one of the recent updates helped things but Kerbals still have problems climbing onto a surface at the top of a ladder. Making sure the angles between ladder segments are 30 or 45 degrees rather than the full 90 helps, then they can just climb up and over and sort of stumble off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-09T13:43:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think you need to go as far as 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, a 60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 or even 75\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 angle will do just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-09T13:49:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf the gravity is low enough where you send your rover, you can jetpack up to the seat as well \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AengorKerbow","CreatedById":127433,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-09T14:05:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pecan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pecan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEasy one first - right-click the seat and select \u0027board\u0027 ;-)\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUgh...I should have thought of that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Boomerang","CreatedById":92198,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-09T15:29:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a small enough rover as well that you might want to try testing it without the horizontal ladder segment on top.
