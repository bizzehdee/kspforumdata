Download the kerbal space orbiter, and build it in the VAB. The building isn\u0027t very fun is it? Everything fits in it\u0027s place exactly, and in no other way. The mod is fantastic. I love the look of it, and flying it, but the building portion just isn\u0027t very interesting because there\u0027s very little creativity or problem solving involved, and that process is a huge part of what makes ksp interesting and fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep, definitely a fine perspective, and I agree that avoiding part bloat is important. On the other hand, if there\u0027s anything KSP has in abundance it is options for different sizes of storage tanks. And the large UF4 tank holds 4x the fuel of the 1.25m reactors, and that just seems a bit off to me. It\u0027s also the same size as the other small cans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also suggest moving some of the storage tanks to the earliest nodes that use them - there\u0027s no point having UF4 tanks cluttering up your VAB until you can actually use UF4.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merendel","CreatedById":97774,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T03:30:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bonesbro\u0022 data-cite=\u0022bonesbro\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also suggest moving some of the storage tanks to the earliest nodes that use them - there\u0027s no point having UF4 tanks cluttering up your VAB until you can actually use UF4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately there are actualy 2 nodes this could be although admitedly one would be a very strange path up the tree. The obvious node is Nuclear Propulsion where you unlock reactors. Most people will push for this node anyway for the LV-N. The other one is if you push the science end of the tree up to Advanced Science Tech you have the ISRU, if you also grab the node next to it you would have transceivers and be able to beam solar power to run the ISRU. While its silly to take this path and you may wonder why would someone go and mine UF4 off planet when they cant even use it yet? I point to antimater as a precedent for establishing collection before you can actualy use the stuff. Which node do you put it in as an argument could be made either way.

Windows is not case sensitive and this introduces the terrible habit of not thinking in case-sensitive. For the experimental version released by WaveFunctionP I had to rename and merge a lot of folders. The actual contents of the files were spread over paths such as gamedata and GameData, fueltank and Fueltank and their numerous combinations, and as it is, it wont even start on Linux with an enormous number of error message. Extracting the files, recreating the folder structure and mergeing every single folder of the mod\u0027s structure makes it work. The correct capitalization appears to be CamelCase for the folder names, and the filenames dont seem to require fixing.
