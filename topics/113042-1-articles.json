Or maybe plow yourself a nice flat runway. To make it not so overpowered, the equipment can be very heavy and consume lots of fuel/power. Alternative would be a large platform that unfolds itself and plants down adjustable legs to have a flat horizontal platform."},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T16:41:19Z","Content":"I don\u0027t think the PQS system could handle that, it\u0027s mostly procedural as I understand it and heightmaps don\u0027t have the resolution for small, local areas. Sure, it could be done, but a localized, custom heightmap plus the PQS Controller to handle it might tax memory pretty heavily. If you bulldozed enough you\u0027d also have to render it on the map screen as well."},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T17:43:27Z","Content":"Definitely no, I wouldnt be able to keep myself from shaping minmus like a giant minty ice cream. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nIf this is doable, then I support it."},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T19:50:52Z","Content":"Hmm, yeah I\u0027ll admit I don\u0027t know the work behind the terrain modeling...

Yeah, the MapDecalTangent might do the trick but it\u0027s circular, IIRC, so you\u0027d either have to use multiple or change the code to handle irregular shapes. I\u0027m also not sure how it would handle small changes since it\u0027s a leveling system that will actually raise terrain as needed.
