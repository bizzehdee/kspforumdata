Or maybe plow yourself a nice flat runway. To make it not so overpowered, the equipment can be very heavy and consume lots of fuel/power. Alternative would be a large platform that unfolds itself and plants down adjustable legs to have a flat horizontal platform.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T16:41:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think the PQS system could handle that, it\u0027s mostly procedural as I understand it and heightmaps don\u0027t have the resolution for small, local areas. Sure, it could be done, but a localized, custom heightmap plus the PQS Controller to handle it might tax memory pretty heavily.

Yeah, the MapDecalTangent might do the trick but it\u0027s circular, IIRC, so you\u0027d either have to use multiple or change the code to handle irregular shapes.
