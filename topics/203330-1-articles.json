I don\u2019t use visual packs but people seem to like Astronomers visual pack or\u00A0spectra, but don\u2019t remember if they add city lights (they probably do though). \u00A0If you like building space stations then there is a part mod called space station parts extended (or expanded I forgot) which I use and the parts look really good. For quality\u00A0of life I might be missing some but Kerbal engineer redux,\u00A0xscience (and similar mods) helps\u00A0you keep track of science experiments, and there are some mods with fruit abbreviations that do various things (they are called fruit goose\u2019s fruit pack or something). Everyone debates this but I wouldn\u2019t use mechjeb at the start at least for rendezvous because the game does have a tutorial mission for it that I found to be very helpful and it\u2019s much more satisfying doing it yourself. I also use restock to reskin the stock parts to make them\u00A0a bit more uniform.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hohmannson","CreatedById":202712,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-26T15:00:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRestock, Restock Plus and maybe Station Parts Expansion Redux(caution, heavy) for way better looking parts, Kerbal Engineer Redux(it still exists) for configurable flight data readouts.
