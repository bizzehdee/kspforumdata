Um, I been seeing ships with certain solar panels that I don\u0027t think are in game, and I have tried looking for them before but I can\u0027t seem to find them. I did find the Space Station Pack that has some solar panels to them but I keep forgetting to unpack it into the game...least I think I forgot...yup I did, the Kosmos 4.1 pack I forgot to throw into the game there, but since I haven\u0027t looked, not sure what it has otherwise, any other neat-o Solar Panels out there that I haven\u0027t found yet that others know about or love, that be great!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monkeh","CreatedById":72122,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-21T14:06:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the AIES pack had some solar panels, not 100% sure as it had to go to make room for other mods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-21T15:32:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIdon\u0027t usually use solar panels.
