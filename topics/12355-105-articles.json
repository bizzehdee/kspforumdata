It seems that MecJeb has a real hate problem with rockets that depend on engine gimbals for steering. As soon as I stick a set of small canards on the rocket then MecJeb starts behaving. It seems that MecJeb is not handling finless rockets properly anymore. A simple example I used was an asparagus staged rocket with a default kit rockomax red tank core and the stand off radial decouplers in a configuration with 6 to 8 stacked 2 high of the long white and black FL-800 fuel tanks with proper strutting. I used a Mainsail on the center red tank and the non-gymboled FL-35 engines under each of the asparagus boosters. The result is always lawn dart or breakup. I rebuilt the craft using 4 Red tanks as the boosters and then it launched but rotated 90 to 180 degrees before stopping. I then added the fins to the same 5 red tank rocket and MecJeb flew it marvelously. The thing is that I have never used fins in the past as my launch clamps usually sheer them off. It seems like its a bug that you have to use fins on your rockets otherwise MecJeb just does not work right.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BloodyRain2k","CreatedById":50835,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T02:46:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022dmusson\u0022 data-cite=\u0022dmusson\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve had a couple of instance of the auto warp feature \u0027run on\u0027 and overshoot the next node by a minute or two.

This should show that the problem is in your design, not mechjeb. I correctly oriented mechjeb (you had it upside down), corrected your rcs, removed excess SAS torque, reconfigured your ship a little, and provided a stable launch platform. Since you didn\u0027t include your launch platform in your craft file, I don\u0027t know if your having problems with it as well, but this one should give you a decent starting point. On ascent, limit acceleration to 20m/s, prevent overheat, begin turn at 10k, end turn at 75k, and orbit altitude is 75k. Should have just enough fuel to get you there.

If it cant rotate it then it continues to apply force usually causing the rocket to pitch most generally in the 10 o\u0027clock direction if your looking straight on in the default view followed by a crazy attempt to roll the rocket which normally almost always will cause it to end up flying in a direction that ends in a powered nose first direct flight into the ground. The odd thing is that once I added external control surfaces then it seemed satisfied. I am running the Mac Steam version of KSP so not sure if that may cause any differences. Like I say, as long as either the rocket can survive and stay vertical through the 90 to 180 degree roll or you put some kind of fins on it then it works. So far this behavior is fully repeatable.
