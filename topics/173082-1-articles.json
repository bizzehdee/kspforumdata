title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to go to Duna as it does to go to the Mun.\u00A0 Pick a bad one, and it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emuch\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E more

TL;DR:\u00A0 launch when Duna is about 45 degrees ahead of Kerbin.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAerobrake on arrival.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 Duna has an atmosphere.\u00A0 Use it.\u00A0 This will save you a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elot\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E due to not having to do a braking burn on arrival.\u00A0 A couple of things to be aware of for Duna aerobraking:\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nAltitude can be finicky.\u00A0 When you\u0027re on final Duna approach, it\u0027s a good idea to quicksave your game and experiment with various \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E altitudes.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDuna reentry is really gentle, compared with Kerbin.\u00A0 You probably don\u0027t need to bother with a heat shield.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EUse drogue chutes.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 Duna\u0027s atmosphere is really thin, and it\u0027s easy to faceplant while still going a lot faster than regular chutes can open.\u00A0 Drogues really help.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EConsider a partly-powered landing.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 Duna\u0027s atmosphere is so thin that you need a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elot\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of parachutes if you want to slow your ship down enough to land safely on parachutes alone.\u00A0 Certainly that\u0027s doable, but you need so many parachutes that you pay a price in fuel lugging them across the solar system.\u00A0 An alternate approach is to put just a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elittle\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E bit of parachutes on (say, one regular chute and a pair of drogues), which is enough to slow your descent to 20 or 30 m/s.\u00A0 Then just use a brief burst of engine thrust, right before you land, to cushion the landing.\u00A0 The fuel you burn for that one brief burst is a lot less mass than lugging a whole bunch of parachutes.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EReturning to Kerbin is a lot more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E than returning from the Mun.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 From the Mun\u0027s surface, it takes around 800-900 m/s of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to go home to Kerbin.\u00A0 From Duna\u0027s surface, it takes something like 1800 m/s, if you do a really efficient ascent and have a good transfer window home.\u00A0 That\u0027s a pretty big gap, be sure to allow for it.\u00A0 You can certainly do a direct-ascent landing, but personally, I like to do somewhat more Apollo-style:\u00A0 I leave an orbiting fuel tank upon Duna arrival, so that I don\u0027t carry my go-home-to-Kerbin fuel down to the surface and back.\u00A0 That does save on quite a bit of mass, but it also makes arrival rather more tricky, because aerobraking \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eto orbit\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E rather than going down to the surface is incredibly finicky-- a difference of half a kilometer\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E altitude can mean the difference between \u0022go flying off into interplanetary space\u0022 and \u0022go down to the surface.\u0022\u00A0 So, basically it comes down to a choice between either Apollo-style or direct-ascent return.\u00A0 The former is leaner and more efficient, but trickier to design and fly.\u00A0 The latter is simpler and easier, but significantly bulks up the mass of the mission.\u00A0 Which is \u0022better\u0022 for you depends on your priorities and your play style.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDon\u0027t forget Ike.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 It\u0027s big, it\u0027s got a lot of science, and it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ein the way\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 You may want to consider beefing up your mission so you can visit both Duna \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eand\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E Ike.\u00A0 But even if you plan on visiting only Duna... make sure that you\u0027re paying attention to your arrival path so that you don\u0027t blunder into Ike.\u00A0 It\u0027s big, it has a large \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E, and it orbits quite close in to Duna, so it\u0027s very easy to have accidental/unwanted Ike encounters.\u00A0 It\u0027s nothing you can\u0027t work around, just something you have to watch for.\u00A0 Kind of like living on a street where one of the neighbors has a cow that\u0027s in the habit of wandering out into the street:\u00A0 watch where you\u0027re driving.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022
