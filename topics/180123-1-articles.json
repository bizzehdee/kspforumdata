Therefore you can\u0027t fly the craft after trimming it - assuming this advanced mode was supposed to be used as a trim.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould it be possible that you guys added a feature so that when you switch back to normal flight mode, the control surfaces center is where you set the trim to? For example, I set the elevator blue needle 1 dot over the center, therefore when I switch back to flight mode and let go of my control axis, the orange needle should rest at that \u002B1 dot position.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe would also need to be able to reset this trim (setting the blue needles back to center with a single button combination). Since we already have a \u0022reset trim\u0022 function in the controls (I believe it\u0027s LB\u002BA on the Xbox), it could also be used for this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPs.: Should I post this to the bugtracker as a suggestion?

So it\u0027s not supposed to trim, i wrote a bugreport months ago. But you are right that it works better to trim stuff\u00A0than the current trimsystem. i guess it should had been the new trimsystem but something got messed up at the last \u0022patch\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chel","CreatedById":176173,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-28T00:45:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223494591\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022180123\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221543325846\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022128094\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Arch3rAc3\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 hours ago, Arch3rAc3 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPs.: Should I post this to the bugtracker as a suggestion?
