But, a college can exist on it\u0027s own and usually focuses on one discipline such as Liberal Arts. I graduated from George Fox College, a liberal arts college, which is now George Fox University in which the College of Arts is one of many colleges they now have. We also have Community Colleges which are sometimes called Junior Colleges. They typically have a two year degree and are sometimes associated with a 4 year college that the student can transfer into after graduation. Student who graduate from a community college end up with an associate degree. Our education system is different from other countries in that anybody can go to school regardless of age or social situation. My daughter attended our local community college with no money out of pocket and graduated with an associate degree in graphic design. Her great-grandfather also attended a community college in Washington when he was 90.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T23:32:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What \u003Cstrong\u003Eis\u003C/strong\u003E your college major? or what \u003Cstrong\u003Ewill it be\u003C/strong\u003E when you go?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E?
