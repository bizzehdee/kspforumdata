Just stick some cheap engines (the tiny Rockomax radials work great) on so they\u0027re not firing into the rover, and attach chutes to the assembly, with an upside-down decoupler on the bottom. Once the whole thing\u0027s down, just crank the throttle up and hit the decoupler, and the skycrane will fire off upwards while you drive away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr you just set up for an aerobrake on Duna approach prior to releasing it from the interplanetary stage. It takes a bit of know-how, but you can get an orbit just from aerobraking, and then subsequent orbits slowing you to a landing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fearless Son","CreatedById":133397,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-23T21:35:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you build a landing module with a wide base and radial engines, you can mount the rover beneath the lander. Just be sure there is enough clearance with the landing legs to fit the rover under it without crushing it.

Use the main engine to do your deorbit and most of the braking, then when you\u0027re at a reasonable airspeed and altitude, stage the separators and chutes as one. The rovers drop away and deploy their chutes and then you can crash the transport into the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
