It is not like KSP puts a perfect .64 scale picture on each wall of that profile so I can just chug blocks together.\n\u003E \n\nIts not that complicated at all.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Booster_Core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Booster_Core)\n\nLists the CBC at 40.8m tall.  Scaled by x0.64 = 26.112m\n\nSince the MFT tanks come in multiples of their diameter, it is easy to find the right length tank for that setup.  26.112 / 3.75 = 6.96 (round to ~7).  So, the tank used should be the MFT-7-0 (or shorter), at 3.75m diameter.  Might do a 6-0 or 6-5 as I believe the 40.8/26.112 measurement includes both the engine and nosecone (even a 5-5 might be okay).\n\nTL;DR -- use the tanks themselves as a tape measure ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"}]}
