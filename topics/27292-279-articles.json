Well Mk VI Lander. The Wells line of Munar Excursion Landers is being retrofitted, and Tested as potential Duna Excursion Landers for my first Duna Mission (~120 days and counting). The Wells Mk VI had burned up a lot of fuel rescuing my rover crew after he got stranded near the souther monolith and didn\u0027t quite have enough for a return. It escaped Mun\u0027s SOI but the ejection angle wasn\u0027t pretty and the retro burn cause a new encounter that would put the lander on a collision course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuckily the tug I used to pull my Mun station core into place was still fueled up and ready so I managed to intercept the lander on its suborbital trajectory and pull it out of a collision course.

The service module is docked to the ops core and both Moho landers are docked to the engine hub, just need to dock those two together. My Delta V readouts are projecting too low dV numbers for the Interplanetary Star Ship (ISS) Mark Twain.

This became the Shakespeare if only because I\u0027d already named it such. I sent Kerballed Moho landers to it and it\u0027s been ready to leave for days now. The Twain is just about ready with a crew, Science lab, 2 landers, 3 probes (Moho, Sun, and somewhere depending on the D/v output of that little Ion engine). All together I should have enough fuel for 4 Moho landings with (nearly) full science at each (Custom Biomes Mod) and a full return of all hands.

While Jeb would throw a fit about missing his chance to be the first kerbal ever to step foot on an alien world I might need him for the Eello, Jool, or Duna missions coming up. I\u0027d like one of the big three to be on Jool and another on Duna. With Duna having the highest chance of success I think I might want Jeb to oversee that one personally, but then he\u0027d miss out on being the first kerbal on Moho... choices choices.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill get some pictures together for next time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Floppster","CreatedById":92677,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-28T12:07:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI set up both a scout craft and a four satellite comms network for moho and eve, the transfers were almost at the same time so i figured what the heck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough, the moho sat package kinda missed and had to correct, losing fuel doing so.
