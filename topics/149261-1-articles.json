I have build a huge Rocket that i want to use to lift other things into Orbit, because i am tired of having to over engineer my deep space vessels just so they can get out of Kerbin atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI used tweak scale so the Rocket is positively massive, which it must be since it has has to carry whole spaceships inside. Preliminary tests seemed promising. But since i added actual payload i can\u0027t seem to get into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E before my fuel runs out. Which makes since, because now i am lifting more mass then before. But nothing i do seems to have any real effect, getting to about 70k Apoapsis and then my fuel is gone, not enough for circularization let alone deorbit burns. I tried adding Boosters, adding engines to get higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, removing engines to get closer to 1.2 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and most importantly doubling and tripling the tank. But nothing seems to work. What can I change so the thing does its job ?

And that didn\u0027t work either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom my experience there is a limit with booster size, at which point they simply lift themselves, if that. I tried adding 4 50m x 7m Boosters. It was ridiculous and even that didn\u0027t help.
