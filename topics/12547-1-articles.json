Once you\\\u0027re sure the craft is rising, pull up landing gear and resume flight. Rise vertically, beginning to level off at about 30-35k. You may encounter a few points where ASAS alone won\\\u0027t be enough to maintain course, use RCS to boost control at those times. Once you have a 200km apoapsis, cut throttle and coast until there, then burn prograde till you have a 200km periapsis. Release payload, burn retro till your orbit touches atmosphere (there should be enough fuel to aim wherever). Can\\\u0027t quite tell you what to do on return or landing, but try to keep ASAS on until you\\\u0027re low enough to maneuver for landing. Watch the LFE\\\u0027s, they hang fairly low. The wheels on the swallowtail should help prevent smashing them up, but it\\\u0027s a hair\\\u0027s breadth thing. There aren\\\u0027t any landing chutes either.

The design process is as much about visual design as it is about choosing the best components for the ship, the parts matter not only because what parts you choose, but also how you choose to place them.\u003Cp\u003EIf/when Squad is ever \u0027done\u0027 with KSP, I believe their next project should be a procedurally-generated open-universe sandbox game, a-la Elite or the X series. But with exactly the same ship design principles as in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd as far as modifying existing SSTO craft, I think the biggest challenge is making the craft behave well enough with and without the payload. Unless you mount the payload directly in front or behind the craft (not entirely feasible for spaceplanes, though not impossible), you will have issues with mass distribution. My craft sort of skips the issue by placing the payload close the thrust vector of the rockets, but most spaceplanes not purpose-built for this are going to have trouble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I am here, I\\\u0027m sort of wondering. There\\\u0027s quite enough extra fuel on this craft after all the orbital shenanigans, and I don\\\u0027t really need the rockets in atmosphere... what are the parameters for KSO? With some luck, I might be able to reach that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dobrodav","CreatedById":25028,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-21T13:35:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, detachable payload is a pain. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in the line of thinking about the craft exactly as a tanker, we might to count just delivered fuel quantities (in non detachable tanks), relaying on some fuel pump system, that will empty them through docking port. That kind of design is much more easy to accomplish.
