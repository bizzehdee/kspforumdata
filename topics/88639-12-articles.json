Now, I do know how to modify the ADIOS tech tree but given that I have already started the save BEFORE modifying the tech tree i am not sure what would happen:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(depending on how techmanager handles trees)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Does techmanager \u0022load\u0022 the tech tree on first run, and then copies the tree for the current save ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - in which case my new parts would show in a default node, regardless on me editing the tech tree, which would require me to re-load the tech tree if i would want to get them in the correct place\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...if it is case 2, i have a follow up question. is there a way to fiddle with persistence file, so i could manually place the parts where i would want them to, and if so, how ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason why I am asking is since I have already made a couple of youtube episodes to be aired soon for this save, and I would really really like to avoid to re-shoot them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E*UPDATE*\u003C/strong\u003E I did some Exploration, and found the case to be the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
