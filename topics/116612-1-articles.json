There is also the L2. Objects at L1 and L2 orbit about a focal point in the L1 and L2; however, and these orbits are very unstable and need considerable station keeping. This is however convienient, because if you placed all the things you want to keep at L2 (an excellent point for observations) they would be all stacked and interfere with each other. If you instead cluster them in a small L2 orbit; however unstable, you can keep the spaced apart from each other in space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"andrewas","CreatedById":24662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T00:07:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn reality, Earth\u0027s gravity is non spherical, and this causes the orbit to precess. If you choose an appropriate inclination and altitude, the orbit can be made to precess once a year, which will keep your periapsis pointed at the star. This is usually done with earth imaging satellites, so that they get the same angle of illumination with each pass, which makes it easier to assemble mosaics from multiple passes to image a wide area.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Armchair Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":76165,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T00:10:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022r4pt0r\u0022 data-cite=\u0022r4pt0r\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI will phrase this best I can, then include a poorly drawn MSPaint drawing to try to explain it better.\u003Cp\u003EA satellite is in polar orbit, with its periapsis exactly between its parent planet and a star, and its apoapsis exactly oposite, on the dark side of its parent planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the planet orbits around the star, what happens to the satellite in relation to the star?
