If the connector is a decoupler, firing it will produce two sub-assemblies, A and CB. If the connector is a separator, the result of firing will be 3 separate pieces, A, C, and B. To be honest, I\u0027ve never understood the need for the separators to have been added to the game, but that\u0027s the deal: decouplers stick to one side or the other, while separators stick to neither.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-04T04:30:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe decouplers only detach one end.

Most people use them for more delicate operations but their highest and best use is between the main stages of your lifter. When you stage and the engines of the upper stage fire, they blow the free-floating blue ring back into the spent booster at extremely high velocity. This results in a very gratifying explosion safely behind your ship involving nothing but debris you don\u0027t want to have anyway. Seriously, launches are MUCH more fun if the stages are punctuated with explosions \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Space_Meerkat","CreatedById":102953,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-04T16:33:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShort And Simple : Decouplers when fired will stay attached to the part of the craft that is being detached.

Decouplers always want to keep sticking on the root-part or at least its direction.
