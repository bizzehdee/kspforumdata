Flying drone warehouses/flying pizza ovens? Would it save on taxes? what would the shipping cost be. Local, but airbased... Could it work purely on solar power and electric? would it save money, or would it be a hybrid for some reason. Would this be useful in the military for some reason. I assume there might be a limit in range of drones. So, what could this do?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe it\u0027s good for food deliveries.

So, just add the carrier. It\u0027s not like a machine couldn\u0027t put a pizza together and send it through a thin pizza oven potentially(Or, god forbid, some super high end frozen pizza.). Maybe for out of the way areas where a local store isn\u0027t located. Or for special events. Deliver food up with drones, cook, then deliver. Just imagine front line soldiers ordering their favorite pizza hut pizza\u0027s.

And a tank shell weights 40 lbs. you could carry up to 12 abrams shells to a tank and reload it... Outside of nasty AA. Could a drone manage this at low altitude with flying supply ships. I assume the military has looked into this. I\u0027m imagining too vulnerable. Although if it could be done it would cut a tone of potentially fuel and add an alternative to logistics. It could even drop in replacement soldiers(call it the stork.). IF not then what about emergency evac drones to replace helicopters. If you can safely drone carry up to an EM blimp you could do surgery on site instead of having to go to a hospital.

You would point on the app a mapp location(possibly with some location assist on the phone.)for delivery instead of an adress and it delivers.
