Until Squad says KSP is a \u0022finished product\u0022 and starts working on KSP 2, you should EXPECT fundamental changes with each update. So never get too attached to your ongoing games, because there\u0027s no guarantee at all they\u0027ll work after the next update. That said, Squad does try hard to avoid breaking older saved games. 0.24 does not by itself break old saves; we haven\u0027t had that happen in the last few updates. So don\u0027t blame Squad or KSP for your problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHOWEVER, updates DO usually break most mods. That\u0027s not Squad\u0027s fault, nor anybody\u0027s actually, it\u0027s just the way things go, because modders don\u0027t work for Squad so can\u0027t make their changes until after the game update comes out. Thus, there\u0027s always a period immediately after a game update where most mods you were using before simply don\u0027t work anymore. But within a week to a month, most of them will be updated to work with the new game version. Some won\u0027t be updated because those modders have lost interest, had real life issues, or whatever, so those mods will never be of use again unless somebody decides to take them over. And some of the mods that DO get updated will introduce game-breaking changes of their own which the individual modder felt was necessary for continued development of the mod. But none of that is Squad\u0027s or KSP\u0027s fault.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the bottom line is this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you play stock, you\u0027re reasonably safe from updates totally breaking your game. It happens occasionally but isn\u0027t expected. If you use mods, you\u0027re ALWAYS at fairly significant risk of save-breaking updates, and this risk is greater the more mods you use, because this increases the chances of some of them being abandoned and others making game-breaking changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo as I said, never get too attached to your ongoing game. Until the base game becomes a \u0022final product\u0022, nothing is truly safe, and heavily modded games are pretty much doomed at the next update. Just understand that this is how life is in an \u0022early access\u0022 game and \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ebe thankful\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003Ethe game is actually still being updated instead of them taking our money and then abandoning development.
