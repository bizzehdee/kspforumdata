Here are my observations now:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) The first few launches were having some significant increase in time between frames from physics calculations during launch of new rockets (1 in-game second was about 2.5 seconds of real-time). This started around Mach 1 with the atmospheric FX starting, and ended when I was getting out of the thick of the atmosphere around (60 km). Not sure if it had something to do with DRE or FAR since it started around the time FAR\u0027s Mach calculations would have started. This problem randomly went away after a few launches (although I was using the same spacecraft for testing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) When launching a rocket, I started to receive heating FX on ascent (which I wasn\u0027t before deleting the config): starts at about 42km up, surface speed 1150 m/s, acceleration at 27.59 m/s^2; went away around 60 km. The temperature of the parts bearing the brunt of the heating (the LES and command pod) only got as high as 10 deg C during this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Reentry heating FX now starts as soon as I hit the atmosphere at ~90 km, when before it was starting around 75 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Still hardly any ablative shielding loss on reentry.
