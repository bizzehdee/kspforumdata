I just installed the 0.9.0 beta version, and I found a new problem; it\u0027s something annoying but doesn\u0027t block the game. When I hover the mouse on top of any of the \u0022staging\u0022 icons (i.e. the separators, the engines, etc), the screen gets blurred with white and gray squares and lines; when I move the mouse away, everything goes back to normal.

I thought the option caused the highlighting to be too exaggerated in any case (especially if using StockBugFixPlus [I]Editor Symmetry Highlight[/I] feature).
