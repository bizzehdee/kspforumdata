A cubic meter is around 1000 kilograms and a human weighs lets say global average of 50. So that is 20,000,000,000 human volumes. So unless this is a really rare event it can happen in 3 years, so they argue that it did not reach their detector only the effects of a muon neutrino, so it might happen once every 100 or 1000 years. The other assumption is that it decays in the visceral core, which it probably would not.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T20:33:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPossibly comes from the same type of events as \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh-My-God_particle\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EOh-My-God Particles\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T07:42:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd i really wonder what could be powerful enough to impart such energy on a particle.
