Yep, thats right is simply a neutrino of the muon variety. \n\nThe total energy could only be inferred to between 5000 to 10000 TeV, the LHC is now taking date at 13 TeV, ~600 fold lower energy. The particle is moving so rapidly\n\nthat it has barely aged a moment since it was produced. \n\nThese things are occurring over year/cubic kilometer of ice, they appear to come from well outside of our galaxy, although where is unclear.\n\nAlthough the detector has found low energy neutrinos produced by radioactive decay within earth.\n\nCan you imagine if such a neutrino decayed after interacting with a human body."},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T17:18:25Z","Content":"As xkcd noted in one of his strips, you could potentially get radiation sickness from being bombarded by neutrinos. But it would require you to take a Supernova in your face at point blank range (astronomically speaking). And if you are that close to a star going Supernova, then radiation sickness of any kind is the least of your troubles.\n\nAnyways, even ordinary neutrino would ghost straight through ALL people on Earth standing in a neat row, and it would probably fail to interact with a single atom in 7 billions of bodies."},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T18:44:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E As xkcd noted in one of his strips, you could potentially get radiation sickness from being bombarded by neutrinos.

A cubic meter is around 1000 kilograms and a human weighs lets say global average of 50. So that is 20,000,000,000 human volumes. So unless this is a really rare event it can happen in 3 years, so they argue that it did not reach their detector only the effects of a muon neutrino, so it might happen once every 100 or 1000 years. The other assumption is that it decays in the visceral core, which it probably would not."},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T20:33:58Z","Content":"Possibly comes from the same type of events as [Oh-My-God Particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh-My-God_particle)."},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T07:42:37Z","Content":"And i really wonder what could be powerful enough to impart such energy on a particle.
