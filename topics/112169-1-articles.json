Maybe the inner attachment points are less stable. Overall service bays are wonky for me as well.

Your fins look a bit too forward tho, try adding them to the back and staging them with your boosters( you can always throttle to 0 if your want). \n\n It\u0027s very easy to get 1 science Jr to the middle of the 2.5 service bay with 6 atmospheric analyzers attached to it and 8 of the other science module to the top and/or bottom of the service bay. I may add two or three more science bays at the bottom or top for redundancy but only if I don\u0027t have a scientist. \n\nYou defiantly need parachutes tho if you plan on reentry"},{"CreatedByName":"Varsi","CreatedById":120571,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T18:35:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Which sucks because the inside surfaces of the service bays don\u0027t seem to work correctly at all.
