I\u0027m also not sure if it is due to a mod changing physics, since I almost ALWAYS use a mod or two. I\u0027ve come across this problem twice, so it\u0027s not just coincidence.\n\nThe gist of it is that I EVA a kerbal in Career mode, they fall on their faces (right under the leg), and when they get up... well...\n\n[http://imgur.com/eJUvdLv](http://imgur.com/eJUvdLv)\n\nLook familiar?\n\nI\u0027m still not sure what causes this, but it\u0027s generally not too bad; simply restarting KSP and loading up the game (generally I have to relaunch the vessel) is enough to get back on my feet. It bugs the crap out of me, though, so I\u0027d like to at least get the word out.\n\nSystem specs:\n\nOS: Fedora 21 Linux (kernel version 4.0.4-202)\n\nArchitecture: 64-bit (x86\\_64)\n\nPhysical RAM: 16 GB\n\nKSP Version: 1.0.4 64-bit\n\nInstalled mods:\n\nActive Texture Management Aggressive\n\nKAS\n\nKIS\n\nRemoteTech\n\nTAC Life Support\n\nKerbal Engineer Redux\n\nKerbinSide\n\nInterstellar Extended\n\nKerbal Galaxy 2\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-07T04:49:58Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2015 04:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Blazer Nitrox**\n  \nAaand forgot that I had Kerbal Galaxy 2 installed."}]}
