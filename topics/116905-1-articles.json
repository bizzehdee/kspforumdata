The design was very sharp.\n\nThen EJ suggested gimbals on SRB\u0027s and Das and Nasaman agreed.\n\nThis should be cakewalk to accomplish in stock and would add further diversity.\n\nEdit:\n\nThey finally accomplished the task by using liquid fuel boosters. The eight Mainsails produced all the necessary control authority and reached space on the initial launch and docked with the orbiting K-ISS.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-26T21:18:15Z\u0022 title=\u002207/26/2015 09:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MoeslyArmlis**"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T20:43:21Z","Content":"I wouldn\u0027t mind seeing this, given that [there is real-life precedent for gimballed SRBs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Solid_Rocket_Booster):\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Each SRB had two hydraulic gimbal servoactuators, to move the nozzle up/down and side-to-side.
