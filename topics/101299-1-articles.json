How ever after I made some adjustments to the wings my center of lift started to point downwards. No matter what I do I can not make it turn around. After this happened my plane would turn around and fly backwards when it had no fuel left and was landing (The plane flies backwards not upside down). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPicture of the air-plane design on Imgur --\u0026gt; \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/gallery/NUt2cYT\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/gallery/NUt2cYT\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/gallery/ge4iGid\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/gallery/ge4iGid\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T17:12:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi MinimalFantazy, welcome to the forums.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lift indicator can be confusing at times, as airflow and wings are not modelled in a realistic fashion, they are just \u0022good enough\u0022 but that\u0027s changing for the 1.0 release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cause of your issue is the center of mass (CoM) moving as fuel is consumed, causing it to move behind the center (CoL) of lift, this unbalances the aeroplane and makes it want to fly backwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry right clicking the booster and tweaking out the fuel, see how the CoM changes and move your wings a bit to keep it in front of the CoL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t forget to put the fuel back in \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yasmy","CreatedById":79995,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T17:40:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd what happens if you flip the orientation of the delta wing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now, the wing parts are supposed to be used in their default orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully this will change in 1.0.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MinimalFantazy","CreatedById":139026,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T15:05:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I build the air-plane from scratch again to fix the lift direction and pulled all the wings up horizontal and moved them back a bit and now it flies the right way.
