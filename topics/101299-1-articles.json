How ever after I made some adjustments to the wings my center of lift started to point downwards. No matter what I do I can not make it turn around. After this happened my plane would turn around and fly backwards when it had no fuel left and was landing (The plane flies backwards not upside down). \n\nPicture of the air-plane design on Imgur --\u003E [http://imgur.com/gallery/NUt2cYT](http://imgur.com/gallery/NUt2cYT) and [http://imgur.com/gallery/ge4iGid](http://imgur.com/gallery/ge4iGid)"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T17:12:15Z","Content":"Hi MinimalFantazy, welcome to the forums.\n\nThe lift indicator can be confusing at times, as airflow and wings are not modelled in a realistic fashion, they are just \u0022good enough\u0022 but that\u0027s changing for the 1.0 release.\n\nThe cause of your issue is the center of mass (CoM) moving as fuel is consumed, causing it to move behind the center (CoL) of lift, this unbalances the aeroplane and makes it want to fly backwards.\n\nTry right clicking the booster and tweaking out the fuel, see how the CoM changes and move your wings a bit to keep it in front of the CoL.\n\nDon\u0027t forget to put the fuel back in ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Yasmy","CreatedById":79995,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T17:40:34Z","Content":"And what happens if you flip the orientation of the delta wing?\n\nFor now, the wing parts are supposed to be used in their default orientation.\n\nHopefully this will change in 1.0."},{"CreatedByName":"MinimalFantazy","CreatedById":139026,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T15:05:28Z","Content":"So I build the air-plane from scratch again to fix the lift direction and pulled all the wings up horizontal and moved them back a bit and now it flies the right way.

The aero model is going to be completely redesigned."}]}
