However, I thought to myself, \u0022How come there\u0027s no in-game way to view these? Why do I have to go through files on my computer simply to access pictures related to my game?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought this up quickly, but I feel it would be extremely convenient to have a way to access our screenshots within the game.
