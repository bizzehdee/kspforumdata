The wall structures on the top and bottom were attached to the sides and strutted together. In the \u0027hangar\u0027, there\u0027s two small docking ports... one in the front and one in the back. I also added solar panels and some thermoelectric generators. The engines used are nuclear engines. Given that this is a captial ship, hyperedit was the only option... I might add some things and use different engines later...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMod used: B9 Aerospace\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft File: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./view/0d6cdfgf98k1a8s/TCS_Victory.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./view/0d6cdfgf98k1a8s/TCS_Victory.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
