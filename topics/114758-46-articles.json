Now that I look at it, my wording may have been confusing.  \n\nMy intention was only to point out that the KPBS modules may be useful also in space, because there is a centrifuge available.  \n\nThe thanks at the end was intended to Nils277 for KPBS. I think the parts look good, cover everything necessary and are highly modular, offering interesting possibilities for base building. Also, I find it impressive that all the crewed parts have an IVA. This final touch has undoubtedly taken a lot of work. While adding immersion, it also makes KPBS pleasant to use - no misplaced Kerbals because one didn\u0027t show up in the portraits. :)  \n\nAlso, rigid structures.

YES. One thing I have found is that the parts in this mod are exceptionally good for use with rovers. One, they offer a flat bottom, which helps to minimize roll-overs. Two, they allow for a low center of gravity, further improving stability. Lastly three, being the same height as the rest of the base, you can easily dock them to the base when not needed or, as I like to do, use them as effective part movers. The current cupola mudule sorta works, but if it had greater length and the ability to store more crew it would be perfect.
