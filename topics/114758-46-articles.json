YES. One thing I have found is that the parts in this mod are exceptionally good for use with rovers. One, they offer a flat bottom, which helps to minimize roll-overs. Two, they allow for a low center of gravity, further improving stability. Lastly three, being the same height as the rest of the base, you can easily dock them to the base when not needed or, as I like to do, use them as effective part movers. The current cupola mudule sorta works, but if it had greater length and the ability to store more crew it would be perfect. Making it similar in apperance to that of rover 2 (Little novel reference there) would be the icing on the cake. And besides, I do kind of like the idea of my little HAB on the duna prairie having a fitting rover.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rafael acevedo","CreatedById":84946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T12:31:44Z","Content":"\nDon\u0026#39;t know if this will help, but found in the cake thread a post from Blackhawk #2136 stating that if developers use as max ksp version 1.0.99 it will be interpreted that the mod is compatible with all versions of ksp 1.0.xx .
