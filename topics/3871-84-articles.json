Here\u0027s the 1st thing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KTALtFD.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KTALtFD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had the rough model of the pod done for a while, but I\u0027ve finally gotten around to adding all the detail and other parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s mostly based on the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.americaspace.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Boeing_CST-100.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECST-100\u003C/a\u003E, though I want to incorporate some Orion function into it too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the service module engines, the CST-100 has the 4 little thrusters. But I discovered when modeling the nozzle that it looks pretty good with one larger engine (Its 0.625m) in the center as well. Any thoughts, preferences?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s going to black and white/silver, rather than white and yellow like some of the promotional CST images (unless frizzank wants to pick it up and do something special, heh)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s 3.75m diameter and will hold 6 kerbals. Nothing fancy like landing legs/engines or anything like that. There\u0027s a heatshield on the bottom of the capsule\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am looking for anything interested in making a stock-like IVA scene for it - doesn\u0027t need to support HUDs or anything (If you want to do that, cool, I\u0027d just like a base model that is plugin-less as well)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
