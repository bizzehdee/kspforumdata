Multiplying the LV-N by those figures gives us 12.2 to 20.4 TWR - which comes close to the performance of engines that may have never even existed at all, and were definitely not tested. Not bad considering the LV-N is a first-generation prototype made by Jeb\u0027s Junkyard, and not a third-generation paper study.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote also that chem engines can reach specific impulses around 460 for hydro-lox designs, but the KSP engines top out at 370-380 for the big, high-TWR kinds and 390 as an absolute. Scale up the LV-N\u0027s Isp by that same factor, and you get 944-999 Isp. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo no, the LV-N isn\u0027t underpowered at all. It\u0027s a state of the art third-generation NTR in Kerbal scale.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
