I did serve as a \u0022unit serving executive\u0022 for six years and left disillusioned. As of December 2011, I severed all ties with the B.S.A.\n\nAs a volunteer, I had no problems. I had been a volunteer from 1988 to 2011 with two three-year terms as a professional. In my volunteer capacity, I served as Cub Scout Roundtable Commissioner, Assistant District Commissioner, an Assistant Council Commissioner, member of an executive board, a Vice President of Marketing and Communications, Scoutmaster, Assistant Scoutmaster, and a Merit Badge Counselor. I loved what I did. Yes, I was a \u0022knotter Scouter\u0022 and by the time I left Scouting I had four rows of knots, four knots were earned as a youth (Eagle Scout, Explorer Achievement Award, Arrow of Light, and Religious Emblem).\n\nAs a professional, it became all about the numbers - and what was really sad is that the council I was employed by was extremely \u0022top heavy\u0022 where nearly all the funding we raised (as much as 60%) went to staff salaries and not into the program. I also worked 80 hour weeks, often paid for Scouts who could could not afford to pay for their registration or to attend key events. Over the years I have been awarded a number of recognitions for something that became a life-calling...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-30T03:46:21Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2015 03:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by B787\\_300**\n  \nMod Edit"},{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T20:30:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E No, this was political money.
