I do have a couple of concerns, though:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, although having the big 2.5-meter jet stackable is cool, it\u0027s pretty much useless if we can\u0027t get rid of the pylon (a simple button in the right-click menu to toggle it would do) and if we don\u0027t have a 2.5-meter intake to go with it. I\u0027m also worried that there seems to be no supersonic version, so this won\u0027t help much with trying to build Mark 3 spaceplanes without resorting to zillion-Rapier clusters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, I severely hope that new Mk 1 cockpit is in \u003Cem\u003Eaddition\u003C/em\u003E to the old one, not replacing it, although it sounds like it is a replacement. Honestly, I like the old one much better, the jet-fighter styling fits the KSP style much better than the business-jet version which looks weirdly out of place. It could definitely do with a texture/model overhaul to get its styling more consistent with the inline version (similar to the overhaul of the Mark 3 cockpit a few versions ago) but I don\u0027t like the complete redesign. Personally I\u0027ll probably mod the old one back in. (I love the Mk 1 cabin though, should be very useful for tourist flights.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast, as cool as the smaller and same-size parts are, I still think what we need is \u003Cem\u003Ebigger\u003C/em\u003E parts. The 2-meter subsonic jet is a start, but I\u0027d really like to see more 2.5- or 3.75-meter jets, Rapiers, solids, and nukes especially. Maybe even think about adding 5-meter rocket parts. Main reason being it\u0027s nearly impossible right now to build large vehicles (rockets or space planes) without the part count going through the roof and associated performance hits. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, the new parts look fantastic and I am very much looking forward to them, as well as Unity 5, hopefully supported/stable Windows x64, and all the other improvements it sounds like we\u0027re getting in 1.1.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T19:54:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022theend3r\u0022 data-cite=\u0022theend3r\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s the opposite.

The 2-meter subsonic jet is a start, but I\u0027d really like to see more 2.5- or 3.75-meter jets, Rapiers, solids, and nukes especially. Maybe even think about adding 5-meter rocket parts. Main reason being it\u0027s nearly impossible right now to build large vehicles (rockets or space planes) without the part count going through the roof and associated performance hits.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI disagree, actually. In my mind, the smaller parts were \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E needed than the larger parts, simply because you can at least lump smaller parts together to create something larger, as impractical as it is. As it currently stands, making tiny planes is effectively impossible without mods, with the smallest jet engine being really heavy and powerful for a 0.625m craft. That said, the addition of larger parts is most definitely welcome. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
