Thick wings allow you to pull higher AoAs, but would prob skyrocket the wave drag area on your design. Otherwise, what Hodo said (it kinda is possible to do automatic \u0022slats\u0022 though, just need to set the leading edge to negative AoA deflection).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, do you actually pull 70\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 AoA? Or do you pull till less, and then the nose suddenly lifts? If so, your tail stalls first, loses lift, and now that your tail wings aren\u0027t countering anymore, your wings will pull the nose up. Possible solutions would be thicker tail wings, or tail wing slats. Or not pulling that tight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith B9PW it shouldn\u0027t be a problem to add slats/make the slats bigger. Same for flaps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESet the leading edge control surfaces (if I\u0027m not mistaken your leading edge is already a control surface) to either spoilers, or flaps, then modify the custom action groups so you can control them. They should deflect up at 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 AoA, and then deflect towards the airflow (-AoA deflection, I think you already use that) so they don\u0027t cause a stall.
