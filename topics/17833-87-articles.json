In two completely separate locations, mind you, with one under Program Files and the other under Program Files(x86) with the same exact file directories for Steam (I recently had to re-image my computer and copied my old program files folder into the new image, however I neglected to install steam in the same folder for some reason). One directory had KSP v0.90 and the other had KSP v1.0.2 and each had the KER mod installed in the game directories. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lagging problem was fixed once I completely deleted the old Steam directory entirely. I can\u0027t be certain that was the fix, because I have not done any robust testing, but I\u0027m pretty sure that\u0027s the only thing that changed between testing KER in KSP. So somehow the old KSP directory with the older version of KER in it was interfering with the current version even though it was in a completely file directory. I know it sounds far-fetched, but that\u0027s all I did to fix it, so I can\u0027t really explain why doing that worked even though they are in two separate directories.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mjnorman","CreatedById":132798,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T22:56:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd are those stats for vacuum or atmosphere?
