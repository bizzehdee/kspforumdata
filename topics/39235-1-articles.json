It\u0027s simply a solution to reduce the wear and tear on tires and running gear, and to improve turning performance. Without Ackerman geometry a rover simply would have pronounced understeer rather than flipping. What causes the flipping is the tires not breaking traction when they should, and that is simply because KSP\u0027s physics model for the wheels (including those bizarre torque curves) is pretty primitive... enough that whenever I try to do BOE calcs for my rovers, they always leave me scratching my head, lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBobcat\u0027s DEMVs have much better stiction/traction modelling, if you want to compare. Personally I prefer how Squad handles rover building better, but I would love it if Bobcat wrote a plugin to hijack Squad\u0027s wheel physics so we got the best of both worlds.
