At higher altitudes, SAS has more mechanical advantage then that of the control surfaces, hence prograding is easier. I just made what I believe is the tiniest shuttle to orbit kerbin in 1.0. Unfortunately, turning in lower atmosphere consists of finer movements of the control surfaces. I found somewhat of a bug if you asked me. SSTO\u0027s are easier to get into orbit but people fear it will burn up during reentry. I have found out that once you get under 50,000 meters, if you pull your nose up 30 degress, you slow down from 2,400 to 1,800 in seconds. The more you do it, the more you slow down making SSTO\u0027s easier to land. Highly recommended that for SSTO builders. Anyways, I understand you struggle Zekes.
