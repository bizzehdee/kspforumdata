Summer break! Here\u0027s a thread for talking all about it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor me, I plan on focusing on a lot of things I did not have much time to do during the school year. For one thing, I\u0027d like to focus on trying to expand my extracurriculars by signing up for summer camps, working on competitions, and maybe work on getting an Astronomy club at my school set up. Additionally, I hope to work on hanging out with friends because this is certainly not something I\u0027ve ever been able to do regularly for a long time. Another hope is that I try out random hobbies (like reading) that a combination of school and procrastination has really prevented me from attempting. Speaking of which, I definitely want to spend the plentiful time I have to work on gaining better habits and try to improve myself. Lastly, I certainly hope to get back into KSP, and possibly even revive some projects that I abandoned a long time ago...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-18T15:29:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSummer Break has just passed for\u00A0me XD\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-18T20:36:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSummer \u003Cem\u003Ewhat\u003C/em\u003E, now?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll be spending the summer shaking my cane and yelling at kids to keep off my lawn!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-18T20:45:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave a safe, sane, fun summer y\u0027all. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-18T21:55:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMine starts in about a month, although you could say it starts next week,\u00A0considering the actual school\u00A0lessons are nearly over and i will only have to do tests from now on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI always have great plans for summer, and end up doing nothing but sleeping, eating, and doing chores\u00A0instead.
