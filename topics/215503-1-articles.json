I spend the most of yesterday evening and this morning fighting a banana rocket.. putting up a station.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nBecause the station part kept bend out of the faring i ended up strutting it in place like mad. Now... on the module i put up i had a tiny little \u0022drone\u0022 with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters to take modules coming up and installing them.. I read somewere that struts are not an issue and will disappear when you decouple.

Alternatively... i will have to disconnect the arm.. deorbit it and have it crash.. send up a new one and fight the rendevouz procedure and correct my error.
