Seriously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like the basic idea here though. A long time ago I proposed a system whereby the player creates a mission proposal (much like how governmental space agencies do) which outlines certain objectives they want to achieve and then get funding to achieve those objectives. Reputation would go up or down depending on success, either opening further doors or closing them until rep was raised. The idea was to sideline the ridiculously random garbage inherent in the contract system while cleaving to sandbox gameplay (player set goals).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn all honesty though I\u0027m hoping to see a proper sandbox with real incentives to go further, where I can simply set my own goals without needing a contract or proposal or whatever, just build and go, do cool spaceship stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-12T23:24:33Z\u0022 title=\u002202/12/2023 11:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 12, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by regex\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
