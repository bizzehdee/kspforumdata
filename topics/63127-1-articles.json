I play almost entirely stock (Plus Engineer Redux)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had put the game aside for a while and focused on other interests. It seemed that every update was breaking my saves or introducing half-working features, and I decided to take a break while development stabilized.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI came back recently and decided to check out career mode. It\u0027s obviously not finished, but I\u0027ve enjoyed unlocking the tech tree; it seems a useful way to limit the overwhelming variety of parts that would otherwise be presented to a new player.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, since picking the game up again I\u0027ve done a land and return on Mun, Minimus, Duna (and Ike), Laythe, and Tylo. I\u0027ve put a rover on Eve. I\u0027ve done orbital docking and refueling. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecently I\u0027ve iterated nine major designs with hundreds of incremental variants, in an attempt to perfect a stock Eve lander / return to orbit craft. I\u0027ve spent weeks of my evenings refining different designs. I\u0027ve now got a design that I\u0027m confident will work: 13,000 m/s atmospheric \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv, every stage has \u0026gt;1.3 TWR on Eve, it has enough control authority and stability, enough chutes to land safely, and its sturdy enough to take chute deployment as well as landing forces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is, it\u0027s over the \u0022chug\u0022 threshold. I can load the craft and launch it to orbit, but playing the game while piloting it is an exercise in patience and frustration. Launching it to LKO, refueling it, flying it to Eve, refueling it, landing it, and then attempting to pilot it back to orbit would be academic at this point; I\u0027m confident it \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E be done, and suddenly I\u0027m no longer motivated to go through the motions. I loved the design phase, but piloting this beast isn\u0027t rewarding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what I\u0027m looking for is suggestions for other challenging missions. Hopefully some that are difficult, but can be achieved with fewer than 1k parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter landing on and returning from Tylo and Eve, using stock parts and manual piloting, what\u0027s left to achieve?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-13T21:50:13Z\u0022 title=\u002202/13/2014 09:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Anglave\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndOfTheEarth","CreatedById":24503,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T22:48:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFind new ways to land.
