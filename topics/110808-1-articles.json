Valentina appears to be a Male Kerbal in my career mode. IVA cam shows a male, in the Astronaut complex she appears to be a man too. That\u0027s not all. Every other FemKerbal is female with the female model too. It isn\u0027t game breaking. It just bothers me and I\u0027d love if there was some way to fix it without restarting my Career mode save."},{"CreatedByName":"ThaSaint","CreatedById":120513,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T23:39:20Z","Content":"[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122922-Problem-with-gender-swapping](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122922-Problem-with-gender-swapping)\n\nSomeone just helped me solve the same problem. If you have texture replacer installed that\u0027s what\u0027s causing the problem, there\u0027s 2 locations in the save file that you have to switch."}]}
