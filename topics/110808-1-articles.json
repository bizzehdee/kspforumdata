Valentina appears to be a Male Kerbal in my career mode. IVA cam shows a male, in the Astronaut complex she appears to be a man too. That\u0027s not all.

It just bothers me and I\u0027d love if there was some way to fix it without restarting my Career mode save.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThaSaint","CreatedById":120513,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T23:39:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122922-Problem-with-gender-swapping\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122922-Problem-with-gender-swapping\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomeone just helped me solve the same problem.
