The option to transfer KSP Store licenses to Steam is only available for those who bought KSP before it originally came out on Steam, March 20th 2013.\u00A0Note that if you do qualify for a transfer and choose to do it, the process is OPTIONAL and IRREVERSIBLE. If you transfer your purchase to Steam, you will no longer be able to download or update the game from the KSP Store.\u00A0To move to Steam, log in to your KSP Store profile and you will find the button to start the process next to your download link. If you can\u2019t see the button in your profile it means you purchased the game after it was on Steam and you are not eligible, no exceptions, please don\u2019t insist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-30T23:24:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223407758\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022176289\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221530347181\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022159045\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Chocolat Oreos\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 hours ago, Chocolat Oreos said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow that steam workshop is a thing, I really want to have the steam version without paying money to get it, just for a steam workshop function.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou know that there\u0027s only crafts and missions on the workshop and that there is still no intention to open if for actual mods?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-30T23:48:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to KSP Network.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
