If you just drop in several generations of ship building into an early career, you\u0027re sort of defeating the point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T19:21:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMost major part mods have been incorporated into the stock tree. Your best bet is to install these mods ( there\u0027s also custom tech trees, but part placement might be off if u have mods ) and start a fresh save. Work your way through the new tree. Then once everythings unlocked career turns into sandbox. So its the opposite of what you want unfortunately.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AntonDV","CreatedById":90288,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T19:43:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Motokid600\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Motokid600\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThen once everythings unlocked career turns into sandbox.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, because the point is to start with nothing and build your way up, not start with everything and see how quickly you can unlock the tech tree with 20\u002B flights in progress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose it\u0027s easier for me to talk about starting from nothing, I lost over ~100hrs of ship building and saves, and bases on 4 planets when I reformatted my computer.

I could\u0027ve cut it down to six since one of the missions was a minmus flyby that should\u0027ve been a landing (time accelerated too far) and the other mission (DUNA mission) suffered from a badly designed lander.
