Kerrin Orbit Rendezvous munar missions actually start looking attractive. It\u0027s not bad to get single craft to the Mun, but return ends up requiring a transfer vehicle (CSM). Single stage landers work, but they are tight on dv margins. 64K (6.4X system) starts needing some bigger parts. Landers require staging, often, and real choices start to crop up, just like Apollo mission choices that were hashed out (Kerbin Orbit Rendezvous, Direct Ascent, Munar Orbit Rendezvous).
