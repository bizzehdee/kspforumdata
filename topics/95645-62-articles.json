I came into it with SETI in mind, and wanted permission to perhaps call it: Contract Pack: SETI - Aircraft Before Unmanned. Is it ok I use the SETI name with it Yemo? The pack is KAX aware and recommended, but not required to work with SETI or stock.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nContract Pack: SSI Aerospace 0.0.3 - Giving Aircraft a Purpose: Air Flights, Tours, Coast Guard, STS\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ecom\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E/threads/138997-Contract-Pack-SSI-Aerospace-0-0-3-Air-Flights-Ocean-Tours-and-Coast-Guard-Rescue-Recovery\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHey,\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nthank you for asking me about it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. The \u0022SETI\u0022 name brought a lot of trouble for me. People expect(ed) something like searching for aliens (though that would be SEKI in ksp?) and did not look at the thread. I saw this response a lot while watching streams and asking people about it. And then there were the people who were downright offended that I used SETI. Seriously there was one guy ranting over 3 (edit: 2, see page 6 of this thread, so when the mod was quite young and it\u0027s prospects uncertain) pages somewhere in this thread about how I could use such a name for something not related to searching for aliens. At some point I would have changed the name if kerbalstuff allowed for mod name changes...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. With the title of this thread including \u0022Unmanned before Manned\u0022 and \u0022SETI\u0022, a contract pack called \u0022SETI - Aircraft Before Unmanned\u0022 would clearly look like something coming from this thread (and this thread would turn up in google). Which is a serious problem from support to feedback.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. It would also express a preference/affiliation from the \u0022SETI-ModPack\u0022 point of view towards your contract pack. Which would also lead to questions like \u0022Do I need SETIctt to use that contract pack?\u0022, since many users do not read the forum threads before asking such questions. With #2, that question would likely be asked in this thread instead of yours. On the other side, people who do not like SETI for whatever reason would stay away from your contract pack (and trust me there are quite a few who are against the very idea of the SETI-BalanceMod).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n4. Due to those reasons, I tried to avoid the SETI name myself, for every newer mod which is not strictly SETI related. SETIcontracts and SETIgreenhouse only have that name because they were once a part of the SETI-BalanceMod, same goes for SETIctt. SETI-RemoteTech is just a config which is mainly included in the SETI-BalanceMod download, the separate download is just for modularity. As mentioned before, I try to shrink the \u0022SETI-Pack\u0022 down again, using SETIcontracts as a guinea pig before phasing it out and SETIgreenhouse dev has essentially stopped a long time ago. So that I can just focus on SETIctt and SETI-BalanceMod (including the config for RemoteTech and possibly other rebalancing configs in the future).\u003Cbr\u003E\n=\u0026gt; Thus my newest \u0022real mod\u0022 (more than a single compatibility config file for another mod) UnmannedBeforeManned does not mention SETI apart from some background infos.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI would therefore recommend using a different name which avoids the problems mentioned above, especially concerning support issues in general and the assumptions associated with something like \u0022SETI\u0022 in particular.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs I said, I tried to change it myself at some point.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nA few other thoughts:\u003Cbr\u003E\na) Aircraft Before Unmanned seemingly implies a tech tree component moving aircraft parts around in the tech tree (like \u0022BetterThanStartingManned\u0022 and \u0022UnmannedBeforeManned\u0022). Or it implies that such a tech tree component is needed for the contract pack (like SETIcontracts implies that other SETI mods are needed, although it would work fine with ETT as well, thus the name decreases the playerbase for the mod).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nb) There is another contract pack dealing with aircraft missions. I can only recommend implementing mechanisms to deal with the situation where both are installed, because people interested in aircraft contracts will do so (I often saw SETIcontracts and AdvancedProgression installed together and if I would not phase out SEITcontracts anyway, I would do something to prevent all those issues). I learned from that with UnmannedBeforeManned, which completely deactivates every component of itself, if some other tech tree mods are detected (via :NEEDS[!\u0026lt;mod\u0026gt;] module manager statements).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nedit: Not to discourage you, those are just my experiences, especially with the SETI name and mod support issues.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn other news, the \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#b22222;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECustomBarnKit\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E has some \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#b22222;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eissues\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E at the moment.\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E does not install the latest version which works with KSP 1.0.5, but instead installs a version which does not...\u003Cbr\u003E\n2.
