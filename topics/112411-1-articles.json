My lander has 8km/s of DV, which should be enough. It has 1.1-1.4 Kerbin TWR the entire descent and ascent. Currently, I\u0027m just burning retro the entire way down and throttling a small bit to stop me from re-ascending. What\u0027s the way that gives me the most time to burn, and is safest?

With massless, infinite thrust engines you would do a suicide impulse burn a meter above the surface (assuming there would still be a surface after that). With a TWR of 1.00001 you would do something very close to a constant altitude method, because getting too deep in the gravity well with too much vertical speed would cause you to crash and burn.
