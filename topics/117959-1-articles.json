Kerbin is a moon around a gas giant with 3 other moons. Thus starting from the beginning you gotta use good transfer windows or end up wasting a lot of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven that I have Transfer Window Planner (TWP), Kerbal Engineer (KER) and Precise node (PN). But it seems like I\u0027m either doing something wrong or that one of these mods doesn\u0027t really support what I\u0027m trying to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I setup a secondary test game with the bare minimum mods in order to test everything out and throw mechjeb in for testing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe following image is of the transfer I get from TWP. As you can see from the PN window i put the UT in, the Prograde and the Normal as per the transfer info. But the ejection orbit is way out of whack. Am I using TWP wrong?

It never goes into positive numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrecise Node has Ejection Angle, but that doesn\u0027t seem to match up with TWP\u0027s angle. I\u0027m thinking it might be because PN splits it into 180 degree prograde/retrograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to see Ejection Heading?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel like a lot of these are basic questions I should know.

Having the node at the correct ejection angle is much more important than hitting the transfer time at the exact second.
