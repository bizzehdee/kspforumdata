I\u0027ve not had it happen, but there could be similar problems going all to \u0022root\u0022 or all to \u0022heaviest.\u0022 Similar issues happen with regular struts if you use too many. Tiny little adjustments to keep everything stuck together can actually cause ship-rending shaking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think there\u0027s also a performance hit, but I\u0027ve not done any actual testing on that.

Maybe the solution then is to just remove the feature and make all connections a lot stronger. It seems so absurd.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI used a few autostruts to try to stiffen up a big jiggly space station. I didn\u0027t do it right and the station started vibrating like hell and then blew up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the point is that the autostruts are a temporary gift to counteract excessive flex bugginess in Unity joints. When the joint problem gets fixed by Unity, the devs intend to delete the autostruts again. So they can\u0027t just make the connections stronger and assume it will stay that way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"memerman02","CreatedById":212994,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-24T14:57:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your craft doesent look like spageti ur playing the game wrong\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-26T23:32:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps so, but the original poster\u0027s question is long since answered, and further discussion in this thread is probably moot at this point.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAccordingly, locking the thread to prevent further confusion.\u00A0 Anyone with more questions or comments on autostruts (or any other topic) is welcome to spin up a new thread for the purpose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
