I didn\u0027t notice much difference. Or, perhaps said better, the difference between the old docking washer and the new rotatron certainly seems to be vastly more significant. \u003Cp\u003EI will do some dedicated testing tonight to really probe this further, but right now it does seem like some of the joints are significantly stronger than others. I could be mistaken... it could be something to do with how they are attached to their parent, or perhaps how their children attach to them. Proper scientific testing is required. But in the meantime if you can think of anything that makes the new rotatron different from the old docking washer (other than the raw geometry, obviously), that might be the key.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll put together some click through gfys, pretty sure I\u0027ve accidentally taken parts off but again, could be my faulty memory. Will perform some proper testing for you tonight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall I should mention that BY FAR my biggest issues with building right now are to do with the game crashing after half a dozen reverts, and the problem with symmetry getting stuck on radial. These are bugs in the base game that, afaik, have nothing to do with any mods and which take up much more of my time than working around any issues with IR, KAS or KOS. Testing IR craft (or, really, any complex craft) requires a lot of launches and a lot of tweaking, and when the game has a memory leak that happens on revert... yeeesh. I spend half my time looking at the KSP loading screen, lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ve fixed the leak in editor, we\u0027ll try to post a new pre-release or even a release soon.

My crashes aren\u0027t caused by anything in IR (or any other mod) though. The base game just leaks memory when reverting, particularly reverting to SPH (about 100 meg), but also somewhat when reverting to launch (30-40 meg). Long standing issue with the stock game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess what I\u0027m trying to say is that I pretty much judge everything and don\u0027t sugarcoat my feedback (INTJ), but the niggles I have with IR are really just that - niggles - compared to some of the stock game frustrations. Overall I have huge appreciation for what you guys have been able to do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T11:35:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think I\u0027ve found why I was sometimes clicking \u0022through\u0022 the IR window. it\u0027s not actually a clickthrough, it seems to be to do with \u0022lag\u0022 (can\u0027t think of a better word) in the SPH when dealing with a complex craft. It does seem to get worse over time, so this might be related to the UI memory leak. Since you\u0027ve already fixed this one I think it\u0027s all good!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the joint connections, the new joints do all seem to behave consistently. I created a few test craft and put them through tests lifting weights. I also put them in the middle of a couple of girders and dropped it vertically onto the ground with 9 tons of weight on top to see what it did to the connection at the joint and the lower girder always \u0022twitched\u0022 on impact pretty much the same. In fact, the girder twitches about the same as the control, for which I didn\u0027t put any robotic joint in, just two girders connected directly, so that\u0027s good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI scaled up the docking washer\u0027s mass to match the new rotatron and the plates separated a bit, which I didn\u0027t see with the rotatron. But the actual girder twitch wasn\u0027t much more than with the new rotatron. So the net effect seems to be about the same despite there being more apparent movement in the joint itself with the docking washer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, I don\u0027t really have any conclusions to draw here. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am hypothesizing that the effect might be more related to how things are connected (surface attachment, node attachment, offset, etc) than it is to the joint itself. When I node attached the girder and did the drop test the girder wobbled but it did not get forced up through the hinge joints, whereas when I dropped the mech, which also has the girders node attached but then rotated and offset, the hinge \u0022fell through\u0022 the girder quite far and then sprung back up. If true then this behaviour seems dependent on the base game, not on anything in IR itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T17:35:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem of the joint stiffness can be solved with a mod that introduces different materials.
