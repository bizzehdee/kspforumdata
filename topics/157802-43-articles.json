Perhaps squad would have bankrupted and was forced to sell it broken or figured they could just fix it later. I don\u0027t know what the specifics are.

Point is, most the money going into to development is to fix a broken product that was sold, in my opinion, knowingly to console user. This game isn\u0027t getting further developed for pc. They are trying to fix KSP on consoles. Which I do condone them for, as they aren\u0027t under any obligation to do so.

Also, I\u0027m not hating, I\u0027m a finance major and can understand it from a business perspective, I\u0027m just pointing out the obvious. Go read those forums if you would like your proof. Perhaps squad would have bankrupted and was forced to sell it broken or figured they could just fix it later. I don\u0027t know what the specifics are. I\u0027m just saying Squad, rather obviously, sold a broken game to console users. This is really of topic here though.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get a bit on topic, my aim is, squad needed to cut its losses with the console version back in 2016. Instead they started actively rebuilding it from scratch. Something I\u0027m afraid will never work out and become a money pit; or they will just cut their losses later on. Point is, most the money going into to development is to fix a broken product that was sold, in my opinion, knowingly to console user. This game isn\u0027t getting further developed for pc. They are trying to fix KSP on consoles. Which I do condone them for, as they aren\u0027t under any obligation to do so. I just think that was a bad decision from the beginning and that is where development money is going- Rebuilding an entire new game for the console version????????????????!?!?!?!?!?!?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, I should acknowledge take 2 acquiring this game means that they have plans for it. This game is already past its point of maturity, which makes acquiring its rights rather pointless unless you are after the license. Perhaps the pc will see a lot more development. Perhaps we will see a kerbal2. We may even get Kerbal Kart and kerbal tennis soon.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t get me wrong I love KSP and squad for making it- call it constructive criticism\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, they outsourced the console development to another company, who ended up\u00A0dragging their feet. Things happened, the game suffered, and they cut ties and went to someone a little more competent. I\u0027d hardly call that \u0022starting from scratch\u0022 - I\u0027d say it\u0027s taking the first bad decision\u00A0on the chin, keeping their integrity and doing it right the second time. I\u0027d hardly call\u00A0investing\u00A0money with Blitworks a \u0022money pit\u0022. They are creating the product that was promised to the console users years ago.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat would you have Squad do? Refund every user who bought the console versions? Admit to their consumer base \u0022Sorry, we screwed up. You\u0027re not worth our time\u0022\u00A0What\u0027s\u00A0cheaper?

That\u0027s a Unity issue shared by a multitude of other games written in the same way. Do you think rewriting the game in\u00A0Crytek or Havok;\u00A0scrapping\u00A0five years of development;\u00A0reintegrate work done by people who have long since moved on and can\u0027t be consulted -\u003Cem\u003E just to\u00A0improve performance for the fringe cases of people running it on a laptop\u003C/em\u003E - is really a sound business decision?\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSquad\u0027s running on fumes. They have several job openings, lost over half of their developers over the last few years, and just got freaking hit by a massive earthquake. The only sensible thing\u00A0to do is release paid expansions to keep the lights on. A quick buck?
