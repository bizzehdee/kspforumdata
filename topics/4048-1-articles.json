Lets assume I have a part roughly the size of a standard tank - how big the texture file should be? is 1024x1024 optimal?

Should it be the other way around, 1024 is still acceptable, but 2048 is just too much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\\\u0027s only ONE hard restriction, though: each side MUST be a power of two (or was it factor? Pretty sure it was power...).

How many pixels do you need to represent a solid color mapped to a triangle?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe higher the level of mesh detail, the more vertices, and the more unique sets of faces to map into the texture which requires more texture real estate. The higher the resolution required on a particular face or set of faces the more texture real estate required.
