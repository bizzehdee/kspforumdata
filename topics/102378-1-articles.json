As with many space simulators currently in development, it\u0027ll be cool if and when it actually comes out, but until then I\u0027m not going to hold my breath.\n\nAnd it\u0027s not quite SpaceEngine. Vast, sure, procedurally generated, sure. But not THAT vast (as far as I can tell), plus a lot of the background graphics suggest it\u0027s not going to be as realistic-looking as Space Engine. Maybe they\u0027ll change it though, who knows.\n\nI\u0027m still eagerly awaiting a space game like this but with more realistic spaceships. Everything from this to Star Citizen has old-fashioned sci-fi ships that are shaped like planes or boats and have parallel decks. I have yet to see any compelling games featuring something like radial symmetry for instance.\n\n\u0027Xcept KSP of course ;P"},{"CreatedByName":"Pixel of Life","CreatedById":45646,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T14:48:59Z","Content":"Looks cool.
