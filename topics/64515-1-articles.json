An EVA Kerbal weighs 0.095. Thus, a Kerbal in a chair weighs 0.1 tons but you can\u0027t have full seats in the SPH. To get around this, during construction, you can put some other part that weighs 0.1 tons where the chair will go eventually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHOWEVER, this only works if all the Kerbals will get on and off at the same place. If you have an airplane with individual Kerbals getting off here and there as it flies, and the seats are lined up along the fuselage, then the CoM will change as they leave and you\u0027re back in the same boat. To avoid this happening, line the seats up along the wingspan so all are in line with the CoM. Thus will prevent the CoM from changing longitudinally as individual Kerbals get on and off. It will, though, make the CoM shift from side to side unless you drop the Kerbals in pairs. However, this lateral CoM movement is usually no big deal--torque can keep the thing level anyway. In any case, this is a LOT better than a longitudinal CoM shift that screws up where the CoM is compared to the CoL.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-28T22:31:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t load your craft in KSP (which I might shortly), but I\u0027ve designed a VTOL with 8 seats on it.

When you say that, do you mean even after you load the first passenger kerbal? And no matter how many kerbals you add, it goes crazy?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ask because I flew your VTOL and it was rock solid. I then loaded it up with 8 kerbals and proceeded to land on top of the VAB, and managed to do so on the first try. Your craft has 10 jump seats so I tried various configs of 2, 4, 6, and 8 Kerbals. I flew with the front most seats empty, and the back most seats empty. (I landed on the VAB with the back seats empty.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one gotcha to that though (and I\u0027m hoping your problem is this), is that when you load a kerbal into the command seat, his position becomes the new orientation for your navball. So, for instance, if you load a kerbal in the left side seats, take off, and try to roll left you might end up pitching forward. So I can see if the craft starts to sway, and you counteract but it\u0027s not in the intended direction, the whole craft will quickly flip over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it is this, (after you\u0027ve loaded your passengers) right click on your MK-1 cockpit at the front and select \u0022Control From Here\u0022. That should fix your navball/control issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that\u0027s not your problem, then you might be having some other issue such as clipping or just a plain bug. Your kerbals at the very back clip a little into the pods you have hanging off the back, and they clip into the kerbals in the seats right behind them. It\u0027s such a small amount of clipping that I don\u0027t suspect this is the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW: I\u0027m running completely stock KSP except for MechJeb and KER.
