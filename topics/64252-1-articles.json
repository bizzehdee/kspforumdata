Whether you are looking to put some Kerbals into space, or even to colonise a planet, we\u0027ve got you covered...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are currently working on our custom plugin, which will generate resources on other planets, and also add in the things necessary to keep your Kerbals alive. With this mod, you will be able to create advanced vessels, and fill them with life! We are hard at work, and are positive that this part of the mod will be released soon!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are looking for more parts to create orbital craft, then you\u0027ve also come to the right place! With DC Aerospace, we provide you with an enormous amount of satellite parts, so that you can design intricate satellites to put into orbit around anything in the Universe, or to send on deep space missions. Whatever your aim, we can help you get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EProbe Cores:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur main range of parts is an entire line of probe cores.

These cores are built around a 1.25m scale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E-The Horizon Range-\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese advanced cores are the perfect platform to construct your own space telescopes around- featuring large reflecting chambers, lenses, solar panels, and all of the features of an orbital probe core, you can create fully-functional orbital telescopes within minutes!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have also designed a wide range of satellite parts to add onto any of the satellite cores, to allow you to design extremely advanced, and compact orbital and/or exploration probes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can have this pack for your own space program right now, by going to the official page:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/defcon-corporation-orbital-tech-pack/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/defcon-corporation-orbital-tech-pack/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Showcase Of The Mod:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/1VYXB\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

We are aiming to create a vast array of high-quality parts for KSP, which are designed to bring exciting new features into your game, and to allow you to build bigger, and better craft. This will remain the sole aim of our mod, and we will not be considering making the mod compatible with other mods until the DC Aerospace mod is at a point at which we are happy with it. We apologise for any inconvenience that this may cause, but please note that this will give us more time to expand the DC Aerospace mod, meaning that we will be able to create parts of a much higher quality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDC Aerospace by EsvDefcon, MetalMouth7, and Deathsoul097 is licensed under a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/deed.en_US\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECreative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"a__gun","CreatedById":83859,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-25T18:13:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy have you started a new, identical thread for this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deathsoul097","CreatedById":77396,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-25T18:38:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe old one got a lot of bad rep and a few people were a bit ranty over the idea of hyperium.
