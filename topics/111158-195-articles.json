All my craft are pure stock - which is the first time since .18 that I\u0027ve played a KSP version which is this stock. I only have the mods because they add environmental things and effects into the game that I\u0027ve always felt the stock game misses.\n\nI prefer to play Sandbox games - I\u0027ve always enjoyed defining my own mission objectives. Right now, I have a bunch of new \u0022Kerbalnauts\u0022 who are trying to earn their skills in a variety of missions - flight, spaceflight, and even oceangoing. I think it is more fun to set my own parameters. I also like creating craft which have function.

Unless it is either mid-terms or finals. Then I only log in for about thirty minutes a day here and about thirty minutes on Steam where I am also an administrator for the official KSP Steam page. I pretty much do the same job there as I do here - moderation (oh, and I use the same user name there, too). But...\n\nI spend most of my time, when I do have it available, here in this forum. And unless I am forced to act as a moderator, I pretty much do what the average forum member does - discuss topics where I can be the nerd that I am, look at some really nice screen shots, and even play some forum games! As mentioned earlier, I am working on a fan-fic story and have an image repository where I toss random images out. So, as I said above, pretty much everything everyone else does!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 51 minutes ago, LittleBitMore said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E A question I forgot to include in the last post, for any mod: the Moderator Lounge has been mentioned.

We do have a moderator\u0027s lounge where we have various threads about the forum, a \u0022how to moderate\u0022 guide for us newer moderators, threads where we discuss the nominations for thread of the month and thread of the year, and a few others I really cannot recall and for those that I can, I can\u0027t say. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  But all in all, that part of the forum is so we can be better moderators for this forum.  \n\nI hope this helps you out."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-29T03:09:07Z","Content":"I play stock, both because it avoids the nuisance of updating mods, and to keep myself acquainted with the base game that we all have in common.
