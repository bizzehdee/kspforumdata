So I decided to test it by doing 5 launches with an orbitor.\n\nIn these launches it took me 3780 \u002B/- 28m/s to reach an orbit of 75km (mean \u002B/- std.dev.).\n\nFor the individual launches that was 3776m/s, 3748m/s, 3804m/s, 3812m/s, and 3758m/s.\n\nI am curious if other has been experimenting with that, and what figures you have come up with for the new delta V requirements. This is also only for Kerbin, I\u0027ve not yet done any experiments for the other planets/moons with an atmosphere.\n\nSo if you also have some results, I would be grateful if you will share them.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T20:21:12Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 08:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by krh42**"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T22:01:52Z","Content":"3500-4000 m/s is generally what folks have been getting; your observations fall in the same range. That\u0027s also consistent with pre-1.0 FAR\u0027s delta-V requirement for LKO; the new aero is fairly similar."},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T22:04:34Z","Content":"Yes, about 3700 m/s. Pretty close to FAR. Actually I\u0027m very surprised that I don\u0027t have to re-adjust my habits from FAR."}]}
