So I decided to test it by doing 5 launches with an orbitor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn these launches it took me 3780 \u002B/- 28m/s to reach an orbit of 75km (mean \u002B/- std.dev.).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the individual launches that was 3776m/s, 3748m/s, 3804m/s, 3812m/s, and 3758m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am curious if other has been experimenting with that, and what figures you have come up with for the new delta V requirements.
