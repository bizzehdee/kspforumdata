Unfortunately, those mods dont run with 1.0.4 yet. I have a backup of my gamedata folder from 1.0.2 that I would like to continue to play untill all mods have been updated. But I cant figure out an acceptable (read: legal) way to revert back to 1.0.2 since my game has been updated to the recent version through steam already.\n\nI know about the \u0022revert to last stable\u0022 version option in Steam, but that gets me 0.9 which doesnt really help me.\n\nI searched on forums and reddit but couldnt find any solution. If anyone knows how I can continue playing 1.0.2, it would be most appreaciated. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-02T16:35:38Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2015 04:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TrooperCooper**"},{"CreatedByName":"Cerbis","CreatedById":124555,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T14:10:44Z","Content":"Unless you backed up the entire Kerbal Space Program folder, you won\u0027t be able to run 1.0.2; GameData alone isn\u0027t enough.
