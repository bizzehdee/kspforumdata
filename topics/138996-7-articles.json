I have never spent as many hours playing one video game. I\u0027ve restarted career over and over, trying out different mod combos, and its never boring. Occasionally, you get burnt out and take a break, but come crawling back. I\u0027ve made one payment for this game, I don\u0027t remember what I paid, but it was I remember I thought it was a good deal. Since then, they\u0027ve been making continuous updates. They even upgraded the entire game engine, 1.1 being a huge step forward. More upgrades planned, even VR support possibly. Never once has squad asked me to spend any more money on their game with dlc and what not. Its a game that keeps on giving, really. They give frequent updates on their progress with devnotes. They respond to user posts, suggestions, etc. Is the game buggy? Yes....so is just about every game out there. I\u0027ve had frustrations with GTAV and Project Cars to name just a couple. I know Rockstar is known for never commenting on and not really bothering to fix some bugs, GTA Online is a hive of hackers and cheaters. Project Cars is a mess, and my experience with their studio is they\u0027re a bunch of jerks. I can\u0027t get through one season of their abysmal career mode without running into race ruining bugs, and they\u0027ve never been fixed. They also failed to deliver on many promises, and have now pretty much suspended support while they work on a sequel, only releasing token dlc and minor patches.

Going to the public to complain about your employer is pretty petty and childish and doesn\u0027t serve a purpose. Does he want to tarnish their reputation? Does he want fans of squad to not like them anymore? Does he expect them to change their practices because he ratted on them on reddit? Does he want his low paying job back? I don\u0027t get it. I think its for attention and spite, but that\u0027s just me. I\u0027m not a dev, I\u0027m not a coder, I\u0027ve never worked in video games, so I don\u0027t know anything other than what I hear. What\u00A0I hear is that working in the video game industry sucks in general, working Mexico sucks in general, so it doesn\u0027t come as a big surprise to me that working as a video game developer in Mexico probably sucks a lot.
