If 15 XP is the max (planting a flag), but you landed and forgot to plant one (or couldn\u0027t for some reason), let\u0027s say that was worth 12 XP. If you brought that same Kerbal back as part of a crew that planted a flag, you would get an additional 3 XP and his log in would be updated to show he planted the flag. You can\u0027t double-down on XP, but you did get credit for each thing you did. Fly by, orbit, land, plant the flag (not sure what EVA in space gets you).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-06T15:30:17Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2017 03:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Cpt Kerbalkrunch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NewtSoup","CreatedById":178829,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-06T15:43:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, thanks that\u0027s reassuring. \u00A0As long as they\u0027re at least getting dirt on their boots then they\u0027re fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
