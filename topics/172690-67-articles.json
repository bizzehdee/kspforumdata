Each company starts with a set amount of money (10 million, it doesn\u0027t matter what exactly) and designing a plane costs money, and bigger, more complicated planes will cost more. (Each type of plane will have a base cost, say 400k for a turboprop, plus maybe 12k per passenger and 5k per part count, so a typical turbo prop might be 800k-ish to design, a Smallie might be 1.1 mill and it goes up as the planes get bigger)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis does sound intriguing.

These rounds would last a predesignated time, say, on a weekly or bi-weekly basis, and reflect a specific need of KEA. For instance, we as the judges could designate an open order for a long thin airliner, with certain characteristics that are desirable and certain ones that are turn offs. We\u0027d set a budget and open submissions for a week, then close and judge them on an ongoing basis while submissions open for the next round, etc. This would limit entries flooding the challenge and also (I think) discourage poorly thought out designs.

If I were to reboot the challenge, I would split up various characteristics to be tested by each judge rather than sending an entire submission to be judged by a single judge. As long as each characteristic was consistently judged by the same person for a given round, it would practically eliminate any biases or just oddities from any judge. I think this should be based off of personal preference but if need be a randomizer could be used. For instance, I could judge an airliner\u0027s cruise and flight characteristics, while stardust judged take-off and landing performance, panzer the construction and efficiency, and so on and so forth. With this method each judge would score their particular category out of a given maximum, which would then be used to calculate the aircraft\u0027s overall score.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe that having a new spreadsheet per round would make the process much better (or at least a new page on a cumulative spreadsheet, perhaps).

As well, I liked the open approach to KEA that anyone could design anything for whatever class at whatever time, making the design process rather enjoyable to approach, as there wasn\u0027t any pressing need to \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E work on a design. You want to design a medium-sized jet? Go for it, it\u0027s not like there was a specific entry period for that class of aircraft.

And the entire design process was certainly educational through experimentation, and I\u0027d rather not reduce that effect by making the entry process more restrictive in terms of requiring a completely focused goal. In this scenario, I think it\u0027s more beneficial to encourage free experimentation instead of directing people to a specific design goal that they may meet better if they had gained experience in building other projects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s just me though.

I guess, my point is, the nature of this challenge is such that we\u0027re probably going to get the lesser designs one way or another, and it\u0027s just something we\u0027ll have to work through. Besides, they do provide interesting material to write the more entertaining reviews.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe judging system we were working on, if you recall. It was going along pretty swell, actually; we had most of the important scoring categories down (from aircraft range, control authority, ease of flying, comfort of ride, etc.). It\u0027s just that there was pushback for the idea of going through with it because the current KEA was still going at the time, so it would have been somewhat disruptive to suddenly have this value-based scoring system pop up. I think that the scoring sheet we were working on provides sufficient enough uniformity in actual feedback for performance in meeting the challenge\u0027s goals, maybe with the addition of easily accessible metrics such as size dimensions for some additional help in easily parsed value-based differentiation between aircraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Box of Stardust","CreatedById":112527,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-05T03:37:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223698800\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022172690\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221572700546\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022167612\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NightshineRecorralis\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 11/2/2019 at 9:15 AM, NightshineRecorralis said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also think the limits play well with time progression, as it is unlikely for a new company to immediately jump into building large airliners (except\u00A0Airbus, apparently, but that\u0027s not a fair comparison), and so I think not only should part counts be limited by the RnD cost but also what parts to be used.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSay for instance new companies are limited to low cost, low budget parts in the beginning and then would have to progress to newer, better parts.

That will probably require a deeper dive into the simulation side of things - how much demand is there between cities, fuel prices, maintenance costs, cost to buy vs lease,\u00A0company reputation, and more, but this is just a generalized overview.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I just want to address this in one of my own posts, primarily so I have my own reference regarding it, as well as my own suggestions on how we might be able to help streamline the submission-review process. Because the ideas in this are quite good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems to me that some of the most submitted classes to are the jumbos and supersonics. Not by a huge margin, but the queue is still larger for those two compared to the others. Supersonics especially, but this is, after all, Kerbal Space Program; I suppose that\u0027s to be expected. In terms of \u0022problematic\u0022 designs, those also seem to be generally spread around, but I expect will be more present in the two previously mentioned larger categories.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a good night for distractions and rambling, so here\u0027s my take on restrictions based on \u0022company progression\u0022:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirstly, maybe just disconnect from any initial pricing-related restrictions. Those could come afterwards, and it\u0027s already tacked onto the aircraft submission parameters anyways, and should also factor into a company\u0027s \u0022first impressions\u0022 in tandem with the actual aircraft\u0027s performance and quality (because someone could just come along with a relatively expensive turboprop \u003Cem\u003Ebut\u003C/em\u003E it\u0027s quite good and fair for the price).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn terms of submissions, a \u0022company\u0022 \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E start with light, small, or \u003Cem\u003Emaybe\u003C/em\u003E medium aircraft (possible as per Airbus). This puts them in a set of \u0022primary\u0022 review queues (per class, as we had before), which judges should aim to address and review in order of submission (or such). The idea behind this being that these smaller/more manageable aircraft are fairly easier to put a review out for, and in my opinion, somewhat more fun of an experience to fly around, thereby making it less of an ordeal for judges to review. It then therefore allows people to get their foot in the door a little faster if they can prove that their planes won\u0027t be something future judges will have to slog through.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs \u0022company\u0022 prominence raises, they can expand their \u0022market lineup\u0022 to the larger or more expensive/lucrative aircraft (supersonics, jumbos, even just general large airliners), and their submission allowances reflect this. Maintaining such reputation upholds their submission privileges (in a formal and meta sense). This \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E ensure that these classes of aircraft that can be somewhat more of an ordeal to review (heavier to handle and whatnot, finnicky flight characteristics, etc.) are generally reserved to \u0022companies\u0022 that are known to make reliably flying aircraft that won\u0027t be too much of a bother to undertake as a review and would provide an interesting, productive experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaking a poor impression imposes a sort of submission penalty that makes future aircraft less of a priority to review until they prove themselves able to build reliable aircraft, keeping the combination of \u0022not so productive aircraft of a tedious class to review\u0022 to a minimum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, anyone is still free to submit whatever they\u0027d like; they\u0027ll just be put in an according set of \u0022secondary\u0022 review queues. If someone wants to just build a supersonic or whatever, they still can. But they should be notified that they will be put in a secondary sort of queue that judges can select when they want to review it; it\u0027s not a priority or anything. So at least, the person is warned that they\u0027re not exactly following the bounds of the challenge, but their effort is still respected and, if presented attractively enough, may still perhaps get a judge to take interest and review it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeck, maybe we could still allow people to submit full-range catalogues, but only place the \u0022starter class\u0022 aircraft in the primary queues, and leave the rest in the secondary queues until further reviews deem a possible upgrade for those aircraft to the primary queues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it goes somewhat according to plan, we\u0027ll have a weirdly big backlog of turboprops, small airliners, and some medium liners, and then it should taper off as it gets into the bigger, more heftier aircraft. We could even have judges assigned to certain tiers/classes of aircraft, which could help onboard people looking to start judging. Like, \u0022Hey, you can start helping us judge by going through some of the turboprops!\u0022. Could also act as a bit of quality control for reviews, and ensure that the \u0022bigger\u0022 projects go to judges of higher tier that are known to be pretty good about posting interesting reviews.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRestrictions may need adjusting based on how popular general medium and simply large aircraft are, or even smaller business class-like jets. Though I guess it would be pretty simple to divide up the aircraft classes by \u0022starter company tier\u0022 and \u0022experienced company tier\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like how KEA inspires people to just build, and I don\u0027t want to take that creativity-inspiring aspect away from the thread. But we also need rules in place to ensure that the thread doesn\u0027t die off like it did, and so there needs to be a way to encourage people to actually play the challenge in a productive manner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is just reiterating the entire discussion that\u0027s been going on right now: the queue and review process needs to be manageable such that judges don\u0027t burn out quickly and also be easier for new judges to get in so that the challenge can continue along in a healthy manner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Or we can also take the route other various challenges have done that, by virtue of the challenge,\u00A0have taken the core\u00A0community that had formed and create a Discord server...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-11-05T04:39:31Z\u0022 title=\u002211/05/2019 04:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 5, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Box of Stardust\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzerknoef","CreatedById":90599,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-05T08:37:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree with pretty much everything \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/112527-box-of-stardust/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022112527\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/112527-box-of-stardust/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Box of Stardust\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0has said here. As much as I am a fan of a pricing system that could be integrated, it does seem to me like the first plane that is posted should not adhere to any of those rules. Think of every company as one that had massive amounts of economic support from all kinds of places leading up to their first plane. As he said as well, jumbos and supersonics were by far the most submitted classes. They are however as well the most tedious classes to judge since they take a long time to review.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would rather not see people submit entire catalogues of aircraft at once though, even if they would be split up between a primary and secondary queue. My opinion is that people should still be restricted by a hard cap on the amount of planes they can have pending. So if they want to upload a catalogue, let them do it in smaller pieces and it\u0027ll be fine.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would also like to keep the categories that we started out with in the challenge, the more we add, the more tedious reviewing is going to become, and that should always be prevented.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow on the topic of cabin rebalancing. I suggest we nerf the mk1 cabin down to 4 people, which will still make it the best price/passenger cabin out there by a fair margin, but it\u0027ll at least make it a lot more difficult to spam like before, giving other cabins a chance to actually be used properly. Mk2 can actually stay at 8 people for me, giving it a use other than added luxury. For size 1.5 I would suggest something like 16, size 2 can be 24 and size 3, 32. Oh, and then there\u0027s size 3S1 which should keep the 2 passengers that it can actually carry. Perhaps we should consider modding the cost of the mk1 cabin to about 1000 to keep it somewhat in line with the other cabins.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAaand, that\u0027s all I have to say for now...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
