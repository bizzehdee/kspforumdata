I want to show you how to design your own plane that flies how you want, so you can experiment and learn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t feel overwhelmed now, but the airplane we build/experiment on in this tutorial can be modified to fly in a 200km orbit and return to Kerbal Space Center.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EBACKGROUND (basics of aeronautics):\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was going to write an information topic about basic aeronautics because the ones I read were very simplistic. What I mean by that was there was little depth beyond \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cput your center of gravity in front of your center of lift.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 This IS an incredibly important tip. However, I kept seeing comments from people unable to design or fly their own aircraft for various reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, before I started writing I found \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52080-Basic-Aircraft-Design-Explained-Simply-With-Pictures\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis article \u0022Basic Aircraft Design\u0022\u003C/a\u003E, written by Keptin, and I think it is a very good starter. I tip my hat to the author for spending time making the illustrations and breaking the terms down. Do not feel like you have to fully grasp the concepts, as the point of this tutorial is to actually SEE how the different factors affect flying in stock Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeptin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s article covers these topics, in this order:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECenter of Mass (Is mentioned, but not described as he assumes you already know what this is.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECenter of Lift (and its relationship to Center of Mass)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECenter of Thrust (and its relationship to Center of Mass)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EControl Surfaces (Ailerons, Rudders, Canards/Elevators, Elevons)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWing Shape (High, Moderate, Low Aspect Ratios) and Wing Sweep\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWing Placement (High, Mid, Low Wing, Dihedral, Anhedral)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAngle of Attack\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding Gear (and effects on takeoff/landing angle of attack), landing gear width, overweight\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recommend you read Keptin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s article and have a very basic understanding of the above terms. You can either read his whole article and come back here, or read his article and mine at the same time. I decided to try and mirror my tutorial with his (with a few exceptions since we have to design). Also, I will not cover all of Keptin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s topics in this first tutorial. Some of the topics are pretty big, but if people want more, I will write another. Plus I found this tutorial became pretty long as it is (about 10 Microsoft Word pages without pictures). So if you want to shorten your reading in Keptin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s article, see my topics below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ETOPICS:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor easy reference, here\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s what you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll find below:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Section 1: Creating a Test Aircraft\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Section 2: Landing Gear Placement Basics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Section 3: Horizontal Center of Lift Design\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Section 4: Horizontal Center of Mass Design During Flight\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Section 5: Vertical Center of Lift Design \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 aka Wing Placement (High, Dihedral, Low, Anhedral)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, I believe this information will all be fairly basic and meant to be hands on.

So now it is time to put these three together into an aircraft that is reasonably stable so we can test out different designs. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m going to assume you know the basics of the Kerbal interface and how to find the parts, although if you haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t rotated and flipped parts in the Space Plane Hangar, I have included those keys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s build our airplane: (see the picture below for help)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Go to the Space Plane Hangar and start a new ship. (Select \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CNew\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 if you have any parts or previous ships up in the hangar to clear it out. You might also want to start a new save game if you are squeamish about killing your kerbals, as you will probably crash a few times.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Select the Mk1 cockpit, add two Mk1 fuselage sections and one TurboJet engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Turn on angle snap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Place one tail fin on the top of the rear fuselage, as far back as you can get it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Landing gear: Place one \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Csmall gear bay\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 on the underside of the nose so that the back edge of the gear lines up with the seam between the Mk-1 and the forward fuselage section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Place the rear gear (with symmetry on) on the underside of the rear fuselage section. Line it up so that the back edge of the gear bay lines up with the seam between the rear fuselage and the turbojet engine. Place the rear gear slightly up the sides of the fuselage. Make sure angle snap is on and you will have to rotate the gear 45 degrees [shift-Q, nine times]. Ensure the gear points straight down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Turn on the Center of Gravity (yellow \u0026amp; black bubble) and the Center of Lift (blue \u0026amp; black bubble) indicators.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) Select the Delta wing, turn on symmetry, and mount the wings in the middle of the fuselage side. Align the center of lift (blue \u0026amp; black) bubble just behind the center of gravity (yellow \u0026amp; black) bubble. You can use the little \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cspikes\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 that stick out of the side of the blue lift bubble to help with alignment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9) Attach a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CStandard Control Surface\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 to the back edge of the wing, with symmetry on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10) Add \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CXM-G50 Radial Air Intakes\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, with symmetry on, and align the intake\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s connecting point with the flame symbol near the back end of the airplane fuselage (left side).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11) Give it a name and save if you want to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall it should look like this\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JXKto5p.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022JXKto5p.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wjSHw2u.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022wjSHw2u.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vndaGSv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vndaGSv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo Fly \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 But wait! Before you actually go fly I want to describe what we will do. We will use the same basic profile for takeoff and flying the plane. That way the changes we make during the tutorial will be a bit more obvious, and the results repeatable. Read through this next part before you do your first takeoff. Here\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s our procedure\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Rotate the camera around to a comfortable viewing angle. Personally, I like a view that allows me to see the control surfaces and landing gear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Ignite the engines [space Bar], run the throttle up [shift] to full power, then activate the SAS [T].\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) At 120 m/s, pull the nose into the air \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003E (or pull back on your joystick) to get the nose a few degrees up. Holding 5 to 10 degrees nose high is fine.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003E4) After the aircraft climbs away from the runway, retract the landing gear [G].\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003E5) Continue to accelerate till you reach around 160 m/s. Pull the nose into the air again [s, or Joystick] and try to get it straight up. Work hard to get the dot in the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153V\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 right on the straight vertical dot.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003E6) When you reach around 2000 m, push forward [W] till you get the nose back to the horizon.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003E7) Turn off the SAS [T] and see what happens.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EThis is where our generic procedure will end. Feel free to play with and fly the airplane around more after this point. However, this flight profile will serve as a baseline for my comments on aircraft reactions you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re looking for (listed as \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CTest Report\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2) in each tutorial section.

We will discuss why that is in the next section (if you haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t figured it out already). Go ahead and run off the end of the runway and make sure you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re still pulling back. The aircraft will fly away easily and is controllable all the way up. The nose sort of bounces a little during the pull, but it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not too hard to pull the nose up and push it back down. SAS off, it flies about the same except it doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t snap to a stop during rolls and pulls. Depending on your exact placement, it might want to pitch slowly forward.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EThis will be our starter aircraft for Section 2.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003ESection 2: Landing Gear Placement Basics\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding gear placement is one of the basic considerations for your takeoff roll. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not going to delve into all the types of landing gear or problems in this tutorial (maybe on another tutorial) because I want to focus on small aircraft aero basics. However, this basic tricycle gear can cause problems leading to wasted aerodynamic tweaks that can mess up airborne performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, one way to fix the takeoff of our basic airplane is to put on canards, or we could tip the wings up. However, we can adjust the landing gear first without increasing part count (and weight and drag) and without changing the airborne aircraft characteristics\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s rotate the landing gear around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Select the rear landing gear (make sure symmetry is on) and reset the rotations you did earlier (Press [space]).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Rotate the gear so the wheels are on the front of the gear bay instead of in back (Press [D, 2 times]).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Now, rotate the gear 45 degrees down like earlier [shift \u002B Q, 9 times] and attach to the rear fuselage with the back end of the landing gear again lined up with the seam between the TurboJet engine and the rear fuselage. This leaves the center of gravity unchanged, but moves the wheels very far forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7L5BDqn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00227L5BDqn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo Fly!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETest Report: Oh no! What happened? The aircraft tips back on its tail because the wheels are so far forward. That\u0027s okay, go ahead and activate the engine and take off anyway to watch what happens. Wait to activate the SAS until after the nose wheel is back on the ground. At 120 m/s, rotate the nose off the ground. You\u0027ll find it takes very little to get the nose up, and the aircraft is very stable after that. The rest of the profile looks like it did before. So we fixed the rotation problem (sort of) without changing flight performance or part count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously starting out with an airplane tipped up and the engine on the ground isn\u0027t ideal. So let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s refine this a little.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Go back to the hangar and select the gear, undo rotations, and rotate it back down 45 degrees (remember: symmetry on, [space] to reset, [shift \u002B Q] to rotate). Except this time when you align the gear on the rear fuselage, place it so that about 1/3 of the gear bay is in front of the Center of Gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Adjust the wings so the center of the Center of Lift bubble is aligned with the back end of the Center of Gravity bubble. (The bubble will move some, it\u0027s okay.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KWgQWkK.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KWgQWkK.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo Fly!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETest Report: The aircraft takes a little more to pull it off the ground than when the wheels were flipped around, but it also doesn\u0027t sit on the engine. The rest of the flight profile is unaffected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo ahead and play with gear placement more if you want. Also note that even though the landing gear moves the Center of Mass bubble in the SPH, it doesn\u0027t actually change the flight characteristics. Despite having weight and drag in the SPH, the landing gear currently have no effect on in flight mechanics (KSP v0.23). This isn\u0027t too big of a deal with most aircraft, but if you\u0027re working on touchy stability with strange airplanes, it might be important. Because of this, you may want to consider adding the landing gear last during construction so that it doesn\u0027t throw off the Center of Mass bubble when placing the Center of Lift. I will possibly cover more landing gear in another tutorial if people want it. Personally I\u0027m a fan of having the gear all swing forward when they retract, but you can place them in either direction. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ll use this most recent configuration as our baseline airplane for the next sections. You might want to save a copy to save you time later after making modifications. (By the way, this configuration is capable of flying up to about 64km if you let it keep going straight up.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003ESection 3: Horizontal Center of Lift Design\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so when talking about Center of Lift, what\u0027s actually important in basic design is the relationship between the location of the Center of Lift, and the location of the Center of Mass (at least for now...). So what we\u0027re going to do move the Center of Lift around a bit in relation to the Center of Mass (horizontally) and see how the airplane flies. We will discuss vertical changes in Center of Lift in a later section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.1 Center of Lift Aft of Center of Mass (Positive Stability, or Stable)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is how we\u0027ve been flying the plane around up to this point, with the blue lift bubble behind the yellow mass bubble. Now we\u0027re going to move it much further back and see how it handles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModifications:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Grab the wings and slide them aft just so there is a slight gap between the blue lift bubble and the yellow mass bubble. (Blue bubble closer to the engine than the yellow.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xY5OAwi.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022xY5OAwi.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow go fly!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETest Report: The airplane is a little harder to takeoff than it was before and the nose is slower to get up and down. It still flies pretty smooth though, and I find it a little easier to fine tune the straight up part. If you paid attention to the altitudes during pull up and pull down, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll see it takes more room to turn. This is kind of important to note: SAS off, the airplane wants to pitch down slowly. If you design your airplane with the Center of Lift too far back, the SAS might not be able to compensate and the aircraft will slowly pitch over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.2 Center of Lift with the Center of Mass (Neutral Stability)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModifications:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Grab the wings and slide them forward so the blue lift line is coming out of the top center of the yellow mass bubble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/llLA8kq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022llLA8kq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo Fly!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETest Report: The airplane lifts off the ground really easily. The nose is quick to get toward straight up and is still a little \u0022bouncy.\u0022 If you manage to get really aggressive with the pull up (or your Center of Lift is a little too far forward), the airplane might go out of control a bit. SAS off, the plane might want to pitch up or down a bit depending on your exact Center of Lift placement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdvantages here are that the plane is a lot more responsive. However, it sits on the edge of being out of control. Bear in mind that the Center of Mass will shift during flight (aft for this airplane), so if you start out neutrally stable on takeoff, you may end up unstable during flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.3 Center of Lift forward of the Center of Mass (Negative Stability, or Unstable)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnstable during flight you say?! Let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s try that out too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModifications:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Grab your wings and slide that lift bubble forward so that there is a slight gap between the blue lift bubble and the yellow mass bubble.

(Or try to anyway.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETest Report: How was that liftoff? This thing is flyable if you know how, but you can see how much work it is and how easy it goes out of control. Usually you don\u0027t want an airplane like this for (hopefully) obvious reasons. It\u0027s actually kind of fun to watch it fly around. The SAS actually does a lot of work here trying to make the airplane stable. If you manage to not crash for a while, turn the SAS off and see how it goes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to play around with a negatively stable airplane, adjust the Center of Lift so that it is only slightly forward of the Center of Mass (blue bubble inside the yellow bubble, but forward of center). You can slide that around a bit and see that an airplane with a forward Center of Lift is flyable but takes some work. It\u0027s sometimes easier to get the airplane under control without the SAS, then turn it back on when you\u0027re nearly flying right again. This might give you some confidence if you find yourself in a bad situation and you can rely on some piloting skill to save it without abandoning or reverting right away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.4 Revert the airplane to the baseline from the start of this section. This means putting the center of the Center of Lift bubble at the back edge of the Center of Mass bubble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ozcSawS.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ozcSawS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003ESection 4: Center of Mass Design During Flight\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so now that we know a bit about the relationship between the Center of Lift and Center of Mass, how can we affect this during flight? Well, for our basic airplane, the Center of Lift isn\u0027t going to move around but the Center of Mass will because of fuel burn (and maybe because you leave or pickup a payload in orbit). For now, we\u0027ll just talk about planning a Center of Mass change due to burning fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.1 Center of Mass due to Fuel Burn for our basic airplane (horizontal Center of Mass)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we saw in Section 3, the airplane is most unstable when the Center of Mass is at the most aft position. So in this section we will adjust fuels to simulate the change in Center of Mass during flight. In this way we can find out if our aircraft will end up neutrally stable (Section 3.2) or unstable (Section 3.3). Then we can design the airplane to have the desired stability and maneuverability at all times in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn our basic airplane, normal Kerbal fuel feeding will use fuel from front to back. Let\u0027s see if we can figure out when the Center of Mass will be furthest aft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModifications:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Right click on the front fuselage tank and run it completely empty by clicking and dragging the green bar down to zero. Watch how the Center of Mass yellow bubble moves aft, toward the engine. It will also move slightly down, but let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not worry about that for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Now right click on the rear fuselage tank and run it completely empty. Watch the yellow bubble. It should move forward (and slightly down).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the Center of Mass is furthest aft when the forward fuselage tank is empty, and the rear one is full.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Refill the rear fuselage tank and make sure the forward fuselage tank is empty. Notice how the center of the blue bubble is still behind the center of the yellow bubble (although it is now inside the yellow bubble).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/M4vY0Qd.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022M4vY0Qd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo Fly! Note: If your plane tips back on the tail, see if you can think how to fix it. (Hint: Think about Section 2: Landing Gear. This is part of the iterative process of designing.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETest Report: The plane is fairly maneuverable but still controllable at the most aft fuel condition. Not much else to say here other than, if your plane tips back on the engine and you didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t figure it out, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll need to move the landing gear slightly back. (With the fuel cut in half, this configuration is capable of flying up to about 85km if you let it keep going straight up. Recall when fully loaded it was about 64km, a 33% increase.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: Make sure you refill the forward fuselage tank when you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re done!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003ESection 5: Vertical Center of Lift Design \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 aka Wing Placement (High, Dihedral, Low, Anhedral)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVertically moving the Center of Lift can be caused by two basic design choices. If you recall Keptin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s discussion of vertical wing placement (high, mid, or low) and wing up/down angle (also known as dihedral and anhedral), these affect an aircraft\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s stability similar to having a forward/aft Center of Lift. In the case of our basic airplane, we have been flying with the delta wing mounted mid fuselage, so the Center of Lift has been (nearly) at the same vertical height as the Center of Mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoving the Center of Lift above Center of Mass (High Wing and Dihedral) tends to stabilize an aircraft. Moving the Center of Lift below Center of Mass (Low Wing and Anhedral) tends to destabilize an aircraft. Realize the concepts of wing placement and dihedral/anhedral are two different concepts, and we will explore both.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.1 High Wing \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Center of Lift Above the Center of Mass (Positive Stability)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHigh wings tend to stabilize an airplane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModifications:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Grab the wings (symmetry and angle snap on) and place the wing root 30 degrees above the fuselage center line and angle the wings so they are back to level [shift-Q, 6 times].

Strangely, I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really like it on a space plane (maybe because it isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t the classic shape). If you place the wing slightly high, you can give them anhedral and it will still be reasonably stable (looks like a Harrier). If you place the wings low and give them dihedral, it looks more like a space plane (to me anyway).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry this and see how it flies: Move the wings down from the midpoint one angle snap (15 degrees) and give them dihedral [shift \u002B E, 4 times]. Align the back edge of the blue lift bubble at the back edge of the yellow mass bubble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ESUMMARY:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you have fun with this basic plane. It isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t much, but I think it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s effective for playing and learning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlacement of the Center of Lift with respect to the Center of Mass is a big design crux of your airplane. Generally speaking, you DO want the Center of Lift behind your Center of Mass. However, you need not be afraid of having it neutral if you know what you want. Hopefully I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve given you a bit of hands on knowledge and courage to try out different designs. Don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t forget to consider fuel burn in your design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe design choice of high/low/mid wing and dihedral/anhedral/neutral wings is really up to you. Just like the Center of Lift/Mass, it depends on how you want your airplane to fly and what you want it to do. You can also combine these in various options to get the look you want, but with stability. If you have a hard time flying a plane, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll probably want it more stable. If you find flying airplanes easy, then you can opt for a more maneuverable design. Realize the aircraft reacts differently as you get fast and higher up in altitude. And for space planes, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll need good controllability and stability as you leave/reenter the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you guys want, I can continue the tutorial to explain how design and test this thing to get into orbit with only two more parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-13T01:58:34Z\u0022 title=\u002201/13/2014 01:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded landing gear mass/drag note.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BigFatStupidHead","CreatedById":44217,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-11T22:44:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery nice tutorial; I\u0027m certain this will help a lot of people.
