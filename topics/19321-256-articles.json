I can see why that would be a problem. I\u0027ve posted on AlphaAsh\u0027s thread as well, so I\u0027ll see what he says. I hope it can get sorted, because the two mod concepts do really lend themselves to being combined.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zzz","CreatedById":63211,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-24T01:42:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AetherGoddess\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AetherGoddess\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethe space shuttle didn\u0027t really fly during reentry, it\u0027s reentry configuration was basically the large flat underside with balanced forces. it fell with style. once the atmosphere was thick enough and speeds slow enough, it started to fly, but that was well into the atmosphere.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI not said it necessary fly or how ot called, but it object of aerodynamic and gravitational forces anyway, I asked how it made it.
