The problem that has occured is that the front tanks will always empty first making the aircraft backside heavy, resulting in it to be harder to steer. I tried connecting the rear tanks to the front ones, with separate fuel lines, to try and burn the fuel away equally but that just won\u0027t happen. Any suggestions? Is this how it\u0027s supposed to be or am I doing something wrong? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T01:55:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/qqvcdx9yloh9plm/Fuel_Line.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDownload Here for the example\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to the fuel line limit length....You might want to stack it to 5x2 rows, instead of 10x1 row.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrUberGr","CreatedById":78026,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T06:13:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBut then I won\u0027t have the length I want... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, I messed up the answered/unanswered.

It will stay balanced (if a little heavier) at the beginning because at the start it has more mass equally distributed along the length of the plane. Then as you fly, you can decouple the mass from the rear as you need meaning that although there is more fuel in the back, it isn\u0027t heavier because you\u0027re shedding the added mass from it. Basically the plane starts off heavier but can be kept balanced as you use your fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-27T01:42:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice, beautiful plane.
