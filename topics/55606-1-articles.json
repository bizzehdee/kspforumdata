Unfortunately, the normal \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV to GSO is over 1,750m/s, and would eat up all the satellite stationkeeping propellant doing the plane change. That would be bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead, they push apogee to 130,000km with the plane change there, plus they do 2 apogee burns and 2 perigee burns, which drops the \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV to 1,473m/s. That\u0027s nice, but it caused other problems:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* First, the transfer orbit was far longer than ever before (11-14 days) so they had to deal with battery life on the satellite so it\u0027d live that long.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Second, they had to get 2 Earth attitude sensor passes per orbit, except they couldn\u0027t use the sensor below 25,000km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Third, they\u0027d never used the sensor over 100,000km before, and didn\u0027t know if it\u0027d handle that small of an Earth disk or if it\u0027d be accurate enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* They\u0027d also never used the telemetry/command links that far out either. Plus, at various satellite attitudes, the antennae couldn\u0027t see the Earth at this altitude, so there was long outages, and they had to design the satellite so if things crapped out during an outage, it would survive to the next telemetry/command pass, AND there\u0027s only one ground station with the proper antenna to communicate with the satellite and all the burns have to be seen from that station to be commanded. (and you thought Remote-Tech was a b*tch!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Then, at this altitude, orbit determination is more difficult and you have to be a lot more precise. Those magic orbit numbers from MechJeb don\u0027t come for free!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* As if this isn\u0027t enough, they have to avoid certain launch times to avoid long battery-draining eclipses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* They have to calculate Lunar effects since they\u0027re 1/3rd of the way to the Moon, and they have to avoid yet more launch times so the Moon doesn\u0027t drop the perigee into the ocean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The satellite has to end up in GSO at 322.5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 East without hitting any other comsat on the way in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWHEW. DAMN.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s interesting that the launch got favorable winds which resulted in saving 45lbs of propellant, and they retargeted the launch orbit inclination in real-time from 26.9\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 to 25.7\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 to take advantage of it - and you thought Eve launches had to deal with razor-thin margins!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s also interesting that they give the range/azimuth/elevation data graphs and explain how they did orbit determination. They found out that tracking SSTO wasn\u0027t that much harder than GTO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey did have to upgrade their computer to do the trajectory firing solutions to a VAX 4000/90, and still had to make burn calculation runs of over an hour. They computed errors and margins down to 54 grams of propellant, and the final orbit had an eccentricity of 2.5x10e-4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery impressive for 1994...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-09T03:15:45Z\u0022 title=\u002212/09/2013 03:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by GeneCash\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerBlammo!","CreatedById":63139,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T09:07:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s all rather gob-smacking, thanks for posting!
