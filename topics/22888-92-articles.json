ASRBs (IIRC) had much less segments, but were never used (though they might be for SLS), and SRMUs were shipped in just 3 segments, but having a single-segment booster of that size would be a handling nightmare.\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, liquid rockets fail in much more benign ways than SRBs. Liquid engines can be cut off, you can have multiple engines feeding from one tank (meaning engine-out capability is possible) and many of them can be re-started if needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SRBs used on the Challenger were separate segments held together by O-rings, which were never tested.

What happened was the ship sat on the launchpad with the o-rings compressed the temp dropped below 32 degrees causing the o-rings to shrink and became incapable of filling the gaps. Simply put the cold caused the o-rings to lose their elasticity. This cause a hole to burn through the srb and then through the external fuel tank like a welder. Causing a catastrophic failure of the entire spacecraft. Because of a hectic schedule that had the ship launching faster than it was supposed to Mission Control chose to ignore the warnings that the o-rings might fail if the temp drop below 32 degrees. So politics and oversight is what caused the challenger disaster.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
