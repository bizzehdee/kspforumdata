You need to gather science and start off by looking through an observatory (new building) and try to look for planets or moons near kerbin. (Mun, Minimus) Once found on the telescope the planets will appear on the map. At that point you need to send rockets to the mun or minimus. Once there your kerbal on EVA mode can look through their telescope and find the NEAREST planet/moon. The observatory would have a stronger telescope, this is why. Then you need to keep gathering science and continue to expand. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sun, kerbin and possibly the mun start already on the map. Everything else will need to be discovered, the observatory will need to be unlocked with science (50 maybe) then you can begin use. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease give me critique and stuff!
