But if you would actually want to perform military missions outside of earth\u0027s orbit you are very limited anyway. What is the use of a system that has a deployment time of years or months at best for the most basic capabilities? Long duration miliary operations also tends to damage or destroy assets and if the replacement and resuply (materials/ammo) has to be planned months ahead it\u0027s easyer to just destroy the enemy launch facilties instead of a combat in deep space.
