My lift rockets weren\u0027t able to get to orbit when they could in 1.0.0, but \u0022equivalent\u0022 rockets in 0.90 had much smaller carrying capacities, so essentially the effort needed to get to space isn\u0027t really more after all.

You can\u0027t see where that is in the editor, but it seems to generally be roughly in the middle of the ship. Thus rockets that drain their fuel from the top are doomed unless they have some pretty powerful fins. But rockets that drain their fuel from the \u003Cem\u003Ebottom\u003C/em\u003E have a much easier time of things, or in other words, you have to block fuel flow to the engines and then run a fuel duct to them from the top of the ship.

Have most of the parachutes clustered around the empty center of mass (in rockets this is often surprisingly close to the bottom), and one or more pairs of parachutes at the far end, with the pairs on opposite sides of the rocket so it stays aerodynamically balanced, but NOT bound by symmetry. On one side, set them to open with the rest of the parachutes, e.g. at 500m, and on the other, have them wait until 50m. When the parachutes go off, the \u0022center of parachutes\u0022 will be off to one side of the rocket due to one side opening first, and the rocket will tip sideways. When the second group opens, the rocket will start to straighten out, but there won\u0027t (hopefully) be enough time for it to right itself all the way before landing. Thus on landing it will find itself tilted, and thanks to the improvements in 1.0 parachute behavior, the parachutes near the top of the rocket will stay open and guide it to a gentle repose.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T13:36:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 01:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by parameciumkid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rithsom","CreatedById":114646,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T13:39:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t see anything wrong with the 1.0 aerodynamics.

If you pitch is a bit to weak you end up flattening out much higher than nessesary and you loose a lot more to gravity losses.

Anyway, real life rockets never deviate far from the prograde vector during atmospheric flight, because they do not have the structural integrity to survive the aerodynamic stresses this create.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EI was wondering how much impact that would make, using separate fuel and oxidizer tanks. Would the fuel:oxidizer mass ratio also affect it? KSP uses a nearly 1:1 fuel-ox mass ratio, whereas I believe in real rockets the oxidizer is a few times more massive than the fuel.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T15:06:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just tried a gravity turn that was pretty efficient both in FAR and in 1.0, in 1.0.2 and then launched the same rocket to 10km, cranked it hard 45, and then followed my old 0.90 gravity turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe old 0.90 gravity turn saved me about 50m/s \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: This was with as aerodynamic a rocket as you can make in the early tiers.
