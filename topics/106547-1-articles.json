As soon as KSP indicates that a Kerbal can climb for example onto a wing, it happens that the Kerbal just makes \\*poof\\*. This is possibly related to the fact that if a Kerbal is standing slightly under a wing, he or she collides with it, bounces back, and the forces built up to a level that is basically killing it."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T01:22:48Z","Content":"In that case, can you share the craft file?
