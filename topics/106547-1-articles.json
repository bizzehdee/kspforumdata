It is difficult to make a screenshot of the problem. As soon as KSP indicates that a Kerbal can climb for example onto a wing, it happens that the Kerbal just makes *poof*. This is possibly related to the fact that if a Kerbal is standing slightly under a wing, he or she collides with it, bounces back, and the forces built up to a level that is basically killing it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T01:22:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn that case, can you share the craft file?
