So, that said, my idea is to just have a nuke, 2-ish tanks of jet fuel, a pod, RCS and SAS, and a docking port. What more do I need to add to get rid of the heat, since, as I said I don\u0027t remember radiators working very well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-13T22:10:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESlap a radiator on, they magically suck up heat.
