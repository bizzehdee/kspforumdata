Thank you for making it. This is my first time using it but I\u0027m no stranger to KSP (3 khr)\n\nShort form: Struggling to match Cryo Engine to the right fuel tanks.\n\nA quick/bug Im having is getting a match between engine and a cryo fuel tank. I have the mods \u0022Cyrogenic Engines\u0022 and \u0022Cyrogenic Tanks\u0022 installed. There is host of other mods so perhaps one is conflicting. Could also be Im missing something on the how to use the two mods. The most likely mod interference, if it is, is \u0022Interstellar Fuel Switch\u0022 with its \u0022Interstellar Fuel Switch Core\u0022 or \u0022Modular Fuel Tanks\u0022.\n\nIf I use a (vanilla?) Rockomax x32 I can choose a matching Lqd Hydrogen and Oxidizer fuel combo (12,723/848). That fuel tank doesn\u0027t appear to have the boil off code associated. So I\u0027d be getting that wonderful \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E without the trade off of needing active electric cooling.\n\nIf I use a Cyrogenic Tank such as CT2501 it only holds one fuel type. So that would be the Liquid Hydrogen. Now I need an Oxidizer only tank to provide the mix. Cycling through the tank types for CT2501 there is a Lqd Oxygen but not an Oxidizer. Oxidizer doesn\u0027t need cryo freeze so I get that. \n\nIf I attach a Rockomax x32 I can zero out its normal 720 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E and keep the 880 Oxidizer.

I assume this only provides new tank types for PP to select.\n- Fuel switchers do different things\n    - The configurations supplied with CryoTanks modify the stock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E tanks only, and lets you change them to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E, O, LH2, and LH2O.\n    - Last time I checked, IFS core makes all sorts of changes to some subset of tanks to make them switchable to something.\n    - MFT is the whole deal which I think lets you switch whatever with whatever.\n\nWhat do I recommend? Obviously use the bundled stuff in the mod package (B9PartSwitch with CryoTanks). If you use MFT/IFS, there will probably be some conflicts as different mods try to target the stock tanks. However, if you just use PP \u002B CryoTanks, there should be no incompatibilities - CT will handle the fuel switching on the stock tanks, and PP will do its own thing."},{"CreatedByName":"Nertea","CreatedById":83952,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-03T00:22:03Z","Content":"**Cryogenic Engines 0.4.6**\n\n- Updated bundled B9PartSwitch to 1.7.1\n- Updated CRP to 0.6.6\n- Updated AVC link\n- Added description to VL-1 Volcano\n- Fixed incorrect naming of normal maps for 3.75m engines\n- Fixed a boiloff issue that could occur when switching ships that were close to each other"},{"CreatedByName":"Wyzard","CreatedById":162363,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-07T03:25:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 2/28/2017 at 8:44 PM, dingdong said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E sorry for asking but i kinda dont see the merit of LH2 in stock. its just way too less dense for any reasonable use,even considering the impressive isp of  nuke engines...as the density for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E is way more superior , i kinda end up using stock parts only.
