You teach a class with this book and the errors lead to a terrible class and bad teaching evaluations?

For the most part, publishers of these myriad sorts of intellectual property seem (by and large) to try to adhere to ethical and conscientious guidelines that reflect the spirit of their enterprise rather than simply some legally binding specifics. For example, patches for computer games; it is amazing really that so many developers and publishers spend so much time and effort to try to correct the errors that exist in their initial releases. Perhaps they are still not achieving the standards of some other industries. For example I have no idea whether publishers of say, engineering textbooks are obsessed with making sure they have zero errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this to say: lets be reasonable about what we expect game developers to provide us with for the cost of a visit to a cinema and a cheap dinner for two.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Levelord","CreatedById":57711,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-22T16:44:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DisarmingBaton5\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DisarmingBaton5\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E^^This.

The public at large, even gamers, have no idea how time consuming and nerve-racking software development can be. You really put your heart and soul into not only the software, but the vision that drives its development. A developer works all day (and often night) to create something that appears magical. Every iteration of the software will reduce bugs, but seems to create others as it grows. This is true even for the best and the brightest out there. There are just too many variables (literally) that can interfere with the software you are creating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven though I sit here and run (execute) the software I have created up, down, sideways, etc., and think I have seen every scenario to possibly generate a bug. Usually no less than a day after launch, an end user will discover a bug that never presented itself during development. Often a result of a different platform environment than the developer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore the developer should not be the the person testing the software. Since they built it, they know every button to be pushed to make it work. We need to leave testing to those that have never seen the software and have no idea how to use it in the present.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy point overall is that WE are the alpha/beta testers and need to do the developers a service. Sure we \u0022paid\u0022 (EXTREMELY cheap entertainment) for the game but with the understanding that the software is not finished. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing on the other side of the fence at work, it is actually somewhat painful when you have put a LOT of effort into a project that does amazing things, and when one relatively small bug is discovered the users will claim your software sucks, you suck, etc. It ruins my day and dissuades me from providing services to the people that complain about a petty issue that can be easily and quickly resolved. Even if I figure out the problem and fix it the same day, some users are already skeptical and now want it to break so they have an avenue to complain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd in my case, people WANT the software to break. I work in an office. If the software breaks, or network goes down, they are off the hook to work and get to sit around and drink coffee, and talk about how crappy things are. It makes them feel better IMO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDont get me wrong though, the majority of people are appreciative of the work we do. It is the few rotten apples that spoil the bunch, and it really brings us down mentally and even physically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to wrap up my rant: hug your local software developer, they want to do good. We DO want to know about the bugs (but hope for none). If you are not satisfied with the software, remember to appreciate the great things it does and present the bad parts in a productive light so it can get fixed. Otherwise your programmer may not show up for work the next day. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHANK YOU SQUAD for years of a few little bugs \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-22T18:09:44Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2013 06:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by roosterr\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"joppiesaus","CreatedById":57698,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-22T18:00:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not just about to be good to our developers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s about be good to everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a big problem on the internet for some people.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t just turn of your powers computer when you see bad words about you.(sorta force, \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diche Bach","CreatedById":76097,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-22T18:07:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cartz\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cartz\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027d say in a lot of your examples you\u0027re discussing the content of a functioning product.
