But I wonder how much of it is still self-inflicted, and coiuld be mitigated with a little additional work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake ASAS for example. Its algorithm seems to be a very straightforward logic: if I\u0027ve drifted off-center in the \u002Bx direction, then try to push in the -x direction until I\u0027m no longer off-center. The problem is that it\u0027ll be pushing at full speed the whole way back to the origin, which means I\u0027ll cross the zero point with a large -x velocity, taking me far from the origin in the other direction, which\u0027ll again require a large correction back. Effectively, it\u0027s attempting to match position but not velocity. It\u0027s especially bad if you\u0027re using RCS, since it\u0027ll be trying to use full RCS thrust to correct for tiny variations in orientation. A similar problem applies to engine gimbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what if the internal math were fixed, to where the system tried to zero out deviations in both position AND velocity simultaneously? What if ASAS was designed to reduce rotations as it corrected, to where it hit the origin with zero rotational velocity, and therefore no need to see-saw back and forth? (That is, far from the locked angle it puts as much rotation in as possible, but as you get closer it attempts to reduce the velocity by thrusting the OPPOSITE direction so that rotational velocity approaches zero as you reach the right orientation.) A variable-thrust RCS jet would help with this, but it\u0027s not really necessary as long as the ASAS is smarter about knowing when/if to turn off the jets. Small perturbations can be corrected through flywheels, no need to fire the RCS, but right now turning RCS on means the ship will always use them at full strength whenever it needs to make any change in orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr consider the node rigidity issue. Maybe it\u0027s not worth the effort to try getting the Unity people to recode their physics engine to avoid the issue. But consider the possible workarounds; we already know that struts solve the issue, and the Quantum Strut mod allows for dynamic addition of struts in-flight, albeit with some part count/power issues. So there\u0027s no need to have everything require large numbers of permanent struts to stay stable, since there\u0027s nothing stopping the game from creating its own pseudo-struts internally. Imagine if the HubMax connector, or similar parts, could dynamically create invisible, strong \u0022struts\u0022 to pull its connected parts back together if the connected joints began to break. No graphical workload, no symmetry issues requiring multiple struts to bond two tanks together, and it\u0027d solve many of our disintegrating crafts if used correctly. Stations would no longer need nearly as many struts to stay stable, since their central connecting nodes would have this functionality built-in. (A pancake-shaped \u0022super glue\u0022 part, using similar logic, would help as well for holding multiple tanks together in vertical rocket stacks.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point is, these things can be improved without waiting for Unity to get its act together.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-28T22:32:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree on the pseudo-strut point, it should work around the issue and I believe an attempt was made to do this with a plugin by DEADBEEF a while back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EASAS is badly in need of an overhaul and has been for some time, though it has also been suggested that it might be replaced completely with another system to stabilize our craft, with the main issue of the ASAS being it\u0027s inability to adapt for different size rockets, it\u0027s really a one-size-fits-nobody issue at the mo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing back to the wobble though, I was told by another member ages ago that Unity offers several different types of node, and that there is a pivoting note that can be set to have zero movement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis node is supposedly more rigid when set to zero than the rigid nodes, but I have no means to test this, I can\u0027t run Unity so maybe someone who can will be able to do some tests?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad should be able to address most if not all the issues we have given time, it\u0027s a precious resource though \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E And they did work around the radial attachment issue rather than wait for a fix from Unity, as again it was Squad making Unity do things it wasn\u0027t intended to do, and waiting for a fix for an unsupported feature was not feasible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TouhouTorpedo","CreatedById":30603,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-28T22:36:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Anglave\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Anglave\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI also feel it\u0027s important we remember that the game is in alpha, we\u0027re all volunteer testers, and major game-breaking bugs aren\u0027t unexpected. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELate as I am to this thread, this particular post did strike a nerve with me.

Kerbal Space Program is very different. Space travel is space travel. There are things that are going to be in it no matter what, things that would be awesome to have in it, and things that would be nice to have in it. We are kinda reaching the point of the second sentence here. KSP has every essential thing in place already; launching, planets, moons on those planets, docking, roving, probes, and reentry (rudimentary) etc. It is having some very cool but unnecessary things too: Airplanes, spaceplanes, harvesting of resources, scanning of planets, etc. And it even has, or is going to have completely unnecessary things: Kerbals with animations, Planet side bases, cities, dynamic clouds and weather, Iternal Vehicle Activity, Extravehicular Activity, flag planting, easter eggs up the nose, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne can see from this that KSP direction, drive, and purpose. It is focused. I know that Harv saw this game completed before he even wrote his first piece of code.
