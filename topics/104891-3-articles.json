It depends greatly on how dense the air your are moving though is. So the speed limit increases with altitude. I cant wait to see how high the atmosphere goes in 1.0 streams...."},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T15:47:05Z","Content":"This... will be the longest 2 more days of my life."},{"CreatedByName":"2001kraft","CreatedById":120475,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T18:25:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This... will be the longest 2 more days of my life.\n\nThey\u0027re streaming 1.0 soon.

Useful after landing to reduce the landing run. A few planes have spoilers designed more to produce yaw for steering.\n\nAirbrakes: drag-producing devices, usually on the fuselage, that can be used in flight.\n\nFlaps: on the trailing edge of a wing, increasing wing-camber, producing extra lift and drag. Good for landing, not good for take-off.\n\nSlats: extending panels on the leading edge of the wing that control airflow, reduce the stall-speed.\n\nFlaps and slats are pre-WW2 inventions, and were used by planes such as the Fieseler Storch and the Westland Lysander to allow landing in very small spaces because of the reduction of minimum flying speed.\n\nThe jet engine didn\u0027t respond quickly to throttle changes, and it was possible to use all these devices to create easily removable drag so that if a landing had to be aborted the engines were already generating enough thrust. Generally, as planes got more streamlined it became necessary to add some extra drag to give better landing behaviour. Otherwise the relationship between angle-of-attack, airspeed, power, and descent rate gets into frightening territory. Planes, remember, are built to be flown by ordinary pilots.
