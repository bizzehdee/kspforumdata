I am not sure I am a big fan of this, but it is something that could be considered. One could percieve a tracking station on earth using multiple dishes to recieve or send a faint signal (just like they do with radio telescopes), or maybe some last ditch effort of a probe to reestablish contact with Kerbin or a command centre, maybe even programming the probe to display this behavior when contact is lost (like the deploying-antennae-behavior mentioned before).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/files/2011/07/Radio_Telescope11.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022Radio_Telescope11.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JDP","CreatedById":30775,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T17:12:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022King Jareth\u0022 data-cite=\u0022King Jareth\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs there any advantage of the smaller \u0027fixed\u0027 dish over the small deployable one?

I\u0027m having an issue with some satellites I sent to Mun. Their dishes are activated and targeting satellites near Kerbal that are targeting them back, but they are out of contact. I\u0027m wondering if the craft is not recognizing the dish. Basically, I\u0027m using the probe sized ASAS module at the top and have two satellite dishes attached on the corners. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA previous satellite I used worked fine but on that one the satellite dish was attached along the side of the craft.

This isn\u0027t really a RemoteTech question, just a general one. I never know exactly how long to schedule the burn. When I set up the maneuver node, it gives me the HH:MM:SS of when the burn should take place, but often says NA on the time.

All my probe cores and the default dish and antennae work like they would in vanilla. Seeing as about 90% of my comms network uses those parts, this is a slight problem for me. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly the compatibility pack will need to be ported over to account for the new folder structures.
