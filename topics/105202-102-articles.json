I\u0027ve been talking to Bill Kerman and he explained to me why they behave like this in lack of supplies: Kerbals don\u0027t need supplies, their organism can survive forever without any income. However, they just love them. Those supplies are just candy, icecream, chips and snickers. They eat it like the blue fellow of Sesame Street (don\u0027t know his name in English): nothing goes in, they just chew them and everything fall back from their mouth in an awful mess they call mulch.\n\nNow, Kerbals love to be in space but when they sign for the Space Program, although they do it for free, they include in their contract they can\u0027t be more than 15 days without supplies. If those days are done, if the player (as employer) doesn\u0027t fullfil the contract, they as employees refuse to work.\n\nI told to Bill it seemed reasonable, but there are times when their life is in danger an could be saved only by pushing a button. He just laugh and said \u0022We are a much more advanced civilization than yours and have alredy demonstrated scientificly the existance of heaven and, anyway... a contract is a contract\u0022.\n\nLately Kerbal have become more fussy and now they demand accomodations and vacations. What is going to be next? Money? When I was young a Kerbal could be stranded in a pod for centuries without a complain!!"},{"CreatedByName":"Bishop149","CreatedById":82368,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-26T15:04:02Z","Content":"Just a note, the first screw up I made with under supplying and a Kerb going on strike was Valentina.\n\nI just re-read the front page, she should be immune, no?\n\nAt time I just assumed orange suit meant only the three originals."},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpsp","CreatedById":113874,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-26T15:24:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 18 minutes ago, Bishop149 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Just a note, the first screw up I made with under supplying and a Kerb going on strike was Valentina.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I just re-read the front page, she should be immune, no?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E At time I just assumed orange suit meant only the three originals.\n\u003E \n\nYou are better off reading patch notes and/or checking configs when you start playing.
