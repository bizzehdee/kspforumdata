Doing that requires a lot of dV, and aerocapture is difficult without burning up. But Jool has a couple of moons (Laythe and Tylo) that are very massive and well-suited to gravity maneuvers. You can use one of them for a reverse gravity assist to slow down and capture to Jool. Big savings, and not very difficult to set up.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIf you have a ship orbiting Mun or Minmus and want to go interplanetary (e.g. go from Mun orbit to Duna or somewhere). In this case, you get more bang for your buck if you use a Kerbin slingshot: that is, instead of launching directly from Mun (or Minmus) to your destination, you instead drop down to low Pe over Kerbin and do your thrusting there.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the Kerbin system is really not well set up to get gravity-assist benefits; it\u0027s just too finicky and difficult.
