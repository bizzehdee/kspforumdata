I\u0027ve orbited the Mun, and I\u0027ve unlocked just a couple of the 45-science nodes.\n\nMy mission control seems to list around 4 tourism at any time. I have two big problems with these:\n\n1. I haven\u0027t yet unlocked any reasonable way of putting more than one kerbal in a craft. All I have are the 1-man capsule and the pointy 1-man cockpit.\n\n2. They don\u0027t pay well enough to justify their costs. The reward for doing a Minmus flyby is nowhere near the cost of the rocket that would be required.\n\nI\u0027d like to see these pay more and maybe not unlock until I have either a multi-man capsule or at least the in-line cockpit or lander can."},{"CreatedByName":"Snooze","CreatedById":67712,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T18:21:01Z","Content":"Came here to say exactly this.

Works pretty well so far. As for cost--I\u0027m thinking the best method would be to take tourists on a flight you\u0027re planning to do anyway. Want to go to Minmus to gather science? Work in an extra capsule or two and bring a tourist."},{"CreatedByName":"Jarin","CreatedById":71395,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T19:51:50Z","Content":"I\u0027ve had no problem building early-game craft to deliver tourists to orbit (three pods/tanks in parallel)... but these contracts really do pay out horribly.

They were designed to be folded in with other missions as a fairly casual early game source of funds. Each tourist does not need to go on the same vessel, and more than one pod can fit on a vessel.\n\nThe tourism contracts are one of the highest paying contracts, but this comes with a few caveats. The funds of tourism contracts scales dramatically with what the tourist is requesting and how many tourists there are in the tour. You get partial credit at each destination, but indeed, this is not meant to be a large amount. The bulk of the reward is given when you complete the tourist\u0027s itinerary by recovering him back on Kerbin. The tours are intentionally designed this way to heavily encourage keeping the tourists safe."},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T20:43:59Z","Content":"I think the tourism contracts aren\u0027t really worth enough to do the missions just for tourism. The best way to use them, I think, is as an extra source of profit by sticking a tourist onto a mission you were already going to do anyway.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Agreed. \n\u003E The ones with 4 kerbals wanting to go to different bodies (between the group) is also not worth the risk/reward.
