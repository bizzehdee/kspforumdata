Also there is a secret society calling themselves \u0027Keep Kerbals On Kerbin society\u0027 or K.O.K. for short they are trying to hinder the efforts of the Kerbalnaughts to get into space. \n\nThe first video has been made and I am currently planning episode 2 which will be about getting Kerbal\u0027s into orbit, the start will be rockets exploding and a Kerbal comes up with the idea to use explosive decoupling to reduce weight to get a rocket into orbit.\n\nIf you want to check out episode 1 for what I have so far here it is: [http://youtu.be/gg4cRKt_Rvg](https://youtu.be/gg4cRKt_Rvg)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/gg4cRKt_Rvg?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nThere is a button in the video to skip commentary to the show part of video if you want.\n\nLet me know your ideas, they must have the brilliance of Kerbals while keeping their funny derpiness.\n\nCheers,\n\nMark.\n\nHere is a list of the cast I have created (Names generated by game)\n\n**Crashed and stranded on Duna**\n\n**Bill** - Head of Tactical science team \n\n**Doodmon** - Scientist of Tactical science team \n\n**Ludwell** - Idiot of Tactical science team \n\n**Astronaut complex**\n\n**Jeb** - Pilot and Kerbalnaught trainer\n\n**Bob** - Well you know him as well\n\n**Mission Control**\n\n**Desdun** - Head traffic controller \n\n**Sidwise** - Assistant\n\n**R\u002BD**\n\n**Sheldon** - Head scientist\n\n**Archibald** - Assistant\n\n**Administration building**\n\n**Altrey** - KSC Administrator\n\n**Design Engineering Rocket People or VAB**\n\n**Mundorf** - Chief engineer\n\n**Sidson** - Assistant\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-28T09:20:41Z\u0022 title=\u002202/28/2015 09:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Orb8Ter**\n  \nAdded video"}]}
