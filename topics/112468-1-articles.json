After I touchdown, I must EVA and go through the painstaking process of trying to click each parachute to repack everything. I\u0027d much rather EVA, get in range, press \u00221\u0022 then be done with it. I\u0027ve searched high and low looking someone else that\u0027s had this problem and decided to fix it by enabling the \u0022Repack Chute\u0022 button in the VAB\u0027s Action Group tab. However, it seems I\u0027m somewhat alone in my desire. Stock, the only two Action Group options are Deploy and Cut.\n\nI\u0027m open to all suggestions as hopefully this thread can be referenced by future users that might not want the exact same solution that I do."},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T15:04:40Z","Content":"Well, repacking chutes can only be done with an Engineer, so sadly no.

There\u0027s no way to apply action groups to EVA activities.\n\nWould be cool if they\u0027d make EVA so that you could alt-click to select multiple things at once (e.g. the way you can do with fuel tanks so you can transfer stuff). But alas."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T19:25:12Z","Content":"Ahh, I see what you are asking for here.\n\nI haven\u0027t tried doing as you ask in my fixes (enabling the \u0022Pack Chute\u0022 as an action group), but I think that without further programming, it wouldn\u0027t work as currently set up. Since (as mentioned above) action groups apply to the vessel. And the \u0022Repack Chute\u0022 option is actually attached to the chute, although marked as available for EVA usage (which allows the right-click menu to be accessible when EVA).\n\nSo the way the stock code is written, I don\u0027t think one could simply \u0022unlock\u0022 the action group and it would be ready to use. There would be some other work involved, namely attaching the functionality to an EVA kerbal which looks through nearby parts and repacks chutes that are close enough.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T19:39:58Z","Content":"Scientists just harvesting every nearby experiment would be another application..."},{"CreatedByName":"Elix","CreatedById":135044,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T19:52:01Z","Content":"Ah, yes. I see what you mean about Repack being a function of the EVA Kerbal. Looking less and less like an easy fix.\n\nPerhaps a wise modder could make it a vessel-based hotkey that first checks for an engineer before executing...in the same way ForScience can harvest science, but will only run single-use containers (Goo/Jr) if a scientist is on board to \u0022Reset\u0022 those experiements.\n\nExample A:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/qPQlYaM57xI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T21:17:51Z","Content":"It might be more convenient to use fewer chutes (maybe airbrakes in place of some but not all) coupled with a powered landing for final decent.\n\nA single cute has significant effect on terminal velocity. Most craft have low double digit terminal velocities with one chute. Air brakes are not as powerful as chutes, but they can be freely deployed and retracted (and are more heat resistant deployed)\n\nWith such high drag, you don\u0027t need much thrust to have a safe landing velocity (.6-.8 TWR is about right) and the slow fall speed makes timing a suicide burn easy and the dV for one small. You also save on takeoff mass which is a big plus.\n\nThe single cute thing also helps for passive landers. Open one chute higher (400-600 m on Kerbin) and you will be going slow enough to safely open the rest later than normal (50 m on Kerbin). All my passive Kerbin recovery craft have a minimal group of chutes set to .45 atm \u002B 500 m and the rest for .50 atm \u002B 50 m. (If you have reentry effects below 8 km you have bigger issues that chutes burning up) You can even stage it at 30 km on accent with your fairings so you don\u0027t forget! That system hasn\u0027t failed me yet.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T21:22:35Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 09:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ajburges**"}]}
