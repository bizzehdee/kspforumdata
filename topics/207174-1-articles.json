I\u0027ll start. Long ago, the solar system now known as Kerbol was complete. It had everything someone could want. The sun god, Kerbol, the moon god, Mun, the uncle god, Minmus, and the annoying aunt god, The Kraken, all decided that there should be life in that seemingly perfect system. Since Kerbol was always so bright and cheery, everyone decided to name the new species after her. They called them, the kerbals. A new kerbal was born every time a star died in the universe. The star\u0027s spirit and name would belong to its new body, a kerbal. The many gods frolicked in the cosmos as they watched the kerbals break new boundaries, and even touch the gods themselves, by landing on them. The kerbals, however, still had many more galaxies to explore...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SSTO Crasher","CreatedById":215483,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-18T14:48:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebadiah Kerman\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe beginning of Jebs story begins with tragedy, as his mother died when he was 2 due to kerbalpox, he did not have anything else to do and he was bullied in school for his personality. So he dove deep into his studies. Having mastered college level sciences by age 7. Through his studies and his obsession with \u003Cem\u003EH\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003Euman Space Program\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ehe started developing a talent for flight. He became famous when he was just 11 when he was on of private flight from Kiami to Kuba for vacation. Jeb was in the cabin talking to the pilots about flight and they were astounded by how much he knew. The plane lost pressure very high up and both pilots were knocked out. Jeb managed to reach the oxygen mask just in time. He repressured the plane and flew around dangerous terrain before landing vertically. He was broadcasted all over kerbin and gained the attention of the Kerbal Air Force . When jeb was 18 he joined the \u00A0KAF. He became known as the best pilot they had. By the end of that year he had 80 confirmed air to air victories. At the same time jeb was recruited another kerbal named Valentina Kerman joined the KAF. The 2 created a relationship as they were the best pilots in the force and they were very similar. Jeb and Val were married 2 years later. Around that same time a Kerbal named Gene was putting together a space program and needed pilots. Jeb and Val were recruited immediately. The twins Bill and Bob, some of jebs oldest friends from school, were chosen to be engineer and scientist. Jeb flew many missions, and finally, at long last, he was selected to be the first kerbal to go to the Mun\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Abel Military Services","CreatedById":219257,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-18T23:52:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina Kerman\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal was borned in a normal pilot family in KSSR.

He had been separated from his two brothers, Lemburry and Thompberry (Yes, the one from Emiko Station) but a kind man named Wernher Von Kerman found him on the streets of Kologne, Kermany. Wernher raised Linus with deep affection and started to notice how intelligent he was. Around the time Linus was 8, the 3rd Keich had gained power and the Kazi\u0027s started invading other countries. The Kazi\u0027s evicted Wernher and Linus and forced them to work for them. While developing planes for the Kazi\u0027s, they secretly made plans for something they called a rocket. At the end of the war, they heard that the Kazi\u0027s, led by Kitler, had trapped the Allies. They quickly built their prototype, the K2, and launched it at the Kazi army. They both became famous after that, allowing his brothers and cousin, Valentina, to find them. Valentina informed them of a new project called the KSP. All of the friends then were accepted in the KSP. Within 2 months, Linus and Wernher became well-known and Wernher was appointed Chief Engineer and the engineer representative for staff meetings, while Linus became the Chief scientist and experimental engineer. He also represented the R\u0026amp;D department in staff meetings. Much later, during the War Against Thompberry Kerman, Linus agreed to adopt Thompberry\u0027s consciousness. This led to both living in one body, with them both being able to switch willingly. The person in control of the body\u0027s movement, vision, and hearing were all accesible to the person who was not in control, allowing them to communicate to the one in control. Linus continued to develop new tech for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, when eventually it was time to set sights on further distances. As the old \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E was turned into a musuem, they prepared to move to a new location: Kape Kanaveral, and set their sights on other stars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
