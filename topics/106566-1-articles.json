If we imagine a Titanium sphere 1 meter in radius, and 6 centimeters thick, it has a cross-sectional area of 0.1885 m^2. That means it should be capable of withstanding a force of slightly greater than that it would experience on the surface of Venus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGranted, there are probably much better material choices. Aerogels, etc would probably be better, considering their low weight and high yield strength. Furthermore, a latticework of cross-beams could probably further strengthen the structure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the prop blades, they aren\u0027t hollow, so the dynamic pressure when they aren\u0027t moving is zero. I.e. They would not be even slightly problematic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the structure, it would have a not insignificant mass of about 3.34 tonnes. While this may sound like a lot, let\u0027s not forget that the contents of such a vehicle probably weigh in at 4 tonnes anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically, we have to double the mass of our vehicle if we use Titanium for crush-resistance. That isn\u0027t actually very problematic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s say we sent down a 100-tonne rocket. All we need is an extra 100 tonnes of hull-strengthening in order to protect it from the pressure. Bonus: That much hull strengthening allows for heat resistance and acid resistance to be trivial matters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd again, we don\u0027t need to put the armoring back in orbit from Venus. Just send it up from Earth and ditch it on Venus.

After aerocapture at Venus, the mission adopts a strategy reminiscent of the Apollo manned missions to the Moon. A propulsive plane change and aerobraking put the spacecraft into a circular equatorial orbit. A lander separates from the orbiter and descends to the surface to collect a sample, which is placed in a sample carrier at the tip of a three-stage Venus ascent vehicle (VAV). A variety of passive thermal and pressure protection techniques are used to protect the landed hardware and the VAV during a rapid descent and 90-minute stay on the surface. The lander inflates a balloon which carries the VAV with the sample to a high altitude (60 km - 70 km) in a few hours, from whence the VAV puts the sample carrier into orbit around Venus. Then the orbiter which brought the lander to Venus uses a beacon on the sample carrier and its own telescopes to rendezvous with the sample carrier. After transferring the sample into an Earth entry vehicle (EEV) on board, the orbiter deploys solar arrays to power a solar electric propulsion (SEP) system which is used to spiral out from Venus and travel back to Earth, taking two and a half years in total for the return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Venus Surface Sample Return: A Weighty High-Pressure Challenge\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20010003946.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20010003946.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s another concept somewhere that proposes a balloon-carried probe thats \u0022hops\u0022 across the surface.
