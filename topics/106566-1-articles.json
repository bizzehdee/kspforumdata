Surely it wouldn\u0027t take much to get off the ground on Venus.\n\nThen once we get to high altitude, we ditch the heat/acid-shielding and the propeller and burn to orbit just like we would on Earth. We\u0027d only need like 7 km/s or so. That\u0027s well within the realm of practicality.\n\nIs there anything obviously wrong with this idea? I realize it obviously requires beefy acid-resistant heat shielding, good insulation, and the mother of all AC units to land on Venus, but besides that, is there anything I\u0027m overlooking with the whole \u0022use props to fly back to cloudtop\u0022 idea?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T13:56:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 01:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pds314**"},{"CreatedByName":"xenomorph555","CreatedById":103080,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T14:02:06Z","Content":"No just stop, the manned Venus landing dream is impossible and any idea, including this one, is full of flaws.

Two examples would be that the pressure instantly break your helicopter, the lander would have to be super reinforced and ultra heavy, basically impossible to fly. There are too many flaws to go over.\n\nI never said it had to be manned, but pressure-wise, it is more than doable.\n\nRemember, there are diving suits meant to withstand 800 meters. That\u0027s 90% of the pressure on Venus.\n\nAdditionally, the lander doesn\u0027t have to fly using rocket thrust. All it need do is get thrown at Venus along with an orbital module, deorbit, etc.\n\nTitanium has a Yield Strength of 800,000,000 N/m^2. If we imagine a Titanium sphere 1 meter in radius, and 6 centimeters thick, it has a cross-sectional area of 0.1885 m^2. That means it should be capable of withstanding a force of slightly greater than that it would experience on the surface of Venus.\n\nGranted, there are probably much better material choices. Aerogels, etc would probably be better, considering their low weight and high yield strength. Furthermore, a latticework of cross-beams could probably further strengthen the structure.\n\nAs for the prop blades, they aren\u0027t hollow, so the dynamic pressure when they aren\u0027t moving is zero. I.e. They would not be even slightly problematic.\n\nAs for the structure, it would have a not insignificant mass of about 3.34 tonnes. While this may sound like a lot, let\u0027s not forget that the contents of such a vehicle probably weigh in at 4 tonnes anyway.\n\nSo basically, we have to double the mass of our vehicle if we use Titanium for crush-resistance. That isn\u0027t actually very problematic.\n\nLet\u0027s say we sent down a 100-tonne rocket. All we need is an extra 100 tonnes of hull-strengthening in order to protect it from the pressure. Bonus: That much hull strengthening allows for heat resistance and acid resistance to be trivial matters.\n\nAnd again, we don\u0027t need to put the armoring back in orbit from Venus. Just send it up from Earth and ditch it on Venus. It would only double the cost of landing compared to if Venus had an atmosphere or 2 worth of pressure, as far as I see."},{"CreatedByName":"cryogen","CreatedById":134454,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T14:48:28Z","Content":"You could use balloons instead! They\u0027re much simpler and probably lighter. One JPL study proposes a teflon-coated Zylon balloon to lift a sample-return probe, and a three-stage solid rocket, from the surface to high altitude:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Mission overview \n\u003E A single launch with a medium-to-large expendable launch vehicle (in the Delta IV M\u002B class) suffices to launch the spacecraft on a ballistic transfer to Venus, where it will spend a year before beginning the return journey to Earth. After aerocapture at Venus, the mission adopts a strategy reminiscent of the Apollo manned missions to the Moon. A propulsive plane change and aerobraking put the spacecraft into a circular equatorial orbit. A lander separates from the orbiter and descends to the surface to collect a sample, which is placed in a sample carrier at the tip of a three-stage Venus ascent vehicle (VAV). A variety of passive thermal and pressure protection techniques are used to protect the landed hardware and the VAV during a rapid descent and 90-minute stay on the surface. The lander inflates a balloon which carries the VAV with the sample to a high altitude (60 km - 70 km) in a few hours, from whence the VAV puts the sample carrier into orbit around Venus. Then the orbiter which brought the lander to Venus uses a beacon on the sample carrier and its own telescopes to rendezvous with the sample carrier. After transferring the sample into an Earth entry vehicle (EEV) on board, the orbiter deploys solar arrays to power a solar electric propulsion (SEP) system which is used to spiral out from Venus and travel back to Earth, taking two and a half years in total for the return.\n\n\u0022Venus Surface Sample Return: A Weighty High-Pressure Challenge\u0022\n\n[http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20010003946.pdf](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20010003946.pdf)\n\nThere\u0027s another concept somewhere that proposes a balloon-carried probe thats \u0022hops\u0022 across the surface. Which gives you new options for thermal management, since you\u0027re at the surface for only minutes at a time, and can cool off at higher altitude.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T14:50:58Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 02:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cryogen**"},{"CreatedByName":"Pds314","CreatedById":70014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T15:11:40Z","Content":"As for the prop....\n\nIf our lander (shield-included) has a diameter of 6 meters (and masses 200 tonnes) and our folding prop is 10 meters in radius after deployment, we have a disk loading of about 637 kg/m^2. On Venus, this means we need the exhaust velocity of the prop to be around 10 m/s for takeoff. In order to go to an altitude of 50 km, where the pressure is 1 Bar, the atmosphere density is about 1.9 kg/m^3 and the temperature is 75 C, it would need to reach an exhaust velocity of about 55 m/s. While it may indeed be difficult to reach such altitudes, let\u0027s not forget that the disk loading of such things as the F-35B, which works at 10% higher gravity at 5000 kg/m^2.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You could use balloons instead!

A lighter than air vehicle may be a better idea, because the helicopter would consume more energy to reach 50km altitude to launch your rocket from there.\n\nBut the vehicle needs to have variable bouyancy and able to resist a higher difference of pressure and temperature..\n\nIt will be easier to use 2 lighter than air vehicle, for example one for 30km to 50 km, and another one to 0km - 30 km.
