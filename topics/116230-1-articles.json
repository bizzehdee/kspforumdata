Rover Expedition missions generate for as many rovers as you have, but I left the deployment missions only on rover-less places because it seems like exploring new places would be a scientific priority, as well as more interesting and fun for the player than having 10 rovers on the same planet. I really wanted to avoid sending rovers to a place and then abandoning them or returning them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour second point is one I started with, but the only way I can think to make that happen would be to mandate a specific waypoint. I didn\u0027t want to tie anyone\u0027s hands as to deployment location. For instance, people playing with Life Support mods may want a manned rover, but that would only be practical if they deployed it near an existing base. I also didn\u0027t want to do something like \u0022check for four wheels\u0022 because that would stifle people\u0027s creativity to make RCS Hover Rovers or something creative like that. I don\u0027t want to offend anyone that self-identifies as rover-kin!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI welcome ideas on how to do that without restricting the landing location. For now, I think of the situation of landing a damaged rover like the Chinese YuTu rover. They landed it, it didn\u0027t work right. It was still a great accomplishment and they did good research at the site, but they weren\u0027t able to take any rover expedition missions like they had hoped. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nightingale\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nightingale\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAwesome stuff, congrats on the release!

Arsonide had great rover missions in the Fine Print mod back in the day. I don\u0027t know why those didn\u0027t get translated over to stock like everything else did. The \u0022survey\u0022 missions are supposed to fill that gap, but always mix up stuff like \u0022higher than 18,000m\u0022 that make them inappropriate for a rover. The one improvement I am proud of, though, is in the ability to get the missions for existing rovers. I always hated the feeling of rovers being a one-off to play around with and then get abandoned.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BigFatStupidHead","CreatedById":44217,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T04:10:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Whyren\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Whyren\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso give me feedback on the distances. I did my testing on Kerbin (bad idea) but I think actual rover missions should take 10/20/30 minutes (depending on prestige).
