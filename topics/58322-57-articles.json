I cannot find it. Yes I have read the guide on the cannons. However the shots seem to go right through things at close range, and no sights mean that I cannot hit squat at ranges \u0026gt; 400m. If we had the RNG mechanics available, we could maybe tweak them to out own liking?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a minimum range, this had to be imposed because of self inflicting wounds but this shouldn\u0027t really affect gun usage much. I can hit other targets at ~50m no problem. IRL you\u0027re not having vehicle to vehicle combat under 50m, not in most cases anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a few ways a projectile gets terminated. 1) it runs out of time... all rounds have timers because it would be very wasteful to allow thousands of bullets to proceed at relatively low velocity, or much past a range that would be accurate. 2) Minimum velocity, rounds that fall below 50m/s are destroyed, simply because they have little chance at that speed of penetrating, and like #1, having potentially thousands of ineffective projectiles lingering around isn\u0027t going to make anyone\u0027s computer very happy. 3) the projectile collides something other than a projectile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think most light projectiles have timers of 4 seconds. At 780\u002B m/s this gives them a ballpark range of ~2.5km or so, depending on what the velocity is over the course of it\u0027s flight. They aren\u0027t going to be very effective past 2km, again depending on their initial velocity and penetration power.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-02T22:56:06Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2014 10:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by InfiniteDice\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ryanedward","CreatedById":103837,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-03T00:33:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh ok... but my problem is that I am engaging at ranges from \u0026lt; 50m to 150m, it is natural for me to do so because of certain tank games I play *cough WOT cough*, but I wish it was easier to simply edit the projectiles themselves to suit individual needs.
