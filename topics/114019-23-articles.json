This time, I decided to make it a bit more unique. The purpose of the run was for the distance record in the \u0022Engine failure on takeoff challenge,\u0022 and I decided to kill 2 birds with 1 stone by attempting to get the lowest recorded aerial circumnavigation. In essence, my requirements were to shut off one of my 2 basic jets on takeoff, deal with the asymmetrical thrust, and then circumnavigate Kerbin while never flying above 1000 meters.\n\nThe aircraft involved in the challenge, the NAM-6B, was named the \u0022Conquerer.\u0022 Linalla Kerman and Arma Kerman were selected as the pilots for the mission.\n\nThe route I took (roughly) is shown below:\n\n![6JLRFool.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/6JLRFool.jpg)\n\nHere are the many pictures of the aircraft in flight and on takeoff, so you can specifically see what happened:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

View full album](//imgur.com/a/JY14c)\n\nThis third album is compromised of 6 screenshots of the F3 menu. Whenever I would quick-load the game after crashing my plane (or accidentally going over 1000 meters), the F3 log would reset. Fortunately, I discovered this while trying to land my NAFA-4-J2 on a mountaintop, and had drafted up a solution by the time I got to this flight. Every time I would quick-save, I would take a screenshot of the F3 log. If I wound up crashing the aircraft on accident (happened 4 times), or went over 1000 meters by accident (happened once), I would be able to quick-load the game while having all of the F3 data from the previous parts of the journey saved in a screenshot.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

The below F3 log is what the final F3 log would\u0027ve looked like if I hadn\u0027t quick-loaded at all during the flight.\n\nFlight Achievements:\n\nTotal Mission Time: 1 day, 1 hour, 47 mins, 6 secs.\n\nHighest Altitude Achieved: 897m\n\nHighest Speed Achieved: 172 m/s\n\nHighest Speed over Land: 175 m/s\n\nGround Distance Covered: 4,452,725m\n\nTotal Distance Travelled: 4,454,042\n\nMaximum Gee Force Endured: 9.9G\n\nYes, my maximum altitude was only 897 meters. I didn\u0027t even fly over 900 meters. This flight was extremely close to the ground.\n\nWhat is also kind of impressive is that this flight was only less than 10 minutes slower than my personal time record, but flew another 450 kilometers further (Which was likely due to the weaving around terrain I had to do combined with the asymmetric thrust veering the aircraft to the left)."},{"CreatedByName":"nicky4096","CreatedById":128125,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-21T05:53:27Z","Content":"nicely done noname.\n\nanyway, sadly my plane was too unstable to properly land, as well as having too much fuel, too much lift, and full monoprop. also, no parachute ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nbut here\u0027s a \u0027demo\u0027 anyway:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
