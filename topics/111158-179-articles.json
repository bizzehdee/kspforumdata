There are moderators on the team who have been *\u003Cu\u003Einvited\u003C/u\u003E* and joined, and there others who have *\u003Cu\u003Eapplied\u003C/u\u003E* and joined.\n\nBoth approaches have advantages and disadvantages.  When you take an application from someone, you know they \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ewant to be a moderator\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E, which is both good and bad:\n\n- Good, because it means they\u0027re enthusiastic and motivated and are likely to \u0022show up for work\u0022 (this is a volunteer job, after all; it\u0027s not like we punch a clock).\n- Bad, because it can raise questions about real motivations-- in particular, some people are motivated by a \u0022power trip\u0022 and are actually seeking *\u003Cu\u003Eauthority over people\u003C/u\u003E*, and we sure as heck don\u0027t want anyone like *\u003Cu\u003Ethat\u003C/u\u003E* as a moderator.  Can you imagine the damage that a power-motivated moderator could do?\n\nAnd sending out an invitation is the converse of that.  On the one hand, we\u0027re reasonably sure the person isn\u0027t a power-tripping type if *\u003Cu\u003Ewe\u003C/u\u003E* ask *\u003Cu\u003Ethem\u003C/u\u003E*... on the other hand, there\u0027s the risk that they might not be as motivated to moderate (after all, it\u0027s a time-consuming, thankless job) and could end up not pulling their weight.\n\nSo, both ways can work, and both ways have their pluses and minuses.  The common factor in both cases is that we\u0027re not going to make someone a moderator (either by invitation or application) unless they have a long, well-established track record on the forum and have *\u003Cu\u003Edemonstrated\u003C/u\u003E* that they\u0027re unflappable and temperamentally suitable, as well as being motivated to help folks.\n\nIn my own case, it happened to be an invitation.

About two weeks later, I had heard from someone (I cannot identify) that the moderation team was looking for ~~fresh meat~~ new people to recruit for vacancies open on the moderation team. So, I sent a PM of interest to Vanamonde and wasn\u0027t really surprised when it didn\u0027t work for numerous reasons at that exact time. I didn\u0027t think anything else of it; out of sight, out of mind.\n\nA few weeks later, Vanamonde sent me a private message asking me was I still interested in being a moderator. I gladly accepted the offer and here we are!\n\nIn the past, I made jokes about being a moderator and even got very upset at a forum member who accused me of trying to become a moderator. I joked around about it because I thought with my record of 2.2b violations (see my signature image), I\u0027d *never* be approached to be a moderator. So, I found other ways to contribute to the community.\n\nSure, I may have joked about becoming a moderator in the past, but they were just that - jokes. Even now, when I have to put on my moderator hat, I get a little nervous. I don\u0027t want to make a mistake or do something which will become harmful or toxic to the forum community or the moderation team.\n\nWill I ever be 100% comfortable being a moderator? I hope not.
