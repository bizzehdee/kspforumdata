need a lot of it, and its still only good for close in point defense. your ship might get better acceleration if you jettison your pdc ammo. that doesnt work in the expanse because the humans are ultimately what limit the acceleration, not the mass of the ship and its ammo stores. so if torch ships in your setting are not quite capable of breaking 1g, then dumping ammo and hauling tail might be a useful evasion tactic.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthere are other weapons on the drawing board. like the metalstorm gun that can hit a million rounds a minute, in

weapon would only fire a burst and would probibly take a long time to reload. traditional gatling based ciws do have the advantage of being able to fire continuously, the feed systems are the real selling point. however this weapon is not limited to firing in bursts and it can dial in its rate of fire to the operator\u0027s requirements. by the time of the expanse such weaponry should be ubiquitous. rounds are stacked in the barrel and each can be fired multiple times, but i cant imagine it being as easy as a gatling to reload and would be more subject to jamming. still in a space setting ditching the heavy ammunition will help your acceleration and high velocity plasma pdcs i think would be a good option. the \u0022ammo\u0022 comes out of the same tank that fuels your torch drive, and you already have some kind of fusion power plant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nrail guns kind of also give you a better damage to ammo mass ratio, as much of the energy comes from the reactor. you only need big dumb slugs and no propellant or casings and each one does more damage than many times its weight in conventional ammo. plasma ciws for defence with railguns for attack might be the better way to do things. save the slug throwers for ground pounders. i think missiles are still the go to for long range combat. i think they would be more like icbms and less like the cute little torpedoes they use in the expanse, possibly with its own ciws to make it hard to intercept with other missiles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMetalstorm put the rounds after each other and fire them electric, think of an tube magazine who is also the chamber. Downside is that this will get long and heavy fast. As for reloading it would be like loading an long and skinny round I think and its not really designed to reload during an engagement.\u00A0 Now this is not an totally new idea a few flintlocks used the same tricks for 2-4 shots and and a row of flint lock hammers down the barrel.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nYes it was an danger of setting off the next charge so you designed for that.
