Alshain\u0027s got the particulars for you, though I generally find that the 100% atmospheric efficiency part is achieved when the TWR is in the 2.2 to 2.3 range; at 1.5 the efficiency is inevitably less than 100%, meaning delta-V losses to gravity. I also try to keep the Apoapsis around 45 seconds ahead past 10,000 meters myself, and I generally don\u0027t turn from straight up until I\u0027m at that level (due to how Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere works - folks regularly call it \u0022pea soup\u0022 down in the troposphere).

Not 1.0 on the pad, 1.0 at 30km. MechJeb fails when I let it try with that rocket. It pushes the AP to about 70km, falls back to about 68km, and then pushes the AP on the far side of the orbit. Doing it manually, I move my AP from about 60km at 30km, and slowly keep pushing it higher so that my circularization burn is only about 6dV. My PE has come up to about 50km before I hit AP, and my dV remaining is more than when I let MJ do it\u0027s thing.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I said, at 30KM, you don\u0027t need full throttle. #5 says to watch the time to apoapsis, not the TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EdFred","CreatedById":108599,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-17T22:07:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELike I said, at 30KM, you don\u0027t need full throttle. #5 says to watch the time to apoapsis, not the TWR.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd what if your AP never gets out of the atmosphere?
