Yes, *damaging* any panel if they are wired in series would break the circuit. But by merely not receiving sunlight a panel doesn\u0027t start acting as isolator. Plus series wiring means specifically that every single element of the circuit has the same influence on the rest of the circuit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, wouldn\u0027t it be silly if a single bird dropping could disable three meters of a solar panel, just because it splattered on the one special cell?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T01:28:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would guess it probably has more to do with the fact that KSP only calculates shadowing at the part\u0027s root, rather than over multiple points. I didn\u0027t confirm that is how it\u0027s done, but based on what I know of other parts I am fuessing this is the case.
