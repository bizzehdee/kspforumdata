Yes, \\*damaging\\* any panel if they are wired in series would break the circuit. But by merely not receiving sunlight a panel doesn\u0027t start acting as isolator. Plus series wiring means specifically that every single element of the circuit has the same influence on the rest of the circuit.\n\nBesides, wouldn\u0027t it be silly if a single bird dropping could disable three meters of a solar panel, just because it splattered on the one special cell?"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T01:28:14Z","Content":"I would guess it probably has more to do with the fact that KSP only calculates shadowing at the part\u0027s root, rather than over multiple points. I didn\u0027t confirm that is how it\u0027s done, but based on what I know of other parts I am fuessing this is the case. So yes, this will likely lead to exactly what you describe.\n\nThe alternative is casting multiple rays or testing multiple points. Probably feasible for low count craft, but adds up. Idk if this will get addressed, but it\u0027s the first time I recall this specific complaint. Probably something to keep an eye out for, but I can\u0027t recall having this problem myself for arrays that pop out of cargo bays.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T20:23:05Z","Content":"One more alternative is picking data back from the graphics engine and checking how much of the panel is actually lit up by the Sun - skip separate physics calculations, use the lighting rendering algorithm which is active at all times."},{"CreatedByName":"Skalou","CreatedById":133496,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T22:21:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Solar panels in real life are composed of an array of individual photovoltaic cells wired in *series* (like Christmas tree lights).
