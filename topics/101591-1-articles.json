Space Transportation System wasn\u0027t a very good name either, but it got the stylish moniker *Space Shuttle*. \u0022Shuttle\u0022 just rolls off the tongue better than Es-Tee-Es. The same goes for Es-El-Es. I\u0027ve been calling it simply \u0022System\u0022 but that probably won\u0027t catch on. And at this point renaming seems to be pretty much out of the question.\n\nBut maybe there is a better solution. SLS uses the same rocket engines, the same tank hardware (slightly stretched), and the same SRBs (also stretched to five-segments) as Space Shuttle. Aside from ditching the Orbiter for an in-line stack (and putting the RS-25s where they should be) it is almost the same vehicle. The core of the vehicle will still be a big orange tank and two slender white boosters. So why don\u0027t we keep calling it Shuttle? It honours the central role Space Shuttle played in NASA\u0027s post-Apollo spaceflight operations and in the directly derivative hardware heritage of the new vehicle.

SLS isn\u0027t so good sounding, but the way it feels sort of *off* feels appropriate for the general state of space travel feeling off at the present. We developed a moon-rocket, ditched it for a shuttle, then ditched the shuttle for what looks like (but is very different from) a retrofitted Apollo with shuttle boosters strapped to it, feeling like we\u0027ve gone full circle in a confusing way.\n\nIf SLS has part of the rocket coloured orange like the ET then treating it as a Shuttle derivative would feel more natural to me. Perhaps SLS - Space Launch Shuttle? Or abandoning the acronym, something conveying a message that is essentially \u0022Space Payload Shuttle.\u0022 - the Launch vehicle is expendable, but it shuttles payload into orbit reliably. \n\n*Orion-Shuttle* is quite nice, being distinct from just \u0022Shuttle\u0022 while keeping it in there. I can see it being truncated to just Orion, but considering this is similar to what happened with *Shuttle* vs *Shuttle Orbiter*, maybe that\u0027s natural.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-09T03:49:29Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2015 03:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Coam**"},{"CreatedByName":"Pipcard","CreatedById":2541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T03:49:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The correct name is *Senate* Launch System.\n\u003E Though I suppose one could call it a Delta V, since it uses the same upper stage, and the SRB \u002B hydrogen core shows some similarities.
