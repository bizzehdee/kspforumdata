Weighing in 48.7 tonnes, the new design may feature a smaller payload bay but it makes up for it in flight-time and the capability of Mach 2 (tested at ~730.8, which is Mach 2.14) at altitudes of \u0026gt;23 000 m (atmospheric engine flight ceiling is around 25 000m utilizing compressed O2 canisters for added turbojet longevity). Carries enough fuel for a round trip (take-off, ascent, orbit and return) with some extra fuel for atmospheric cruising and has nearly 10-12 hours of total flight-time. An aerospike boost is recommended during take off, especially when carrying a large payload but it can then reach atmospheric escape on turbojets alone, with only a short aerospike boost to get it over the 60 000m mark. Aerospike use is recommended to be as low as possible before the orbit burn, due to the limited supply of oxidizer on-board. There should be enough to achieve a ~150 000m orbit, perhaps more if used wisely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mogul design will also come in the K-3350-L model which will feature a larger payload bay, as well as the K-3350-T, which will be a crew-transport SSTO, featuring a smaller bay but accommodating twice the crew. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S: Yes, the front landing gear is pitched up. This is due to the change of Centre of Mass after a flight which exhausts more than 3/4 the fuel. It\u0027s an issue only when the plane is stationery/parked and doesn\u0027t compromise stability.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Read have Read","CreatedById":60863,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-30T03:17:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022crongame\u0022 data-cite=\u0022crongame\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi, i just noticed the VTOL steering mode and i started messing with it, but there\u0027s one problem i think. When i have it to throttle control double pair and i press W it goes up instead of down and same for S it goes down instead of up. Is there any way to fix that? Thanks\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I noticed this too. I looked at the firespitter manual and nothing indicates that this should be the case. I eventually gave up and went with a single pair.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pa1983","CreatedById":58328,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-30T10:59:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReally beautifully made parts!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"madnessinmysoul","CreatedById":74964,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-30T14:32:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERequest for the next release:more parts that work well with or are 1.25m sized.
