Very little time had passed since the explosion, and now their best hope for survival was fast approaching. Not as fast as whatever had hit them, thankfully. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe was still a bit sore from it all and the pain in his head was somewhere near excruciating, but nothing a few painkillers wouldn\u0027t solve. Danlong had done his best to patch him up, but there were far worse cases to deal with than Milzer. Melden, for starters, who was badly burned from putting out the fires in his section of the habitat. And Deruki, who had taken quite a beating when his capsule was ejected from the duster and propelled off into a higher orbit. Milzer still wasn\u0027t sure how he survived. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey had isolated most of the damaged portions of the habitat and had moved quickly to patch leaks and transfer reserves into good tanks. Water would be their biggest concern, as much of it had been stored between the hulls of the ship to serve as radiation shielding. When small bits of debris pierced the outer hull, pockets of that precious fluid had rapidly sublimated. Even with their recycling system there was no way they had enough to last until a rescue ship from Kerbin arrived. At least not with all twenty of them aboard. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe arrival of the Osprey would help tremendously. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150412_ksp0030_osprey_kh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150412_ksp0030_osprey_kh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMilzer\u0027s joy turned bitter when the captain of the Osprey sipped through the airlock and into their small station. Dudry Kerman, their old crewmate who had gone missing during the raid on Sky\u0027s Reach, only to turn up later as the first astronaut in a new space agency. Meldo and Milzer moved quickly to block his access to the Harvest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022M! M! Heyas boyos! Long time no see, is it not?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeldo groaned. \u0022Dudry? Of all the places to bump into _you_. Crash any of our space stations lately? How can we trust you? How do we know you\u0027re not responsible for this mess in the first place?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Do you have a choice?\u0022 Dudry looked around the small room, growing slightly uncomfortable. \u0022Look, I had nothing to do with the spot you\u0027re in just now, just like I had nothing to do with Bernoulli. I\u0027m looking for answers the same as you. Seems our lander went missing before we could use it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Think we found it.\u0022 The standoff continued for a few moments, and finally Meldo turned and opened the passage back into the ship, returning to the lab module, followed silently by Milzer. Dudry drifted in behind them. The air inside was slightly acrid, as though something somewhere was still burning. Milzer wondered if there wasn\u0027t something still smoldering here in the lab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Nice place you\u0027ve got here.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It was.\u0022 Meldo glared at Dudry harshly. \u0022I\u0027d ask how you made it out of Sky\u0027s Reach, but I already know you were a spy in the first place. So instead I\u0027ll ask where Podoly and Lengee went. And the other three. Jorble, Genekin and Bobbo. Did you brainwash them like you did Gene?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Such hostility. Tsk. You always attack your guests and rescuers like this?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMilzer was hungry still, the painkillers having amped up his metabolism. He fished around in the lab\u0027s cabinets for a snack bar and set about munching on it in a somewhat agressive manner. He stared down Dudry, who was obviously being evasive, then spoke up. \u0022Answer. It\u0027s a simple question. What happened to our friends?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No idea.\u0022 The glares from M\u0026amp;M seemed to be enough to startle Dudry and he was becoming visibly nervous. \u0022Look, I\u0027m here to help your crews, not argue over mistakes we made in the past. Yes, I was working for the Council while flying with you. Had been since my time in the military. Yes I was feeding them information while we were on the run. That changed after the raid on Sky\u0027s Reach.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And the others?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Barting was the only other one I know of. He disappeared a couple years ago, right after that fiasco with Bernoulli Station. I haven\u0027t seen him since.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022AND THE OTHERS?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Disappeared. At least the four rescuees did. I never figured out what happened to Bobbo. I wanted to recruit them for the new space agency, but the one time I asked I was told never to mention them again. You learn one thing it\u0027s to not question the Council. But they seemed to be as in the dark as I was.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMilzer and Meldo continued to stare down Dudry for several minutes, Dudry\u0027s eyes darting between the two of them.

Sand and ash are fluidic under the right circumstances, and more forgiving than your usual rock. So I figure I can drive this big pole on the end of this gizmo down into those sands and stop without so much as a scratch.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaloly brought the orbiter-turned-lander into the atmosphere just as he said he would - pointed directly at the ground. The air tried to flip it around, but the strength of the reaction wheels was enough to overcome. Barely even a trace of reentry flames, perhaps due to the air not compressing in front of the craft but instead flowing through its open structure. In the end it wasn\u0027t enough. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150412_ksp0125_silence.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150412_ksp0125_silence.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150412_ksp0127_silence.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150412_ksp0127_silence.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Pow!\u0022 Shouted Haloly as the camera feed erupted into a cloud of flames and static.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Nice try, dude.\u0022 Shepgee rubbed his hand on Haloly\u0027s head to mess up his hair. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s not over yet. Just watch the feed.\u0022 A few seconds later and the picture cleared, snow and flames fading to a clear view of Laythe. The telemetry from the orbiter showed only a single RCS thruster was offline. \u0022Ok, so it\u0027s a bit scratched up. Tied game?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sure.

They had been going over the details of what he might expect as he reentered. The small chamber was already partially filled with the seemingly magical suspension fluid, which Gene was wistfully running his fingers through. It was cold and slimy to the touch, yet the fluid rolled off his fingers without leaving a trace. The technicians had tried to explain how it fed and breathed for those in the chamber, but he wasn\u0027t sure they completely understood either.

He poked at it with his other hand while half answering. \u0022Land on Ike.\u0022 The fluid slid through his fingers and silently rejoined its flock. \u0022And that should release everyone still trapped in the Simulation, including myself.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Correct. We checked and the Ike Contingency is still in effect. I can\u0027t promise the system won\u0027t try to stop you, though.\u0022 One of the technicians motioned for Gene to move into the chamber as Lem droned on. \u0022Now there\u0027s a chance you\u0027ll end up in Kerbin orbit instead of in your office. Happens with most of the crews we\u0027ve sent in, so it might take us a few attempts to get you in the right spot.\u0022 Gene slid his legs down into the fluid and relaxed. The \u0027chair\u0027 back would shortly lean him down into the chamber once more. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And what happens if I never show up at KSC?\u0022 The fluid was starting to fill the chamber now, and the technicians were lowering the lid of Gene\u0027s coffin.

Two windows in the lid of the chamber were like bright lines in the darkness of the fluid. Gene breathed in an uncomfortable lungful, the oxygenated superfluid rapidly displacing the air from his body. Carl\u0027s body. The two bright lines faded to two dots and receded off into the distant night.

Something went wrong.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene looked up at Carl, who was still watching, motionless and silent. \u0022What will happen to Carl?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Council looked amongst each other, a silent moment passing. The member closest to Gene stood, taking over as their mouthpiece. \u0022He will remain. The Wanderers built protections into their device that we can not understand.

The Council continued. \u0022Yet even software constructs such as we can break under continued contact with Them, as evidenced by this former member of our Council.\u0022 He waved and the Senator disappeared. \u0022Corruption is universal.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene turned to look out of the window at the artificial and simplistic beauty of the world beyond. \u0022So what now?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Now\u0022 all the Council said in unison, \u0022a promise must be made.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Very well.

The universe descended into total darkness. They seemed to have landed, but Meldo was expecting to settle and shift. He was certain they\u0027d come down on a fairly steep incline, but so far, nothing. Not even a thud or the sounds of rocks and sand scraping agains the lander. Just darkness and silence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Where did the stars go?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150419_ksp0096_white.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150419_ksp0096_white.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd suddenly the world outside was blindingly bright. Meldo blinked back the brightness and moved quietly into the post-landing checklist. Engines off. Check. Lights off. Check. Radar shows zero. Check. Milzer sounded particularly frantic on the radio as Meldo was shutting down the lander\u0027s systems. Landing computer off. Check. \u0022Milzer, I think we\u0027ve landed.\u0022 Ladder extended. Check.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I can see that, but where?

He waited as the ladder noisily extended and clanked at the bottom of its reach. Noise. The hatch squeaked as it worked its way open. Noise. \u0022And I think there\u0027s an atmosphere.\u0022 Meldo pushed it the rest of the way and climbed out on the ladder. \u0022We seem to be in some sort of box.

Ok, so maybe this was the weirdest thing he\u0027d seen. He glanced over at Haloly, who was had broken the emergency cheese out of the food locker and was busy munching away. Haloly shrugged and kept snacking, replying with a half full mouth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hey, if it\u0027s the end of the world at least I\u0027ll die holding all the cheese.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150419_ksp0294_white.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150419_ksp0294_white.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then the universe flashed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Kerbin?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No, not yet.

The ship\u0027s sensors had reported the space outside as being at a full atmosphere, roughly equivalent to sea level on Kerbin.

Just a few moments before they had all been sitting in their ships, or walking around outside their ships, or sitting in their offices, patiently awaiting whatever it was that was coming. None of them were quite sure how they got here, or even where \u0022here\u0022 was. In front of them were eleven not even slightly confused kerbals. The three older ones in orange suits were known by all: Bill, Bob and Jebediah. The eight behind them dressed all in black were familiar, yet strangely unknown. Two kerbals stood in the aisle: Gene Kerman, also known by all, and Barting Kerman. One was smiling, then other shaking. Jebediah walked forward and addressed the assembly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We don\u0027t have much time, so I\u0027ll be brief. For the last ten years you have all been a party to a most unfortunate series of events. Those of you who have not yet remembered will soon understand, as you will shortly be cast back into a world long forgotten. So I won\u0027t dwell on that. Understand that I, and the Council behind me, have learned much from your time here.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022When you awaken there will be many questions, some of which do not have answers. We are seeding those of you we feel capable of bearing the burden of our knowledge with memories that are not your own. It is our hope you will use this knowledge for the betterment of kerbalkind.\u0022 Jeb looked over his shoulder at Bob, who nodded a silent response. Jeb continued.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Your memories will remain with us long after you have returned to your lives, and will dwell in this Crypt forever. In time others will study and learn from you, just as you have learned and studied from us. Future beings will look into this glass and know the past. They will know you. And they too will learn.\u0022 Jeb smiled and looked at Gene.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150429_ksp0311_white.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150429_ksp0311_white.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Gene Kerman. Through no fault of your own you were the catalyst that fed this situation and kept these others in the trap. While we have at last separated you from the mind of Carl, we can not separate Carl\u0027s mind from you. And you had a choice. You could have remained in the other world, living the life of Carl, but you chose to return and do the right thing. Through all the mess of the Simulation you have struggled to survive, to find the truth, and to do what is right. You are most welcome in our company.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Barting Kerman.\u0022 Barting was still standing in the aisle behind Gene, shaking and spinning slowly. He looked up when Jeb spoke his name, then looked bashfully back at his feet. \u0022At every turn you were presented with a choice, and you took the darker of two paths. While the corruption which led you from the life of a helpful kerbal to one of destruction has been purged, the consequences of your decisions still remain. You alone know true terror. You alone have met the mind of a truly alien being. The burden of having communed with one of the Wanderers will in time break you and drive you mad. Only fitting, for one so quick to toss away the lives and safety of his fellow kerbals.\u0022 Jeb looked at his feet, kicked absently at something, then looked back to the scared kerbal standing in the aisle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yet we feel a great pity for you, and have blocked the writeback. At the end you saw the error of your ways, though it was too late to change your course. So, when you awake it will be as though no time has passed. Ten years will have simply vanished.

Get real. This isn\u0027t some vessel for their minds. This is a sample container for ours. That wasn\u0027t a crash. And it wasn\u0027t a trap.

Yes, relaxed. A feeling Gene had never known, the Gene still living in his memories, and a feeling that still felt a bit alien to him. The real him. His gaze was on the stars, eyes focused on the nothing beyond the window. Quiet, distant, empty... and yet alive. How many others were out there, beyond the reach of their star? How many others were looking back at him now, unaware he was here. His thoughtful trance was interrupted by the ship\u0027s robotic voice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ladies and Gentlekerb this is your captain speaking. We are fast approaching our destination. Vall is our first stop in the Joolian System. Observant guests will notice...\u0022 The voice droned on about how they would use Tylo and Vall for partial gravity captures and course corrections including a short burn at Joolian periapsis. They would also witness a close approach to Laythe. In all a fairly typical approach to Jool. The chart appeared on the screen at the front of the cabin, their orbital paths outlined in various shades.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe artificial voice of the ship\u0027s \u0022captain\u0022 was still a bit disturbing. Cold and alien, it was not at all what Carl had expected. He supposed it was necessary when your ship is 100% automated. So much of life in the real world was alien, to him and all the others that had been trapped in the Simulation. In just a short decade the field of automation had progressed by leaps and bounds, and the changes such knowledge brought to the world were unmistakable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt first he suspected the Wanderer\u0027s technology had been unlocked; that these new intelligences were based on the personality matrices used in the Simulation.

The muse in their midst. \u0022Haloly?\u0022 As usual, Haloly was lost in thought, looking out at Tylo and its craters as it receded into the spinning distance. \u0022Anyway, the package will land once we\u0027re all on site.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And after that?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe shrugged. \u0022No idea.

Vall was up next, again, the encounter set, another day or two of the regular nothingness of space travel. Jool and its moons may be a smaller system than the entirety of the Kerbol System, but days were still days and orbits still spread out. Now the jolly green giant was ever-present and visible just beyond the windows of their rotating Void Liner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJool.

It was a longer burn, this capture at Vall, but at a lower thrust than they had used to capture at Jool. The ship\u0027s rotation had not slowed at all during any of their maneuvers, a very pleasant experience for the less than regular spacekerbs in their ranks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe engines cut off and the \u0022captain\u0022 once more took to the intercom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ladies and gentlekerb, we have arrived in Vall orbit.

The inside of the cabin was disorienting when they first boarded, the angle of rotation meaning their seats were always on the ceiling. That settled after leaving the Void Liner, as the shuttle canceled its rotation. Sweet bliss of microgravity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheir rendezvous with the lander occurred above Vall\u0027s North Pole. Their arrival was timed perfectly, allowing them to start their landing descent just as soon as they were transfered and strapped in. The shuttle remained in its orbit, its \u0022captain\u0022 going dormant until they returned from their trek to the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaloly checked to make sure the package was on its way.

There were several warnings about landing in restricted zones and the penalties attached, warnings Carl bypassed with a few button presses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe friends and their lander were already visible as they made the final descent to the icy surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220150510_ksp0136_epilogue.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150510_ksp0136_epilogue.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220150510_ksp0163_epilogue.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150510_ksp0163_epilogue.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey entered the lander in microgravity, but had to gather their things in real Gs. The chair backs were suddenly the chair seats, the addition of gravity turning their world back on its head. After years in transit where \u0022down\u0022 meant \u0022out\u0022, suddenly having \u0022down\u0022 be \u0022backwards\u0022 was rather unusual. They each suited up and climbed through the hatch, eager to see their old friends again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost of their party was already present on Vall, those who had been working out here at the edge of civilization for some time. Several of the \u0022Simulation Seventy,\u0022 as they had come to be known despite only numbering sixty-two, had pulled assignments in the Jool System fresh from the academy. Many others had been sent to Duna and Eve to support the now burgeoning off-world colonies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeldo in particular was awarded a job leading the newly formed \u0022Joolian Flight Training School.\u0022 JFTS was tasked with teaching crews the trades of prospecting and ore hauling, with an emphasis on controlling and managing their robotic mining fleet. Neilny, Jervan and a few of the others had joined him and were in-system milking the lucrative mining and settlement contracts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA select few of their group had made their way to Moho and Dres. Moho, where Anny was challenging the pilot\u0027s union and hoping to hit the prospecting motherlode. Dres, which had drawn Laning and Barting. Laning so he could research the less-than-sane kerbals who had been banished to the dismal rock, Barting so that he might have time to heal. Poor Barting, who had no memories of his time in the Simulation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo others were present, only those who had been in the Simulation. Carl had determined some time ago that only members of the 70 could be trusted with this last mission. A few had been personally selected by him, asked to stay behind and prepare this final task while the others went on about their lives. Now, with those that were available and willing present, Carl was ready to move forward over the last hurdle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220150510_ksp0173_epilogue.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150510_ksp0173_epilogue.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What\u0027s the word on the package?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaloly punched at his suit\u0027s wrist computer and waited. \u0022Inbound.

One of the great mysteries of Kerbol. \u0022There. In that gap on the far side of the \u0027henge. Land there first, then move it to this side. To the transmitter site at the base of the row of obelisks. That should trigger the startup and set things in motion. Got it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yep. Dialing it in now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShortly thereafter the lander soared overhead with its priceless and ancient cargo. Jervan pointed up as it drifted silently by.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Is that it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Funny, I wouldn\u0027t have such a complex alien device to look exactly like a shipping container.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCarl wasn\u0027t sure if he was joking or not. Jervan had always seemed a bit dense, but was more often than not simply being sarcastic. He answered him anyway. \u0022It\u0027s inside the container. Wouldn\u0027t want to ship it all the way out here unprotected, now would we?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220150510_ksp0199_epilogue.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150510_ksp0199_epilogue.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220150510_ksp0204_epilogue.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150510_ksp0204_epilogue.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220150510_ksp0206_epilogue.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150510_ksp0206_epilogue.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ground rumbled as the lander delivering their package made its first stop. Was it rumbling, or was it a very low-frequency hum? Carl wasn\u0027t sure. Haloly looked at him nervously as the rumbling continued.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Is it supposed to do that?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How should I know? Just don\u0027t stop now, ok?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFollowing its script, the automated lander lifted off again, hovered to get its bearings, and then moved towards them. As it approached the delivery point it slowed, dropped to the ice, and detached from its cargo. Once the container was safely on the ice the lander took off and moved clear of the site. The rumbling, which had subsided temporarily, grew in strength before stopping suddenly. The stillness of the void returned to Vall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220150510_ksp0210_epilogue.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150510_ksp0210_epilogue.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220150510_ksp0216_epilogue.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150510_ksp0216_epilogue.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ok Haloly, blow the pod.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You got it.\u0022 Haloly swiped at his wrist and the sides of the container blew away, exposing the strange alien device. An insidious machine which had trapped them inside their minds for so very long.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220150510_ksp0217_epilogue.gif\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150510_ksp0217_epilogue.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220150510_ksp0222_epilogue.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150510_ksp0222_epilogue.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeldo scratched at the back of his helmet. \u0022It\u0027s like an egg.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It _is_ an egg. Were you not there when we boxed it up, M?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, no. I\u0027ve been out here living my life. Doing the work. Being productive. Y\u0027know, the usual. Sitting back and relaxing while my students do all the work. Anyway, what happens now?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCarl grinned. \u0022Now M? Now we wait.\u0022 Meldo never changed. None of them did, really. All he coudl do was shake his head and grin. For some time the device sat there, nothing happening. Growing anxious he walked towards it, wondering if there was something else he needed to do. Something Gene had been programmed to know that would just pop out of his memory. He knew the Sun had to be in the sky. He knew the device had to be aligned. Beyond that he had not so much as a hint.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe was halfway to the device when the light show started. Small orbs formed at the top of each of the obelisks, orbs that gave off a strange, unkerbally blue glow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220150510_ksp0223_epilogue.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150510_ksp0223_epilogue.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220150510_ksp0225_epilogue.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150510_ksp0225_epilogue.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220150510_ksp0226_epilogue.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150510_ksp0226_epilogue.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimilar orbs formed atop the other stones. As they grew in size a ring formed, each orb arcing out to connect to its neighbors. The electrical noise crackled on each of their suit radios, hinting at the intense electromagnetic events taking place on the ice in front of them. The noise grew to a hum, the hum grew to a roar, the vibration rising ever more powerful as time passed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then their device activated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA beam fired forth from the alien egg, feeding the ring with its own energy. Moments later another pillar of energy appeared, aimed directly towards Kerbol. The Sun. The energy ripped and roiled around the ring, splitting off into shafts of lightning reaching for the ground. Grounding through stones, obelisks, rocks. The crackling and the glow was interminable and bright.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCarl was awestruck. Many minutes he stood, watching the scene, bathed in the soft, blue, pulsating light. A strange euphoria passed over him, a feeling as though he was independent of time and space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220150510_ksp0235_epilogue.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150510_ksp0235_epilogue.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220150510_ksp9120_epilogue.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150510_ksp9120_epilogue.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTransmission. This was some sort of transmission, that much was obvious. None of them were recording it, each as obsessed with the light show as the others. Minutes later the glow started to dim, the light show ended. One final burst punctuated the night, and then the Vallhenge was cast back into the darkness of the distant Sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCarl walked towards\u00A0the device, curious as to what had happened to it. He was no more than a few steps on his journey when the egg exploded, a cloud of smoke and sparks spreading across the Vallian ice. It smoldered in the vacuum, this alien machine that had nourished them for so long. Now glowing hot and red, the ice underneath it turned to steam. Another explosion, more steam, and the device disappeared into the ice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe chuckled softly, shrugged, and then walked back to his friends. So much for that. Best to leave it at that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220150510_ksp9121_epilogue.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20150510_ksp9121_epilogue.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMilzer walked out to meet him, followed closely by the others. He waved towards the Vallhenge, towards the rapidly dissipating cloud. \u0022Didn\u0027t the Academy want that thing back? They going to be more than a bit irked when you bring them a burnt-out husk.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCarl shrugged again. \u0022Don\u0027t know. Don\u0027t really care. Sometimes you just have to do the right thing.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do you think it worked?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe smiled. Yes, it definitely worked. Gene was as sure of it as he was. \u0022I think we\u0027re well on our way across the universe. Off to wherever we\u0027re going, to whoever these Wanderers are. It\u0027ll take many years to reach our destination. This was the next step. The next step for all Kerbalkind. The next step in a long journey, a journey we can never abandon. We\u0027re bound for some beautiful and wondrous place where all our questions will find answers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, I think it worked.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaloly looked sullen. He punched at his wrist once more, then looked up at the Sun. \u0022I\u0027m kinda disappointed.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They never answered the question. I was kinda hoping they\u0027d explain.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe others flashed Haloly a confused look, Carl included. Haloly was always the one asking the strange questions, the big questions. Questions that had no answers. Surely he could see this was one they themselves would never have answer to?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnly Shepgee probed further. \u0022Ok, I\u0027ll bite. Explain what? We were in that thing\u0022, he turned to point at the steam cloud and hole in the ice, \u0022for more than a decade. It copied us. Copied our minds. Our memories. Our dreams. And now it\u0027s shot them off into space, turning us upside down and inside out along the way. And it exploded. We\u0027re alive. We\u0027re free. We\u0027re here. What\u0027s left to be answered?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The big question, man.

Old links would be of the style .../images/adlunam/... or .../images/adlunam2/... where as the new links are all .../images/ksp/adlunam/...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m back in the swing of things KSP-wise, all the flood waters and downed trees and roving gangs of water moccasins seem to be gone now. First post of my KSP v1.0 career should hit tonight or tomorrow.

The Luzhin and most of the bits on them (including the latticework decoupler and the solar arrays) were the old Tantares Soyuz craft. I\u0027m not sure how much of that is left after Beale\u0027s latest rework, but the basic look should still be there. As for the launch vehicle colors - I was doing that by editing the texture files. The SoyJuice/HGR parts in particular were just a thin olive-green mask (at 20% or 30% opacity) placed over the normal textures.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
