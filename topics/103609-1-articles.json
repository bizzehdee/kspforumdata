Sure, it has a moon, but Gilly is the smallest thing the Kerbal Scientists have found! It\u0027s a mere asteroid (well, it actually is an asteroid) at 13km in radius! Eve isn\u0027t the only one to suffer this fate either (reference to maybe a future mod of mine). But, AstroGamer\u0027s EvePlus mod fixes that problem! By adding 3 new bodies, this mod spices up the Eve system!\n\n![fvCbZFr.png](https://i.imgur.com/fvCbZFr.png)\n\n**What is EvePlus, Mr AstroGamer?**\n\nI\u0027m glad you asked!
