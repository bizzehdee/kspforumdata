I know almost everything about rockets, and I\u0027ve decided to build an SSTO that can be reused. This, of course, requires knowledge of spaceplanes. I have built a successful SSTO that has a lot of fuel left after orbital insertion, but I really would like a few tips when designing them (I went through ~20 major variations to find one that worked)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"B787_300","CreatedById":31055,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-30T06:06:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehey 3_bit, welcome aboard, but I remember you from before the crash... and this seems in the wrong thread...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESSTO\u0027s are very difficult which is why there are none in real life. you can build a simple rocket SSTO with out much trouble if you make it have about a 1.2 TWR on ignition and atleast 6000 m/s of vacuum deltaV and 4000 atmospheric detlaV. planes might be harder as you need to have the wings and what not balanced along with intakes for atmospheric flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy B787\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AceGamer","CreatedById":61925,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-30T19:08:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t made a SSTO but i\u0027m looking forward to trying to make one in the future it seems hard but challenging\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-30T20:00:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESSTO\u0027s are easy.

I aim for a TWR of \u0026gt;1.8 and a dV of about 5200. This is enough to get something to a 150k orbit easily.

At the bottom of the spine is a lander can while the top of the spine has the decoupler to release the payload. It all goes to orbit, lets the payload go and returns to KSC in one orbit, so about 30min pad-to-pad. (btw, that payload is about 60t)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
