However, Bandicam has a huge advantage over Fraps in that Bandicam can compress the video as it records which Fraps cannot do. I have paid versions of both and I have pretty much stopped using Fraps, also it seems for me that Bandicam doesn\u0027t cause me to take a hit on my FPS while recording in fullscreen where Fraps usually does.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"antman","CreatedById":36428,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-11T00:41:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would agree with Ziff.
