To find the delta V needed to get onto a Lambert solution transfer orbit, you find the orbital velocity of the transfer orbit at t1 and translate that into the \u0022hyperbolic excess velocity\u0022 relative to your departure planet. You start with the planet\u0027s orbital velocity around the sun, then the vector difference between that orbital velocity and the velocity of the Lambert transfer orbit at t1 gives you the speed and direction needed for your escape from the sphere of influence of your departure planet. You can translate that escape velocity into a maneuver delta-V from an initial parking orbit using the vis-viva equation. Set your parking orbit altitude as the periapsis of the escape trajectory, then the maneuver delta-V for your escape burn is the difference between orbital speed at that altitude and periapsis speed of the hyperbolic escape trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should always be able to get into any Lambert transfer orbit with one (instantaneous) burn, but that burn may need to be quite crazy if your transfer orbit is inclined in a way that doesn\u0027t line up nicely with your initial parking orbit.
