Will give that a try. It\u0027s frustrating that KSP 0.25 worked fine on 10.9.5 but doesn\u0027t on 10.10. I suspect there is more going on than just a memory problem, because I found an odd bug in reading model textures that have \u0022-\u0022 in the name. Specifically, \u0022greenhouse-emissive.tga\u0022 works fine as a texture on 10.9.5, but on 10.10 it shows up in the log as a file that doesn\u0027t exist. Change the name to \u0022greenhouse_emissive.tga\u0022 and change the model to that file name, and it works fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: dropping the graphical settings has improved stability immensely.
