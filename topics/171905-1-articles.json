I normally get close, target a docking port which is a north or south orientation, designate my port as control from here and then switch to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and slowly move in. I noticed that a cannot kill my speed when getting very close. l always seem to be moving. I can kill speed if I go at least 1/ms and\u00A0 switch to prograde\u00A0 but that is too fast when real close. I did discover that my thrusters were not located on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E so I adjusted and that did not help.
