I\u0027ve also tested with 8 Twitch instead of 4 as shown in the image, the result was the same.\n\nThis is my first try with Twitch engines, I was previously using Thuds when needing radial attachment, and it was working fine.\n\nTo compare , i\u0027ve tried replacing the 8 Twitch , (which should give 8\\*13.7 = 109 Thrust), with 2 Thuds , throttled down to 33.5 % and it lifts up just fine when the tanks empty (TWR tops up at 1.18 similar to above).\n\nAm I doing something wrong ? or is this known ?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-20T21:19:23Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2015 09:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Finndibaenn**"},{"CreatedByName":"Reddeyfish","CreatedById":142160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T20:51:56Z","Content":"your 64 kN of thrust in the shown TWR readout is for in-space ISP, not atmosphere ISP.
