Sometimes the length of dialogue might differ\u00A0by character and personality.\u00A0About the plot: could it partially be because I drop a few hints for something for an episode later, but isn\u0027t really discussed much in the episode itself, and the subplots are made but really don\u0027t get put into action?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave enough images, but not too many.
