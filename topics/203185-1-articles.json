If you got KSP through Steam, uninstall, reinstall and then right click KSP \u0026gt; Properties \u0026gt; disable cloud saving and then verify the local files, then never add mods to the Steam copy of KSP- copy KSP out of Steam\u2019s folders and then put your mods in the copy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
