Works great and helps with wobbles by strengthening decouplers and interstages, which in real life are quite a bit stronger than the ones in KSP. Doesn\u0027t help much with docking ports but that\u0027s fine. It also stabilizes your ship when you come out of warp or load the ship by making it temporarily indestructible and turning off the physics. It then makes your ship \u0022destructible\u0022 again and slowly ramps up the physics back to normal. This prevents large ships from exploding, or parts breaking off, or weird bends and spins when you load it or come out of timewarp.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"guitarxe","CreatedById":115354,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-23T16:00:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, I might try that mod if I don\u0027t like the strut/girder solution.
