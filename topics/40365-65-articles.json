This had one lab part on it, two of the largest nuclear reactors \u002B generators, an antimatter tank, and two of the least stupid kerbals I could find. This was all on the big tracks you can get from another mod, and I included a pipe outlet on the front of the track base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI set the lab to produce antimatter and timewarped until I had ~500 units, then made a simple rocket with antimatter reactor \u002B thermal rocket and a bunch of AM collectors. Rolled the science craft over and fueled the rocket with antimatter then launched it into orbit at around 1 million KM. I let that collect while I generate more on the ground for the next launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom there I launched a science module into orbit as well, refueled at the collector station and went on to Jool to deploy a science station and additional collectors to work as a fuel depot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that you have a decent infrastructure for refuelling craft in the system. I put 12 sats in low orbit around the sun with microwave power transmitters so I could receive power pretty much anywhere I needed to (and now that its possible I also have 12 nuclear powered sats in orbit around kerb with transmitters).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been experimenting with making the smallest reactors and generators grabbable via KAS so I can assemble small probes and vessels in-sutu.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Donziboy2","CreatedById":74984,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-11T14:01:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou didn\u0027t open them on the launch pad did you?

It wobbles at all times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Rage quit and remove the ship, which is now on an irrevocable re-entry trajectory (I couldn\u0027t bear to watch it crumble).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, I tried AM instead:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
