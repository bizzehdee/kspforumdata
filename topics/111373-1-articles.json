When I click on the launch pad and choose a rocket, it sometimes blows up for no apparent reason. It happens with rockets I\u0027ve launched many times before, usually when I want to launch many of the same type. This isn\u0027t a huge problem because it works fine if I click launch from the VAB, but it is a bit annoying when I know there is nothing wrong with my design. Any one know why that might be?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DanielCoffey","CreatedById":144083,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T18:20:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo the rockets move off the pad at all or just \u0027splode on the ground? It may be the \u0022sticky Launchpad bug\u0022 which can be cured by putting launch clamps on the sides or a decoupler at the bottom.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
