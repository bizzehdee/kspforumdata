Guess what other measurement in the system isnt to that scale? Mun is significantly closer to kerbin than 1/10th would dictate. Mun is at 12,000km while the Moon is around 385,000 KM or so. They probably put Mun closer than it should be to make it easier to reach but because of the angles they had to make Kerbol bigger to make the proper eclipse work. If Mun was in a proper 1/10th scale orbit it would be out alot closer to where minus is, 38000km next to minmus\u0027s 47,000km\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NERVAfan","CreatedById":72817,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-07T06:27:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBut Mun could still eclipse Kerbol even if Kerbol was a point of light... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs the idea that they wanted them to look the same size from Kerbin just as the Moon and Sun do on Earth?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(For that matter, why IS the Mun that close?

The earliest versions of the game had no map view or time warp. In addition, LEO orbital velocity is about 3.14 times that of LKO orbital velocity. It takes about 9-10 km of dV to reach LEO, which is about 3 times what is needed to reach LKO with Ferram Aerospace and twice that of stock. However, reaching LEO with stock aerodynamics would\u0027ve been even higher, perhaps 11-12\u002B km of dV. Remember that the atmosphere of early KSP was one consistent block that ended at around 32 km, although I\u0027m not sure what the density was. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could go into more about what an early LEO in KSP would look like, but it\u0027d be like creating a sun-diving rocket out of the early parts just to reach orbit. People have done this, but it\u0027s ludicrous. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I can find out how to make youtube videos of KSP, I\u0027ll try to make a rocket in RSS that uses early KSP parts and features. \u003Cstrong\u003EFOR THE CHALLENGE\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, there are some technical aspects. The surface area of Kerbin is 4.52\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D10^6 km. The surface area of Earth is 5.1\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D10^8 km. That\u0027s two more orders of magnitude of surfaces that has to be created, stored, and rendered. And the same scaling up would apply to any other bodies, too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etl;dr: If Kerbin was the size of Earth, you\u0027d need a Kerbol-diving rocket just to reach orbit using the early parts and no map view. In addition, each planet\u0027s textures would eat up so much RAM it wouldn\u0027t even be funny.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
