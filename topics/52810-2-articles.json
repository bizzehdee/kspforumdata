GALCIT was a key player in Project Prometheus and nearly all research and engineering revolved around that massive project to build an intercontinental ballistic missile. For this, reliable upper-atmosphere readings were necessary, and so sounding rockets received some of the windfall of funding. Late in the war, when it was obvious that Prometheus would not be ready in time, and that a heavy bomber would be sufficient to carry nuclear bombs, sounding rockets retained considerable priority, along with continuing Navy balloon flights, since a fast, high-flying bomber would itself need high atmospheric data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile GALCIT focused primarily on Prometheus, that program, done mostly in cooperation with the Air Force, was joined with another project of the newly established Jet Propulsion Laboratory at GACLIT (JPL) --JATO. Jet Assisted Takeoff--although later jets would come to mean air-breathing jets rather than rockets, the name for both JATO and JPL stuck--was a program run in concert with the Navy to provide small disposable boosters which could be used to drastically shorten takeoff runs for carrier aircraft and increase their maximum takeoff weight, as little time for acceleration on a short deck was a limiting factor for payload (land-based aircraft could manage larger payloads with long runways to accelerate down.) The JATO project at first used Goddard\u0027s preferred liquid propulsion, but it soon proved inadequate for service needs; instead JPL turned to solid fuel rockets, which were safer and could be built and then stored for months at a time. Frank Buturovi\u00C3\u201E\u00E2\u20AC\u00A1 and other students, postdocs, and fellows at JPL had been testing various solid fuel combinations for use in Navy and Air Force rocket-propelled weapons, and a cluster of these rockets--in a longer, thinner form such that the burntime would be longer and peak thrust lower--would enter service as detachable boosters for Navy aircraft (and Air Force aircraft flying from unprepared strips) in the final year of the war.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the closing months of the war, with the Mighty Mouse and Fat Albert rockets and the JATO packs no longer in such high demand, Buturovi\u00C3\u201E\u00E2\u20AC\u00A1 mated an old Fat Albert Mk. 1 thrust section with the sounding rocket he had designed years before for his doctoral thesis, the Wren. Hitherto the Wren had reached an apogee of only about 25km--perfectly high enough for use \u0022testing the waters\u0022 for aircraft, but still only a bit into the stratosphere. Mated to an obsolete Fat Albert Mk. 1 booster, Buturovi\u00C3\u201E\u00E2\u20AC\u00A1 hoped to be able to reach high into the stratosphere and perhaps determine if it merely continued up and up in a single atmospheric \u0022bloc\u0022 until it faded away altogether, or whether there was a third layer of atmosphere, distinct from the troposphere and stratosphere, extending above the stratosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Wren was a simple design, and already showing its age. Thin steel-braced aluminum skin enclosed two pressurized propellant tanks: a large tank of red fuming nitric acid (the oxidizer) in the fat cylinder at the base, and inside the conical section above that a smaller tank of aniline, the fuel. The propellants were toxic, but they at least had the merit of being hypergolic, which greatly simplified the engine. The engine, a later model of which was designated LR22, was a very simple affair: pressure-fed and needing no ignition system due to its hypergolic propellants, with a very simple bell nozzle that JPL had developed from the first, conical, efforts. The engine produced 11.53kN of thrust at sea level, rising to over 15kN as air pressure decreased. Specific impulse was 182 seconds at sea level, rising past 235s in the best vacuum JPL could create to test the engine (later testing would yield figures of 15.2kN and 240s in near-perfect vacuum). The other main components of the rocket were the nose cone, sided with heavier, thicker steel and insulation to protect the sensors from heat, and the sensor bay immediately below the nosecone. Inside were a barometer and a thermometer, and a small radio to transmit results back to the ground. This was necessary since the rocket was unrecoverable and was expected either to break apart under heat and stress on return, or crash and be destroyed. Finally, three fins were added near the rear; these would provide stability in flight and keep the rocket pointed into the airstream; beyond this, the rocket was without attitude control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMission Control:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E Jet Propulsion Laboratory\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVehicle:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E Boosted Wren\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELaunch Site:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E Prometheus Project testing site, Sinclair AFB, California.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELaunch Date:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E September 12, 1944\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EObjective:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E Return readings from the upper atmosphere\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIntended Orbit:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E Suborbital\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDescription:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E Launch the Wren sounding rocket on a Fat Albert Mk. 1 booster, attempt to exit the stratosphere (if there is something beyond the stratosphere), return temperature and pressure readings.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOutcome: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESuccess.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWren\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/r9LCRcA.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/r9LCRcAl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022r9LCRcAl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ET-02:00:00 Engineering statistics; Boosted Wren being assembled in a hanger at Sinclair.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eMCStzw.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eMCStzwl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022eMCStzwl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ET\u002B0:00:00 Liftoff from Pad 3 at Sinclair.

Since the diameter of the booster was quite a bit larger, some steel fairing bridged between the shell\u0027s 28cm width and the 50cm of the booster. Intended to give naval carrier attack aircraft standoff capability, it was to be carried in lieu of a torpedo or 2000lb bomb by torpedo and dive bombers respectively. The Mighty Mouse, with only a 400lb warhead, was sized for fighters doing suppression or light attack duty. As an air-launched weapon it was accurate out to about a mile. It was also considered for deployment as a ground-launched bunker-buster for the Marine Corps.

As the 1930s drew onward and Russia became ever more belligerent (and more industrialized) rearmament intensified; innovative officers in the more firmly middle class Kaiserliche Marine, and in the Luftstreitkr\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A4fte (which had been made independent from the Heer late in the Great War), looked to rockets as perhaps a way to even the odds against the titan to the east. Even earlier both the navy and the air force had reached out to the VfR, given their meteorological needs and the potential for sounding rockets to deliver instrument packages to the higher atmosphere; as the ties built, and like-minded officers were assigned as liaisons, at some point the idea of ballistic missiles took hold. Given Anglo-German advances in RADAR, and Russian shows of strength in the air, by the mid 30s the idea that \u0022the bomber would always get through\u0022 was dying. Besides, Russia was so vast (and, at the time, bombers\u0027 ranges so feeble) it appeared that to build an airplane that could get to its target and return was an impossible task; a missile, which needed only to arrive, must be simpler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany had joined the VfR in the service of a shining, peaceful future, however, and would not see their rockets fly in the service of death. A similar phenomenon occurred in America, later, during the buildup of the Prometheus Project (and the Knoxville Project), as some scientists and engineers would not stand to see either rocketry or atomic physics used in that way. While some members of the VfR would finally offer their services after the invasion of the Fatherland, it would not be until well after the War that there was anything approaching a full reconciliation; a similar pattern occurred with the American Rocketry Society.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the first projects that the new Raketenamt of the Reichwaffenamt ordered was an upscale and conversion of the latest mark of Repulsor sounding rocket which the VfR had been testing. The Repulsor series had been funded in part by the Kaiser, a very generous patron of the VfR; with his support the VfR had moved to Berlin, under the joint aegis of Karman and Oberth at the Kaiser Friedrich Institute. There, with funding aplenty, they could build much larger rockets than their previous Mirak \u0022Minimum Rocket\u0022 designs. Repulsors used gyroscope-based inertial guidance and alcohol-liquid oxygen engines; these soon graduated from the old pressure-fed designs to new turbompump-fed ones (powered by steam from catalyzed high-test peroxide). To solve the heating problem in the nozzle, Repulsors used the regenerative cooling method developed by Irene Bredt and Eugen S\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A4nger, a newcomer to the VfR and later Bredt\u0027s husband.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs secrecy became an issue rocket testing was moved from the VfR\u0027s Raketenflugplatze in Berlin to a hunting estate of the Kaiser some ways out of the city, northeast of Potsdam. It was there the first government-sponsored Repulsor was tested. At the time of its first test-firing in 1938 it was the largest and most powerful liquid-fueled rocket in the world, with an engine capable of just over 20kN of thrust and weighing over half a ton wet, with instruments, parachutes, and ballast. By the start of the war it had gained a 250kg warhead, a 50km range, and a new name: Pfeil (arrow); by the end, it had a 29kN engine, a 340kg warhead, a 75km range, and a series of more famous descendents.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the war, surplus Pfeils regained their old name of Repulsor and performed valuable high-altitude research. The post-war Repulsor, like its pre-war predecessors, was equipped with parachutes and scientific equipment. However, as it was by then designed for a 340kg weight right in the nose, its light scientific payload required ballasting, limited its altitude. Nonetheless, it was sufficiently powerful to bring its instruments up to nearly 60 kilometers above the earth and return them safely to the ground. In so doing, it gave German scientists the first opportunity to make observations of a new layer of atmosphere above the stratosphere: the mesosphere, which begins approximately 50km above the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Repulsor/Pfeil was a simple rocket. At the front was either an aluminum nosecone fairing or a steel-encased warhead, respectively. For civilian use, inside the nose cone would be ballast and scientific instruments, and four small parachutes. Behind the nose section was the inertial guidance unit and its gyroscopes. Behind that were the liquid oxygen tank and the 75% ethanol/25% water fuel tank. Behind that came the engine section. First was a small tank of high test hydrogen peroxide and a catalyst to break it down into steam; this would drive the turbopump. The turbopump, below that, would feed the oxidizer and fuel to the mixing chamber at high pressure. The model \u0022A\u0022 engine--A4 in the late-war Pfeils--had a single large mixing and thrust chamber, which fed a large conical nozzle, regeneratively cooled. Carbon vanes in the exhaust would, on command from the guidance unit, divert it; the engine itself did not gimbal. The Armbrust used a derivative, the model B engine; it used 8 scaled-up A2 thrust chambers, and a similar thrust-vectoring system. The final distinctive feature of the Repulsor/Pfeil was its fins. Purely for stability, unlike later rockets they resembled the rakish designs gracing the covers of science fiction and science \u0022fact\u0022 magazines of the 1920s and 30s. They had also been designed to cushion the tail-first landing of the early civilian Repulsors, and that ability, though unused, remained during the rocket\u0027s later use, only to be called on again when the Pfeils were released from military service and returned to their sounding rocket roots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMission:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E Flight 12b\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMission Control:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E Kaiser Friedrich Institute / VfR\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVehicle:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E Repulsor (ex-Pfeil no. 17582)\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELaunch Site:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E Northeast of Potsdam, on the shore of the Grosser Wannsee\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EObjective:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E Return readings from the upper atmosphere\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIntended Orbit:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E Suborbital\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDescription:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E Launch the Repulsor sounding rocket, attempt to exit the stratosphere (if there is something beyond the stratosphere), return rocket and instrumentation (with data) to the ground.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOutcome: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESuccess\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERepulsor\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgurr.com/gGFDH0c.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gGFDH0cl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022gGFDH0cl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ET-07:00:00 Engineering statistics; Repulsor being checked out in Potsdam prior to journey to launch site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgurr.com/PZwbOZe.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PZwbOZel.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022PZwbOZel.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ET\u002B0:00:00 Repulsor positioned on its launch trailer just inshore from the Grosser Wannsee lake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgurr.com/o4CHvB5.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/o4CHvB5l.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022o4CHvB5l.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ET\u002B0:00:01 Liftoff from trailer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgurr.com/VIaTX1r.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VIaTX1rl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022VIaTX1rl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ET\u002B0:00:15 Nearing supersonic velocity.
