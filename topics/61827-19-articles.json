Then thats when kOS got broken, as I was working on the code to deploy the sats, and trying to figure out how to get the deployed sat to automatically run a program to circularize. Although for that I think I was going to have to run the program manually, not a big deal though I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TranquilTempest","CreatedById":18141,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T01:38:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs there a way to find the altitude at which KSP decides to auto-switch from surface velocity to orbital velocity on the navball during an ascent?

Nice work Steven.\u003Cp\u003EI was pretty proud of the 3 stage asparagus staging program I made a while back. Stages were setup so as to be able to measure amount of fuel in the stages (divided by the number of booster stages) and it would compare that to the current stage fuel (all running engines/tanks). Once it dropped a stage, it would factor that in. For the whole thing to work you had to tell it how many paired \u0022stages\u0022 you had. Don\u0027t think it worked very well for just 1 set of boosters though.

The problem was that it was normal for there to be some fluctuations in the calculations of fuel loss rate because part of the calculation involved dividing a very small number by another very small number to get a rather normal medium-sized number, which is a calculation that can get rather chaotic, exaggerating small errors in precision into big ones. So I had to have quite a bit of tolerance in the fuel loss rate, and only stage if the change in fuel loss was big enough not to be the result of minor precision errors. That made it really messy to try to make the script work for any rocket, big or small or complex or simple, because the window was vary narrow between setting the tolerance too low so it stages when it shouldn\u0027t, versus setting it too high so it fails to stage when it should. Just directly detecting the flameout is much cleaner now that it\u0027s possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T22:13:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to only lock some but not all the controls using the SHIP:CONTROL technique?
