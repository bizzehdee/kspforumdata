Ever since Beta than Ever, however, it\u0027s been showing some really, really, REALLY weird graphics errors. Things like ghostly part or skybox textures filling my screen, epilepsy-inducing rapid strobe flashing, parts of the ground being darkened, and the whole screen appearing to be viewed through crude oil, with every object and the ground pitch-black and the sky still blue but blurred with the objects. 1.0 has made them slightly less common, but they still happen. I\u0027ll try to get some screenshots and update this when I can."},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T01:37:24Z","Content":"Just moved this to the unmodded support forum. Good luck getting it solved.\n\n(This is where Pippin says his/her install is modded up to the hilt, and I facepalm quietly before calling myself an idiot and moving the post again.)"},{"CreatedByName":"larkvi","CreatedById":108735,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T01:38:11Z","Content":"I have consistently getting these issues on the mac as well as the persistent memory leak that leads to a crash less than an hour in every time. I thought I might be able to play 1.0 on my mac, but it looks like it is bootcamp-only still."},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T01:46:51Z","Content":"I think a fair number of Mac users have seen those graphical errors.
