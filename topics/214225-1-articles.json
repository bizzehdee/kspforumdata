A familiar voice ran through his head, yelling out his name. Suddenly, he jumped up. He opened his (non-psychotic) eyes in a hospital ward. He was quite confused, though. Last thing he knew, he was on the Mun researching the mysterious Stargate. Next thing he knew, he was here. A doctor ran in surprised he had woken up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How are you alive? You were asleep for a month! Some hiker found you badly injured on a mountain side!\u0022 the doctor yelled out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, first thing I know I\u0027m on the Mun, the ne-\u0022 Tim was cut off by the doctor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The Mun? How would you be standing on the Mun\u0027s surface? It\u0027s extremely far away from any where!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What? But I remember! The gray dust, my lander, and my crew mates! I was wearing a space suit, maybe you have that?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, you were wearing something. But it wasn\u0027t a space suit. Nobody\u0027s even been to space yet! You fell off the side of a mountain.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I was on the Mun, Dr... Arlep Kerman!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nArlep walked out of the room to talk to another doctor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022He\u0027s clearly delusional. He thinks he was on the Mun. He was wearing a pressure suit when we found him. Maybe he\u0027s a pilot who\u0027s gone mad?\u0022 Arlep said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, how can we diagnose him if we don\u0027t who he is? I\u0027ll go in and ask him\u0022 the other doctor said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe walked in to the room, and proceeded to ask Tim as many questions as she could to figure out who he really was, and what he was doing. He told her his name, and continuously said that he was on a top secret mun mission, that the public didn\u0027t know about. He mentioned who his crew mates were, Joemon Kerman and Anfield Kerman. But they didn\u0027t exist on any records. Not even Tim did. The doctor walked out of the room, confused about the story Tim was telling. However, he wasn\u0027t any harm to himself or anybody else. And all of his injuries had healed. So the hiker who found him was called over and picked Tim up. Tim was given his pressure suit, as it was the piece of clothing he owned (the hospital wouldn\u0027t let him keep his gown).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA Kerbal named Virsen Kerman was the one who founded Tim. He was muttering gibberish about the Mun and something called Stargate. She couldn\u0027t know exactly what had happened to him, but he was badly injured. As if he fell out of the sky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hi Tim,\u0022 Virsen said. \u0022I imagine we\u0027ll be roommates from now on! I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll enjoy my place \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Csub\u003Eeven if it is a pretty crumby apartment.\u003C/sub\u003E\u003C/span\u003E Tim just looked confused. \u0022Well, come on! get in the car!\u0022 And off Tim went, off on his strange new adventure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
