Thank you for assuming that even though you don\u0027t know me.me . \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I use KER and EVE, but I consider myself a stock player. And I probably play that way until I\u0027ll get bored (I can stop playing completely by that point, though) there\u0027s a number of reasons for that:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) I have experience playing heavy-modded Minecraft, so I know how it feels. At some point I stopped playing Minecraft and started playing RedPower, IndustrialCraft, Thermal Expansion, etc. While that\u0027s nice, I can\u0027t get back and play vanilla anymore, it became a different game for me. I might get there at some point, but while stock works for me, I\u0027ll play stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) I don\u0027t want to bother with managing all the stuff, updating, running out of memory, finding which mod caused that nasty bug, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Now this is a bit too global, but still, I want to respect developers work and give some feedback. It\u0027s quite often to point some balance issue or suggest a feature, and get a response like \u0022use [mod name]\u0022. You are not helping! It\u0027s like suggesting to devs to abandon all development except for the engine and bugfixing, and I think I have actually seen such suggestions. No! Stock should be playable as it is without mods so if I think there\u0027s an issue with it, I point it out. For the \u0022respect\u0022 part it is just making me cringe when people start discussing how worthless Squad is because fairings don\u0027t separate in two parts.

It is a creative form of story telling through an interactive medium. The game sets out to take me on a journey in which I have to face certain challenges, learn how to overcome them, and deal with success and failure using a particular set of options at my disposal. They could easily have put something like Mech Jeb or KER into the stock game, but they have taken a creative decision that they want me to go through the learning process and experience the emotions of succeeding or failing without them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I go to watch a movie or read a book, I try to avoid spoilers.

I feel the same way about games: I respect the artistic efforts of the creators of the core game and want to experience the game as they intended.

A stock solution can be recreated by anyone, and knowing that seems to make it feel more legitimate somehow. Of course, beyond a few sandbox missions, the only reason I play stock is because plugins sometimes need a few days to work out compatibility with major patches. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can say without plugins, my playtime in KSP would probably be about 1/5th of what it is... a great bargain to be sure and still an amazing game, but just not nearly as amazing as it is now. When used properly, plugins can add convenience to certain redundant aspects of the game without making it easier, and add amazing new features well ahead of the stock game. Mining and refining fuel, better aero, and deadly re-entry heat are all features we got from plugins before stock had it. Life-support is still a plugin-only feature. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy personal point of no-return with plugins was with Kethane. Too often, my big missions were devolving into countless routine refueling runs. You can only make a vessel so big before it breaks the game and deep space missions meant either insanely big vessels at launch (worse before 3.5m parts) or many ships docking in orbit to refuel at key points during a mission. So many routine refueling missions turned the game into drudgery. It was then I reasoned, \u0022This isn\u0027t hard. The mission would be just as hard if I cheated to refuel at these points, but a lot more fun without the drudgery\u0022. I just couldn\u0027t bring myself to outright cheat though...and then I discovered the Kethane mod. It added a whole new dimension to my missions, allowing me to refuel without routine launch drudgery or feeling like I cheated. It even added difficulty to the game. I now had a reason to put satellites into polar orbit and land large mining rigs on distant moons. Building fuel infrastructure in advance of major missions was often more challenging than the missions themselves. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, I can fully understand how someone getting into KSP right now could shun plugins. All that cool stuff that was once part of my \u0027must-have\u0027 plugin package is now built into stock and stock feels much more like a complete game. On other hand, you\u0027re still missing on life support, robotic parts, and a lot of other cool stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LittleBlueGaming","CreatedById":144665,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T17:52:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI enjoy playing with some of the informational/quality-of-life mods, I enjoy playing with parts mods for more variety, but I also enjoy playing stock for more of a challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027ve got a toaster for a laptop, so I can really only use small mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent modded career uses Blizzy\u0027s Toolbar, CapCom, ContractConfigurator\u002BPacks, Contracts Window \u002B, Crowd Sourced Science, Kerbal Engineer, MechJeb, Science Alert, Stage Recovery, Waypoint Manager, Kerbal Alarm Clock, Final Frontier, S.A.V.E, Transfer Window Planner, Docking Port Alignment Indicator.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
