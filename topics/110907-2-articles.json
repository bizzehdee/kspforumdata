At some point I stopped playing Minecraft and started playing RedPower, IndustrialCraft, Thermal Expansion, etc. While that\u0027s nice, I can\u0027t get back and play vanilla anymore, it became a different game for me.

It\u0027s quite often to point some balance issue or suggest a feature, and get a response like \u0022use [mod name]\u0022. You are not helping! It\u0027s like suggesting to devs to abandon all development except for the engine and bugfixing, and I think I have actually seen such suggestions. No!

The game sets out to take me on a journey in which I have to face certain challenges, learn how to overcome them, and deal with success and failure using a particular set of options at my disposal.

I want to follow the story the creators of that work of art intend me to follow in the way they planned. I respect the artistic decisions they have made, and want to go on the journey they intend for me. I feel the same way about games: I respect the artistic efforts of the creators of the core game and want to experience the game as they intended.

A stock solution can be recreated by anyone, and knowing that seems to make it feel more legitimate somehow. Of course, beyond a few sandbox missions, the only reason I play stock is because plugins sometimes need a few days to work out compatibility with major patches. \n\nI can say without plugins, my playtime in KSP would probably be about 1/5th of what it is... a great bargain to be sure and still an amazing game, but just not nearly as amazing as it is now. When used properly, plugins can add convenience to certain redundant aspects of the game without making it easier, and add amazing new features well ahead of the stock game. Mining and refining fuel, better aero, and deadly re-entry heat are all features we got from plugins before stock had it. Life-support is still a plugin-only feature. \n\nMy personal point of no-return with plugins was with Kethane. Too often, my big missions were devolving into countless routine refueling runs. You can only make a vessel so big before it breaks the game and deep space missions meant either insanely big vessels at launch (worse before 3.5m parts) or many ships docking in orbit to refuel at key points during a mission. So many routine refueling missions turned the game into drudgery. It was then I reasoned, \u0022This isn\u0027t hard. The mission would be just as hard if I cheated to refuel at these points, but a lot more fun without the drudgery\u0022. I just couldn\u0027t bring myself to outright cheat though...and then I discovered the Kethane mod. It added a whole new dimension to my missions, allowing me to refuel without routine launch drudgery or feeling like I cheated. It even added difficulty to the game. I now had a reason to put satellites into polar orbit and land large mining rigs on distant moons. Building fuel infrastructure in advance of major missions was often more challenging than the missions themselves. \n\nOf course, I can fully understand how someone getting into KSP right now could shun plugins. All that cool stuff that was once part of my \u0027must-have\u0027 plugin package is now built into stock and stock feels much more like a complete game. On other hand, you\u0027re still missing on life support, robotic parts, and a lot of other cool stuff."},{"CreatedByName":"LittleBlueGaming","CreatedById":144665,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T17:52:21Z","Content":"I enjoy playing with some of the informational/quality-of-life mods, I enjoy playing with parts mods for more variety, but I also enjoy playing stock for more of a challenge.\n\nAlso, I\u0027ve got a toaster for a laptop, so I can really only use small mods.\n\nCurrent modded career uses Blizzy\u0027s Toolbar, CapCom, ContractConfigurator\u002BPacks, Contracts Window \u002B, Crowd Sourced Science, Kerbal Engineer, MechJeb, Science Alert, Stage Recovery, Waypoint Manager, Kerbal Alarm Clock, Final Frontier, S.A.V.E, Transfer Window Planner, Docking Port Alignment Indicator."}]}
