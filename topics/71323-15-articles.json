Then texturing. After that I\u0027ll start with Falcon 9 1.1 stuff, Merlin 1D\u0027s, new structure, and possible even the landing legs. Though I am not sure about those, balancing the rocket for a possible propulsed landing is really hard, I tried that with my SELV Falcon 9. You have to make a very high engine thrust and very low tank weight in order to make a landing possible. And due to the high thrust-low weight thing, the rockets have a crazy-high TWR. See LazTeks Falcon 9. Falcon 9 1.2 will be made too, once there is proper information and a succesfull flight and the other stuff is done. Falcon Heavy will come with that, it\u0027s just a Nosecone and Decouplers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will still take quiete a while until I finished that, though be patient, it will definitely come!
