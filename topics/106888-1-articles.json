Kind of disappointing as I know there\u0027s more than one mod out there with parts that would have benefited from allowing radial cross-feed. I guess that will still be dependent on plug-ins. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T15:52:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFuel and oxidizer never cross fed from radial parts afaik and I don\u0027t see anything about it in the changelog.
