We still don\u0027t have INFORMATION! this has always been KSP biggest sin. It\u0027s a rocket science game and it doesn\u0027t tell you even how much delta-v you have, just the most important piece of information. Not during construction, not during flight. I can see a spark in that direction in the engineer\u0027s tab and the information tab in-flight but it\u0027s missing everything basically. Delta-v is just the bare minimum though, to make planes we would need waaay more than that, specially with the new aerodynamics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry.

The reason that the angle is usually 30 degrees is that most spaceplanes have a TWR less than 1 at low altitudes and speeds and instead rely on lifting surfaces to ascend. Once the straight line stops working you\u0027re usually at the point where you can begin your ACTUAL ascent to space. The problem is that the turboramjet with ram intake won\u0027t produce enough thrust to overcome drag past mach 1 at the highest point. This is why players level out just before max altitude to accelerate to mach 1.5-2.0. From here ascent becomes easy as you normally have an excess of thrust versus what your plane can handle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong story short we go high because we are bored.
