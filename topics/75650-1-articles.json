Long time no SSTO, right? Well, here comes something I have been sneak-peeking for a while, the Nodachi!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/Bv0arwf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Bv0arwf.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Bv0arwf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest one I\u0027ve made so far (that works), it is also one of the most well balanced I have done, which is doubly surprising considering its size. First, a few of the numbers so you see I\u0027m not kidding around. GLOW is 100mT almost exactly, so it is easy to translate into percentages. Well, \u003Cem\u003E69.5% of that makes orbit\u003C/em\u003E. Yup, mass ratio 1.5 if you want to see it that way. About half of that (\u0026gt;36mT, or 36% of GLOW) is naked payload (the big red fuel tank with docking ports), so the plain payload ratio isn\u0027t bad either, putting most rockets to shame. And that counts the crew of three, the two MMUs to move the payload around and dock it, and the payload bay door (completely aesthetic), as structural mass and part of the SSTO. Of course, all of it is able to be reused. Notice how I developed for it a nifty engine assembly of 1:1 RAPIER/Turbojet ratio that works beautifully giving you just the right T/W ratio for each leg of the flight, and a smooth rocket transition. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou get 3 flameout events, BTW. Don\u0027t worry! They are pretty benign, you get fair warning and a couple of seconds to press the appropriate action group. First one, you switch the RAPIERS to rocket mode and leave the turbos on (4). Then the outer jets go out (cut \u0027em with 1), and then finally it\u0027s 100% rocket power when the last pair go (2), closing the intakes to cut drag (0), and lowish T/W, but by then you are already bringing your apo over 70 kms and don\u0027t need it. You can also recover from relatively big deviations , ~30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA is not an issue you can\u0027t recover from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe whole time after you climb over 20kms and level out, you don\u0027t have to raise the nose over 20-30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA to get sufficient vertical velocity, so it turns out pretty efficient getting the speed. Getting to altitude with a full load, however, can take a long time, so you know, leave it at a 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA climb and go websurfing, or admire the cool (stock) exhaust my TurboRAPIER gives:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/CZ3bdiC\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CZ3bdiC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CZ3bdiC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And speaking about reusability, what\u0027s that you said about reloading?\u0022 some of you might think. Well, the payload rack thingy that doubles as payload bay door isn\u0027t just to close it and make the whole thing more pleasing to the eye (as well as role playing reentry protection for payloads... have I mentioned this thing can land full on reasonably even terrain?). No, it is mostly there so you can have a base when building your own payloads for the bird. See, when you load the ship in the SPH, you get something like this: [spoiler=]\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/lOX0uf0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lOX0uf0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lOX0uf0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee the big rover protruding from the payload bay? That\u0027s the Crawler/Tanker/Reloader. Not only can it taxi the big bird around, it is perfectly aligned so that payload rack mounted on the decoupler docks inside the bay when you drive it in. So you can:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1- Throw away an empty payload rack after you land it (you can \u0022recover\u0022 it too!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2- Load a crawler\u002Bpayload of your design (save a payload rack\u002BCrawler as subassembly by grabbing them from the payload bay, then build the payload to your liking, as long as it fits inside the docking port outline it\u0027ll fit the bay), \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3- Refuel your Nodachi\u0027s consumables and tow it back to the start of the runway before decoupling the crawler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4- You are ready for takeoff! Remember to retract the Crawler\u0027s landing gear before detaching it from the Nodachi for a smooth disengage (Abort action group). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, some glitchiness when you dock, you usually end up with one of the Nodachi\u0027s landing gears clipped to the ground. Just cycle the landing gear and don\u0027t mind the bumps, perfectly normal and harmless*.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can in fact spawn a new crew while you do that, too, but don\u0027t expect a lot of effort put into making the crawler anything other than functional. And I \u0022might\u0022 have forgotten to put RCS to refuel the plane, too, so just the 30 units on the pod. If someone has a stab at beautifying it, please give me a shout!

(solar panel is optional) And they look just the right size for your kebals, too, not to mention they allow me to handle dumb payloads just by sticking a couple docking ports on the sides, something much more part-friendly for bigger builds than giving each section independent RCS controls for docking. Also, a nice shot of the reference payload (the benchmark of all kerbalness, the Big Red) being released, this time by remote control:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/G5fQs3t\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/G5fQs3t.png\u0022 alt=\u0022G5fQs3t.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe orbit shots on this look cool, right? Anyhow, don\u0027t worry about the RCS groups being so far back. That reaction wheel can compensate if you put fine controls on and take things slow, but I heartily recommend using Navyfish\u0027s docking alignment indicator. Once you master docking (and not before), it greatly cuts down on the time and frustration required to make a multi-dock like the one the payload rack uses to secure itself firmly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, refer to the mission album for more screenshots, including a couple with the UI up so you guys can check out my payload ratio claims and such. You can also check out how the older version without payload door did (in case you want to get rid of it to put another custom payload), as well as notice I didn\u0027t use my usual 70km orbit with this, I went for the full 100kms circular... and I still had a healthy margin. So if it fits the bay, it\u0027ll take it to orbit, I can say that with confidence.

Now a landing gear makes tailstriking actually impossible, and has a nice feature: while it can lift off well before teh end of the runway, that only appens if you wait for the proper rotation speed (around 85-90m/s). Simply put, wait till you go past the airplane hangar, then pull up and it will lift off 100% of the time without leaving parts on the runway. This particular multidocking is really easy, BTW.

That happened to a development version... then it stopped happening. Also overheating turbojets that stopped giving thrust when they overheated on another design I was working simultaneously. Since it happened on a becoming-unstable game (the SPH had already begun to misbehave) I assumed it was because of that, because next time I flew it after the inevitable crash the problem had solved itself. So I suggest you try again on a restated game, and if not, tell me and maybe try to fiddle with how the engines are mounted. Mind you, the RAPIERS are attached with surface attachment (courtesy of Ed Tools), but I have built a similar engine in three different working ways, all without fuel lines. This one just happens to only use the two engines and no extra parts, but you can just stick cubic struts to the end of a RAPIER and clip the jet on top of them (fuel flow only cuts when you use attachment nodes twice).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.

I made something awesome to go with the Nodachi in these though times of budgets and reusability. A reusable interplanetary mothership that fits in the bay! Carrying 4.8km/s in the tanks at lowish T/W (0.23) and a lander good for another 2.8km/s at excessive thrust (can\u0027t recall specifically, but probably \u0026gt;1 on kerbin), it can do a Duna mission without chutes (or a lot other places, frankly), then get back into LKO to be picked by the same Nodachi that took it up to be returned to the runway. Oh, and since it\u0027s supposed to carry two kerbals around (one pilots the mothership, the other takes the lander down), so you can crew it from said Nodachi in LKO after you perform the final systems and snacks check before Kerbin departure. It is 10 mT lighter than the original payload, so taking it up is kinda trivial, too.
