The browser seems to be fine with this, but should you accidentally hit VAB or SPH while browsing subassemblies, simply hit EL\u0027s \u0022Select Craft\u0022 button again (no need to close the browser).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done a fair bit of playing with background builds, and wow, what a difference. I, too, wanted it from the beginning, but I was worried about game-play effects and I wanted to design it \u0022right\u0022 before implementing anything so as to avoid thrashing around, but I realized the real game-play comes from ensuring enough required resources are on hand.
