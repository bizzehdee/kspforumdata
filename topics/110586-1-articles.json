The Luftwaffe forestalled this problem by building turbines which were made of steel with tungsten alloy sprayed over the blades to cut expenses. As a result each Me 262 needed replacement engines after just a few hours in the air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only way to end the problem could be changing over to ramjet propulsion, which is cheaper due to the lack of turbines or moving parts. Of course this means that the engines would have to be mounted far from any surface which could disturb airflow and flame outs would occur at IAS speeds under 290kph or 80m/s but not in KSP. The liquid rocket engine designed to give that initial acceleration is included though and the pilot is free to use it whenever he/she should choose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/S6Jtp6K.png\u0022 alt=\u0022S6Jtp6K.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Blohm und Voss P 209:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBlohm \u0026amp; Voss taking a page from the Horten brothers wanted a cheap fighter which could be made with few materials, so few in fact, that they left out a tail.
