Keep in mind that when you have RCS and SAS active, the RCS will try to hold you in the spot you activated SAS.\n\nHave fun on the forums, and keep your kerbals safe!"},{"CreatedByName":"amore555","CreatedById":23863,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-02T12:13:01Z","Content":"I knew there was something I was missing.\n\nGood sir I could kiss you"},{"CreatedByName":"trbinsc","CreatedById":10144,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-02T12:18:24Z","Content":"Also, H and N are part of the RCS controls too.
