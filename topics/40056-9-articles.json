Then I created a collider mesh with this plugin, both the box and others (can\u0027t remember the names, the only one I didn\u0027t try was the wheel). Then I tried calling the collided with different names according to the tutorial mentioned above and also the name/structure I tried to mimic from a couple remote tech/mks parts that I imported. That means in some cases everything was under a single root node, and on others they would be side by side. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d usually start from scratch, just in case. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast step was selecting the root node, exporting the .Mu file, and copying it along its .Png and .CFg file into a new folder. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best I could get from all of those combinations (god forgive me if I skipped the right one, because I tried to slowly cover most of them) was seeing an ugly gray cube with a node that allowed it to be attached in the vab, but couldn\u0027t be grabbed / removed.
