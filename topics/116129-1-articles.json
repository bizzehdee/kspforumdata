Only quick actions on the part of the crew, cutting cables leading to the module and closing *Spektr\u0027s* hatch, prevented the crews having to abandon the station in [Soyuz TM-25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_TM-25). Their efforts stabilised the station\u0027s air pressure, whilst the pressure in *Spektr*, containing many of Foale\u0027s experiments and personal effects, dropped to a vacuum.[^\\[22\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir#cite_note-Dragonfly-22)[^\\[58\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir#cite_note-SMH_Flights-58) In an effort to restore some of the power and systems lost following the isolation of *Spektr* and to attempt to locate the leak, [EO-24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir_EO-24) commander [Anatoly Solovyev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoly_Solovyev) and [flight engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_engineer) [Pavel Vinogradov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Vinogradov) carried out a risky salvage operation later in the flight, entering the empty module during a so-called \u0022intra-vehicular activity\u0022 or \u0022IVA\u0022 spacewalk and inspecting the condition of hardware and running cables through a special hatch from *Spektr\u0027s* systems to the rest of the station. Following these first investigations, Foale and Solovyev conducted a 6-hour EVA on the surface of *Spektr* to inspect the damage to the punctured module.-WP\n\nSafety wise it was a devastating but not catastrophic collision.

Soyuz has been designed with spacewalks in mind, so the orbital module can act as an airlock and allows entry with inflated space suit. I\u0027m not sure if they keep door to the descent module closed. If so, then it wouldn\u0027t even need to be re-pressurized, since there is an airlock. In either case, it can be.

This would basically cut off their evacuation route. Still, they would close off the decompressed modules. The crew would still have enough time to figure out a contigency strategy.
