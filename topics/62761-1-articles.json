These parts are supposedly comparable to one orange tanks surrounded by six more orange tanks - that would make them 7.5m parts, far larger than anything we\u0027ve seen so far. You can find 3.75m and 5m parts in the modding community, but this looks to be much much larger still.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, take this with a grain of salt, as interviews can be misunderstood, and even things that are true today might change tomorrow if it makes sense for the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as my opinion goes, I\u0027m not sure I understand the need for parts of this size... KSP as a whole is scaled down quite a bit from IRL. But it seems to me that a 7.5m part would be close to a life-size replica of the SLS, which as of current plans will feature a 8.4m main stage (built around a modified space shuttle external tank frame). Isn\u0027t that just a little bit big for Kerbals? And if these parts become stock, don\u0027t we need something in between? And how will they affect the difficulty of the game, considering the sheer payload capacity they\u0027ll offer? I sincerely hope that Squad will find a reasonable compromise.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Comrade Jenkens","CreatedById":59544,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-10T11:21:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still assuming that they will be 3.75m parts.
