Upon landing the craft bounced enough to cause the lander to bounce back up and impact the docking port on the ground, breaking it. In recovering from the bad landing, half the monoprop was used to recover, for the torque of the craft didn\u0027t allow for fast maneuvers. After hundreds of science was gathered, the launch was eventful, for remote tech decided to lock the craft into a targeted heading, which resulted in the craft wanting to not pitch up. Luckily I got it to pitch up enough that I only lost a solar panel, out of two. After Jeb finally got back to the pof with Bill and Bob (short eva needed), they returned home, where it was still eventful, for the service module decided that it needed to play with the pod during reentry, and flew by the pod 1 metre away.
