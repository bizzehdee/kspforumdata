By the time one reaches a speed of 900 m/s, one is often at an altitude so high, and climbing so fast, that the scramjets aren\u0027t going to be usable for much more than ten seconds. Ramjets are what I\u0027d prefer, for that particular reason. A MagLev launch-sled, simply-put, a \u003Cstrong\u003Ehorizontal\u003C/strong\u003E mass-driver, could accelerate the winged, air-breathing lower-atmospheric stage to a high enough airspeed that the ramjets could be started, propelling the plane to a high-enough speed and altitude for a scramjet/rocket hybrid to get an orbiter up into orbit, while allowing the ramjet-powered lower-atmospheric stage to fly back down and land on a runway for reuse.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
