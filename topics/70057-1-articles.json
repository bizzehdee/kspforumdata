I heard awesome comments about Fraps, so after using the free version for a while, I bought the full for just about $26. I\u0027ve actually put the free Fraps, with it\u0027s 30sec video limit, to work and produced one or two Danny2462-esque videos that way before upgrading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also experimented with Ezvid before that, and that\u0027s all the experience I\u0027ve had with free recorders!

It\u0027s totally free and gives me far better results with smaller files than I ever could get with Bandicam. It also supports twitch streaming and microphone capture. It has barely any drops in framerate for me with KSP. It\u0027s still being developed heavily, so they keep adding new features, but it\u0027s pretty restricted to what hardware it runs on. I only ever use the manual record, not the shadow record, but the idea of it is pretty cool (you can save a recording after something happens, in case of surprises that you weren\u0027t recording)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.geforce.com/geforce-experience/shadowplay\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.geforce.com/geforce-experience/shadowplay\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Billyk88","CreatedById":102725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-22T00:43:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk thank you all for the info.

So coming from experience, save up a bit and go for the paid options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: Fraps if you want to film shorter things like comedy videos and dxtory if you\u0027re going to be recording long missions, as dxtory has a feature which allows you to change the video codec: meaning you can use codecs which take up less memory after the file is saved.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Liowen","CreatedById":94498,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-22T01:21:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EACTION! from Mirillis is around $22 for the full version. It can record in MP4 for smaller video size and easier editing. It can also be used to stream if you decide to do that at a later date, though I am not sure the quality of the stream as my internet is not able to do so right now. I had a free one that I originally used but I had a lot of issues with it glitching frames in the videos, so I decided to drop some coin for a quality program and glad I did.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
