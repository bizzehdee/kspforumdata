To be clear for the non-Apple users out there: Apple does tend to use subsystems that began life on PCs, e.g., GT 750M GPUs, Intel Core CPUs, but they often put a little twist in there that can make for incompatibility and/or instability with vendor (not Apple) drivers. The big pieces tend to be fairly compatible, i.e., unmodified, the glue that holds them all together, far less so. They\u0027ve done a fair job smoothing that over with the low-level stuff that BootCamp throws in the mix for Windows, but they do nothing for Linux and as many of us who use Mac\u0027s at our day jobs for dev work are actually Linux escapees, the potential user base for Linux-on-Apple is smaller than it might otherwise be--I want to go back to that like I want to drill holes in my ankles with a rusty bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few folks asked what I\u0027m using and that is OS X 10.10.2 on a MacBook Pro 11,3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESounds like most folks are having OK times with 0.90 pre-10.10 OS X and maybe a few running OK with 0.90 on 10.10 with different hardware.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t see what\u0027s going on when KSP freezes, but nearly every crash is coming from malloc and I\u0027m seeing stock KSP exceed 2GB of RAM pretty much out the gate, therefore any mods would quickly push it to the limit of KSP-OS X, which is ironically lower than on Win.
