It\u0027s orbit is kinda eh, and it\u0027s surface is just a generic selena. What would possibly make it more interesting? Some have suggested giving it a moon, but I really don\u0027t think that\u0027d be all that interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe devs have mentioned several times that there\u0027s not likely to be a GP2, and one of NovaSilisko\u0027s proposed moons is much like the planet \u0022Inaccessible\u0022 from PlanetFactory. I think that it\u0027d be super-awesome if Dres was given a spin that equates almost orbital velocity on the surface (Not \u003Cem\u003Efaster\u003C/em\u003E than orbital velocity, like Inaccessible), and then suddenly inaccessible would be much more interesting. THis simple change would totally redefine Dres to be one of the most interesting bodies in the system! Basically, Dres\u0027s geosycronous orbit would be about 1 meter above the maximum surface. HarvesteR said he wanted the Klaw to be able to grab the ground, but he couldn\u0027t get it to work in time. Obviously you\u0027d need the Klaw to work on the ground for this to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may be thinking to yourself \u0022But that\u0027s not realistic! Planets can\u0027t spin as fast as orbital velocity!\u0022 And you\u0027re (sorta) right! That\u0027s why it\u0027s not spinning \u003Cem\u003Equite\u003C/em\u003E as fast as orbital velocity. Also, gravity is not the only thing that could hold a planet together. Normal molecular forces are at play here as well, like how rocks stay together. There\u0027s even an asteroid that is spinning almost 1.2 times orbital velocity. It\u0027s held together in sorta the same way as a chinese finger trap. Furthermore, if Dres was spinning too fast to be held together, it would have thrown off all the material until only it was left... perhaps making the Transkerbin Asteroid Belt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what are your ideas to improve Dres?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-17T19:37:02Z\u0022 title=\u002211/17/2014 07:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bv1","CreatedById":127982,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-17T19:53:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEaster eggs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-17T21:36:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just tested out this on my 3.2x config for RSS, and I think I\u0027ll include it in the next release.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-17T21:38:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bv1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022bv1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEaster eggs.\u003Cp\u003EEverywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/56293670.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002256293670.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FunnyBunny14","CreatedById":128892,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-17T22:02:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWait...
