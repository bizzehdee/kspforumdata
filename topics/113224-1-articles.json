Need some inspiration here! I am in need of developing a lander capable of carrying a FTT cargo container full of ore from the surface of minmus to a orbiting station and land again near the mining truck. I am having a creativity block and don\u0027t know how to go about doing it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI originally planned on the typical 4 legged spider design but it seems too unstable for this much mass. Though about like a plane, but the mass changes too much in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T17:29:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is funny I just saw someone post one of those just yesterday lol I think it was in \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[h=1]\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/78162-Showcase-Showoff-Your-Rep-Worthy-Crafts\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E[showcase] Showoff Your Rep-Worthy Crafts\u003C/a\u003E[/h]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewithing the first 8 pages at least\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"A_name","CreatedById":134040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T17:48:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo what\u0027s the actual problem, lack of stability upon landing?
