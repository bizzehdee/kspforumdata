At worst, you\u0027ll have new models for the surface-attachable parts that are likely going to be a bit bulkier, but I\u0027ve been taking pains to keep part names the same so it doesn\u0027t delete crafts. I already balanced Karborundum usage amounts, so I won\u0027t have another reason to change fuel costs. Although you always have to allow for unplanned things to intrude, if nothing unexpected arises there should be no major break in functionality between now and release.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pigbear","CreatedById":68791,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-05T07:18:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suspect that setting up a beacon around the sun harvesting karbondonum would make it pretty much infinite.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-05T10:32:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pigbear\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pigbear\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI suspect that setting up a beacon around the sun harvesting karbondonum would make it pretty much infinite.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only rub... is that to harvest around the sun you\u0027re looking at altitudes below 2000m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Edit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere I am going with this... is that if there\u0027s variance in your arrival point, you will probably at some point poral into the middle of a star.
