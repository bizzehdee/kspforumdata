If you can move it downwards so it doesn\u0027t stick up so high, that will help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMake sure you have turned off roll authority on your vertical stabilizer. This is really, really important . If you don\u0027t do that, it will try to help you roll the plane, which will induce yaw, so it ends up fighting itself and therefore loses much of its effectiveness in providing yaw stability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs shown, I expect that your plane is going to have real trouble getting its nose up when taking off. You\u0027ve put your rear landing gear almost directly under the only pitch controls on the plane (i.e. the ailerons on the back of the wings). Since the only way your plane can pitch up is by pushing the tail down, and since you\u0027ve put the rear gear way back there, that means it\u0027ll be hard to rotate off the ground. This, in turn, means that you\u0027ll have to get up to a really high speed on the runway before you can take off, while simultaneously putting LOTS of load on those rear gear, which is going to make you very vulnerable to bad instability while zipping down the runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a couple of ways to solve that. First, move the rear landing gear forward, closer to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E. This will make it easier to rotate the nose up during takeoff. Second, consider putting canards on the front of the plane. That helps by giving you a pitch control that works by lifting the nose rather than pushing the tail down. Just make sure to disable roll authority on the canards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, one last comment. From the wording of your post, it appears that you\u0027re under the impression that having your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E behind your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E will make you prograde-stable. That\u0027s a not the case. It\u0027s a very widespread KSP myth that a lot of players believe, but it\u0027s wrong. So don\u0027t rely on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E marker alone when you\u0027re trying to figure out stability issues. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-11T19:42:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would imagine it\u0027s wheelbarrowing \u0026amp; digging the front gear in, because the rear wheels are too far aft.
