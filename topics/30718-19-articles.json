The warmth on my leaves opens them and brings them to life. I taste the new sugars building, gathering, slowly trickling from leaf to stem to branch to trunk. I sense the cool moist soil around my roots, taste the tang of water and salts as I draw them in. The water brings other tastes with it, spiky acidity, smooth musty currents, tiny droplets of a thousand varieties of sweetness scatted through the soil. Streaks and whorls of salt criss-crossing a filigree of root fibres, the patterns an imperfectly sensed part of a greater latticework.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe latticework frays. Here a ragged break in the salt traces. There a missing cluster of droplets. Elsewhere stagnant globules of...wrongness.

And like the glass, the pattern will break if not tended to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe smells are the same. Not as rich or as varied as the many-taste soil but each one a vital part of the whole. Each one has its tale to tell for those that can read it. But now the story is jumbled. These smells do not belong together. True, that one is fading but it should not be there at all. Elsewhere, other smells are missing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy kerbal remembers the dawn. The joy of light on face, breeze in hair, smell of leaves, smell of cinnamon, smell of other kerbals. Where are the other kerbals? One tall, one small, two old; many dawns since they left. We showed the first old one many memories, we scared it although we did not mean to. We were more careful with the other old one; showed her less. Then she asked questions, too many questions, frightened by our answers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMemories of all my kerbals. Memories of all the dawns. Memories of the lattice and how to repair it. We did not share those with the old ones, how could we make them understand? I cannot find the memories. Not on my own, not without my kerbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe tried after the second old one left. My kerbal was sad - I wanted to make it happy again.

It doesn\u0027t talk with me anymore, it can\u0027t help me to remember. How many dawns since the tall one left, carrying the small one? The small one was very angry; it attacked me with its branches. I think my kerbal had a special name for it.

The company would be welcome but the thought of having to show them what I showed Donman scares me rigid. I dare not consciously remember anything now; even a simple thing like a sunrise triggers a flood of other memories. Memories of thousands of other sunrises seen through the eyes of hundreds of other kerbals.

Ferry worked the blade around an especially large clump of ragleaf; flicking the uprooted weed into the waiting basket. He chopped viciously at a patch of knotweed, breaking up the stringy green mat and burying it. He chivvied the soil around unenthusiastically with the hoe blade until it was more or less level and moved on to the next bush.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe neighbouring row was mostly hidden by dense foliage but Ferry could hear the regular scrape-scraping of hoe against soil interspersed with the thud of weed hitting basket and the clinking of steel on stone.

Startled, Ferry lifted it up to peer inside. The sweetly musty scent from the nectaries tickled the back of his throat and the heavily laden stamen peered back at him like rows of tiny eyes. \u003Cem\u003EHuh - that explains it. No silverlace, no fruit. Hmmm, wonder if we could do the pollination by hand?\u003C/em\u003E He stared at the rows of flower laden bushes. \u003Cem\u003EYeah, Fred\u0027s going to love that idea.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFerry reached the end of his row. He wiped the sweat out of his eyes, lugged his basket over to Fredlorf\u0027s tractor and dumped the weeds onto the larger pile heaped up on the trailer bed. He squatted, back braced against the trailer wheel and rolled his shoulders to relieve their stiffness. Fredlorf stumbled towards him, carrying his own basket of weeds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CReckon I\u0027ve found the problem, Fred.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou an\u0027 me both then.

Jonton cleaned every last scrap of posset out of his bowl before pushing it away with a rueful smile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI wish I could eat more of that,\u0022 he said \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cbut I\u0027m full.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle put her own spoon down.\u201CYou will be all right with solid food, won\u0027t you?\u0022\u00A0she asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton nodded. \u201CThis much will be fine,\u0022 he said, \u201Cand it\u0027s such a treat to taste \u003Cem\u003Eanything\u003C/em\u003E, let alone a meal like that!\u0022\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EI\u0027ll probably suffer for it later on but right now I don\u0027t care.\u003C/em\u003E He stifled a belch. \u201CNow, what were you saying about Ferry and Fredlorf hoeing the prickleberry fields?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey were keeping the weeds down apparently,\u0022\u00A0said Gerselle. \u201CWhich I didn\u0027t understand to start with. Then Ferry told me that the bushes were still flowering, which I didn\u0027t understand either. They should have been pollinated and fruiting by now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton closed his eyes. \u201CI was afraid of something like this,\u0022 he said. \u201CI think the Kerm has been trying to warn me for a while now but I haven\u0027t been able to talk to it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027m not surprised,\u0022 said Gerselle gently,\u0022It\u0027s a miracle that it can even warn you, let alone talk to you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh, it can talk,\u0022\u00A0Jonton said sadly. \u201CThe problem is me.\u0022\u00A0He paused to gather his thoughts. \u201CDo you remember what I said about the shards melting?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle nodded uneasily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton wrung his hands, hunting for the right words. \u201CIt\u0027s like the edges between me and the Kerm are blurring. As soon as I think of anything for more than a few seconds, I get thousands of...\u003Cem\u003Eechoes\u003C/em\u003E, of the same thing seen by hundreds of other kerbals. It gets harder and harder to tell which thoughts are mine and which are just an echo from another long dead Keeper.\u0022 His voice cracked. \u201CIt\u0027s starting to drive me crazy, Gerselle. The effort of \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E thinking about anything all day, tires me out. Then I go to sleep and I can\u0027t stop them! They\u0027re washing me away. Bit by bit they\u0027re washing me away.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle\u0027s eyes widened. \u201CWhat can...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI do?\u0022\u00A0said Jonton. He sagged against the vines wrapped around his waist. \u201CI think there\u0027s only one thing I can do, love. Stop trying to keep the shards intact and just let them melt. Put all the pieces back together, give the Kerm its voice and let it concentrate on mending the Grove.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle\u0027s eyes filled with tears. \u201CPestilence take the Grove, Jonton!

If I let go now, maybe there\u0027ll be enough of me left after the melting that...\u0022\u00A0His voice tailed away. \u201CEnough of me left that I can still remember Joenie... still be her father.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe lifted his head. \u201CAnd be there for her birthday.\u0022 He clenched his jaw. \u201CWhatever happens, I \u003Cem\u003Eswear\u003C/em\u003E I\u0027ll be there to watch her with her birthday presents!\u0022He forced a smile. \u201CI\u0027ve just thought of something else to give her. Promise me, love. Promise that you\u0027ll both be in the garden before sunrise on her birthday.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle burrowed through the Kerm leaves surrounding her husband and wrapped her arms around him. \u201CI will,\u0022 she said through her tears. \u201CI will.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe metallic chattering of the alarm clock rang in her ear. Gerselle groaned, reached out and slapped the off button. Silvery, pre-dawn light crept around the gaps in the curtains, throwing pale streaks across the floor. She rubbed her eyes and yawned, smiling despite herself at the sudden excited babble from the next room. The door burst open and Joenie hurtled across the room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CParty, Mummy, party!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle climbed out of bed and pulled on a poncho. \u201CNot yet, sweetheart, no party yet. Why don\u0027t you come out into the garden with Mummy and see your special present from Daddy?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle opened the back door, stepped out onto the porch and froze. Every single Kerm branch was draped in a softly sparkling gauzy fabric. The morning light shone through it, sending thousands of tiny rainbows dancing over each twig and shimmering fluidly over every leaf.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie\u0027s eyes lit up. \u201CButterfies, Mummy. Butterfies!\u0022\u00A0She let go of Gerselle\u0027s hand and scampered across the grass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle\u0027s eyes misted over. \u003Cem\u003EThey\u0027re beautiful Jonton. I don\u0027t know how you did this but thank you.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EFrom my window I watch Joenie darting from branch to branch, pointing at the silverlace and dragging Gerselle along behind her. Her mouth moves but from this distance I can\u0027t hear a sound. No matter; the look in her eyes tells me all I need to know. Gerselle too; she looks happy for the first time in far too many weeks.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EJoenie reaches out to touch one of the silverlace. The butterfly trembles on its leaf but does not flee. I see Gerselle talking, no doubt telling Joenie to be gentle. Both of them wide eyed as the silverlace hops onto Joenie\u0027s outstretched finger, spreading its wings towards the morning sun. Odd - I wasn\u0027t expecting that. Gerselle turns to me and smiles.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EI sense the first stirrings of warmth on my leaves. I cannot hold them much longer - they are creatures of the dawn, of cool air and dew, too delicate for the rising sun. I smile back at Gerselle, lifting my hand, palm up, to the ceiling. She nods, takes Joenie by the hand and steps back.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EI let the silverlace go.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EFloating on the breeze like a sparkling cloud of iridescent dewdrops, soaring up into the shell-blue morning sky. Twisting and swirling, the cloud breaks apart into pale rainbow streamers of glimmering gauzy wings that swirl away towards the prickleberry fields. Joenie dances on the damp grass, waving at the silverlace until, at last, they disappear; their translucent wings too distant to catch the first rays of sunlight shining through the treetops.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EI feel... content; at ease with myself for the first time in weeks.

Live bands before launch had been a tradition at the Barkton Space Centre ever since the \u003Cem\u003EMoho 1\u003C/em\u003E flight, although in Patbro\u0027s opinion, the music had a tendency to be deplorably modern. Something inspiring by Kolzt would be just as appropriate for spaceflight, or better yet, the ethereal harmonies of Gemeny\u0027s \u0027Celestial Wanderer.\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EStill\u003C/em\u003E, he thought, \u003Cem\u003Ethe Kerbin Interplanetary Society had certainly done their best to make this an event to remember; what with the press conference to unveil their new spaceship, the opening ceremony for the new exhibition building, the kerbonauts mingling with the crowds, and the extended stands. Which seem to be set \u003C/em\u003Emuch\u003Cem\u003E further back from the launch pad.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPatbro turned to admire the exhibition building again. A circle of pylons erupted from it\u0027s domed canopy, the two connected by a web of suspending cables. It should have been nothing more than a glorified tent, but somehow it managed to embody a dignified blend of traditional kerbal architecture with a distinctly space age aesthetic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThe earplugs were a nice touch too\u003C/em\u003E, he thought, \u003Cem\u003Eespecially the ones with brightly coloured rockets printed on the sides. Getting Jebediah to hand them out had been especially clever; if the first kerbal in space thought you needed earplugs for the launch, then by the Kerm, you probably \u003C/em\u003Edid\u003Cem\u003E need them.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe commentary box speakers crackled. \u0022Good afternoon everyone.

Presumably most of it was just intended for KBS viewers anyway, since nothing that Leland was saying was news to the rows of kerbals in the stands. Everyone had been to the opening ceremony, everyone had seen the eye-catching models of the new rocket, and everyone had seen the three kerbonauts riding out to the launchpad, waving enthusiastically to the crowds from their trailer. The new rocket certainly \u003Cem\u003Elooked\u003C/em\u003E much bigger, and sturdier, than the old \u003Cem\u003EMohos\u003C/em\u003E and Patbro was quite prepared to believe that it could loft three kerbals into space. \u003Cem\u003EAlthough I wouldn\u0027t fancy being stuck inside one for this long.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbsently, he surveyed the crowd around him. There were plenty of poncho-clad figures dotted around the stands and even the occasional grey robe. \u003Cem\u003EHmmm, still no sign of Jonton. Haven\u0027t seen him for the last few launches either, but I was sure he\u0027d be here to see the new rocket. \u003C/em\u003EHe gave a mental shrug.\u003Cem\u003E It\u0027s a big crowd - maybe he just came in through the other gate.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuddenly, something struck him neatly on the ear. Puzzled, he turned round to find a sheepish looking kerblet being told off by her horrified mother. He glanced down and saw a slightly crumpled Kerlington, \u0027Heroes of Duna\u0027, model rocket lying next to his feet. Smiling, he picked it up, expertly straightened out its nose cone, and handed it back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No harm done,\u0022 he said cheerfully, \u0022Good thing it wasn\u0027t going backwards though.\u0022 His eyes widened dramatically. \u0022If we\u0027d damaged the Proton Ultraboosters, she might never have flown again!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe kerblet giggled. Her mother raised her eyebrows, \u0022You sound like quite the fan, Keeper?\u0022 she said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The joys of having two young nephews,\u0022 said Patbro affably. He knelt down and bumped knuckles with the kerblet. \u0022What\u0027s your name, Commander?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Adelan!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ahhh, just like the kerbonaut,\u0022 Patbro smiled. \u0022I don\u0027t think she\u0027s flying the rocket today though.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nuh-uh,\u0022 said Adelan, \u0022Commander Ribory - she\u0027s my favourite! - Roncott and Calzer are going to space today! Their rocket is called the Eve 1 - Eve is a planet you know.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I do know,\u0022 said Patbro. \u0022You sure know lots about space, Adelan.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdelan beamed at him. \u0022I\u0027m going to be a kerbonaut too, when I grow up! Just like Jebediah and Camrie and Wilford and the other Adelan and Richlin and Joemy and Tommal and Barrie and Sherfel and...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdelan was interrupted by a burst of static from the commentary box.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And now we have confirmation from Rockomax mission control at Foxham. The \u003Cem\u003ENext Step\u003C/em\u003E is on orbit and, here at Barkton, the countdown has resumed at T minus twenty minutes.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdelan pulled on her mother\u0027s hand. Resignedly, she picked her daughter up and set her on her shoulders. Patbro smiled at them both and all three kerbals turned to watch the launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022T minus eleven minutes and counting. Capsule is on internal power, and all systems are Go as we approach the ten minute mark.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPatbro imagined the three kerbonauts squashed into their capsule. By now they\u0027d be setting their final switches, listening to the flight director run through the final steps in the countdown, and waiting for the nine minutes of controlled fury that would hurl them into orbit. He crossed his fingers behind his back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022T minus five minutes and counting. Gantry systems moving to launch positions. Commander Ribory reports: \u0022The capsule is good and we\u0027re looking forward to the flight.\u0022 \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPatbro watched the two spidery launch tower gantries: one by the capsule, the other midway up the booster. Slowly they swung clear of the spacecraft. He glanced at Adelan perched atop her mother\u0027s shoulders. The kerblet was staring raptly at the gleaming rocket standing on its launch pad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022T minus two minutes and counting. All gantry systems are at launch positions and we have a Go for engine start.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdelan tapped Patbro\u0027s shoulder. \u0022You should put your earplugs in, \u0022 she said solemnly. \u0022Jebediah told me that this rocket is going to be \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E loud.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022T minus sixty seconds. Autosequencer is Go; we have launch commit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022T minus thirty seconds.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery kerbal in the stands turned towards the launch pad. Patbro saw more than a few other kerbals around him with crossed fingers behind \u003Cem\u003Etheir\u003C/em\u003E backs. He pushed his earplugs firmly into his ears.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022T minus twenty seconds. T minus twelve, eleven, ten, nine...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022...four, three, two, one, Ignition!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBrilliant white fire boiled out of the six engine bells, rapidly coalescing into a single, blinding light amidst a dense cloud of roiling smoke.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And liftoff - we have liftoff! Eve 1 has cleared the tower!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMercifully, the earplugs muffled the noise to bearable levels but it was still an almost physical presence, battering at his chest and shaking the boards under his feet. Adelan was waving at the \u003Cem\u003EEve 1\u003C/em\u003E, her eyes shining as brightly as the torrent of fire spewing from its six engines. A thick, grey plume followed the booster out over the Great Tranquil Sea, like an enormous smoky arrow pointing the way to space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E are on orbit too. Understood, Fercan, thank you. Yes, please do keep me informed of progress. Hmmm? Oh, more than likely, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E are most adept at publicity. Thank you Fercan.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan put the phone down and checked his watch. \u003Cem\u003EJust got time to catch up on any progress at MIR before the Probodyne meeting.\u003C/em\u003E. He tucked his notes into his briefcase, dropped a pen into the plastic holder resting snugly in his shirt pocket, and set off for the laboratory wing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EStrictly speaking\u003C/em\u003E, thought Lodan, \u003Cem\u003EMIR should be renamed for the duration of this project.\u003C/em\u003E The large map pinned to the long wall of the Munar Imaging and Reconnaissance laboratory was decked out in shades of greens, browns and yellows rather than the more usual greyscale. Each of Kerbin\u0027s continents and major island clusters were numbered and marked out with a red dotted border. A set of correspondingly numbered maps adorned the remaining wall space, each overlaid with a ruled grid. The upper left corners of each grid square was marked with a four digit code. Some of them had a second number; hand-written in a box in the bottom right corner. The matching boxes in the bottom left hand corners were, so far, all empty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan frowned. The numbered squares were supposed to be set out in vertical bands but instead they were striped diagonally across the maps. He did a swift mental calculation and nodded grimly. Even now the numbers were clear. \u003Cem\u003EFar too many Groves and not enough space left. We\u0027ll have to count up how many new Groves we can fit in soon, but that\u0027s going to let the gronnek out the bag for sure.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalf of the room was taken up by a row of data consoles, each occupied by a serious looking kerbal staring intently at his or her screen. The operators all sported a large headset clamped over their ears and Lodan could just make out the faint strains of music, made tinny by the headphones. The nearest operator scribbled a number on the checklist next to his keyboard, blanked his screen and then called up a new map square.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan watched in fascination as the operator deftly spun his trackball, marking the corners of the map with little blue flags. The trackball button clicked rapidly and three small white circles appeared on the map. The operator tapped a key and leaned back in his chair. There was a brief pause, a row of lights flickered on the console and the screen began to fill up with an overlaid grid of grey circles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan nodded to himself. \u003Cem\u003EGood thinking. Evenly spaced Groves is a reasonable starting assumption, so a first pass automated count should be quite efficient.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe spotted the opening door reflected in the glass screen, and flicked a sideways glance at the young bespectacled kerbal standing in the doorway. Aldsen studied the row of monitors for a moment then came over to join him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022My office, Director?\u0022 he asked quietly. Lodan nodded and followed him into a small windowless cubicle that was largely occupied by a desk and a pair of enormous filing cabinets. Aldsen carefully lifted a stack of printouts off the one spare chair, and indicated that Lodan should take a seat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What can I do for you, Director?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Very little at the moment,\u0022 said Lodan. \u0022I was here out of curiosity rather than any concerns abut the project.\u0022 He pointed through Aldsen\u0027s office window at the row of consoles in the main laboratory. \u0022I\u0027m impressed - an automated first count wouldn\u0027t have occurred to me.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It certainly speeds things up,\u0022 replied Aldsen. \u0022And it ought to compensate for the problems we\u0027ve been having with the satellite.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan blinked. \u0027Go on,\u0022 he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldsen laced his hands behind his head and stared at his desk for a moment. \u0022Stuck actuator on the MCP - sorry, motion compensating platform,\u0022 he said. \u0022We tried everything we could think of from here: hammering the actuator, spinning the vehicle to shake any debris loose, angling it to keep the actuator out of direct sunlight. Doesn\u0027t seem to be an electrical problem either, so our best guess is that the platform rail has buckled somehow; either during the flight or through unanticipated thermal expansion on-orbit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe looked up wearily. \u0022We\u0027ll re-work the design of course, but in the meantime, we\u0027ve got a busted bird up there.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The platform was supposed to compensate for Kerbin\u0027s rotation wasn\u0027t it?\u0022 said Lodan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldsen nodded. \u0022Yes. The idea was to line up the images on each pass. A nice pole-to-pole strip of constant longitude to simplify the eventual map synthesis.\u0022 He shrugged, \u0022So much for that plan. We did wonder about using the reaction wheels instead but they\u0027re not really set up for that kind of fine pointing.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I presume you\u0027re just using a new shutter sequence then,\u0022 said Lodan. \u0022Capturing images stepwise in both latitude and longitude.\u0022 He smiled faintly at Aldsen\u0027s carefully concealed look of surprise. \u0022I wondered why you were filling in the map along diagonal stripes.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It makes the image registration harder, \u0022 replied Aldsen, \u0022and it\u0027s taking longer to collect all the data. It\u0027s the best we can do though.\u0022 He paused, \u0022Why are we doing this Director? It\u0027s interesting enough as a technical challenge, but who on Kerbin is this interested in counting Kerm groves?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan shrugged. \u0022President Obrick didn\u0027t see fit to tell me, \u0022 he said, \u0022I decided this was a good time to follow instructions without asking too many questions.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThat doesn\u0027t sound like you, Lodan\u003C/em\u003E. \u0022I suppose so,\u0022 said Aldsen slowly, \u0022but I\u0027m still kinda curious.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan eyed him thoughtfully. \u0022Trust me,\u0022 he said, \u0022I\u0027ll let you know as soon as I hear anything.\u0022 He stood up. \u0022For now, please excuse me; I have a meeting with the Probodyne management team in ten minutes.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldsen stood up too. \u0022Of course, Director. Let me show you out.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDunney was already waiting for him in the meeting room. Tall, almost lanky by kerbal standards and sporting an old fashioned drooping moustache, Dunney was the instantly recognisable face of professional astronomy on Kerbin. For all his slightly old-fashioned public persona, Lodan knew him to be a skilled team leader, with a well earned reputation in planetary geology. Spaceflight was revolutionising that particular field: which until recently had depended on a combination of ingenious instrumentation, patient mapping, and more than a little educated guesswork.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ah, Director. It\u0027s good to see you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDespite himself, Lodan smiled. \u0022It\u0027s good to see you too, Professor. But please, this is an informal meeting.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Lodan and Dunney it is then! So what brings you to our corner of the Space Centre on this, quite frankly, miserable day?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022A need for some professional advice, Dunney - and some help saving the world.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDunney rubbed his hands together. \u0022Well that should brighten up the day nicely. Professional advice I can do right now, saving the world might take a little longer!\u0022 Then he caught sight of Lodan\u0027s expression and his smile slipped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027re serious aren\u0027t you?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan dipped his head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022In that case, I think we\u0027d better wait for the rest of my errant team to arrive. This sounds like the kind of thing we should only discuss once.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe awkward silence was broken by the meeting room door bursting open and disgorging three out of breath kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sorry we\u0027re late, Dunney. Took longer than expected to work through the new perturbations for the Muna 3 orbit, but Germore\u0027s new AMC model is looking promising!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good, good,\u0022 said Dunney, \u0022but, fascinating as they are, we can talk about anomalous mass concentrations later. For now, I believe we are needed for other matters.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan locked the door and studied the new arrivals. Jernie and Sidbo, he knew, were two of Dunney\u0027s students who\u0027d chosen to come with him to the KSA. Both had been heavily involved in designing and building the \u003Cem\u003EMuna 3\u003C/em\u003E. Apparently Germore\u0027s work was more theoretical; he didn\u0027t know her personally, although the fact that Dunney had recommended her spoke volumes for her competence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll four kerbals took a seat. Lodan poured water for everyone, before taking his place at the head of the table.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022First things first,\u0022 he said, once everyone had had a chance to settle. \u0022I\u0027m afraid I haven\u0027t been entirely fair to you all, and for that I owe you an apology.\u0022 Jernie, Sidbo and Germore stared at him in polite confusion, whilst Dunney looked at him expressionlessly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I will also need to insist on absolute confidentiality for some of the things we\u0027re about to discuss. If anyone feels unable to guarantee this, I would appreciate it if you left the room now. Please be assured that this is an informal meeting and however you choose to proceed, your decision will not go beyond these four walls.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNobody moved. Lodan nodded in satisfaction, retrieved a sheaf of papers from his briefcase and dropped them on the table. The front page of each document was prominently marked Confidential and stamped with the Seal of Twelve Pillars. Jernie, Sidbo and Germore stared at him wide eyed, and even Dunney looked taken aback.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thank you everyone. Please read these carefully before signing them.\u0022 The corner of Lodan\u0027s mouth twitched in a brief half smile. \u0022I think you\u0027ll find them to be remarkably self-explanatory - and quite succinct for legal documents.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe room was quiet apart from the rustling of turning pages and then, one by one, the scratching of pens, as each kerbal signed his or her agreement. Silently, they passed them back to Lodan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thank you. Now, to start the meeting proper, I have one question. If you needed to set up an off-world colony in ten years, where would you go?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDunney\u0027s jaw dropped. \u0022Off-world \u003Cem\u003Ecolony\u003C/em\u003E. Great Kerm, we\u0027ve barely made it to Munar orbit - and there with half a handful of the lightest probes we could build!\u0022 He shook his head. \u0022We\u0027re not going to be building a colony \u003Cem\u003Eanywhere\u003C/em\u003E in this \u003Cem\u003Ecentury\u003C/em\u003E, let alone in ten years!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Normally I would agree with you,\u0022 Lodan said quietly, \u0022but it appears we have no choice.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEveryone listened silently as Lodan laid it all out. Donman\u0027s revelations to the Twelve Pillars; Jonton\u0027s story and the history of kerbalkind; and finally, the significance of the Blighted areas, and the sudden, desperate race against time that they faced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDunney recovered first. \u0022Saving the world indeed,\u0022 he murmured. \u0022I presume you intend us to be the scouting party?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes,\u0022 said Lodan. \u0022I propose to turn the Probodyne team into a semi-autonomous branch of the KSA. Eventually, I hope you\u0027ll become an independent organisation, but for now, we simply cannot afford to have your work held up by the uncertainties of commercial considerations. Your remit has just doubled, good kerbals. Not only will you be responsible for building our robotic probes, but you will also be tasked with using them to find us a new home within the Kerbol system.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So we\u0027re Probo-double-dyne now?\u0022 said Jernie.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I think Probodobodyne sounds better,\u0022 said Sidbo, with a straight face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGermore glanced at Lodan but fortunately the director seemed to be taking the comments in good humour. \u003Cem\u003EAll the same...\u003C/em\u003E \u0022How many probes did you have in mind, Director?\u0022 she asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022As many as we need, I would imagine,\u0022 said Dunney, \u0022but the powers-that-be will doubtless prefer us to prioritise.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So we\u0027re going to Duna.\u0022 said Jernie briskly. \u0022The Mun is no good for a colony, Minmus not much better, Eve... no thanks, and everything else is either too far away, or just a lump of orbiting rock.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E they\u0027re lumps of rock,\u0022 corrected Dunney. \u0022We hardly \u003Cem\u003Eknow\u003C/em\u003E anything about them at all.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jool isn\u0027t a lump of rock either,\u0022 said Lodan. He saw the disbelieving looks around the table. \u0022Probodyne will investigate \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E necessary options. If the only viable colony site is Jool\u0027s upper atmosphere, then that is where we\u0027ll be going.\u0022 He sipped his water. \u0022Although I devoutly hope that you can find an easier site to work with.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What about Laythe?\u0022 said Sidbo. \u0022The LOST guys have found water and ozone there, which means oxygen.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJernie shook her head, \u0022Too far,\u0022 she said, \u0022and Kerm knows what the radiation will be like. Plus, the LOST results don\u0027t say anything about liquid water - that close to Jool, I\u0027m betting on surface hydrates.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Duna could have surface hydrates too,\u0022 Sidbo pointed out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022With that albedo at the poles?\u0022 scoffed Jernie, \u0022C\u0027mon Sid - we\u0027ve been through all this.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, but what about the atmosphere?\u0022 said Sidbo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJernie shrugged. \u0022Thin most likely, but hopefully enough for Kerm, if not kerbals.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You hope!\u0022 said Sidbo. \u0022I still think Laythe is a better option.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I think we could probably go to both,\u0022 said Germore quietly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDunney tapped on the table for attention. \u0022Germore makes a good point,\u0022 he said dryly. \u0022We could always go to Laythe \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E Duna.\u0022 He raised an eyebrow. \u0022And much as I\u0027d hate to see hard facts spoil a perfectly good running debate, we \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E just been tasked with uncovering those facts.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan listened as the conversation turned to technical matters: instrument packages, trajectories and launch windows, the feasibility of landers and and a debate about the ability of photovoltaic panels to power a Laythe-bound probe, which showed every sign of progressing from debate to heated argument. He tapped the table firmly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That will be all, thank you.\u0022 He ticked off their conclusions on his fingers. \u0022Very well then. Probodyne is expanding to meet the needs of a new KSA robotic exploration programme. Primary programme goals are purely scientific; secondary goals are to scout for resources; real goals not to be disclosed at this time. First two missions are to send orbital probes to Duna and Laythe; these will be followed by landers, should they be deemed necessary. Probe instruments will include cameras, spectrometers and gravimeters.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan looked around the table. \u201CDoes anyone have any questions?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo everyone\u0027s surprise, Germore raised her hand. \u201CI don\u0027t have any questions, Director, but I do have a suggestion. We should increase the initial number of missions to three, and send a probe to Minmus. It\u0027s unlikely to be unsuitable as a colony site, but we have good reason to believe that there is accessible water there, which will be an invaluable resource for the colonisation effort. Besides, to outside observers, it would seem strange to start an ostensibly scientific programme by going to Duna and Jool, whilst neglecting an obvious, and much closer, target.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDunney nodded, \u201CI concur.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan nodded too. \u003Cem\u003EGood to see that one of them has some sense.\u003C/em\u003E \u201CAgreed. I want to see budgets and development charts for all three probes by the end of the week. Dunney, we need to discuss staffing and other resources for Probodyne. Tomass will be able to find you the next space in my calendar.\u0022 He pushed his chair back. \u201CWe have a lot to do, good kerbals - I suggest we make a start.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Cem\u003EMoho\u003C/em\u003E flights had proved that a multi-kerbal crew was not technically required for a successful orbital rendezvous, but according to the \u003Cem\u003EEve 1\u003C/em\u003E flight plan, all such manoeuvres were to be treated as a \u0027crew coordination exercise.\u0027 In Ribory\u0027s opinion, the exercise was going remarkably well, all things considered. She nudged the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E hand controller, neatly halting her spacecraft relative to the distant \u003Cem\u003ENext Step\u003C/em\u003E. At this range, it was nothing more than a set of numbers on the radar display.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFlight, Eve 1.

Across the capsule, Calzer\u0027s attention was fixed on the view through the rendezvous window; his gaze flicking back and forth, as he searched for any signs of the other spacecraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRibory glanced at the radar display. \u201CSixty kilometres and closing, Flight. Circularisation data please, Roncott.\u0022 She nudged the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E controls, lining up \u003Cem\u003EEve 1\u003C/em\u003E for the burn. Then, at last, Calzer caught a sudden flash of sunlight on metal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFlight, Eve 1. Got a bright light here. Looks too big for a star and too bright for a planet.

Please proceed to one hundred metres.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRoncott automatically reached for his keyboard. \u201CCopy that, Flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom two hundred metres out, the \u003Cem\u003ENext Step\u003C/em\u003E was clearly visible as a dark, blunt cone, perched atop a gleaming base. Calzer watched it drift closer and closer, and then two lines of running lights lit up alongside the capsule windows. Ribory fired a burst from \u003Cem\u003EEve 1\u0027s\u003C/em\u003E thrusters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFlight, Eve 1.

She worked the attitude thrusters in short precise bursts, lining up the two rows of lights with a matching pair of slanted lines painted on the rendezvous window. She gave the translation controller a quick squeeze for luck and then fired the aft thrusters. The \u003Cem\u003ENext Step\u003C/em\u003E began to drift slowly towards them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EFifty metres to go... forty metres...thirty metres...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Cem\u003EEve 1\u003C/em\u003E crew held their breath as the \u003Cem\u003ENext Step\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s docking port loomed ever larger in the window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ETen metres...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a muffled clank and then the capsule shuddered with a welcome ripple-bang of docking latches snapping shut. Ribory exhaled sharply and was amused to hear similar sighs of relief from Roncott and Calzer. The distant cheering from Mission Control filled her headset.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFlight, Eve 1.

You\u0027re Go, Ribory.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRibory pulled the hatch lever down. The locking bolts retracted with a clunk and a brief hiss of air. She lifted the hatch out of it\u0027s frame, stowed it under the capsule seats and flipped herself over to face the open tunnel between the two spacecraft. A space helmet of unfamiliar design blocked the opposing hatchway, visor open, and it\u0027s owner grinning cheerfully back at her. Together, the two kerbonauts reached up, removed their head gear, and then clasped hands.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood to see you up here!

Welcome aboard!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRibory backed away, and Jondun nimbly followed her. She looked around the \u003Cem\u003EEve 1\u003C/em\u003E with great interest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNice capsule you\u0027ve got here, guys.

She gestured at the hatch where a fifth kerbal had just poked his head through. \u201CThis is Kerke.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerke waved at everyone. \u201CHey, folks.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTell you what,\u0022 said Jondun, \u201CWhy don\u0027t you move back a bit, Kerke, and let Ribory take a peek at the \u003Cem\u003ENext Step\u003C/em\u003E. That way there\u0027s enough room for everyone down here. Dunno how you make them over at Barkton, but if your couches are anything like ours, I\u0027m betting Roncott could do with stretching his legs!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRibory laughed. \u201CSounds like you make them the same way we do.\u0022 She grabbed a handhold and followed Kerke through the tunnel. \u201CYour life-support people do a better job than ours though - I never figured a capsule could smell this good after a day on orbit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerke reached up, unclipped something from the capsule wall and handed it to her. \u201CHerbs,\u0022 he explained. \u201CThe \u003Cem\u003EEndurance\u003C/em\u003E crews liked having them around so much, that they became a bit of a tradition.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNow \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E,\u0022 said Ribory, \u201Cis one idea that we\u0027re definitely going to borrow.

He removed his helmet and blinked shyly at Jondun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHi, Roncott.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHi, Jondun.\u0022 \u003Cem\u003EKerm, what do I say now?\u003C/em\u003E \u201CUm, I like your badge.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJondun looked nonplussed. \u201CBadge? Oh right - the mission patches? Yeah, they\u0027re a bit of a Rockomax tradition too.\u0022 She grinned, \u201CGlad you like them - we brought a couple of spares for you.\u0022 She reached into her leg pocket and pulled out three stiff fabric discs. She handed one each to Roncott and Calzer and flipped the third one end-over-end towards Ribory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRibory inspected the patch curiously. A braided rope circle was embroidered on a black background. Inside the circle, stylised versions of the \u003Cem\u003EEve 1\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003ENext Step\u003C/em\u003E flew nose to nose over Kerbin\u0027s horizon. The word CORDS was emblazoned at the top of the patch, and her name at the bottom. The other four kerbonaut\u0027s names were written around the sides.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow very appropriate - thank you, Jondun! We brought a souvenir for you and Kerke too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCalzer reached under his couch and retrieved a small, engraved silver plaque, mounted on a disc of polished Kerm wood. \u201CKerm wood for good luck,\u0022 \u00A0he said, handing it over to Kerke.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerke looked at the plaque closely. Like the mission patches it depicted the two spacecraft flying nose to nose over Kerbin. Both capsules were picked out in fine detail, and Kerke ran his fingers gently over the delicate cross-hatched shadow around the \u003Cem\u003ENext Step\u0027s\u003C/em\u003E engine bell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis is beautifully done.

See if you can dig out the good rations would you, Calzer? And we should probably switch the camera on too, for the good folks back home.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdemone leaned against the balcony rail and smiled to herself as she watched the main monitor screen.
