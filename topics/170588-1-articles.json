flights, and starting a reentry descent with a bunch of heat built up from the ascent makes me nervous. \u00A0This goes especially for Whiplash-driven spaceplanes, which tend to have a more aggressive ascent profile than R.A.I.P.I.E.R.-driven spaceplanes due to them needing to build up more speed in thicker parts of the atmospheric where more heating happens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote

to colder things.\u00A0 Thus, radiators only work if they\u0027re hotter than their surroundings.\u00A0\u00A0When burning through an atmosphere, the flames outside are hotter than the ship.\u00A0 And radiators, due to their surface area - to - mass, are just as good at absorbing heat from hotter surroundings as they are at radiating heat away into colder surroundings.\u00A0 Thus, sticking a radiator into reentry plasma would pump heat into the ship, not radiate it away.\u00A0 I suspect this is why your test ship exploded sooner when you added radiators to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for how heat flows within a ship and various radiators work, that\u0027s kinda complicated.\u00A0 Inside a ship, heat flows from hotter parts to colder parts via conduction, until every part has the same temperature.\u00A0 But this heat flow depends on the\u00A0the specific heats and masses of the parts involved, as well as their surface area-to-mass ratios, so the speed of heat propagation through a ship varies with the parts involved.\u00A0 Also, part heat is divided into 2 types, surface and core, which function semi-independently, again based on the thermal properties of the parts.\u00A0 Surface heat tends to move around a lot faster than core heat, and (IIRC) surface heat can exceed the explosion temperature of the part for a while---it\u0027s the core temperature (I think) that causes explosions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway,. fixed radiators are only \u0022connected\u0022 to the part they\u0027re attached to, so indeed only really apply any cooling to that one part.\u00A0 The heat from other parts only gets into the radiators and then out of the ship by the natural conductive processes, so fixed radiators have more impact on the more mobile surface component of part heat.\u00A0 Surface heat eventually raises core temperatures so getting rid of it sooner keeps core temps lower overall.\u00A0\u00A0But surface heat comes mostly from sunlight and atmospheric friction.\u00A0 As noted above, radiators should be counterproductive during atmospheric friction so the main good of fixed radiators is on the shady side of things close to the sun, or on the underside (in the shade) of nuke-powered, low-speed (as in non-flaming) aircraft whose non-stock nuke jets get hotter than stock LV-Ns.\u00A0 Such as the nuke jet in Mk2 Expansion.\u00A0 But they can survive flight speeds and cost zero EC/sec.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRetractable radiators have a ship-wide plumbing system for coolant that costs EC/sec to pump around.\u00A0 But it goes to every part of the ship and reduces core part heat directly.\u00A0 Thus, heat from all parts\u00A0 moves to the radiators quickly, so these radiators frequently become quite hot themselves, which is a good thing.\u00A0 The greater the temperature difference between the radiator and its surroundings, the faster heat leaves the radiator into the surroundings.\u00A0 This is another advantage of retractable radiators, as fixed radiators rarely get more than luke warm due to the comparatively slow rate of heat flow into the part they\u0027re attached

the fuel flow much if at all, and/or the\u00A0reactor\u0027s rate of temperature\u00A0change is very slow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet us assume the Boffins\u00A0designed the NTR so that when its reactor\u00A0is cranking out its max heat release rate, and the fuel is moving\u00A0at its max flow rate, the engine is producing both its max thrust and max Isp, AND the fuel is carrying away enough reactor heat to keep the reactor\u00A0below its explody temperature indefinitely.\u00A0 \u00A0It might get a bit toasty but reaches a certain temperature and stops there, well below\u00A0its material limits.\u00A0 Thus, no radiators needed when the engine is operating in this regime.\u00A0 And it really makes no sense to design the engine any other way.\u00A0 If the reactor can get hotter than the fuel pumps can cool, you have too much reactor or too little fuel flow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, if the fuel system can provide adequate cooling (as in not needing radiators) when the reactor is as hot as it can get, then keeping the reactor cool at lower temperatures is no problem for it.\u00A0 Thus, the engine has no keep-it-from-exploding need for radiators at all, regardless of reactor output.\u00A0 But that\u0027s only considering the internal workings of the engine.\u00A0 We also have to worry about fuel mileage, which is the whole point of using NTRs to begin\u00A0with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the fuel flow can be controlled in an essentially analog manner, then it can be scaled to match the heat output of the reactor at any point on its temperature curve and there\u0027s still\u00A0no physical need for radiators.\u00A0 And if the reactor\u0027s temperature increases and decreases fast enough (which depends on the design of the reactor), flowing fuel to produce less-than-max thrust and/or Isp might be of insignificant consequence.\u00A0 OTOH, if you\u0027re stuck with always flowing fuel at or near max rate, and/or the reactor heats and/or cools slowly, then spewing fuel for reactor cooling in non-optimum temperature regimes will get expensive, not only because most of the reaction mass isn\u0027t getting as much energy as it can take, but also because excessive fuel flow will slow the heating of the reactor to max temp and speed its cooling at the back end, so the non-optimal regimes last longer.\u00A0 In this case, providing whatever pre- and post-optimum cooling is necessary with radiators would be better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHOWEVER, then the radiators would be scaled (within mass trade-offs) to handle all the non-optimal regimes.\u00A0 In which case, the actual time when you\u0027re flowing fuel would be wholly within the optimal regime or close enough, so then the thrust/Isp output would really be a step function or close enough.\u00A0 In which case the NTR is the functional equivalent (as far as the game is concerned) of an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and
