I got into an 80x80 orbit heading 270 deg around kerbin and when turning off SAS it behaved almost as it does at about 40k. The craft started to sideslip and pitch up etc (engines shut down of course) and the pitch up tendency increased with increasing AoA, as if it still was in the atmosphere. The orbit however wasn\u0027t affected and no parts seemed to register drag. For a while i thought the atmosphere had been extended since I had to struggle quite a bit to keep the craft pointing in the prograde direction. The forces could actually be noticed with SAS on too. When timewarping at x5, x10, x50 etc it dissapeared. I have never seen this before.
