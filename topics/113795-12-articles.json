The mass of the aircraft was roughly twice what it needed to be, and the mass was shifted towards the rear of the aircraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe clipped wings added weight and drag, and did not provide any additional lift. I removed the extra pair of wings and replaced them with control surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI added a communotron to extend the front hub. I think that\u0027s the look that you were going for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe FAR settings for the control surfaces were causing your craft to stall constantly. I optimised them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI set up some spoilers so that it can land safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rear canard shifted the center of lift too far behind the center of mass. They were really hurting your design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe structural intakes cause drag and serve no function. But they look cool, so I kept them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI added struts to reinforce the structurally risky areas. The craft no longer flexes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI added drogue chutes so that you perform short landings. For example, on the island or KerbinSide\u0027s aircraft carrier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI added basic action groups. Press 1 when you want to use the drogue chutes. Press 5 when you go transonic and press 4 when you\u0027re below mach 0.8 again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith these very minor changes I think that you have one of the nicest light fighters in this competition. It\u0027s a good design! It\u0027s stable up to Mach 4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main limiting factor in your design is the stock wings and control surfaces. They suck. The stock swept wings especially suck. If you replace the wings with B9 procedural wings then it performs amazingly well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/EfFv9\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Despite all the \u0022experts\u0022 saying that fights will be fought BVR, these BVR missiles can\u0027t keep up with the advancement of jamming and countermeasure technology. BVR missiles have hit rates in single digit percentages. And when jets are flying at Mach 2 towards each other, it goes from BVR to visual range in a matter of minutes. Let\u0027s say, hypothetically the F22 engages with an Su-35. The F22 fires its long range armament, however the 35 dodges the missiles with ease. Or maybe, the 35 uses its radar jamming tech. Whatever it is, it will turn into a within visual range fight quickly, and then maneuverability really matters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour design can already reach Mach IV with ease, at which point it explodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModern fighters operate between mach 1 and mach 2.

Lets look at historical examples of great energy fighters, or Boom and Zoom fighters. The FW-190D9 by far one of the best BnZ fighters in history. It had a phenomenal roll rate better than anything the Allies had during the war. This aloud it to pull off surprisingly quick reversals and get the shot then climb away before anything could counter it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext we could look at the Me/Bf-109G6, again, another light weight aircraft that had a great roll rate, and actually could turn pretty decently under high speeds, but suffered at lower speeds. This mated with its power to weight ratio, it could pull itself out of most fights if it needed to. The 109G6 manual even said, \u0022when in trouble point your nose towards the heavens and climb like a home sick angel.\u0022 The G6 had a 4200fpm climb rate, when the next best allied aircraft could only manage 3700fpm. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly we could look at my personal favorite, the P-47D Thunderbolt. That thing was a TRUE energy fighter. If the jug was caught low, it was dead. But if it had the altitude advantage it would kill anything in the air. And because the Thunderbolt accelerated in a dive like a brick dropped by god, it could retain that energy into a mild climb. But if you asked it to turn it would burn that energy faster than a forest fire through a kindling factory.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketTurtle","CreatedById":67534,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T17:54:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hodo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hodo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E faster than a forest fire through a kindling factory.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat one\u0027s new.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in all seriousness, I agree.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
