Lots and lots of it. \n\n- Have split off the DOS, COS, HAB parts that were created through patches into their own config files.  Creates a bit more overhead, but makes it quite a bit easier to differentiate things on a per-part basis.\n- Lots of cleanup on the stats/balance/resources on DOS, COS parts.  HAB are still a bit undecided (mass, resources, crew #, etc), but should have something in place for the next release.  Mass and resource volumes for the DOS and COS parts should be at their initial balance point though.  Cost and tech-tree placement are still WIP, mostly pending some research time (cost) and feedback (tech-placement).\n- Reworked the preliminary \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS patch for DOS parts, created one for COS parts, and have started on the setup for the HAB parts.  Very much WIP, but I\u0027ve got a spreadsheet setup for easy and accurate balance calculations, so shouldn\u0027t be too hard to tune them to where they need to be.\n- Centrifuge parts are being split off from the HAB series, into their own series (ST-CFG).  This is a WIP, and will still be for the next release.  As the models for them are finished up they will be moved/renamed to their final setup.\n- Added inverted-adapter support to lots more parts, still a bit WIP/ongoing as I\u0027m sure I\u0027ve missed a few spots that could use them.\n- Removed the \u0027prototype\u0027 tags from many of the not-so-prototype parts (DOS, COS, HAB, DSP, MST).  Balance on them is not yet final, but they shouldn\u0027t be receiving any more game/craft breaking changes (that I\u0027m aware of... always room for surprises).\n- Merged in quite a few PR\u0027s from Jimbodiah for various fixes and updates to match stock behavior and expectations for several parts (comms/transmitter/categories).  Thanks for the help!\n\nSadly no pics/etc as it is some very boring work.  Was hoping to do a mid-week pack and release of this stuff, but the work continues.  Apparently quite a bit of this stuff was in bad shape and in need of cleanup.  Next release should be much more usable as far as balance goes."},{"CreatedByName":"mechanicH","CreatedById":167929,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-02T18:52:15Z","Content":"[http://imgur.com/a/A6w0P](http://imgur.com/a/A6w0P)\n\nOK one last one, ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)   creative juices are flowing, and i need to share it with you wonderful people."},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-02T20:17:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, mechanicH said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [http://imgur.com/a/A6w0P](http://imgur.com/a/A6w0P)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E OK one last one, ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)   creative juices are flowing, and i need to share it with you wonderful people.\n\u003E \n\nNice!

The kerbal is uncontrollable and the log is continually spammed with errors.  FlightEVA.onGoForEVA() is where the error is occuring, but as that method doesn\u0027t even have any input parameters I have exactly zero information on what the problem is or could be.\n\nIf I had to guess (and apparently I do...) I would wager that there is some cached field somewhere for the airlock transform that isn\u0027t getting updated/set properly when the part initializes.  Going to do a bit of poking and investigation, possible API scraping, hoping to find a field that looks airlock related.\n\nThe X-Short COS module will still be available (even if airlock adapters don\u0027t work out), however will only be available in the HAB variant, and only has capacity for a single crew member (subject to balance changes)."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-04T00:04:30Z","Content":"What\u0027s the point of an extra small COS module from a gameplay POV?
