Essentially making a timer that is based on the number of scientists assigned and there respective levels, and the cost in science points of a node, that must complete before you actually unlock said node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(from a role play perspective the science earned would represent all the raw data you have collected from experiments and such, this would keep experiments, planning missions to go collect science, as a still necessary game mechanic.

You can go into the R\u0026amp;D building and unlock nodes, but then once you leave the R\u0026amp;D building it has a timer that counts down before the node actually becomes unlocked, the time is based on the expense of the node and an upgradable research speed stat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome thing else that could be cool as an additional hard mode, like the stock games setting where you can research a node but then need to pay to unlock each individual part, would be using my above suggestion with scientists researching and unlocking nodes, but then needing scientists and engineers to actually develop the parts in that node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways just some ideas and suggestions that I\u0027m tossing out there \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-13T22:46:28Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2015 10:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Akira_R\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EI can grammar\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"daniel l.","CreatedById":57763,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T22:58:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you going to add military contracts?
