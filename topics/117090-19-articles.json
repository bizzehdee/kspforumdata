The image you have provided above is about the only one I\u0027ve ever come across, and each engine will have its own hot-spot areas due to differences in how they are engineered (such as some having fully cooled nozzles, others ablative, others purely radiative).

Would require some minor plugin/code changes to accommodate, but as there is already a scale field, I should be able to relatively easily turn it into a proper Vector3 to allow for per-axis scaling. Or even just create a second field for verticalScale that defaults to the regular scale value for that adapter. I just really don\u0027t want to create another set of adapters (right now)... doing the initial set and then trying to do the engine mount adapters nearly killed me (or my motivation at least). Certainly a possibility though, and with the way the plugin is set up these should be very clean and easy to add in at any point in the future. On that note, I need to spend a day or two and finish adding all the rest of the adapters/couplers to the new tanks too (I was just too lazy to figure out all the scales and attach node positions for the initial release of those tank sizes for that many adapters).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrev (tank/cap/texture) buttons -- Have already added a \u0027Prev Main Tank\u0027 button, and should be able to get the other buttons added.
