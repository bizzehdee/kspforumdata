Should only need 1 decoupler per booster, and you can right-click on the decoupler for all sorts of options (such as setting the vertical spacing between the mounts). And the rings should be wrapped around the booster (unless that is all just the joint weirdness you are talking about).\n\nJoints -- they still use stock joint mechanics, so you will likely still need struts with large payloads. Nothing that I can (reasonably) do about it. KJR is generally the solution to joint wobbliness. However, I did set them to some pretty extreme breaking force/torque values, so they may noodle around a bit more than most other parts / not break very easily.\n\nEmissives: Sadly, the resources that I have found regarding how engine bells glow are,.... non-existent. The image you have provided above is about the only one I\u0027ve ever come across, and each engine will have its own hot-spot areas due to differences in how they are engineered (such as some having fully cooled nozzles, others ablative, others purely radiative). That particular engine appears to be the RL-10-B, so is a good representative of the ICPS engine, but would not work so well applied to other engines.\n\nIf you can provide images/resources for how each of the engines glow, I will gladly look into implementing a more realistic glow pattern on the new engines (-not- changing the existing stuff, though you are more than welcome to if you want... I can provide the original/pre-dds .png files if you need).\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Yah, the things and pace you\u0027re developing here are both brilliant.

Probably doesn\u0027t help that I spend possibly unhealthy amounts of time modding, and little time doing any playing/relaxing anymore. Yah, I do need to learn to ignore/dismiss requests... but it is hard for me. I don\u0027t like saying no without a valid reason, and for some reason \u0027because I don\u0027t want to\u0027 just doesn\u0027t seem valid enough to me (though, really, it needs to be).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I understand, as long as your not giving up on them and you plan to do them eventually in the near future (by near I mean (NOT giving you a deadline nor did I mean to offend) around a year). I didn\u0027t take any offense also, I like the SLS parts and the decoupler.\n\nThanks, and no offense taken (and none was intended). No, I\u0027m not giving up on the parts, nor have I any intent of leaving things in an unfinished state. Just have so many things to do / planned, that it may be awhile before it is all finished up.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So, I used SSTU parts to make a Duna Descent \u002B Ascent Vehicle or DDAV. \n\u003E [snip for brevity]\n\u003E \n\u003E It would be cool to have a conical shaped landing pod shaped like this, but with no ablator etc etc, but I\u0027m happy enough!\n\u003E \n\u003E Without SSTU parts (particularly fiddling around with the hollow tanks and tweakables), this would not have been possible (or at least, not look quite so awesome).\n\nSimply epic! Love seeing creations like that, especially with un-intended uses for parts. Glad you are getting some good use out the parts.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m pretty much settled on my launcher list with Vostok and Soyuz for light stuff, Jarvis for medium payloads, SLS and Saturn V for heavy and Saturn MLV for the insane stuff. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\u003E with current SSTU release I have SLS, and some bits for Jarvis and Saturn, can\u0027t wait to be able to have full Jarvis and Saturn using SSTU ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E here\u0027s something I threw together quickly (KW, FASA, SSTU and Procedural Fairings):\n\nAwesome ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Whats the lift capacity on that beast?\n\n-Should- be able to get analogues of your other favorite launchers before too long.

Includes USI life support capacity of \u003E800 days through the Nom-o-matics w/fertilizer, and easily expandable through including more fertilizer. Also has a MKS 10-kerbal hab ring (undeployed, will be deployed during interplanetary flight after burn is done). \n\nAs I\u0027ve been working on it for the past couple of months, it does not have many SSTU parts on it (the tanks/etc didn\u0027t exist when I designed it), my career-game setup is also a couple of SSTU-releases behind (sad I know, that I don\u0027t update my own mod in my career game...

Generally for the smaller stuff though, the stock decouplers have enough jettison/decoupling force to work properly. Might be easier to make the non-ring-based model scale for 0.625m. Will see what I can do as I am finishing up the models.\n\nScaling collider height - Hmm... -might- be possible, but would require quite a bit more code to accomplish, and I\u0027m not sure that I want a big vertical strip running down the side of the tank/etc. Will give it some thought, might be something I can work in. No guarantees though.\n\nThrust vectoring - while possible, it would require some pretty heavy coding to do, and I have no idea how I would show the current thrust orientation to the user in an understandable fashion. Will give it some though... might make it into V2 in the future (after I can work on GUI stuff).\n\nMass - Yep, you can tweak both the amount of fuel, and the thrust level (burn time); so while it is by-default a bit overpowered for some uses, the thrust should be able to be scaled down for smaller uses as well. And of course, those are all config values and easily alterable through a patch / user customization.\n\nModel - Hmm... will see what I can do about the mounts. Nothing on it is finalized yet, so I can probably rework it a bit. Tricky part is making sure it will still look good/work when scaled to various sizes. For the mount rings, I can probably put a cut-out in them for the fuel-lines, though the central mounting point would be a bit harder to accommodate (might still be able to.. and might actually look cool... though not sure how well it would work for all tank setups, as the central mount does not scale).\n\nStrongly considering releasing the engine cluster plugin on its own as a modders/users tool (just the plugin, no models, though perhaps some stock configs for examples). I think it is probably a good candidate for general end-user/config pack use (much more so than my other plugins). Of course, I would still bundle it with SSTU along with the engine models and some pre-built cluster configs.\n\nDo you guys think this will be something others in general could find useful (besides JoseEduardo, as he is obviously loving it ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) )?

Though rather than creating new geometry and needing new textures, I would rather just scale the existing parts along their Y axis. Would require some minor plugin/code changes to accommodate, but as there is already a scale field, I should be able to relatively easily turn it into a proper Vector3 to allow for per-axis scaling. Or even just create a second field for verticalScale that defaults to the regular scale value for that adapter. I just really don\u0027t want to create another set of adapters (right now)... doing the initial set and then trying to do the engine mount adapters nearly killed me (or my motivation at least). Certainly a possibility though, and with the way the plugin is set up these should be very clean and easy to add in at any point in the future. On that note, I need to spend a day or two and finish adding all the rest of the adapters/couplers to the new tanks too (I was just too lazy to figure out all the scales and attach node positions for the initial release of those tank sizes for that many adapters).\n\nPrev (tank/cap/texture) buttons -- Have already added a \u0027Prev Main Tank\u0027 button, and should be able to get the other buttons added. Was trying to keep the right-click menu clean/short until I can do some proper UI for it with the Unity 5 upgrade.

But yes, editing the fueltypes config file (or patching it with MM) is the proper way to change tankage fraction/mass fraction.\n\nThere are actually two fields you can edit - \n\nThe first determines how much volume is lost due to the difference in the actual tank compared to a cylinder (beveled/rounded tops/etc):\n\n**tankageVolumeLoss = 0.15**\n\nThe default is 0.15, or 15%. Stock uses a pretty wide range for their tanks, but generally falls between 10-20%\n\nThe second field determines the dry weight of the tank - as a multipler of the volume lost, with the resultant value used as tons.\n\n**tankageMassFactor = 1**\n\nThe default is 1, meaning for every 1 m^3 of volume lost due to tankage loss, you will have 1 ton of dry weight. Generally this puts things in the ballpark of stock when left at default values.\n\nFor your use case, realistic mass-fractions, I would actually suggest altering the tankageMassFactor rather than the tankageVolumeLoss. For stock liquid fuels, a \u0027tankageMassFactor = 0.3\u0027 would give you a ~5% dry-weight/mass fraction.\n\nThinking on it... I will likely be changing that system up a bit to be a bit simpler to use. tankageVolumeLoss will still work the same, but I\u0027ll alter tankageMassFactor to work directly on the final computed mass of the resources; so you can just enter your desired mass fraction. Probably not for this update, but in the near future (perhaps next week).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E If I am wrong, please correct me.\n\u003E I don\u0027t think you don\u0027t edit tank empty mass directly.
