This due to the fact that it would be cheaper and more reliable to just keep sending them up to get more proficient rather than to spread the risk. If they died, then oh dear\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 we have to start from scratch all over again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI assume you think the above would be a ridiculous scenario. But it isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t in KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel this is a core game play issue which could be addressed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Kerbal experience should not be aligned to a single Kerbal but rather to the entirety of the space program. Each time you \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cpush the envelope\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 your program should gain levels of experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) As a program gains experience, the cost of training kerbals increases. If you lose a kerbal then training up a new one gets ever so much more expensive as your program progresses. Effectively, as you learn more, your training regime becomes deeper, more intensive and also costs more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not envision it being more expensive to train new kerbals in comparison with already experienced Kerbals, rather it would allow a player to obtain experienced Kerbals at a cost in line with the programs stage of advancement (obviously some balancing would be required to get this exactly right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) As a result, if you recruit a new pilot and spend the money to train \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153em up, then you can expect a fully capable crewman with all the abilities present considering the stage of your programs advancement. At the same time, this crewman is also quite valuable considering the training investment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) A kerbals\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 individual accomplishments must be tracked. The more a Kerbal accomplishes as an individual then the more program reputation is lost if the Kerbal is KIA. (Perhaps Apollo 11 and Yuri were not sent back to space because the risk of losing them was considered to be too great).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) If single Kerbal gains a bit of additional experience (which is then applied to the overall program) which leaves other kernels with lesser capabilities, then the lesser kernels should be allowed to return to the astronaut complex to undergo further training and investment to allow them to take on the new knowledge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) All other elements of Kerbal pilot, science and engineer skills could be retained as is - although obviously these will be further refined as the Devs get a better handle on skills and capabilities through the beta adjustment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow..
