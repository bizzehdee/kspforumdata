This has involved long slow burns, involving a very low acceleration of around 0.0175m/s^2. To bring it into orbit I would need a deltaV of around 400m/s. The method works fine for the first 100m/s of deltaV, decreasing the velocity of the asteroid by 0.1 m/s every 5-6 seconds as expected from that acceleration. However, after the asteroid reaches an orbital velocity of 750.0m/s thrusting the engine no longer has any affect on the orbital velocity, and it is not decreasing by the 0.1m/s every 5-6 seconds. I\u0027m not sure if this is a bug or what, but it has happened consistently, even after re loading from a previous save file multiple times. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen re-loading the save file, sometimes the asteroid loads rotating, and I\u0027m not sure why this happens either, but this is less concerning to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m running version 1.04.861 on a mac, OS 10.7.5. I\u0027ll attach the save file for right before this happens, so the asteroid can still decelerate for a few tenths of a m/s before thrusting stops having any effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xo4pjj6v84t3fcq/AACLC1hvZGBapoXru9SXWXifa?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/xo4pjj6v84t3fcq/AACLC1hvZGBapoXru9SXWXifa?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate: even if I wait till periapsis, and my orbital velocity increases to 752.0m/s and then burn, the speed changes just fine until 750.0m/s,where it stops changing again (other than changes due to the orbit itself)--It\u0027s like there\u0027s a speed limit under which thrusting does nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-08T15:28:25Z\u0022 title=\u002209/08/2015 03:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by deltak\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-16T08:48:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Deltak, I cannot load the save file as it appears to be a shortcut to your file, not the file itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"deltak","CreatedById":150818,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-18T12:32:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for checking sal_vager, I changed the file so it should work now.

This continually shifts the origin of the coordinate system used by the game to remain centered on the vessel to eliminate some very odd effects caused by moving quickly. Certain parts of the game not correctly allowing for the side-effects of krakensbane (or allowing for them when it isn\u0027t actually being used) has been the underlying cause of a number of bugs in older versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is most likely related to either the claw or to the asteroid (and you have to have a claw for an asteroid to be part of your vessel).

This can be most easily seen when you make a quicksave at one point in an orbit (it may need to be a very large and eccentric orbit) and then reload the save after you have travelled to a significantly different point on the orbit and your ship is pointing (and travelling) in a considerably different direction. After the quickload you may see that the ship has not been loaded in the orientation it was in when saved, instead being left in the orientation it was just before you loaded. Quickloading again should then load it correctly. So, if you think there is something weird after quickloading then immediately do another quickload of the same file and it may well be better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Are you only using a single nuke engine? When I was messing with class E asteroids I was using a tug that had 18 LV-Ns and the burns still took ages. This was in 0.23.5 when asteroids and the claw were first introduced and the LV-N still used LF\u002BO so it needs a major redesign for 1.0\u002B\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/IMp66\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
