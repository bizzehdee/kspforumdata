However, that particular plugin lacks documentation on how to install so I have not tried it. Thank you in advance!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat appears to be just a MM config to add the SCANsat module to all capsules. I use something similar in adding the BTDT Scanner to all command pods (including probe cores):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E@PART[*]:HAS[@MODULE[ModuleCommand]]:Final\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\tMODULE\u003Cbr\u003E\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tname = SCANsat\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tsensorType = 32\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tfov = 1\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tmin_alt = 0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tmax_alt = 2000\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tbest_alt = 0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tpower = 0.05\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tscanName = BTDT scan\u003Cbr\u003E\t}\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to GavinZac for this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for installation instructions, just save it as a cfg file anywhere in your Gamedata folder. I originally wanted just the MapTraq part, but the BTDT is more useful (and with Near Future reactors, electricity isn\u0027t an issue).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT, yeah, it\u0027s just a MM config:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E@PART[*]:HAS[@MODULE[ModuleCommand]]\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003EMODULE\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\tname = SCANsat\u003Cbr\u003E\tsensorType = 0\u003Cbr\u003E\tfov = 0\u003Cbr\u003E\tmin_alt = 0\u003Cbr\u003E\tmax_alt = 0\u003Cbr\u003E\tbest_alt = 0\u003Cbr\u003E\tpower = 0.05\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich, to be honest, isn\u0027t the best one I\u0027ve seen. Looks to be made for an older version of MM though, but yeah, all it does is, instead of right clicking the clunky MapTraq scanner to open the map, you right click the command pod/probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDITE THY SECONDE: From memory, there\u0027s plans to make the MapTraq part a lot smaller and more GPS looking but as for the other, I don\u0027t know. Not sure what you mean by comically oversized though, most of them seem to a reasonable size for what they do.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-31T01:19:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2014 01:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ObsessedWithKSP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hunne","CreatedById":91800,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-31T12:35:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethis issue only is related to kerbin, I did orbit the mun in polar orbit - took me like 15-20 revelations to fully scan it...maybe something just went wrong...will try again and then make some screenshots\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T12:11:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, this is brilliant!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was one of the very few mods I had installed (i.e. #2), but quite frankly grew tired of it crashing so I dropped it several months ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI look forward to downloading and giving the new version a try.
