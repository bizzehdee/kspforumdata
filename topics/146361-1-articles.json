What is your speed just as you cross over the runway? Adding more lifting surfaces will help you fly more slowly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you\u0027re on the ground, you want to make sure that your landing gear has proper traction settings. I turn off the automatic traction control and set the sliders to about 1 or 2. The rear wheels should have a\u00A0 higher setting than the front. Increasing the traction setting will allow the brakes to work better. You can then improve the braking even more by having your control surfaces produce downforce instead of lift. Not only does this increase brake effectiveness, but it creates drag to help slow you down. I tend to use deployed control surfaces instead of dedicated airbrakes when I can to save some weight. Just make sure that your plane doesn\u0027t flip over when doing this. Flipping can be a problem for very light aircraft with large control surfaces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LN400","CreatedById":140595,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-22T19:29:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdding to the post above by\u00A0Empress Neptune.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor each design, just like in real life, learn how the plane behaves at different speeds. Find the lowest speed where you can maintain control and not lose altitude. Remember that speed. Typically that will be near your minimum take off speed so remember which speed you took off at.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore take off, memorize the pitch angle of the nose (look at the nav ball). That is the angle where you will land on all wheels. A couple of degrees up from that is where the drag helps you slow down while letting you land on the main wheels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn flight, play with speed,\u00A0controllability and descent. Find the speed where you can control the airplane while slowly losing altitude. That will be (near) your landing speed during finals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA plane needs time to adjust so plan well ahead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike in real life, make a plan for the phases before touchdown, especially the finals which is the stretch you START losing altitude for landing. This needs to be started straight out from the runway, Don\u0027t do sharp turns during finals. It also needs a considerable distance. 5km out is not unheard of. Might very well be more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStandardise your initial altitude and speed for finals. Start the finals at the same altitude each time, at the same speed. This makes it easier to find what needs to be corrected in future flights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAllow a shallow descent. A straight sloped line is perfect at an angle of only a few degrees. You might have to wing it but if you pay attention to your speed and your descent rate then it can give you the ballpark figure\u00A0you need.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust above the treshold, just a few meters off the ground, cut the throttle and let the plane settle down (unless you are flying a grand piano tied to an anvil in which case you might need the throttle).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeep practicing all the above and in particular the finals.
