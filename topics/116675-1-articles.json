I tried sending an unmaned ship to Minmus, but I completely forgot to remove Jeb from the capsule. This was for a mission that wanted me to land a base on minmus, it had to have a capacity of at least 5 kerbals. So I put a hitchhiker thingy (4 kerbals) with a capsule for the 5th one. I never intended to send anybody in there tho.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, I did not plan on returning this to kerbin so I did not include fuel for the return trip. When I realized Jeb was in the ship, it was too late for reverting the flight (I had to go back to space center or somthing I don\u0027t remember), and I had already burnt most of my fuel, I was going for my landing on minmus already so not enough fuel to go back home. So I landed, and started planning for a rescue mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow yesterday, I decided to send a second science lab in orbit around minmus. So I decided to attatch a small rescue ship on the mini space station that, after putting the lab in orbit, I was going to detatch and land on minmus to get Jeb. That part of the plan worked wonderfully. Until I realized I had a brain fart while building the ship and forgot to add a heat shield and a decoupler. I had barely put enough fuel to deortbit the rescue ship from minmus and make the periapsis under 20km so that the ship would just fall back to kerbin. But falling back from minmus makes you get to Kerbin REALLY fast. I was getting in the atmosphere at over 3100 m/s. This is not a problem when you got a heat shield. It is, however, a huge problem when you don\u0027t! Again, brain fart, by the time I realized this, it was too late, I had no more fuel and again, reverting the whole flight was not an option anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esooo. here is how I successfully rescued Jeb. I first contemplated the idea of using the RCS to bring my periapsis back to 75 clicks and send a rescue mission to rescue the rescue mission XD. But I decided to try something else. I used the RCS to bring back my periapsis to 55 clicks instead. of course, with such a high periapsis, I couldn\u0027t bring the ship down in one go. but everytime I passed through it, the apoapsis went down, and the speed at which I went throught the periapsis went down as well. Of course the periapsis was going down a little bit everytime as well. It must have taken at least 10 orbits, but my apoapsis finally went down under 70 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow there was another issue. Because of the heat and the ship being absolutely uncontrollable because my rcs and my solat panels blew up, I went through the atmosphere face-first one time. Which blew up my chutes. I then noticed that the ship was going to crash right after some water. So as soon as the flames went away re-entering the athmosphere, I EVA\u0027ed Jeb. He couldn\u0027t hold on to the capsule becuse of the wind. This is exactly what I wanted as I did some testing a long time ago, and remembered that kerbals can fall safely in the water. When Jeb got blown away from the ship, which was gonna crash AFTER the water, I turned on my EVA propelant, and tried to brake my horizontal movement as much as possible to have Jeb fall in the water instead of on the ground. I held shift and W to try to kill my vertical velocity as well (I\u0027m not so sure you can fall in water at any speed and still survive so I tried cushioning the fall as much as I could. The ship indeed crashed to the ground and exploded. Jeb fell in water and lived.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s just say Jeb totally deserved that level up XD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was a VERY stressful hour. I don\u0027t want Jeb to die XD.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-23T17:47:42Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2015 05:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Thunder_86\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
