It seems that if I set a science result to be transmitted, while my only antenna is retracting, the science result is lost forever. Usually I can rerun these experiments, but I can imagine a scenario in which I blow my materials bay because my antenna is retracting when I set it to transmit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-28T15:05:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like this idea. Plus when you have a terrible data transfer speed (low power or small antenna and large data)\u00A0you could queue up everything and do something else (alt-tab out for a minute or contemplate jool or anything ingame) \u00A0while it\u0027s transferring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_Astra_","CreatedById":155195,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-28T15:49:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, queuing data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNice idea, too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/128772-mits-to-mbits-conversion/\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/128772-mits-to-mbits-conversion/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StarManta","CreatedById":57805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-28T20:33:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, data transmission should obey timewarp properly. Say I have a piece of data that takes 100 mbits to transfer, but my craft only has enough battery to transmit 50 of it. (I pulled those numbers out of the air, just roll with it) If I try to do it normally, it will fail - it gets partway through, runs out of power, and cancels. OK, that\u0027s annoying, but it seems like a pretty realistic design limitation: In order to transmit large pieces of data I need power storage, seems sensible. BUT, now I can cheat. I hit transmit data, and before it starts, jump to 100x time warp... power generates much faster, but the transmission uses power in real-world time. If the need for power is an intentional limitation, then don\u0027t let me cheat it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-28T20:33:59Z\u0022 title=\u002212/28/2015 08:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by StarManta\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
