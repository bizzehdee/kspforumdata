The drill overheats within 15 seconds and the ISRU does too. I can get rockets and spaceplanes up in the air, but I don\u0027t understand the heatsink problems with resource mining.\n\nIs there any guide or \u0022how to\u0022, that explains the inner workings of these parts?\n\nI want to establish a probe controlled ground refuel station with transfer rover tankers.\n\nEdit:\n\nSolutions from comments:\n\n-Use a big mass (fuel tank) as heat sink and light wing segments as radiator (all attached at the heated tank).\n\n-Engineer Kerbal does help with temp problems, but is no option for a fully automated drone plant \n\nThis is my test rig. It\u0027s still not fully stable. Only one drill, which seems to be the limiting factor. Stable with an engineer in a capsule attached.\n\n[![rqbtktgb.jpg](http://fs1.directupload.net/images/150429/rqbtktgb.jpg)](http://www.directupload.net)\n\np.s. \n\nthanks so far\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T12:21:43Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 12:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ion Man**"},{"CreatedByName":"nekogod","CreatedById":103186,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T11:04:09Z","Content":"Lots of solar panels or wings work quite well as heat sinks."},{"CreatedByName":"Radam","CreatedById":79910,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T11:05:16Z","Content":"Try using 9t fuel tank as a base to attach drill and isru to.
