I got trackIR working (and it\u0027s awesome) but my Logitech Force 3D Pro isn\u0027t mapping properly anymore. I remember being able to use it in the past.\n\nBasically, the problem is that when I go into settings, I select the axis I want to map (say Yaw), move the relevant axis and KSP correctly picks up what axis I moved, so the joystick is definitely working and detected. However, the \u0022accept\u0022 button does nothing, it doesn\u0027t even close the popup window. The only way I can close it is by clicking cancel. If I try to map the axis again, the interface will disable and the mapping popup won\u0027t even show up. Since the confirm/cancel setting changes buttons at the bottom are still disabled, the only way to leave the settings menu is to switch to another settings tab (like audio) and confirm/cancel changes from there.\n\nJoystick buttons map fine as usual.\n\nJoystick drivers up to date and still works in other games.\n\nRunning Windows 10 64 bit, KSP 1.0 through Steam.\n\nModel: \u0022Logitech Force 3D Pro\u0022\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T11:55:11Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 11:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by thatdude624**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T10:53:04Z","Content":"Hi thatdude624, can you please look at the support stickies, this isn\u0027t a known issue and we need more info from you ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"thatdude624","CreatedById":77358,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T11:15:56Z","Content":"Sorry about that!

It also seems that changing the resolution to 1600x900 fullscreen, confirming (which immediately changes resolution as normal) then closing and restarting KSP will keep it at that resolution and it will stay fullscreen, but if you enter the settings menu it claims to be on 1280x270 windowed mode. Clicking apply/accept without touching anything in the settings mode will actually put it in windowed mode at that resolution, while changing it back to 1600x900 fullscreen and then applying will fix it. This all resets every reboot of KSP, and every time it goes back to default in the menu, but not in the game. It seems to affect the other settings as well. They do not reset when leaving and reentering the settings menu while KSP stays open.\n\nRunning as admin doesn\u0027t fix this, and KSP isn\u0027t in program files or any restricted folder\n\nI\u0027m not too bothered by this, but it may perhaps be related to this problem.\n\nHere\u0027s the mapping window. Clicking accept doesn\u0027t do anything, only cancel closes it.

Even weirder: After trying this, the settings menu retained its settings!\n\nI think I might know what the problem relates to. Whatever squad changed to overhaul the joystick controls changed how joystick controls are saved to the config file. Something with how those names are saved does not like my joystick, perhaps it saves the name of the joystick which contained strange unicode character like the trademark or copyright symbol or something.\n\nThat could explain why it won\u0027t confirm, and why some settings are messed up on reset.\n\nHowever, I know absolutely nothing about how Unity or KSP works, so this is purely a guess. It seems to be related to the Logitech joysticks though.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nAlright, tried to test my theory. I don\u0027t see anything too strange in the config. I have pitch mapped to the Force 3D Pro, and Yaw mapped to the Xbox 360 controller, named by KSP\u0027s Config file as \u0022Joystick 1\u0022 and \u0022Controller (Xbox 360 Wir.\u0022 respectively at line 830 onwards.

It\u0027s weird because it will load with the saved settings, but when you go to the menu, it\u0027s the defaults and unless you change them, it will load them when you hit accept/apply. I\u0027ve included a post-first run settings and log, and then a post-second run settings and log. For some reason, it forgets everything even though the config file has all the settings I want. It even asks me, again, if I want to submit usage information.\n\nAlso, it will then dump my CH Pedal assignment to yaw, showing no mapping.

The Xbox 360 gamepad has to be awake when you start KSP, otherwise assigning axes will work for 1st time and then the setting screen will malfunction. Also the axes are assigned to \u0022joystick 0\u0022 (or some other number) instead of the Xbox 360 wir. you see otherwise. I didn\u0027t manage to reproduce the setting file corruption/reset thought. I did testing with renaming the settings file so a fresh settings was generated.\n\nIt\u0027s actually pretty easy to run into this problem because the gamepad is wireless and goes to sleep automatically.
