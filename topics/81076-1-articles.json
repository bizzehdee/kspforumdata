The problem is that I\u0027ve always limited myself to orbital stuff before. Anything I sent to land anywhere was always self contained, usually a miner which could mine its fuel to get back to orbit to refuel whatever was orbital.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the problem I\u0027m running into is actually aligning the different landers to each other. I can get them close when I land with the help of mechjeb, but getting them the requisite 4 meters apart and rotated right is proving to be a challenge. I tried to do it with MJ and the translatron feature, but didn\u0027t get far with that (I\u0027ve always been godawful with the translatron). Next idea was a rover that could slide under the MKS component, lift, dock with it, move to where it needed to be and then lower down, but that\u0027s giving me trouble too (like I said, I\u0027ve only ever done ships).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo does anyone have any advice on how to actually build these pretty bases I see in pictures? Ideally something text based as my ability to actually hear videos is somewhat limited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-08T17:01:23Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2014 05:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ASW122\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EChange to answered\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"itsmagic2009","CreatedById":116666,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-07T20:48:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou are looking for\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/48876-The-art-of-modular-base-building\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/48876-The-art-of-modular-base-building\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETest on Kerbin first, then ship to the Mun.
