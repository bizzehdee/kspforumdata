The \u0022same\u0022 ship means either literally just, or from one ship to another when the two ships are docked. My most extensive \u0022test\u0022 so far has been from a connector delivery probe \u0022docked\u0022 via a winch which is part of a beam that is docked to the target ship. Unfortunately, I didn\u0027t take any screenshots.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYea, it seems to work fine as long as it the part remains \u0027docked\u0027 but as soon as you try to take it away to another ship, or drop it undocked to float next to the connector.. its like loses its frame of reference, and suddenly goes \u0027hmm, not attached to the ship anymore, must be on the ground with zero velocity.\u0022 Then your ship, or your Kerbal, smacks into the part at ~2000m/s, and starts tumbling through space half dead.
