Everything disappeared, (only empty space remained) - I revert to SPH. Upon relaunching a redesigned rover, the game still won\u0027t render Kerbin, leaving a spooky empty space. IVA is available, but only interior. NavBall had all vectors on one place. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I quit the game, tried to reload the save. Still the same thing, even when looking at the KSC. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried to load an earlier save, still the same thing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI quit the game, re-started the game, and now it loads just fine - But its a VERY OLD save. It doesn\u0027t matter if I try to load the latest quicksave, or something - still the same old save is loaded. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m perfectly fine if I can load any other save than the persistent, an old quicksave would do it, i\u0027m not fine starting almost from scratch again. (my ships are still there though!). But it\u0027s not possible to load a save without a persistent in the folder? I suspect the persistent is corrupted, because it\u0027s the only thing that has changed since the bug appeared.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-10T17:42:03Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2015 05:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by martinborgen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blnk2007","CreatedById":143465,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T19:15:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
