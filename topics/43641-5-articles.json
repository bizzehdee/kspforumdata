I also had a go with a quad engine VTOL cargo lifter (using a tow cable), which was just crazy enough to be able to lift it\u0027s own weight (tested by having one pick another one up).

Landing could be tricky, hovering was quite hard).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there are two kinds of winches. Electro magnet, and suction cup. The former can be turned on and off, but it also needs power, and this is what I used. This worked alright, with a bit of patience I could sometimes grab things from the air without crashing (it didn\u0027t respond well to what is essentially dropping an anchor), and having put in some batteries, and solar panels and the fact that the engines also made power), I never really gave this a lot of thought. I never worked out ariel grabs, since hovering steady enough, and in a particular location was pretty much impossible for me, and a flyby grab was like dropping an anchor, and didn\u0027t end well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solution was to land, run out with a kerbal for a manual attach, climb back in and pray that the engines could get the cargo off the ground before the RCS lost a fight to gravity, pendulum physics, and sanity, needless to say that the first minute after a pickup was spent desperately trying to gain height and stop the cargo from spinning around on a 20m cable. After doing this a couple of times around the base, I decided to take a rover to the island. I\u0027m not too far out when suddenly, the rover drops off the magnet. I look at my ships status and notice it\u0027s dead out of power, the magnet drawing more than the engines and solar panels could produce.
