But I feel that it lacks the role-playing aspect that Kerbal Space *PROGRAM* needs to have before it goes 1.0. Hence, I have been thinking about how real space programs manage their various missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to see the current system focus more on generating long term funding by placing satellites into target orbits. The randomness of the science contracts are well, random. So I\u0027ve been thinking of how to approach the scientific discovery in a more organic way. For this example, I will be using the Mun, Apollo style.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPrograms\u003C/strong\u003E \u0022We go to the Mun, not because it is easy, but because things might explode\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are overarching goals. Each planet would have one as well as various space stations, outposts and asteroid as the game progresses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce a player has reached orbit, Mission Control offers them their first Program. Each program would contain a number of phases, such as flyby, survey, lander, etc. The player would be able to select which ones they wanted to do and which to skip. More phases means more investment in the short term and larger science returns in the long term. Multiple phases could be completed in single mission or multiple missions, how ever the player chooses to go about it. If I were planning a Mun Program, I\u0027d break it down like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase I - Flyby\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase II - Orbital Survey\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase III - Survey Lander\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase IV - Manned Orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase V - Manned Landing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMissions\u003C/strong\u003E \u0022Captain, the \u0027insert technobabel\u0027 is acting up! She cannot take it!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce a Program has been created, the Mission Planning begins! This is where the player selects which phases they want to accomplish during the mission. For my first mission, I will complete Phase I and II, by placing a satellite in orbit. Now, choosing where to place my satellite is critical, so a series of options would be available (drop down windows!), which in the end would create a \u0027target orbit\u0027 that you can see in Map mode, like we have now. For added reputation, you can set an orbital tolerance of 1/5/10%. Science objectives could target specific \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106037-Change-Biome-to-Geome\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGeomes\u003C/a\u003E for bonus science. If I were planning Phase I and II, I\u0027d break it down like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - Unmanned\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - Polar Orbit ~ 75 deg inclination\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.1 - Low Orbit ~ 20-25 km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.2 - 5% Orbital Tolerance ~ 5% reputation bonus\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 - Major Geomes - Lowlands, Midlands, Highlands, Poles ~ 10% science bonus\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlying the mission, a checklist shows you how the conditions are being met. Once all the mission objectives are met, the Phases are completed and you collect your rewards and move on to the next Phase. If you want to send a manned mission your very first trip to the Mun and complete every Phase in a single mission, by all means, do so. The difficulty settings could be adapted to change how much risk/reward is when going for one or two phases vs. all five\u002B. (I\u0027m thinking actual Apollo Program vs. Interstellar \u0022MATT DAMON\u0022) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMitigation\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, going back to the Mun over and over shouldn\u0027t be as rewarding each time right? Reputation should certainly decrease by some amount each time, as well as funds earned for completing something you\u0027ve done seven times. Science of course is not affected, bring a new toy, get new data. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the icing on the cake that would REALLY make this game yours/mine/ours... an in-game Program/Mission Emblem Generator.
