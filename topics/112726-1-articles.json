The probe properly decouples but the main rocket (the part above the adapter) wont come loose. When I click decouple, the screen wobbles for a few seconds then the main rocket sticks. I made sure the probe isn\u0027t too long and its not attached to the engine. Is it just not compatible with the new KSP update?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DGKacey","CreatedById":123016,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T02:56:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKW didn\u0027t get an actual update to 1.02.
