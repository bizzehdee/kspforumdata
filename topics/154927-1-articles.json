It would be nice to have it. Or at least never unload \u002B some sort of autonomous system so for example someone wants to do the F9-like recovery they place a probe core on the 2nd stage and it flies up to the node and performs the burn while the player lands the 1st stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I come to think of it such feature would great for interplanetary probes mid-course correction burns. Just set up a bunch of nodes and warp uuntil it reaches the planet changing it\u0027s flight path slightly at each node. I think that\u0027s what CommNet should allow for actually and I\u0027m making a thread about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-13T11:17:48Z\u0022 title=\u002201/13/2017 11:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 13, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Veeltch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Palaceviking","CreatedById":166883,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-13T11:54:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSplit pod atmospheric landings!!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
