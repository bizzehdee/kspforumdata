Basically I was taking advantage of taking tourists into orbit of Kerbin and then back for easy money. However, after finally landing on the M\u00FCn with a Kerbal, and then making it back home safely, all of the tourist missions for just doing an orbit of Kerbin are gone and will not come back. Now they have all been replaced with ones where the tourists want to either fly by the\u00A0M\u00FCn, land on it, or both, and still return home safely! The problem with this is that the only ship I have that can reach the\u00A0M\u00FCn and back with Kerbals (only two though) costs about 900,000, compared to the ship I was using just for the Kerbin orbit, which was about 250,000 but could hold 14 tourists and would easily pay for itself plus provide a lot of extra money. However, if I were to use the\u00A0M\u00FCn ship I have, since it can only support two Kerbals, it would not pay for itself and I would only lose money. Also, at the time of writing this, I don\u0027t even have enough money for it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously I\u0027m doing something wrong, and that\u0027s why I\u0027m here.

As four the tourists, separating them would be better but I\u0027m afraid it will eventually only have tourists who want to land. If I can stick with just flybys then I think I can recover from this but if not then this could be an even worse problem than what I originally thought.

But you say you can leave Mun and return ....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPart of the point is that there are many ways to reenter, and all of them work to some extent ... but there are details. After you do a Mun flyby, hopefully you are in an orbit around Kerbin with a Pe \u0026gt; 0. If not, you have to raise your Pe to maybe 61km or so by burning prograde at the Ap. After that, you get to choose either to aerobrake, or to burn your fuel to get back into an LKO. One way or another, you need to reduce your Ap to something reasonable before your final reentry. You may need 6 aerobraking passes, and it may take several Kerbin days. Or you can just wait until your Pe and then blast retrograde with your engine until your Ap is down to 100km. Then you probably want to raise your Pe for a few orbits until KSC is underneath it, then lower it again to 59km for final reentry. If you saved a bunch of fuel, you can burn it during reentry to prevent all possibility of heatsploding -- just burn retrograde until your surface speed is 1400m/s or less. There are details of timing to allow you to land on the runway for a 100% refund on your ship. To slow down during reentry, hold down a key -- A or D work nicely. Alternately, make your ship \u0022rock\u0022 back and forth -- when the nose is going left, hold down A, when it\u0027s going right, hold down D (this works really really well). Holding down S at the same time\u00A0to keep your nose up works pretty good. The more keys you are holding down, the better, because it all adds a lot of drag, and that is what you need on reentry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, and about snark\u0027s method -- no your orbit does not need to be anything special (not particularly circular or anything) in order to place a maneuver node and get to the Mun.

My current method probably wastes a lot more fuel then most other methods. Basically I do it by flying to the same \u0022height\u0022 as the Mun is at and then proceeding to fly against the horizon to create a big orbit. However, I set the orbit to the opposite direction that the Mun is moving so that I will essentially run into and get a Mun encounter. I\u0027ve tried waiting for the Mun to line up closer with KSC but only once did I manage to get it perfectly where I had a Mun encounter without having to fly against the horizon. However, this is something that varies from ship to ship. For leaving the Mun though, I fly up to about 100,000m in height and then use a maneuver to get out of the Mun and into a big orbit around Kerbin.

\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eneed\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E to do this.\u00A0 As bewing points out, there\u0027s nothing super-special about perfectly circular, and you can do stuff without it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I\u0027d recommend developing the skill so you can do it as easily as breathing, for a couple of reasons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, it will make your life simpler.\u00A0 You mentioned that you have trouble building space stations, for example, or rescuing kerbals.\u00A0 In other words, you\u0027re finding it a challenge to achieve orbital rendezvous.\u00A0 Well, things in perfectly circular orbits are easier targets than things in elliptical orbits.\u00A0 Planning an ejection \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Efrom\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E a circular orbit is also somewhat simpler.\u00A0 So if you can hit a circle, you\u0027re slightly simplifying your life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond:\u00A0 it\u0027s just good practice.\u00A0 It\u0027s a handy thing to aim for just for the challenge of it.\u00A0 It will give you good practice at doing fiddly things with maneuver nodes to precisely hit a desired condition, which is a good general skill to have.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s the quick-n-easy guide to launching into a nearly perfect circular orbit:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nDo a launch as per usual, up to the point where your engines cut off and you\u0027re just coasting up towards Ap.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDrop a maneuver node right exactly on your Ap marker.\u00A0 (You have no Pe marker yet, since you\u0027re on a suborbital trajectory and your Pe is actually buried deep inside the planet.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDrag the maneuver node\u0027s prograde handle until you see the Pe marker appear on the opposite side of the planet.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKeep dragging, and watch the Pe altitude.\u00A0 It will climb.\u00A0 Slow down the drag when Pe starts getting close to Ap.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen the Pe altitude starts getting really close to the Ap altitude, the Pe and Ap markers will start to \u0022rotate\u0022 around the orbit.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nStop dragging when they\u0027ve rotated about 90 degrees (i.e. the Pe and Ap markers are about 90 degrees ahead/behind of the maneuver node\u0027s position at your current Ap).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf the post-maneuver Ap is 90 degrees \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eahead\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of your current Ap position, tug the radial-\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Einward\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E handle slightly.\u00A0 On the other hand, if the post-maneuver Ap is 90 degrees \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ebehind\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E your current Ap position, tug the radial\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003E-outward\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E handle slightly.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDo the radial in-or-out nudge just enough to cause the post-maneuver Ap and Pe to rotate back so that one of them is right there on the current Ap marker again, or reasonably close.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re now pretty darn close to a circular orbit.\u00A0 There are additional steps to refine it further if you like, but this ought to be close enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESkill 3:\u00A0 Place a maneuver node to

previously described.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA slightly simpler way to describe it:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nGet into LKO.\u00A0 Ideally it would be circular, but it doesn\u0027t have to be perfect.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDrop a maneuver node on the orbit and drag the prograde maneuver handle until the Ap is raised up to approximately the radius of the Mun\u0027s orbit, or slightly lower.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNow grab the maneuver node itself and slide it around the orbit until you have a Mun encounter.\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nIf the parking orbit you started in with step 1 is a bit \u0022lumpy\u0022 and not close to perfectly circular, you may need to readjust the prograde/retrograde handles as you slide the node around, because your Ap will grow and shrink when you do that.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThis is one example of how you make life a bit simpler for yourself if you launch into a \u003Cem\u003Ecircular\u003C/em\u003E orbit.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022
