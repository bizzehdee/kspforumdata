I would love clarification on this because it is hell on modders, especially when testing in clean environments vs. interaction with other mods. It is also hell on players who like to have multiple profiles of KSP. For instance, I like having a full stock install for challenges, a modded install for playing, and a modded install for RSS, plus all my modding installs. Plus, what does this mean for modifying and redistributing KSP\u0027s stock models?
