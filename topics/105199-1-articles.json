(it\u0027s like its too thin for my screen, wich is almost squared) I tried changing it to windowed mode and this doesnt happen. However every time i get into fullscreen mode, i get those... Anyone knows a fix ? Is it that I am completely stupid and this is very simple ? This is extremely annoying. (ruins my 1.0 hype ! :/ )"},{"CreatedByName":"Ted","CreatedById":26298,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T17:31:39Z","Content":"Try deleting the settings.cfg file in the KSP folder and starting the game again."},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T17:38:18Z","Content":"This is even worse... \n\nI had those : \n\n[![mini_845422Capturedcran53.png](http://img15.hostingpics.net/thumbs/mini_845422Capturedcran53.png)](http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=845422Capturedcran53.png)\n\n[![mini_597848Capturedcran52.png](http://img15.hostingpics.net/thumbs/mini_597848Capturedcran52.png)](http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=597848Capturedcran52.png)\n\nAnd now i get this instead ! \n\n[![mini_902385Capturedcran56.png](http://img15.hostingpics.net/thumbs/mini_902385Capturedcran56.png)](http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=902385Capturedcran56.png)\n\n(this is not very much what i imagined for my first time playing 1.0 .......)\n\nEDIT : I\u0027m on steam, windows 8.1 by the way.
