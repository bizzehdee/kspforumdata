As per the title, this is a SSTO craft, that has a cargo bay fitted that will allow small payloads to be carried in to orbit. It also has a junior docking port fitted to the underside, should you wish to use it for transferring crew to an orbiting space station.\n\nThe craft is quite stable and not particularly difficult to fly, just requiring a standard SSTO flight profile to get in to orbit. I usually go for an Apo of 100k before turning off the engines to coast. This results in an Apo of around 95k by the time you actually leave the atmosphere. There is enough fuel on board if you want to push this a bit higher, but remember to leave enough for your de-orbit burn.\n\nAction keys are:\n\n1: Toggle rocket engine\n\n2: Toggle 2 jet engines\n\n4: Toggle pilot\u0027s ladder\n\n5: Toggle cargo bay door\n\n7: Toggle nose wheel steering \n\n[Craft file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vim3p58soczjyxm/SR71%20Cargo%20SSTO.craft?dl=0)\n\nTake off for next mission\n\n![bb01.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/bb01.jpg)\n\nInitial climb established\n\n![bb02.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/bb02.jpg)\n\nRocket power for orbital insertion\n\n![bb03.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/bb03.jpg)\n\nReady to release the payload\n\n![bb04.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/bb04.jpg)\n\nPayload away\n\n![bb05.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/bb05.jpg)\n\nRe-entry burn near home\n\n![bb06.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/bb06.jpg)\n\nLining up on the runway\n\n![bb07.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/bb07.jpg)\n\nHome again\n\n![bb08.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/bb08.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T12:32:21Z","Content":"Nice design mate."},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T12:58:49Z","Content":"Aesthetics hint: punt one of the cone adapters at the end, then stick the engine to that and sink it with the translation gizmo: the nozzle will just come out of it all nice and flush.\n\nRune.
