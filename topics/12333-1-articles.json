In other words, here\\\u0027s you, and here\\\u0027s a thing moving away from you at one mile an hour, and here\\\u0027s a thing moving away from \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E in the same direction at two miles an hour. How fast is the second thing moving away from you? Well duh. You just add the vectors. Since they\\\u0027re in the same direction, the answer is one mile an hour plus two miles an hour, or three miles an hour. This is blindingly obvious even to the smallest child.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrouble is, it\\\u0027s not right. It is, in fact, completely wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, it\\\u0027s wrong in such a way that you can\\\u0027t spot the error on the scale of a few miles an hour. That\\\u0027s why it took us thousands of years to realize we\\\u0027d been adding velocities wrong this whole time. But once you start looking at things that move \u003Cem\u003Efast,\u003C/em\u003E you find that in fact velocity vectors don\\\u0027t add like Euclidean three-vectors at all. In fact, they add like hyperbolic angles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that sounded like gibberish, so let me explain what it means. In essence, we have to replace the idea of Euclidean vector addition with the idea of rotation by a hyperbolic angle. Hyperbolic angles work just like circular angles \u00E2\u20AC\u201Dyou know, 90\u00C2\u00B0 or whatever \u00E2\u20AC\u201Donly instead of going from zero to 360\u00C2\u00B0, they go from minus infinity to plus infinity. You can \u003Cem\u003Ego around\u003C/em\u003E a circle and come back to where you started, but you can\\\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Ego around\u003C/em\u003E a hyperbola. Hyperbolas are, in a meaningful sense, \u0027inside-out\u0027 circles, so in a lot of ways they behave in opposite fashion to how circles behave. Hyperbolic angles going from minus infinity to plus infinity is one example of that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you describe relative motion \u00E2\u20AC\u201Dthe motion between two things \u00E2\u20AC\u201Din Euclidean geometry, velocities look like vectors. But like I said before, thinking about motion that way ends up giving you the wrong answers once you deal with things that move fast \u00E2\u20AC\u201Dlike, yes, muons produced in cosmic-ray interactions in the upper atmosphere. So instead, you have to describe motion using hyperbolic geometry, and when you do that, velocities look like hyperbolic angles instead of Euclidean vectors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo let\\\u0027s go back to the example from before: thing moving away from you at one mile an hour, other thing moving away from that thing at two miles an hour, how fast is thing 2 moving away from you? Like I said, if you write that out as a problem in Euclidean vector math, you get the wrong answer. It\\\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Every very close\u003C/em\u003E to the right answer, because three miles an hour is a small number, but it\\\u0027s still wrong. If you want the \u003Cem\u003Eright\u003C/em\u003E answer, you have to convert \u0027one mile an hour\u0027 into a hyperbolic angle, and then convert \u0027two miles an hour\u0027 into a hyperbolic angle, and then add the angles, and then convert back to a velocity again to get a number you can intuitively understand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat all sounds like mathematical nonsense and navel-gazing, I know. But here\\\u0027s why it\\\u0027s important: \u003Cem\u003EThere\\\u0027s no fastest possible speed.\u003C/em\u003E Remember when I said that hyperbolic angles go from minus infinity to plus infinity? Since velocities are hyperbolic angles, mathematically speaking, and hyperbolic angles go all the way to infinity, for any given velocity \u00E2\u20AC\u201Dany given hyperbolic angle, in other words \u00E2\u20AC\u201Dyou can \u003Cem\u003Ealways\u003C/em\u003E add a little more. There is no universal speed limit! This is an important insight!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, but \u00E2\u20AC\u00A6 speed of light. How do we reconcile the fact that there\\\u0027s no universal speed limit with the fact that the speed of light is the \u0027universal speed limit\u0027? Like this: Remember I said before that after you do that math problem with the adding of the angles, you have to convert back to a velocity to get a number that makes sense to you. This is, in a sense, \u003Cem\u003Eprojecting\u003C/em\u003E hyperbolic geometry onto Euclidean geometry, in much the same way that you can \u003Cem\u003Eproject\u003C/em\u003E the surface of a sphere onto a plane to draw a map of the Earth. But remember how all flat maps of the Earth are distorted in one way or the other? Points which are actually close together look far apart on the map, because in projecting one geometric surface onto another you end up breaking isometry \u00E2\u20AC\u201Dwhich is just a fancy way of saying you distort the distances between points. Well, the same is true of projecting velocity space \u00E2\u20AC\u201Dwhich is hyperbolic \u00E2\u20AC\u201Donto Euclidean space in order to convert angles into velocity vectors: You end up with a distortion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat distortion is called relativity. It\\\u0027s the reason why accelerating an object that\\\u0027s nearly at rest relative to you creates a big change in that object\\\u0027s velocity, while accelerating an object that\\\u0027s going like stink relative to you by the same amount creates a small change in that object\\\u0027s velocity. \u003Cem\u003EThe map is distorted.\u003C/em\u003E The map that relates actual changes in momentum and position over time to \u003Cem\u003Eobserved\u003C/em\u003E changes in momentum and position is distorted such that when things move slowly, the changes look big, but when things move fast, the changes look very small. It\\\u0027s actually \u003Cem\u003Ethe same change,\u003C/em\u003E just distorted by the projection of hyperbolic velocity space onto a universe that, to us, looks Euclidean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong story short, even though you can keep accelerating an object forever and ever \u00E2\u20AC\u201Dbecause the velocity angle goes all the way to infinity \u00E2\u20AC\u201Dthe actual change in velocity a stationary observer sees as that object accelerates grows smaller and smaller the faster the object goes. What\\\u0027s the limit? The speed of light. If you accelerate an object forever, its \u003Cem\u003Eobserved speed,\u003C/em\u003E as seen by somebody at rest, will get closer and closer to, but will never exceed, the speed of light. If you look at the math, you find that the hyperbolic angle that corresponds to a velocity of the speed of light is actually infinite. Meaning you can get as close as you want to it \u00E2\u20AC\u201Dyou can always go faster \u00E2\u20AC\u201Dbut you can never actually reach it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo on the one hand, you can say truthfully that there is no universal speed limit. You can, in principle if not in practice, accelerate an object forever, and it\\\u0027ll just keep going faster and faster and faster and faster. But on the other hand, you can also say truthfully that the speed of light is the universal speed limit, because no observer, no matter where he is or how he\\\u0027s moving, will ever observe anything accelerating \u003Cem\u003Eto\u003C/em\u003E the speed of light. It\\\u0027s literally impossible, in exactly the same way and for exactly the same reason that it\\\u0027s impossible to count to infinity. You can keep counting forever \u00E2\u20AC\u201Dyou can keep \u003Cem\u003Eaccelerating\u003C/em\u003E forever \u00E2\u20AC\u201Dbut you can never reach infinity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the difference between a mile an hour slower than the speed of light and the speed of light itself might only seem like one mile an hour, but in fact it\\\u0027s a gulf that\\\u0027s literally infinitely wide.

It took a guy named Minkowski to figure out, based on the work of Einstein which was at the time still quite naive, that if you give spacetime a \u003Cem\u003Edifferent type of geometry\u003C/em\u003E from the four-mutually-perpendicular-axes of four-space, instead of getting Galilean relativity (which is wrong, and contradicted by observations of the real world), you get Einsteinian relativity (which is right, and confirmed by observations of the real world).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\\\u0027t know how to explain in detail just \u003Cem\u003Ehow\u003C/em\u003E Minkowski\\\u0027s geometry is different from Euclid\\\u0027s without going into the deep topic of differential geometry, which is a fairly esoteric branch of math that most people never bother to learn about. It has to do with the signature of the metric, where the metric is a tensor that describes how coordinate systems transform. Suffice to say that if you use the Euclid tensor, you get Galilean relativity, and if you use the Minkowski tensor, you get the Einstein\\\u0027s theory of special relativity, which describes how coordinate systems transform between observers moving through space in the absence of either gravity or acceleration. (If you want to understand how gravity and acceleration work, you have to set the Minkowski tensor aside and look instead at the Einstein tensor, a much more complicated object that I won\\\u0027t even bother alluding to.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat it really all boils down to is the fact that we \u003Cem\u003Ecan\\\u0027t see time.\u003C/em\u003E We can see space \u00E2\u20AC\u201D we can draw lines on a piece of paper and go \u0027Oh, these are parallel,\u0027 and stuff like that. It was from such explorations of how space works that we got Euclid\\\u0027s geometry, and in particular his fifth postulate. Euclid\\\u0027s fifth postulate is the one that says, in essence, that two lines which are parallel in one place are parallel everywhere. But it turns out the fifth postulate is \u003Cem\u003Eonly true in the special case\u003C/em\u003E, a type of geometry which mathematicians call \u0027flat,\u0027 because you can illustrate how it works on a flat piece of paper. When we first started thinking about how time relates to space \u00E2\u20AC\u201DGalileo, again \u00E2\u20AC\u201Dwe all just assumed that the geometry in which space and time operate must necessarily be the geometry of Euclid: \u0027flat\u0027 geometry. Turns out this is wrong, which is where Minkowski came in, and so forth and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I can make an analogy \u003Cstrong\u003Ewhich should not be taken very seriously\u003C/strong\u003E just for purposes of illustration, you know how on a Mercator projection of the Earth the equator looks just fine but there\\\u0027s this awful distortion near the poles making Greenland look as big as Africa? It\\\u0027s that same basic kind of idea. If you try to represent curved geometry \u00E2\u20AC\u201D the geometry of the surface of a sphere, like the Earth \u00E2\u20AC\u201Din flat space \u00E2\u20AC\u201Dlike on a piece of paper \u00E2\u20AC\u201Dyou find that it just simply doesn\\\u0027t work. You end up with inconsistencies, like straight lines on the globe turning curved (lines of latitude) or parallel lines on the map intersecting (lines of longitude). That\\\u0027s not because we suck at drawing maps; it\\\u0027s because you \u003Cem\u003Ecan\\\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E draw a map of a globe. It\\\u0027s physically impossible, because the geometries just aren\\\u0027t compatible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe relationship between space and time is kind of like that, roughly speaking. The part that makes it tricky is that we can\\\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Esee\u003C/em\u003E time like we can see the globe. It\\\u0027s one thing to look at a map and then look at a globe and go \u0027Oh, the map is all wonky because it has to be.\u0027 If you could \u0027see time\u0027 (whatever that means), you would probably also be able to look at Galilean relativity and go \u0027Oh, the map is wonky because it has to be.\u0027 Instead, though, we have to observe time indirectly, by looking at things like how fast-moving subatomic particles age in different frames of reference, and suss out the geometry of time the hard way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RedDwarfIV\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RedDwarfIV\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what, we need to build a drive that causes reality to become Euclidian?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease don\\\u0027t take this the wrong way or anything, but that\\\u0027s exactly like saying you need a map that causes the Earth to become flat.

In essence, we have to replace the idea of Euclidean vector addition with the idea of rotation by a hyperbolic angle. Hyperbolic angles work just like circular angles \u00E2\u20AC\u201D you know, 90\u00C2\u00B0 or whatever \u00E2\u20AC\u201D only instead of going from zero to 360\u00C2\u00B0, they go from minus infinity to plus infinity.

Hyperbolas are, in a meaningful sense, \u0027inside-out\u0027 circles, so in a lot of ways they behave in opposite fashion to how circles behave.

But like I said before, thinking about motion that way ends up giving you the wrong answers once you deal with things that move fast \u00E2\u20AC\u201D like, yes, muons produced in cosmic-ray interactions in the upper atmosphere. So instead, you have to describe motion using hyperbolic geometry, and when you do that, velocities look like hyperbolic angles instead of Euclidean vectors.\u003Cp\u003ESo let\\\u0027s go back to the example from before: thing moving away from you at one mile an hour, other thing moving away from that thing at two miles an hour, how fast is thing 2 moving away from you? Like I said, if you write that out as a problem in Euclidean vector math, you get the wrong answer. It\\\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Every very close\u003C/em\u003E to the right answer, because three miles an hour is a small number, but it\\\u0027s still wrong. If you want the \u003Cem\u003Eright\u003C/em\u003E answer, you have to convert \u0027one mile an hour\u0027 into a hyperbolic angle, and then convert \u0027two miles an hour\u0027 into a hyperbolic angle, and then add the angles, and then convert back to a velocity again to get a number you can intuitively understand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat all sounds like mathematical nonsense and navel-gazing, I know. But here\\\u0027s why it\\\u0027s important: \u003Cem\u003EThere\\\u0027s no fastest possible speed.\u003C/em\u003E Remember when I said that hyperbolic angles go from minus infinity to plus infinity? Since velocities are hyperbolic angles, mathematically speaking, and hyperbolic angles go all the way to infinity, for any given velocity \u00E2\u20AC\u201D any given hyperbolic angle, in other words \u00E2\u20AC\u201D you can \u003Cem\u003Ealways\u003C/em\u003E add a little more. There is no universal speed limit! This is an important insight!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, but \u00E2\u20AC\u00A6 speed of light. How do we reconcile the fact that there\\\u0027s no universal speed limit with the fact that the speed of light is the \u0027universal speed limit\u0027? Like this: Remember I said before that after you do that math problem with the adding of the angles, you have to convert back to a velocity to get a number that makes sense to you. This is, in a sense, \u003Cem\u003Eprojecting\u003C/em\u003E hyperbolic geometry onto Euclidean geometry, in much the same way that you can \u003Cem\u003Eproject\u003C/em\u003E the surface of a sphere onto a plane to draw a map of the Earth. But remember how all flat maps of the Earth are distorted in one way or the other? Points which are actually close together look far apart on the map, because in projecting one geometric surface onto another you end up breaking isometry \u00E2\u20AC\u201D which is just a fancy way of saying you distort the distances between points. Well, the same is true of projecting velocity space \u00E2\u20AC\u201D which is hyperbolic \u00E2\u20AC\u201D onto Euclidean space in order to convert angles into velocity vectors: You end up with a distortion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat distortion is called relativity. It\\\u0027s the reason why accelerating an object that\\\u0027s nearly at rest relative to you creates a big change in that object\\\u0027s velocity, while accelerating an object that\\\u0027s going like stink relative to you by the same amount creates a small change in that object\\\u0027s velocity. \u003Cem\u003EThe map is distorted.\u003C/em\u003E The map that relates actual changes in momentum and position over time to \u003Cem\u003Eobserved\u003C/em\u003E changes in momentum and position is distorted such that when things move slowly, the changes look big, but when things move fast, the changes look very small. It\\\u0027s actually \u003Cem\u003Ethe same change,\u003C/em\u003E just distorted by the projection of hyperbolic velocity space onto a universe that, to us, looks Euclidean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong story short, even though you can keep accelerating an object forever and ever \u00E2\u20AC\u201D because the velocity angle goes all the way to infinity \u00E2\u20AC\u201D the actual change in velocity a stationary observer sees as that object accelerates grows smaller and smaller the faster the object goes. What\\\u0027s the limit? The speed of light. If you accelerate an object forever, its \u003Cem\u003Eobserved speed,\u003C/em\u003E as seen by somebody at rest, will get closer and closer to, but will never exceed, the speed of light. If you look at the math, you find that the hyperbolic angle that corresponds to a velocity of the speed of light is actually infinite. Meaning you can get as close as you want to it \u00E2\u20AC\u201D you can always go faster \u00E2\u20AC\u201D but you can never actually reach it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo on the one hand, you can say truthfully that there is no universal speed limit. You can, in principle if not in practice, accelerate an object forever, and it\\\u0027ll just keep going faster and faster and faster and faster. But on the other hand, you can also say truthfully that the speed of light is the universal speed limit, because no observer, no matter where he is or how he\\\u0027s moving, will ever observe anything accelerating \u003Cem\u003Eto\u003C/em\u003E the speed of light. It\\\u0027s literally impossible, in exactly the same way and for exactly the same reason that it\\\u0027s impossible to count to infinity. You can keep counting forever \u00E2\u20AC\u201D you can keep \u003Cem\u003Eaccelerating\u003C/em\u003E forever \u00E2\u20AC\u201D but you can never reach infinity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the difference between a mile an hour slower than the speed of light and the speed of light itself might only seem like one mile an hour, but in fact it\\\u0027s a gulf that\\\u0027s literally infinitely wide. It only \u003Cem\u003Elooks like\u003C/em\u003E one mile an hour because we\\\u0027re looking at a distorted map.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2cM0M.gif\u0022 alt=\u00222cM0M.gif\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2cM0M.gif\u0022 alt=\u00222cM0M.gif\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2cM0M.gif\u0022 alt=\u00222cM0M.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dt890","CreatedById":8704,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-11T10:44:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Enothing is absolute and if the speed of light is the maximum speed anything can travel then we never achieve the speed of light we can maybe do 99.99999% of the speed of light but we can never truly say we are are exactly traveling at 299 792 458 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-11T11:44:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone in this thread touched on the problem of microscopic particles becoming a deadly hazard at near to light speed?
