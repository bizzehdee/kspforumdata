Unfortunately, being an open library, this could be anyone - Either ShotgunNinja himself, or an avid fan of his work, or even an automated script pulling newly uploaded mods from SpaceDock. Technically you could browse the Github repository and look for the contributor names, but there\u0027s no guarantee people will use the same handle on Github as they do here on the forums.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo your best bet is probabl trying the Kerbalism mod thread here on the forums, for starters.
