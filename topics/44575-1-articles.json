I have finally tweaked and perfected the Aeon Class Shuttlecraft, ready for inclusion in the SSI General Catalog after another tester can confirm they too can get it into orbit, and return safely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Aeon Class:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs an SSI original Type I Shuttlecraft prototype, which means it was developed by an SSI member, and is capable of carrying 1 Kerbal up to a 120km orbit, SSTO style, losing no parts, rendezvous and dock, and come back to the KSC, and all this remotely (no pilot required). Also it can depart fully fueled from 120km, land, and come back to orbit, rendezvous and dock. Being SSI minded, it fits the SSI footprint of a small, lightweight, auxillary spacecraft. This version is not a VTOL version, however, one is being developed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart Count:68\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel Remaining at 80km orbit: 125\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel Remaining at 120km orbit: 110\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReal Time to 80km Orbit: 7 minutes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis craft is capable of flaming out and going into a spin, recovering, and still have the remaining fuel above.
