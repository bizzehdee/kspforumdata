What they forgot to accommodate (or purposely left out) is the very reason heat-shields exist. Skin heating. Their model accurately depicts how general heating would work, distributing through the mass of the craft. It\u0027s only during the re-entry phases that this model fails to work as it applies heat until the entire mass is heated to failure, rather than what Star is working on where it will calculate the failure of the outer skin which would in turn more than often destroy the parts during reheating. This is why we still need DRE, but we can use the stock model for the most part in general heating applications.
