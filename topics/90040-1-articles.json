It\u0027s my understanding that when the game is minmimized, the \u0022scene\u0022 isn\u0027t being rendered, which Unity requires to run the physics engine. I don\u0027t ever remembering a time when the game ran minmimized, but I could be wrong. Just run it in the background, I think you should be fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T21:13:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s always been that way but only in full screen.

The game can even continue to run while you do so which is useful during long burns or just haveing to timewarp for years to a transfer window. Runing in normal fullscreen forces the game to pause and minimize if you alt tab and can sometimes cause stability issues on some systems.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ippo","CreatedById":107018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T23:24:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProtip: if you use OpenGL, you can run the game in borderless windowed mode.
