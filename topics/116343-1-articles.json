I present to you... \n\nThe Y-Wing fighter-bomber!\n\n![MKAWik2.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/MKAWik2.png?1)\n\nThe Y-Wing holds one pilot, one gunner in a position behind the cockpit, and one astromech droid. It is armed with 2 forward-mounted laser cannons, along with 2 proton torpedo launchers. The Y-Wing comes with streamlined hull plating, but many people, especially in the rebel alliance, who work on these craft remove the plating from the nacelles and main hull, as it makes it easier to maintain and gives a slight performance improvement. Generally the cockpit plating isn\u0027t removed, since the cockpit area needs less repair. The Y-Wing is notoriously slow, but makes up for that with it\u0027s heavy armament.\n\n639 parts.\n\nTwo thud engines.\n\nRequires infinite fuel.\n\nNow, for some pictures:\n\n![mIU8CL1.png](http://i.imgur.com/mIU8CL1.png)\n\n![f8qEYmD.png](http://i.imgur.com/f8qEYmD.png)\n\n![dxjQfRr.png](http://i.imgur.com/dxjQfRr.png)\n\n![bNF4aBi.png](http://i.imgur.com/bNF4aBi.png)\n\nEdit:\n\nesinohio\u0027s render:\n\n![nBHBUSG.png](http://i.imgur.com/nBHBUSG.png)\n\nEnjoy!\n\n[Download](http://kerbalx.com/Mad_Rocket_Scientist/AMRSD-Y-Wing)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-31T02:02:40Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2015 02:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mad Rocket Scientist**"},{"CreatedByName":"VR_Dev","CreatedById":92196,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T20:13:20Z","Content":"This is super well done.
