Outside air pressure gets in the way of the exhaust and makes it generate less thrust. The following equation links thrust and specific impulse:\n\n*Thrust = Specific Impulse \\* Fuel Flow Rate*\n\nSo reduced thrust and the same fuel flow rate means a lower specific impulse.\n\nIn KSP as it stands, the engines compensate for the thrust drop by increasing fuel flow. This is technically possible in real life, but there\u0027s no reason to do it. As per the above equation, if you hold thrust constant and increase fuel flow rate, again that means a lower specific impulse."},{"CreatedByName":"Cirocco","CreatedById":100285,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-18T13:51:16Z","Content":"what will happen is that thrust will vary: the higher the atmosphere, the less thrust. Isp will remain the same throughout the flight path. In real life that is because the thrust of an engine is related to the difference in pressure between the inside of the combustion/reaction chamber and the outside environment. More pressure outside = smaller difference (gradient) = less thrust. Specific impulse (which you can think of as engine efficiency) is related to engine-specific parameters and does not change if the engine itself doesn\u0027t change. (note that I think this isn\u0027t entirely true, but for simplification purposes it can be assumed to be so)\n\nIn 1.0, you will no longer be controlling the *thrust* with shift and ctrl, but rather you will control the *fuel rate*, just like in real life. So at 100% throttle, you\u0027ll be feeding the maximum amount of fuel into the engines, and they\u0027ll operate at peak power. Now, as they rise, they will go into thinner atmosphere and pick up thrust until they hit vacuum, at which point they wil reach peak thrust.\n\nSo in short: what will change is that rather than changing the amount of fuel being consumed throughout the flight (engines are really greedy at the start and become more efficient throughout the flight but always push equally hard), engines will now always consume fuel at a steady rate, but start pushing harder and harder as the flight goes on. So what you want to do is strap either more powerful engines to your rocket (to compensate lack of thrust early on) but you\u0027ll need less fuel (because you\u0027ll have a steady rate of fuel consumption, same as you would now have in vacuum). Other option includes strapping additional engines to the ship in the first stage to help overcome the lack of thrust.\n\nIn other words: the basic gist is that you\u0027ll need more thrust early on in the flight, so the solution is, in fact, to ADD MOAR BOOSTERS! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-18T14:22:06Z","Content":"The most immediate gameplay effect will be that engines with a large Isp gap between sea level and vacuum will be a lot worse as first stage engines.\n\nPrime example: the LV-N. Yes, it has low thrust, but some people still manage to build something that can launch on nothing but LV-N\u0027s. 60 kN per engine works out for them. The engine is kinda thirsty at 220 Isp in-atmosphere, but as you rise, Isp quickly climbs towards 800 and things are fine and dandy.\n\nCome v1.0, that will no longer work. On the launchpad, the LV-N will still have the same fuel flow rate as it would in vacuum, and it will no longer be extra thirsty... but, it will only offer 16 kN of thrust\\* instead of 60 kN. Only as the rocket climbs and Isp increases, the thrust will climb back up towards full. However, with 16 kN, you\u0027re not going to move off of the pad.

The nozzles of engines are optimized for the ambient conditions at which must operate, i.e. low altitude (near sea level pressure) or high altitude (near vacuum). At low altitudes, nozzles have small expansion ratios, and at high altitude they have large expansion ratios. An aerospike effectively acts like a variable expansion ratio nozzle engine, obtaining a sea level performance similar to a small expansion engine, and a high altitude performance similar to a large expansion ratio engine. In a specific environment, however, aerospikes tend to perform a little worse than a fixed nozzle engine that is optimized for that specific condition. Here are some hypothetical Isp numbers to illustrate this point:\n\nSmall expansion ratio: 260 s sea level, 300 s vacuum\n\nHigh expansion ratio: 200 s sea level, 330 s vacuum\n\nAerospike: 250 s sea level, 320 s vacuum"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-18T18:21:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E An aerospike would have basically the optimal nozzle the whole flight, and would get something like 320-390 Isp.... which is way better than 270-390 Isp, and way better than 320-360 Isp\n\nFunny, the 320/360 engine will lose less thrust at sea level than the 320/390 engine.
