So at 100% throttle, you\u0027ll be feeding the maximum amount of fuel into the engines, and they\u0027ll operate at peak power.

So what you want to do is strap either more powerful engines to your rocket (to compensate lack of thrust early on) but you\u0027ll need less fuel (because you\u0027ll have a steady rate of fuel consumption, same as you would now have in vacuum).

The nozzles of engines are optimized for the ambient conditions at which must operate, i.e. low altitude (near sea level pressure) or high altitude (near vacuum). At low altitudes, nozzles have small expansion ratios, and at high altitude they have large expansion ratios. An aerospike effectively acts like a variable expansion ratio nozzle engine, obtaining a sea level performance similar to a small expansion engine, and a high altitude performance similar to a large expansion ratio engine. In a specific environment, however, aerospikes tend to perform a little worse than a fixed nozzle engine that is optimized for that specific condition.
