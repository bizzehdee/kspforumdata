Is it supposed to push against your craft that hard? My Lander was about 2.5 tons and it was on a narrow base, but you would think if anything a drill would pull you inwards as opposed to the opposite due to the screwing force. Is this known, and if so do I just need a 10-ton class lander?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would have a picture, but trying to F9 crashed my game.
