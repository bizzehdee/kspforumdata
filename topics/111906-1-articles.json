However you should realize the numbers deltaV maps are often fairly tight estimates and that things like the inclination changes amounts (green parenthesis is metaphors map above) are often important. For example, the dV map gives a minimum of 1290 x 2 \u002B 1560 = 4140 dV. However, the actual capture is 230 more dV and the inclination plane change is another 520 dV. Inclination plane changes will often run about a third to half of the amount listed, and here the inclination change takes 52% of the listed 1010. From the deltaV map I would have used something like 4140 \u002B 505 (half inclination) = 4645 with a larger 20% margin to give 5600 dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECyberSoul\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"waterlubber","CreatedById":119333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T22:25:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI put the IP transfer\u0027s worth of DeltaV, I knew that Dres is far smaller than Duna, my usual target, so I was extremely surprised by the enormous requirements to slow down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T04:41:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHaha, wait for Moho, it\u0027s the planetary transfer version of a final exam -- especially that injection burn if your Hohmann transfer wasn\u0027t basically perfect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
