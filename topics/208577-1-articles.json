I had a mission in which i had to test the Mk 12 brake parachute. I launched straight up into the air and threw off my solid booster, which had two parachutes attached to it, and deployed them. As I completed the mission and landed safely back on earth\u00A0 I started timewarping 50x and suddently the booster crashed, although its velocity was like 2.3 m/s. As soon as I recovered the vessel I got two notifications:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Something like: I escaped earths gravity and I got science and money for that\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 idk exactly anymore an didn\u0027t take any screenshot but I remember that it said something with the sun\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you had the same problem before and can you tell me more about it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nComputer:\u00A0 iMac 21,5\u0022 mid-2014, macOS Big Sur 11.6.7, using Steam.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dci","CreatedById":106864,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-15T12:38:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVessel out of load distance will crash, even with sufficient amount of parachutes attached. If you timewarp, it changes vessel state from loaded to unpacked and no other physics is calculated than orbital mechanics, resulting in vessel crash again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-16T13:24:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to Gameplay Questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
