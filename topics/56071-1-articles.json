You may be scalded by the \u0027Hardcore\u0027 programmers, who use Linux and are sworn to c\u002B\u002B and open-source, but you can code in whatever language you want. Unity uses Javascript, C# or Boo (kinda Lua-like). I would say C#, as its more flexible, it\u0027s a popular language and you are free to use most of the .NET framework with it. (Unity doesn\u0027t include some of the DLL\u0027s) You can either download Unity and use the built in IDE Monodevelop, or download Visual Studio Express, learn some C# and then get started on Unity. I would recommend downloading visual studio, learning C# and then linking it with Unity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
