If you want a good output you\u0027ll need at least 720p. Next up, when you\u0027re exporting/rendering, check the resolution. I sometimes render my films as 1440X1080p by accident and it squishes everything. And finally, are you recording at a reasonable framerate? 25\u002B is required for a fluid looking film. Pleasure to help. Good luck.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
