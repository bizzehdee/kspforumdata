Can you come up with a set of equations that will calculate correct wheel rotation for the desired motion of the vehicle, taking into account X and Y position and the wheels handedness within the craft? So if the wheel knows its position and orientation relative to the other wheels and in the craft, you feed it a control, say \u0022move laterally left\u0022 or \u0022turn right\u0022 and it will figure out what it should be doing? Obviously these would need to be summed, but you get the idea. Creating configurable joints is childs play, so if the maths is there, setting a joint up within the wheel and feeding the motor drive a rotation speed will work rather well. Also, suspension is also possible within the joint!! I also have a novel way to cheat a way around the little \u0022bounce\u0022 the one dimensional colliders currently give.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI probably could come up with the rules for deriving that, but be warned that a lot of the math overlaps with crab steering and Ackermann correction. Essentially you require the same local velocity vector that all my other wheels would require, just the final interpretation of it changes from \u0022turn wheel to face it\u0022 to \u0022apply rotation proportional to the vector along our wheel axis\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still not sure that the multiple collider route will return the best result based on my testing, although maybe your proposed cheat could get around that problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022riocrokite\u0022 data-cite=\u0022riocrokite\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EZodius, do you plan your wheels to have top mount or forward mount?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe wheel will mount from the top, so that they have 360 degree uninterrupted rotation capability.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-02T20:39:01Z\u0022 title=\u002202/02/2015 08:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ZodiusInfuser\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-02T14:29:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that kind of procedural is worth pursuing. As you say, there are lots of cool things that could be produced like that. Riocrokite\u0027s frames could be another good example, actually. The other advantage it has would be the lack of wobble between the sections as there would not be any joints involved. The nodes are probably not too difficult, it will just take a little thought and code diving some of the JSI switchable node modules. The biggest sticking point is probably what to do when a frame has been created and parts have already been added. There would have to be some way to lock it down once parts are attached to it, or crazy stuff might happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can come up with some equations, I\u0027ll have a go with both methods for the wheels.
