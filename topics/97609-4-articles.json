The general caveat most seem to have is that we don\u0027t know how well it will all work, and getting everything to work inevitably means that experimentals will have to be exhaustive in scope for this release. As long as it isn\u0027t rushed through testing, and as long as the developers are not shy to go back and do more work if the feedback of the testing team is \u0022this isn\u0027t going to work\u0022, it should be fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E On a semi-related note for those complaining that their pet feature isn\u0027t in KSP yet, I would point you to a number of other games that went 1.0 and grew considerably in scale and scope after that release. Terraria and Minecraft in particular are currently far more elaborate in their current forms than they ever were at their 1.0 releases.

Many large features have run into problems upon release in the past, the unbalanced Strategies stand out in particular in my mind. These features usually take a patch/update or two to fully satisfy the community and mesh well with the rest of the game. If SQUAD releases that many new things at once, we will have at least one bad problem, and possibly not go to space today. Now, we\u0027ve all seen how the forums can get when there\u0027s an unbalance/issue (magical ISP-enhancing kerbals, anyone?), so releasing this and calling it a finished game, only to have to release a patch/new version shortly after launch reminds me an awful lot of many games released last year. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease don\u0027t do that, Squad. I propose that at least one version before 1.0 be released, so that the community can at least see how the features are implemented and offer their feedback. I\u0027m not saying that Squad\u0027s QA team isn\u0027t great, but when Version 1.0 hits, the protective cocoon of \u0027Beta\u0027 falls away, and KSP is exposed to the full fury of game reviewers and their ilk. Having feedback from the entire KSP community will greatly help it stand on its own as a complete game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, I showed KSP to my friend the other day, and he complained how ugly it was. I was about to violently disagree, but then realized that I\u0027m used to running Environmental Visual Enhancements, along with Astronomer\u0027s Visual Pack, which make the game absolutely stunning. He has a point, stock KSP is pretty plain in comparison.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs part of the current atmospheric enhancements, perhaps the devs could sneak in clouds? Heck, hire rbray and get him to make EVE stock. Its touches just add so much more to the game, and I feel that newer players would be motivated to stick around longer if they could really see how pretty the game can be. While I\u0027m on the topic, all KSPs\u0027 planets feel pretty boring in terms of environments, and new features there would be most welcome. However, I understand that this would likely push back KSP 1.0 by many, many months.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the topic of Unity 5. While I understand that the Unity and Squad devs don\u0027t talk to each other, KSP would be enhanced greatly by waiting until Unity 5 is out before releasing. The game still doesn\u0027t feel \u0027smooth\u0027 to me, like many others do. While I do experience mostly lag-free flight, things like the UI and menus feel a little slow, as well as the several seconds between switching scenes. It could be just me, but I think a few more optimization-oriented things need to be done under the hood before I can consider KSP to be release-worthy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhew! I\u0027m usually the type to sit by and not participate much in the large feedback threads, but as this was such an important issue towards the future of KSP, I couldn\u0027t help but throw in my own 2 cents.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Etl;dr:\u003C/strong\u003E The update will add lots of features, KSP still feels plain and unoptimized.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESolutions: \u003C/strong\u003EHave at least one more Beta release before 1.0, add clouds, and try to update the engine to Unity 5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are the thoughts of one lowly forumer, feel free to discuss them and/or tear me apart.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cpast","CreatedById":112846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-24T04:07:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s one situation where this would be fine (annoying, but basically fine): If this is Squad saying that the whole having-more-and-more-intermediate-versions-released-to-the-public is done, and they\u0027ll do a full beta/RC cycle with the testing and QA teams (including alpha versions of the new features). Say, if the \u0022prep for intermediate releases\u0022 is too time-consuming, and they think they can get it done quicker pushing frequent builds to testers. That\u0027d be very annoying, and break the early access concept, but would work just fine in the end, and is how most games work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what it seems likely happened: Squad has been working for around 4 years on this game. They\u0027ve gone through, by my count, 21 basic releases (0.07-0.25 counting 0.23.5 as a basic release, plus 0.90). The game is honestly right now in a state where it\u0027s a plausible game by itself. It doesn\u0027t feel like a beta; sure, it feels empty without mods, but that\u0027s because I\u0027m used to mods, and to modding other games (so I looked for mods quickly). Other games I\u0027ve played feel just as empty without mods in their final release state after I\u0027m used to having lots of mods. KSP vanilla is a plausible complete game. It might not be the best complete game it could possibly be, but it\u0027s still pretty darn good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, you\u0027ve spent 4 years of your life working on a game. It\u0027s in a decent state. You\u0027re losing some of the drive that led you to start working on the game; much of the novelty is going away. Testing, bugfixing, and stabilization is boring. You have things you want to do, but doing them will just push the time when you can say \u0022I made a game\u0022 back even further. But you have these things you don\u0027t want to compromise on; you won\u0027t feel like you made your game until they\u0027re added. So, you say \u0022I\u0027ll add these, and then I\u0027m done! Game is made!
