For instance Rockomax parts would become cheaper if you use them more, thus your inclined to utilize their parts more often. This could add a new element into the game where Rockomax(for example) parts as a whole would be cheap by the end game, and the end game competition has better, but less used and thus more expensive parts (Kerbodyne). Same would go for the weaker parts earlier in the tech tree, such as the lv-t45 from Jeb\u0027s company. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually feel if this isn\u0027t implemented in one way, it should be HIGHLY considered for its addition into the stock game. This is of course if it would fit within the contract system without complicating things. As i do know when \u0022Testing\u0022 parts for certain contracts, you get a limited amount, and if you fail with the limited amount you lose reputation. Maybe this sort of \u0022cheaper parts contract\u0022 could only come into play once you have a stable use of the part, thus giving you reason to utilize the part MORE if you like it, as it would get cheaper over time. (to a degree obviously)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe addition of this mechanic could represent real life. With contracts acting as a way to improve production through field testing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinances in KSP should be the most fluid portion of the game. As it fuels the real game play, but also limits it. So creating multiple ways to play with your own funds should be of high priority.
