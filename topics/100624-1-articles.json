I ran out of fuel (naturally) and decided to bung on infinite fuel as i was already annoyed that my initial mission had failed. \n\nI switched to map view and suddenly I was on an escape trajectory from the Sun, and I had magically teleported above Dunas orbit. Everything is correct except the velocity. The space center says my orbit is \u0022On escape Trajectory Out of Sun\u0022, out of map view I am in the correct place.\n\n![5JNxjgX.jpg?1](%5Bimg%5Dhttp%3A//i.imgur.com/5JNxjgX.jpg?1)\n\nI have a few questions ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) ...\n\n1. WHY?\n\n2. I don\u0027t believe my orbital speed is fast enough to follow this trajectory...\n\n3. Why did I teleport above Dunas orbit?\n\nJust curious, might just been a new, rare kraken. Cheers in advance."},{"CreatedByName":"GloriousWater","CreatedById":128421,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T19:05:18Z","Content":"By any chance did you hack gravity (accidentally or otherwise)? It would probably explain your trajectory with that velocity."}]}
