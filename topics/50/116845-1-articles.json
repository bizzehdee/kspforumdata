Part 3 was a marathon. It\u0027s LONG, but there is a big science payoff in the end. And it is the end. I think these tutorials should be enough information to get even the rawest recruit to the point of being fairly confident to carry on with the tougher contracts in Career Mode.\n\nAs I said in Part 1:\n\nOk, so I read many posts from beginners who: \n\n1. Have no idea how to start in Career Mode. \n\n2. Are crawling around the KSC, scrabbling for science points in its different biomes. \n\n3. Are trying to build aircraft to fly somewhere on Kerbin to do a visual report or something.\n\nI spent a couple of hours putting together, what I hope is, a useful guide to some of these people on how to go about the early stages of Career Mode.\n\nIt is not *the* ***right*** way to go about it. There is **no** right way in KSP. That is the beauty of the game. The way is ***your*** way. If you want to scrabble around the KSC, good for you. If you like building aeroplanes, fabulous. This is just some suggestions on how you might want to go if those options don\u0027t appeal.\n\nI hope this is of use to someone. Constructive criticism welcomed.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-26T02:31:30Z\u0022 title=\u002207/26/2015 02:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Phil deCube**"},{"CreatedByName":"jondugger123","CreatedById":149541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T21:31:06Z","Content":"Literally a second after saying I would like a part 3, i found it.
