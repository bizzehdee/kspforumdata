You get to design the craft, send it off on it\u0027s mission, get to the planet, and then see\u00A0what\u0027s on the surface. A short term option is sending a rocket, landing on the surface, and then lifting off again. But a long term option, like building a base, is great for scientific missions. But \u003Cem\u003Ehow \u003C/em\u003Edo you build the base? \u003Cem\u003EHow \u003C/em\u003Edo you get it to the planet?

There are so many choices. Do you want it to be a mobile base? Like a large rover? Do you want it to be a massive colony, connected by walkways or tunnels? Or do you, in the case of Laythe or Eve, want it to be a floating base? There\u0027s only one issue: Getting it to fit inside the launch vehicle. An easy design of a starting module is this: 1x Hitchhiker module. 1x Docking port hub. 1x Storage bay (or fuel tank), with landing legs on the sides. 4x Deployable solar panels (or two big ones). Place batteries either inside the storage bay, or on top of the hitchhiker module. 2.5m to 1.5m adapter. Antennae on the adapter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is a simple starting base module. It\u0027s not much, but once you have it down on the surface, you can create a better module, and transfer the crew over. Next, you want to design the launch vehicle. Depending on where you want to go, it will need varying amounts of fuel. I would build a probe core with large fuel tanks, and powerful (but efficient) engines. You will need a fairing to cover your base module, (so it doesn\u0027t get destroyed while going through Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere). Add SRBs if you want, and don\u0027t forget a method of power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart 2: Launch, and Nodes\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you\u0027re happy with your craft, launch it. Before throttling up and lifting off, you should aim for a launch window (where two objects are closest to one another, therefore saving fuel). Once your in the air, follow the standard orbit guide (tilt 90\u0027 to the right, get to desired height above atmosphere, cut engines, re-engage engines, and watch apoapsis and periapsis meet. Once you are safely in orbit, you can release the fairing. Set a maneuver node to your target destination, and perform the necessary burn. From there on, simply timewarp. Once reaching your destination, do another burn to get in orbit. Now for the landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart 3: Fancy heating effects and speed\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are preparing to land on the surface. If it has an atmosphere, then you will need a heat shield. Burn your engines towards the planet, and you will be heading on an impact trajectory (not really, as you plan to slow down and land). Once getting through the atmosphere, you will need to burn your engines to slow your descent. You should activate parachutes, and keep burning your engines. A good speed for landing is roughly 5m/s to 10m/s, as you don\u0027t want to get there and crash into the planet, after spending all that time and effort. Once your craft has safely landed, your mission is complete. Take science reports, look around, explore. You may want to send other missions to the planet, adding rovers or other modules. Just don\u0027t forget to dock them, or else they won\u0027t be connected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this guide helps you, TCIS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
