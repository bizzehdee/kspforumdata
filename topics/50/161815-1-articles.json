I tested it this week end with class D asteroids\u00A0and it gave me satisfaction, so i wanted to share. (I have no class E in my vicinity to try it on right now, but look forward to it ).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe problem:\u003C/strong\u003E asteroids good. Me catch dem. But asteroids often on higly excentric, strongly inclined orbit. Sad. I try to refuel and reuse the same tug as much as possible, but those pesky rocks never have the good manners to match my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E parking orbit, and more often than not i spent too much fuel reaching them and could not stop them. sad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe solution : \u003C/strong\u003Epark your tug around the Mun and rendez vous from there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is the process in 10 steps:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003EHave a tug in mun orbit. A Klaw, a Nerva, reaction wheels and lots of fuel, preferably in Mk 1 fuel tanks for better mass ratio.Refuel. For bonus style\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003Epoints, refuel from a mun base.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen your target enters Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, look at its trajectory. Its plan will cut the mun\u0027s in two places (unless it\u0027s quasi-coplanar, in such case you don\u0027t need this trick anyway, you lucky person). This means you have one window every 3 Kerbin days to launch your mission.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen the mun is aligned with the \u0027roid\u0027s plan, burn like you want to go back to Kerbin. But instead of aiming for the equator and reentry like normal, aim so that Kerbin will slingshot you in the proper alignment. This will require playing with the normal/antinormal vectors and setting your escape velocity accordingly. The advantage here is that a very small nudge inside the mun\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E can completely change your orbit once the Kerbin slingshot is complete. Not mentioning the Oberth effect goodie you will get at your Kerbin periapsis. Pay attention though to the target orbit\u0027s orientation. Depending on that you will have to aim for one side of Kerbin or the other, but again, a small push early will allow for a big difference in the final result.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWith a proper slingshot, you should reach the target\u0027s path with little spending of fuel. You don\u0027t have much leeway for timing, so make corrections with\u00A0radial in/out manoeuvres to meet the target.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNormaly, you should be able to rendez vous with only a fraction of your fuel spent. Match velocity, klaw, turn around and burn until your periapsis enters Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. You can now wait for the air to bring down your apoapsis for free.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhile you are still far from Kerbin and your velocity is low, try to align your inclination. The farer from Kerbin, the easier.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen your apoapsis is low enough, bring your periapsis outside of Kerbins atmosphere and voila, you are in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E with your rock.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBring your tug back to mun orbit, refuel, rinse, repeat.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nProfit !\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-09T03:10:34Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2017 03:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by kermand\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
