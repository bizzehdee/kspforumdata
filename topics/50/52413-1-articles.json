The accepted answer for a Kerbin launch requires 4500 m/s so the gravity turn will require 3000 m/s = 4500 m/s - 1500 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you\u0027re still around you\u0027ll probably be interested in specifics about the methodology.

I did more testing and discovered that 1200 m/s gets you up to 8 km and it is possible to complete a lazy (did not move prograde fast enough) gravity turn into a circular 75 km orbit with only 3100 m/s in the second stage. 3000 m/s is enough to put you mostly in orbit and yet keep your second stage from turning into space junk.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-09T04:38:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAn efficient stock ascent will be \u0026lt;4400 m/s, though this is not possible for all craft (It\u0027s more like 4600 m/s for a rocket SSTO maxing out payload per engine).
