Use 3 Big S - Elevons 2 or 8 Small Delta Wings for cooling.\n\nIntroduction\n\nKSP 1.0.2 is hard [citation needed]. One of the factors contributing to \u0022hard-ness\u0022 is the so-called \u0022nerf\u0022 of the LV-N nerva enginge, which now produces significant amounts of heat that usually leads to an overheating of craft components, if the craft was not built to handle high heat production.\n\nIn this post we show that the changes to the heat physics are NOT a \u0022nerf\u0022, but instead require care in constructing heat-handling crafts while still allowing the LV-N to be a viable engine for low-thrust, high-ISP transfer burns.\n\nThe LV-N engine produces \u0022a lot\u0022 of heat. In fact, it produces 31104 \u0022magical units\u0022 of Heat. This heat will gradually heat up the engine itself and everything that is connected to it, and if it is allowed to build up will eventuall overheat and explode (either the engine itself or the attached parts). There are two ways to counteract that: one can use \u0022heat sinks\u0022 - parts that have a high \u0022thermal mass\u0022 or heat capacity. The problem with those is that even the deepest sink can fill up and burn times can only be very finite. Another possibility to counteract the heat is to get rid of it. But how? In the atmosphere, you use convection to give off the heat to the atmosphere. But there is no atmosphere in deep space! Instead, one has to rely on \u0022blackbody radiation\u0022. Blackbody radiation is a real physical phenomenon where an object (no matte which!) is heated up, he radiates off the thermal energy as electromagnetic radiation.\n\nThe \u0022Stefan-Boltzman\u0022 equation describes the blackbody radiation at high temperatures:\n\n j = k \\* T^4\n\nWhere j is the energy radiated per surface area, T is the temperature and k is some constant. To put it in words, \u0022The hotter an object, the more more more more radiation it gives off\u0022.\n\nFrom this equation we can already see, that in order to get good radiation values, we need to get our \u0022radiators\u0022 as hot as possible without them exploding. Most (if not all!) interesting parts for this have a temp. tolerance of 2000 K. We will use them at their maximum temperature in order to cool our nuclear engine!\n\nIn reality, the total amount of energy radiated also depends on the surface area. Since we don\u0027t have good measures for that in the game, we have to determine them experimentally.\n\nWe used the Thermal Data from the Debug Menu to read out thermal data, and Hyperedit to manipulate thermal conditions of the crafts.\n\nMethods\n\nThe Mods used for this Test are:\n\n[Hyperedit](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37756-0-90-HyperEdit-NEW-VERSION-Teleporter-Orbit-Planet-Editor-More), Version 1.4\n\nA craft with a central core (Made from a full Kerbodyne S3-7200 Tank) and several surface-attachable structural parts was used to thest the radiation the parts give off. The craft is depicted in [Figure 1](http://i.imgur.com/oDUKO5I.jpg?1) and is available for download from here: [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1414175/ksp/Heattest-Stuff.craft](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1414175/ksp/Heattest-Stuff.craft)\n\nUsing the Debug Menu (alt-F12), thermal Data display was enabled.\n\nThe craft was \u0022launched\u0022, then Hyperedited into an Orbit of 100011 m. Then, the \u0022Heat Editor\u0022 feature of Hyperedit was activated and the temperature of the central tank was locked to the current ambient temperature.\n\nSequentially, all surface attachable parts were locked, and then their temperature raised to just below 2000 K (which is the maximum Temp. for all parts that were used). The \u0022Rad Flux\u0022 field was recorded for each part.\n\nA second craft was used to confirm sustainable burn capability. It consists of an LV-N, an FL-T400, a Mk1-Lander Can and 3 Big S 2 - Elevons. It is depicted in [Figure 2](http://i.imgur.com/Xgc0qp5.png) and is available for download from here: [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1414175/ksp/Nuketest-Big%20S%202.craft](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1414175/ksp/Nuketest-Big%20S%202.craft)\n\nThe craft was launched, and Hyperedit to an orbit of 300000 m. Infinite Fuel was turned on using the Debug Menu. No heat manipulations were performed.\n\n\u003E ![oDUKO5I.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/oDUKO5I.jpg?1)\n\u003E The craft used for the radiation testing.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![Xgc0qp5.png](http://i.imgur.com/Xgc0qp5.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Figure 2: Sustainable burn test.

This craft had six extra parts added over the previous Poodle tug, four wings and those two girder segments (I added those small deltas after the fact for \u0022roleplaying\u0022 because the entire craft gets quite hot, they\u0027re not at all needed), and burns its entire fuel supply out in 30 minutes without anything exploding. Yes, I modded those parts to handle liquid fuel only because it\u0027s stupid that we don\u0027t have that ability in stock.\nIf I limited burns to normal transfers and braking burns, I\u0027d probably only need to add those girder segments, if anything. It gets 8.5km/s on four nukes. The \u0022problems\u0022 with nukes are quite easy to overcome.\n\nYes, I can do this bone-stock with four engines as well, the single mod isn\u0027t a huge advantage.\n\n![uznIK5fh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/uznIK5fh.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T02:07:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Is there a mod yet that just has dedicated radiators for LV-Ns?\n\nThere is!\n\n[Heat Management - 0.22](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118189)\n\n/shamelessselfpromotion"},{"CreatedByName":"timsfitz","CreatedById":104387,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T03:38:22Z","Content":"I will just turn heat off in the debug menu until squad fixes them or adds radiators.

They did include radiators on solar panels, yes, but really that\u0027s unrealistic (they\u0027ll absorb heat from the Sun; a radiator oriented parallel to the rays instead, rather than perpendicular as in a solar panel, would be more effective).\n\nBTW I\u0027ve also found that a simple magic sauce for keeping LV-Ns unexploded is to just thrust limit them to 73.5%. Sure, it\u0027s a bit of a thrust nerf in effect, but A: SQUAD believed they needed a nerf, and their case is pretty solid, and B: once the large jet fuel tanks are unlocked the changed LV-N chemistry turns into a massive boost. The way I see it, LV-Ns have just gotten the opposite treatment from what ion engines got a few versions ago - made about 2/3 as strong but twice as efficient.

If that requires a re-do of the model, SO WHAT? It\u0027s not like there\u0027s a lack of people making mods for this game, or that they would be unwilling to make a replacement model for the LV-N.\n\nIf you always need part B to use part A, make them both into part C.
