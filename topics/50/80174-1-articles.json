I\u0027ve only been messing with RT2 for a week or so. However, that\u0027s long enough to discover all the traps out there for RT2 noobs, especially if you\u0027re using it in a career game. I didn\u0027t have any real guides to start with so I\u0027m hoping to pass on my experience here.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThis so far just covers hooking up the Kerbin system. I haven\u0027t yet gotten it out to interplanetary but it\u0027s more of the same really. If you can do the Kerbin system, you can apply the same techniques everywhere else.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EBecause I haven\u0027t gone interplanetary yet, I haven\u0027t experienced bad signal delay so haven\u0027t done much with kOS yet.

So most of your launches, at least for science missions, will be crewed. But say you\u0027ve got DMagic Orbital Science and SCANsat, which add more experiments that can be transmitted at 100%, making them attractive for probes. And you want to transmit crew and EVA reports like normal but you\u0027ve decided to use RT for that more than anything else. And then there are all the part test contracts with dangerous conditions you\u0027d rather do with a probe than a crewed ship. So even if you\u0027re still mostly sending Kerbals out there, adding RT to the mix can spice things up a bit. This is the sort of game assumed to be going on in the background, and the RT network built here is intended to support it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut here\u0027s the kicker. Unless you can work in some simple part-test contracts into the RT launches, you\u0027re not getting any money out of your RT network. IOW, it\u0027s a sunk cost and you have to be doing other things to pay for it. So that means keeping things as cheap as possible. Not only does this mean minimizing the cost of each launch and satellite, but also building the network to last so you don\u0027t have to spend even more money launching replacement and/or upgraded satellites. No, you need to build it right the 1st time, able to meet all your needs from the get-go with future expansion capability built-in. This means the individual satellites might be more expensive, but launches cost more than satellites so that\u0027s what you\u0027re really trying to minimize. And to do this, you need to plan the network out in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPLANNING\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this example, the network in the Kerbin system must do the following things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EProvide full, uninterrupted coverage all around Kerbin orbit out to reasonably high altitude (for a SCANsat probe at 762km).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EProvide full, uninterrupted coverage for all of Mun and the space around it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EProvide full, uninterrupted coverage for all of Minmus and the space around it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EProvide uninterrupted links out of the Kerbin system.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENaturally, you can\u0027t afford to do this all at once, and you don\u0027t need a lot of this capability early in the game anyway, but that\u0027s the ultimate goal. So everything will be set up in stages to support this ultimate goal, with later stages added as they become necessary and affordable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving uninterrupted communications means having multiple available relay paths so that if a passing planet blocks 1, another will still work. This means that you need at least 2 satellites for each link in the chain. Further, each satellite must be able to talk to at least 2 others both upstream and downstream of it. The number of things 1 satellite can talk to depends on the number and type of antennae it carries. So right off the bat, we know we need at least 4 antennae per satellite, and in fact we\u0027ll need more than that, more like 6 to 8. And we\u0027ll need at least 2 satellites per link in the chain, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, to meet the above goals, we\u0027re going to do the following (largely inspired by Felbourn\u0027s Project Odyssey network):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EA ring of 3 Kerbostationary satellites which will anchor the system to KSC and be able to transmit in any direction out from Kerbin. This will be called the KGN (Kerbal Geostationary Network) satellites 1, 2, and 3. They provide the full coverage of Kerbin and link out to Mun and Minmus. We need 3 to cover all of Kerbin and to link from there outwards in any direction.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E2 satellites sharing Mun\u0027s orbit, 1 leading it a bit, the other trailing it a bit, as if at La Grange points. These will provide full coverage of Mun except for a tiny slice of the far side surface and a little bit in space above it. They will also provide a link out of the Kerbin system. These will be called MOS Leading and Trailing (Mun Orbit-Sharer).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E2 satellites sharing Minmus\u0027 orbit, same as the above.

We\u0027ll have 2 of them so hopefully Kerbol will only block 1 at a time.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA WORD ABOUT ANTENNAE\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are 2 types of antennae, dipoles and dishes. Both types come in several sizes with different ranges. Dipoles are treated (somewhat inaccurately) as omnidirectional and automatically connect to anything in range, but they have rather short range. Dishes are unidirectional and each one needs to be aimed at a specific target (a ship, a planet, or KSC itself), but they have very long range. In general, the rules for how they can talk to each other are as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDipole to dipole: Happens automatically if they\u0027re both within range of each other.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDipole to dish: Happens if 1) the dipole is within its range, and 2) the dish is pointed at the dipole ship itself or as a cone with the dipole inside the cone. In the latter case, a dish\u0027s cone can cover a large area of space or planetary surface and all dipoles in that area can talk to the dish. So normally you\u0027ll have dishes in orbit providing wide coverage while landers and low-orbit stations have dipoles.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDish to dish: EDIT: In the same SOI, this only happens if both dishes are within their ranges AND each dish is aimed specifically at the other dish\u0027s ship. Dishes in the same SOI can\u0027t connect to each other if 1 or both is in cone mode. If the dishes are in different SOIs, however, cone-to-cone will work.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EKSC to anything. All networks must link to KSC. KSC will connect with any antenna within range and above its horizon, whether it\u0027s a dish or a dipole. Further, KSC will connect with dishes either if the dish is aimed at KSC specifically or is coned at Kerbin.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that with dishes, you can target them on \u0022active vessel\u0022. If you do this for a relay satellite, you can change focus between several ships (say in a flotilla heading for Duna) and each will become connected as you switch to it, but will lose its connection when you switch to another ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBUILDING THE KGN SATELLITES\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1st step is to build the Kerbostationary ring. Getting to the point you can do this requires about 1100 science points to unlock the necessary parts. You should be able to get this no problem simply by doing science in high and low Kerbin orbit, about a dozen or so part test contracts, and MAYBE a Munar flyby. So until you get this far in the game, don\u0027t worry about RT. Everything will be crewed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, once you\u0027re scienced up enough, time to build the KGN satellites. These need 6 DTS-M1 antennae. 1 will be coned at Kerbin, 2 will be aimed at the other 2 KGN satellites, 2 will be aimed 1 each at MOS Leading and Trailing, and 1 spare set to \u0022Active Vessel\u0022. They also need 2x KR-7 antennae to talk to MiOS Leading and Trailing. And of course a probe core, SAS, RCS for fine control of thrust, a bit of fuel for orbital maneuvering, and enough power to run all this indefinitely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach of the 8 antenna consumes a little less than 1 EC/sec. The probe core and SAS combined consume a bit les than 1 EC/sec. So figure on 7 EC/sec. That\u0027s easily handled with small solar panels. But a satellite in Kerbostationary orbit will be eclipsed by Kerbin for about 1190 seconds each orbit. Mun\u0027s eclipse doesn\u0027t last as long. At 7 EC consumed per second, that\u0027s a total of 8330 EC used during the darkness. Now, you DON\u0027T technically need that much battery because most of the time you won\u0027t be focused on these satellites so they won\u0027t actually use any. But if you want to be realistic-ish, you need that much battery. And you need some more solar panels to charge it up before it gets dark again. If you do that, then you\u0027ll end up with a satellite costing about $20K that looks something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/ofgSKC\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2904/14601377250_68fef316a3_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214601377250_68fef316a3_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, because you don\u0027t have any RT network set up yet, you\u0027ll probably need to use a crewed ship to get this into orbit. What you need is a capsule, a transfer stage that can get from LKO to circularized out at ~2868km, and then bring the Kerbal back. Plus whatever amenities you think the Kerbal needs, like life support, parachutes, etc. And maybe a fairing around the lot if you\u0027re into that. It requires about 650m/s to get from LKO to 2868km and another few hundred to circularize there. And of course get back, but by then the ship will be lighter. Anyway, you might end up with something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/ofgSxJ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3841/14601376560_5e17c2ed94_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214601376560_5e17c2ed94_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis costs another ~15K or so. Note the many struts, necessary to keep this whole thing from wobbling during launch. Of course, this needs RCS itself for both maneuvering and fire thrust control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: You can save this whole thing as a subassembly because the crew pod isn\u0027t the root part. The root part is the probe core of the satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you need a reasonably cheap lifter for it. I came up with this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/owLMNV\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3909/14788082805_0ccffb23fb_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214788082805_0ccffb23fb_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal price about $73.3K.

Now you\u0027re immediately faced with the problem of where to put the maneuver node for the burn out to Kerbostationary altitude, so that by the time the satellite gets out there, it\u0027ll be in the correct position relative to KSC and/or the other satellites you\u0027ve already got in this orbit. How do you know where to put the node?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, the engineers at Geschosskopf\u0027s Sand \u0026amp; Gravel Rocketdynamix have got you covered. We\u0027ve developed the High Tech Satellite Maneuver Node Plotting Device. Here you can see it in action:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/oywuJZ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3879/14807926813_bb2ed685de_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214807926813_bb2ed685de_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe picture is pretty self-explanatory about how to use it. This shows it being used for the 2nd KGN satellite, but you also have to use it for the 1st one to get it parked directly over KSC. NOTE: don\u0027t place the node until the ship has only 1/4 of an orbit or less before reaching it. If you place the node too far ahead of your ship, it won\u0027t work right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, you place the node in the right place, then pull the prograde handle until you get an Ap of 2867km and some change. Then just burn out there, then circularize at Ap. And you\u0027l lbe in the right place or close enough for government work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you\u0027re out at about the right altitude and you have to fine-tune it so you\u0027re actually Kerbostationary. You don\u0027t have to be perfectly circular, you don\u0027t have to have an inclination of 0.000. What you need is an orbital period of EXACTLY 6 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds. Your ship might wobble around a little (like Ike seen from Duna) but it\u0027ll stay in the right general area instead of drifting around Kerbin over time, and this is all that matters. To get your orbital period nailed down, do the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOpen MJ\u0027s orbital info screen or the equivalent, so you can see your orbital period.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPoint the ship prograde\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ETurn on fine control (caps lock)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EUse gentle taps of the forward (H) and backwards (N) RCS translation keys to get your orbital period as close to 6:00:00 as you can.

Also, aim to be about 5:59:55 or so because the decoupling force will change the satellite\u0027s speed a bit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVERY IMPORTANT: If you haven\u0027t done so already, activate 1 of the DTS-M1 antennae on the satellite and aim it at KERBIN, not KSC. If you\u0027re properly above KSC, you\u0027ll connect to it this way and you want the cone for its share of covering Kerbin. DO THIS BEFORE separating the satellite!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027re happy, MANUALLY decouple the satellite (using the right-click menu) and back the rocket away gently using RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/ofhbS7\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3847/14601438178_2783ba83a2_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214601438178_2783ba83a2_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen use [ or ] to shift you back to the satellite. Now use its RCS to get it right on 6:00:00. You probably won\u0027t get it exactly there but you should be only like 0.05 of a second off at most. Yay, you\u0027ve got your 1st Kerbostationary satellite in place directly over KSC. Now switch back to the capsule and bring it home.

You\u0027ll end up with a fairly neat triangle of 3 satellites. As you bring up each new satellite, aim 1 of its DTS-M1 antennae at Kerbin and others at each KGN satellite already in orbit. You\u0027ll also have to switch back to the older satellites and aim more of their antennae at the new KGN satellites. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: Each time you switch to a satellite, be sure to tweak its orbital period as needed to keep it at 6:00:00. When you\u0027re not at the satellite, it\u0027s on rails so its period won\u0027t change, but it can change each time you switch to it, so keep an eye on this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the 3rd satellite will give you a fairly neat triangle, like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/oywudt\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2926/14807925043_ff21d521c7_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214807925043_ff21d521c7_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this pic, the blue lines are the cones aimed at Kerbin.

Following the same general rules as the KGN satellites, you might end up with something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/oywub4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5571/14807924903_65b5be4a33_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214807924903_65b5be4a33_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has more LFO and 7 antennae: 4x DTS-M1 and 3x KR-14. However, due to price imbalances at present, it\u0027s actually a little cheaper than a KGN satellite. These MOS satellites have 2 purposes: provide coverage of Mun for science missions going there, and link out to the KOS Leading and Trailing satellites that will one day be out there. So each MOS satellite will aim a DTS-M1 at each of the KGN satellites (and each KGN satellite will aim a DTS-M1 at each MOS satellite to have a sure link home. The 4th DTS is coned at Mun. The KR-14s won\u0027t be used until we\u0027re getting ready for insterplanetary stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that you have the KGN network in place, you can launch the MOS satellites as unmanned probes. They will never be out of sight of Kerbin and the KGN satellites will keep the MOS rockets linked at all times. So the rocket needed for this mission is considerably cheaper than what you used for the KGN satellites. Just remember to aim antennae on the MOS and KGN satellites to point at each other. Of course, if you\u0027ve got the money to burn, you can keep on launching them with Kerbals. That\u0027s what I did in this example because a) this wasn\u0027t a \u0022real\u0022 game, and \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E I was in a hurry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, getting the MOS satellites into the correct position is considerably easier than the KGN satellites. You just make a burn out to Mun\u0027s altitude using the stock closest approach markers so that you end up far enough ahead or behind Mun at your Ap. You want to be far enough away from Mun that you don\u0027t accidentally enter its SOI en route, and to have some safety cushion to keep you from falling into it over time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMun\u0027s orbital radius (12,000km exactly) is measured from the center of Kerbin, so you have to subtract Kerbin\u0027s equatorial radius (600km) from this to get \u0022altitude\u0022 as shown in the game. You want your Ap to be 11,400km exactly. Once you\u0027ve got your Ap close, slide the node around until the closest approach markers are where you want them (it really doesn\u0027t matter so long as you don\u0027t hit Mun\u0027s SOI) and do the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/owLLRz\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2935/14788079595_8a6b62d224_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214788079595_8a6b62d224_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the main burn, make sure you\u0027re pointing prograde and use fine-control RCS with H and N to fine-tune your Ap as close to 11,400,000 meters as you can get it. Then just coast out and circularize. Now you have to fine-tune your orbital period using RCS again. You want the same orbital period as Mun, which is 1 day, 14 hours, 36 minutes, and 24.4 seconds. NOTE THAT THIS IS A 24-HOUR DAY. If you\u0027ve gone to using Kerbin days instead of Earth Days, you\u0027ll have some other number. I leave that as an exercise for the interested student. But I grew up doing everything in 24-hour days so I\u0027ve been sticking with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that you\u0027ll probably be unable to nail this orbital period exactly. It\u0027ll be frustrating. You\u0027ll have it then it will just change by itself as much as 10 seconds either way. About the best I can tell you is, get it as close as you can then switch away from the satellite. But be sure to aim its 4th and last DTS-M1 coned at Mun. You should then have something like this (only with all 3 KGN and both MOS): \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/owuEeK\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5570/14784935541_7467af6b9d_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214784935541_7467af6b9d_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there you go.

Luckily the scansat saved me 2 times) at which point another actiongroup would extend the comutron and solar panels for constant link with the satellite network. the 4 probes at the equator are enough for 100% coverage of the mun, and 2 on the poles will just about cover minmus all the time, though coverage might be a bit iffy when minmus passes its an/dn nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne small problem with this setup though, is that the breakable antennas sometimes break when the ship is loaded in the distance because your active vessel comes near it.

I have never been able to get cone-to-cone or cone-to-ship to work, even when the ships were within each other\u0027s cones, so I figured it just didn\u0027t work. HOWEVER, all such attempts were with satellites all in Kerbin\u0027s SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I don\u0027t really see how being able to cone-to-cone across SOI boundaries is beneficilal in a career game, at least within the Kerbin system. It\u0027s impossible to put a satellite into Munarstationary orbit because the altitude required is outside Mun\u0027s SOI. This means that if you use cone-to-cone to get 100%, uninterrupted coverage of Mun\u0027s surface and a decent area of surrounding space, you need at least 3 satellites in Munar orbit. Sure, each of them needs no more than 4 antennae (1 coned at Mun, 1 coned at Kerbin, and 1 atimed at each KOS satellite), but you have to launch at least 3 satellites to do this. OTOH, if you\u0027re willing to settle for uninterrupted coverage of about 95-97% of Mun\u0027s surface while still getting all the useful volume of space around it, you can do that with just the 2 MOS satellitews I outlined above. Because the MOS satellites aren\u0027t in Mun\u0027s SOI, they can\u0027t connect cone-to-cone despite being within the cones, so need an antenna for each KGN satellite, and each KGN satellite needs an antenna for each MOS satellite.

The satellite you\u0027re trying to position has to be in a 100km orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. You can only place the node when the satellite you\u0027re positioning is within about 1/4 orbit of where the node will be. This requires several iterations of holding the cardstock up to the monitor and positioning it correctly, eyeballing the distance between the edge of the card and the satellite that\u0027s going to use the node, letting time flow a bit, and checking again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. You of course must be positioning the cardstock correctly: corner on the north pole, long edge pointing to where you want the satellite to end up relative to KSC or other satellites. This can only work if you\u0027ve set up the map view correctly. This requires focusing on Kerbin itself, rotating the view up until it hits the stop directly over the north pole, and zooming the map as needed so the long edge of your cardstock will cross the desired orbital altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 2 main sources of error are placing the node too far ahead of your satellite, which will make you come out behind your desired position, and not having the map view set up correctly, which can cause errors in any direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis method is of course just an aid to placing your satellites entirely by eye, without having to do any math, so is never going to be as accurate as using calculations and things like Precise Node. However, it if you do it right, you\u0027ll get more than close enough for government work. There is actually no reason to put a satellite exactly over KSC, it just has to be somewhere above KSC\u0027s horizon. Being centered over KSC just gives you the greatest margin of error and room to drift on both sides. The same generally applies to the other satellites--they just have to be above the horizon to each other, but the closer you get to an equilateral triangle, the more margin for drift you have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo at the bottom line, kerbostationary satellite positions relative to each other and KSC don\u0027t really matter unless you\u0027re got them so far off that you need additional satellites, which adds to expense. And if you\u0027ve got plenty of money, even that doesn\u0027t matter. Then you can flood a low orbit with many satellites that will move relative to KSC, each one connecting to it as it flies over. But if you want to do kerbostationary, then what really matters is orbital period, regardless of the method you use to position the satellites. The only way they\u0027ll be kerbostationary is if you nail their orbital period dead nuts on 6:00:00. If their orbits ain\u0027t quite circular and/or not quite with 0^ inclination, they\u0027ll wobble around slightly about a fixed point in the sky, but this won\u0027t affect communications. And as long as at least 1 of them can always link with KSC, and they can all link with each other, all will be fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mtshaw113","CreatedById":115693,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-15T18:45:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen we are launching unmanned ships and probes, do we need to set a target from the probe to a satellite, or shouldnt it do that automatically(Because the probe has an active vessel dish)?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-17T00:45:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mtshaw113\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mtshaw113\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhen we are launching unmanned ships and probes, do we need to set a target from the probe to a satellite, or shouldnt it do that automatically(Because the probe has an active vessel dish)?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your existing satellites have a dish set for active vessel, then those will aim at the probe you\u0027re launching.
