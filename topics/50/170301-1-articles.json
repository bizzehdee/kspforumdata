It\u0027s a great way to see what goes on in the game, and to learn more tips about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) If you find that your computer is having framerate issues, go into settings and turn down the graphics. It\u0027s better to have a high fps and low graphics, than a horrible fps but fantastic graphics.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Before you even create a new game,\u00A0go through all the tutorials. They really help in teaching the controls, how to get into orbit, landing, and how to use things such as maneuver nodes and the symbols on the NavBall.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) Use sandbox mode first. It can serve as a guide to get you used to the game, and go on to science and career modes. If you load up the game for the first time and pick \u0027Career\u0027 without knowing anything about the game or it\u0027s controls, you\u0027re gonna have a bad time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5) Kerbals aren\u0027t invincible. If they hit the ground too hard, they will die. If they go through a rocket engine that is on, they will die. If they are going through re-entry, they will also die. To avoid losing all your kerbals while you are starting out in the game, turn on \u0027Missing Crews Respawn\u0027 in the difficulty options menu. Your kerbals will still die, but a few days later they will be back at the Astronaut Complex, ready to go on a mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6) Attach parachutes! If something goes wrong, and you want to save your crew, parachutes are vital!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7) Attach a heat shield. A heat shield will protect your craft from the heat of re-entry. If you don\u0027t, your craft will most likely explode due to the heat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8) This is a bit cheaty, but if you want to play the game without your rockets or planes exploding or breaking apart, press ALT \u002B F12. This brings up the debug menu, and allows you to have infinite fuel, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and EVA fuel (jetpack fuel), prevent your craft from breaking apart due to weight or high G forces, prevent parts from exploding due to overheating, and allow you to hack gravity (have no gravity on planets).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n9) Check your staging! Before you launch your craft, go through the staging (the orange list thing on the right). You don\u0027t want your parachutes to deploy when your engines fire, do you?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n10) Use the Engineer\u0027s Report. This shows all the info about your craft, including it\u0027s weight, length, height, and so on, but also tells you for example, if your engines aren\u0027t receiving fuel, or if you are going to accidentally discard a fully fuelled part of your rocket due to staging errors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd there you have it, my top 10 tips for new players in KSP!
