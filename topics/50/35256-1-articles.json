It has a probe body and air intake on the front, a fuel tank in the middle, and a jet engine on the back, all separated by 2x2 structural plates. The 2x2 plates are NOT fuel cross-feed capable, so if there is no fuel line the jet engine won\u0027t work (as expected). But when I run a fuel line from the fuel tank to the corner of the plate, the plate can carry fuel to rest of the way to the engine and it works. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did not know things worked this way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/G5iC43V.png\u0022 alt=\u0022G5iC43V.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T14:24:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is weird.
