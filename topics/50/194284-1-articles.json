You first need to know your WASD keys and that Shift is up and Control is down. First you want to go to the kerbal you want to EVA then hover over him and press \u0022EVA\u0022. Next you want to press R to turn on your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E. After that you can press W to go forward, S to go backward, A to go left, D to go right, Shift to go up, and Control to down. To go back in to a module you first want to find the airlock then if it has a ladder grab it and walk up to the airlock then press B to board.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nControls:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nW to go forward\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nS to go backward\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA to go left\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nD to go right\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShift to go up\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nControl to go down\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nG to grab\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nB to board\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
