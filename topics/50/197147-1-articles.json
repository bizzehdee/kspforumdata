While not perfect, it is a great starting point for new players to help them learn the basics of KSP, and show them the easiest way to send their brave Astronauts out into the Solar System, and bring them safely back to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLNNo-0yak7HWb_tjRds3AxRE70uXh3Xdw\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
