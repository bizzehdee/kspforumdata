The Stayputnik Mk. 1 looks cool, but you can chose from the range of unmanned command modules. Below the Command Pod, you should add some Rechargeable Battery Banks. I used the Z-1k Rechargable Battery Bank due to its high Electricity Composite of 500 E; Use about three of them together for 1500 units of Electricity. Use two OX-4L 1x6 Photovoltaic Panels on both sides of the Battery Banks, use the symmetry option (the \u0027x\u0027 key) in the VAB and set it to 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you want to control your probe so add tiny parts for a light weight probe or satellite. Use two Stratus-V Roundified Monopropellant Tanks on opposite sides to the solar panels and four RV-105 RCS Thruster Blocks, two ROUND-8 Toroidal Fuel Tanks and a small Liquid Fuel Engine at the bottom of the probe; use the LV-909 Liquid Fuel Engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can add some Scientific Antennas to transmit scientific data back to Kerbin. Use one Communotron 88-88 right on the top of your Stayputnik Mk.2 and four Communotron 16. Change the Symmetry Mode to 4 and place them just below the Communotron 88-88 half way down the Command Pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, you will need a separator (like the TR-18D Stack Separator) so put one just below your engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESatellite and Rocket on Launchpad\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage One: This stage needs to be as short as possible so it doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t wobble about when you launch and needs to be aerodynamic to reduce drag. Attach a Rockomax Brand Adapter below the separator. Use a Rockomax X200-8 Fuel Tank and an Advanced S.A.S Module, Large between the Fuel tank and the Adapter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut a Rockomax Brand Adapter 02 at the bottom and make sure the flat end is pointed up (use W,A,S,D,Q,E to rotate the part). Finally, add a LV-N Atomic Rocket Motor and another separator below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage Two: This stage will be your main launch engine. Add another Rockomax Brand Adapter and attach to it a Rockomax Jumbo-64 Fuel Tank with one Rockomax \u0022Mainsail\u0022 Liquid Engine for your centre of thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd TT-38K Radial Decouplers; eight will do. Use the symmetry mode and set to 8. Attach Rockomax BACC Solid Fuel Boosters to these decouplers.

During the ascent the engines will generate energy, but after orbit insertion it will have to work on its own energy reserves. By itself it can store 5 units of energy which keeps it operational for just over 2 minutes. Afterwards it just becomes debris. The Z-500 adds another 500 units of energy which is enough to keep it operational for several orbits. Using the Z-100 battery packs would be more mass-effective, but unfortunately they aren\u0027t as elegant to integrate into a rocket design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you want your satellite to look more like the real Sputnik, you could also add four radially-mounted Communotron 16 antennas to the round part of the Stayputnik so that they face backwards in a 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 angle. But keep in mind that they don\u0027t do anything but making the mission more difficult by adding additional mass and drag to your rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that the aerodynamic nose cones are technically just for show, because the current[outdated] version of KSP doesn\u0027t model atmospheric drag correctly. Any part you add to your rocket will make the drag worse, there is no way to reduce drag by adding more parts. Feel free to omit them when you don\u0027t care about aesthetics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVostok I\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPayload stage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1x Mk16 Parachute\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1x Command Pod Mk1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird stage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1x TR-18A Stack Decoupler\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1x FL-T400 Fuel Tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1x LV-909 Liquid Fuel Engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond stage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1x TR-18A Stack Decoupler\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1x FL-R25 RCS Fuel Tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4x RV-105 RCS Thruster Block\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1x FL-T800 Fuel Tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1x LV-T30 Liquid Fuel Engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst stage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4x TT-38K Radial Decoupler\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4x FL-T400 Fuel Tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4x Aerodynamic Nose Cone\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4x LV-T30 Liquid Fuel Engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that the monopropellant thrusters and their fuel are still on the second stage.

One reason is that the Jumbo tanks for some reason cause the rocket to be a lot less stable, so we would needs struts for stabilization. But there is also another strange effect: The Mainsail engine will overheat when running on full thrust and placed below a Jumbo tank, but when below two functionally identical X200-32 tanks it will not.

There are three to four flights of the Progress spacecraft to the ISS per year. Each spacecraft remains docked until shortly before the new one, or a Soyuz (which uses the same docking ports) arrives. Then it is filled with waste, disconnected, deorbited, and destroyed in the atmosphere.

Salyut 2 failed shortly after achieving orbit, but Salyut 3 and Salyut 5 both conducted successful manned testing.

The very first long-duration crew on Salyut 6 broke a record set on board Skylab, staying 96 days in orbit. The short-term crews included foreign cosmonauts from the Interkosmos programme setting several firsts: the first citizen in space of a nation other than the United States or the Soviet Union, the first black and Hispanic person in space and the first Asian person in space.

Some unconfirmed reports say the station was functionally capable of even more missions and years, but combating the ever-increasing mold in living quarters was becoming impossible, and in practice caused the retirement decision.

DOS-6 was built as the back-up vehicle for Salyut 6 with very similar equipment and capabilities, though several more advanced features were included. The station was aloft for eight years and ten months, during which time it was visited by 10 manned spacecraft bringing six long-duration crews (\u0022expeditions\u0022) and 4 short-term crews (including French and Indian cosmonauts in the Interkosmos programme). On 12 February 1985, during an unmanned period, contact with Salyut 7 was lost. The station had became crippled by electrical problems, all systems did shut down and the station began to drift. It was decided to put together a salvage mission, and in June 1985 the Soyuz T-13 mission, in what was in the words of author David S. F. Portree \u0022one of the most impressive feats of in-space repairs in history,\u0022 managed to bring the station online again.

For this, the DOS modules were to be equipped with a total of four docking ports: one docking port at the aft of the station as in the second generation Salyuts, and the replacement of the front docking port with a \u0022docking sphere\u0022 containing a front, port and starboard docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the station cores DOS-7 and DOS-8 were built and flown, they never received the Salyut designation; Instead, DOS-7 evolved into the Mir Core Module for the Mir space station that followed the Salyut programme, and DOS-8 was used as the Zvezda Service Module for the International Space Station (ISS) which followed Mir.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the heritage from the Almaz program is present even today.

This dissolution had started with the Soviet \u0022perestroika and glasnost\u0022 (\u0022restructuring and openness\u0022) reform campaigns by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in the 1980s, had reached an preliminary endpoint with the revolutions of 1989 and the end of the communist Eastern Bloc (Warsaw Pact and the CoMEcon), finally to reach the Soviet Union itself in 1991.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the Russian Federation became the successor to much of the dissolved Soviet Union and was in a position to continue the Soviet space program with the Russian Federal Space Agency, it faced severe difficulties: imports and exports had steeply declined as the economic exchange with CoMEcon nations had crumbled away, leaving the industry of the former Soviet Union in shambles. Not only did the political change in east-Europe signify an end of contributions to the space program by east-European nations (like from the east-German Carl Zeiss Jena), but parts of the Soviet space industry were located in the newly independent Ukraine, which was similarly cash-strapped as Russia and started to demand hard currency for its contributions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was during this time of transition and upheaval that the Shuttle\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Mir Program was established between the Russian Federation and the United States in 1993.

I can\u0027t find the original orbital information The module was placed on a Low Earth Orbit, which usually corresponds to 160 to 2000 km. The current ISS orbit is 402 km PE \u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D 424 km AP with a 51.6\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 orbital inclination. So, if you want to make it good, launch as usual, with a gravity turn starting at 10 km. Turn towards 38.4 degrees (the 51.6 inclination). Continue until you reach 424 km apoapsis, then burn there to get 402 km periapsis. I\u0027ll have to test myself if it\u0027s possible with the current Proton-K design It is possible to achieve this orbit with precise flying or an autopilot. It leaves 60% of 3rd-stage fuel and a full on-station tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you have the stable orbit, open the solar panels and the antennas. Move the station to orient it the good way (the one radial docking port facing the Earth; the HubMax towards your prograde vector).

If you have an auto-pilot, use the \u0022Launch to rendezvous\u0022 function. If not, try to send it with Zarya at a 45 degree LPA.
