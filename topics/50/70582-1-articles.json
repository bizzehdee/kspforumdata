But you can actually get intercepts whenever you like quite efficiently with just a bit of patience - actually, the amount of patience you need is proportional to the amount of efficiency you want - using the technique I demonstrate in this video (and other similar techniques).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/mnPSNH8zlmw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://youtu.be/mnPSNH8zlmw\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
