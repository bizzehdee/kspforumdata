I did it, and my justification for it is that by default a Kerbal consumes 16.2 kg of supplies per day, whereas a human consumes about 3 kg of food and water per day.\u00A0That\u00A0seems a bit excessive. I know that they include water for bathing, and other things, but I think they would\u00A0be\u00A0able to clean\u00A0the water and re-purpose it if they were sending Kerbals into space. This can be done by going into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Life Support Settings.cfg and changing\u00A0\u00A0SupplyAmount (and WasteAmount respectively). I changed it to 0.0025, but it\u0027s up to you. Also, if you are using UKS then you need to do this\u00A0in\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS.cfg. On that note:\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EUse UKS.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0Believe me, this is a game changer. Using UKS, you have access to inflatable modules, which means you don\u0027t have to launch all these crazy shaped structures and land\u00A0them, just to have a semi good looking base.\u00A0Other than that, it will give so many more features to your base, allowing you to eventually turn it into a whole colony.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPlan ahead.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0This is a big one, and it\u0027s straightforward. This can vary from an intricate spreadsheet, to just making sure in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E that you\u0027re sending enough supplies. On top of Supplies, make sure that you\u0027re vessels can do everything that you need them to do.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMultiple launches.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0This may be annoying, but sometimes it\u0027s the only way to go. My mission had 4 vehicles that landed on the surface before the crew even got into space: A habitation module, A greenhouse/storage module, a huge lander with a crap ton of supplies, and an ore processor to make fuel.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMake it pretty.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0This is not necessary, but it will make your base more awesome.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you do these things than you might have something like (or probably better) than this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot92.png?raw=true\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022https://github.com/WillThe84th/KSP-PICS/blob/master/screenshot92.png?raw=true\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
