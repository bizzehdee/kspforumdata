Want to know how to get your multi-satellite array into a perfect spacing pattern in that orbit without having to hand-calculate everything? Then I have the tool for you! It\u0027s a simple JavaScript application that should work in most web browsers, and it lets you calculate literally any resonance you could possibly desire with a planet. Geosynchronous? No problem! Half-synchronous? Easy! 15:3 resonance? Crazy, but 100% doable! And it\u0027ll even tell you how to space your multi-satellite array when launching it into orbit so they\u0027ll all align equidistant from one another when you finish up putting them in place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.skyrender.net/ksp_sync_calculator.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EYou can find it here!\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Want to see more functionality for this calculation tool?
