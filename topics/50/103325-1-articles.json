Okay so first get a design in your head. You might want to use a probe body with a xeon container thing with a ion rocket ( Those little ion things ) as the actual body of the satellite. You then to, of course, put some solar panels, any choice you but the gigantic ones. Add some Z-100 rechargeable batteries about for four solar panels, and a communitron 88-88 for that like one of those dish thing on top of a house. Then you need a booster stage. Basically anything that can get you into orbit. Make Sure you get a decoupler too! If you don\u0027t you\u0027ll have a big stage on the bottom of the satellite. Thats basically it. If you\u0027re ready to do better, build a Mk3 space plane with cargo bay doors then build a satellite attached to that, decouple that from the plane when in orbit and land back. Feel free to add more tips for any starters."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T01:44:24Z","Content":"Illustrating your suggestions would help make your points. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Djslime6764","CreatedById":140412,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T01:45:13Z","Content":"Hey, im kinda new to da forum and screenshots ( yes , i know how to take them."}]}
