(Easy Picture Explanation)","CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T02:38:24Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T02:38:24Z","Content":"Why Does My FLIPing Rocket Always Flip Over! \n\nAKA: Forces at Work During Launch and Ascent and How to Deal with Them.\n\n**Part 1:**\n\n*A Stable Rocket*\n\nFirst let\u0027s take a look at a stable multi-stage rocket, like the one in this picture:\n\n![nVhigJf.png](http://i.imgur.com/nVhigJf.png)\n\nNotice that the Center of Mass is closer to the bottom than the top; that\u0027s normal. Also, notice that the fins are below the center of mass which helps with stability.\n\nTake a look at what happens when the rocket is moving through the air:\n\n![PZXzUIz.png](http://i.imgur.com/PZXzUIz.png)\n\nAs you can see, the air is coming straight on. Air flow induces some drag at the nose, and some drag on the fins. Now, what happens when you try to tip this rocket over? Take a look:\n\n![Qt336Pd.png](http://i.imgur.com/Qt336Pd.png)\n\nAs the rocket tries to rotate around its center of mass the fins expose more surface area to the air-flow. This increases the drag on the fins, which is stronger than the drag on the nose. The result is the tail-drag pulls the tail back in line. The rocket is stable and will point its nose into the wind.\n\n**Part 2:**\n\n*An Unstable Rocket*\n\nNow, consider the following rocket:\n\n![Uaf4EPI.png](http://i.imgur.com/Uaf4EPI.png)\n\nNotice that the drag is mostly on the nose. So long as the air-flow is in line with the center of mass, this isn\u0027t an issue. However, if you tip the rocket over, even just a little you end up in this situation:\n\n![yMWuP7p.png](http://i.imgur.com/yMWuP7p.png)\n\nThere is more drag on top of the center of mass than below it! Tip over far enough and the torque from this nose-heavy drag flips your rocket around the center of mass because the drag near the nose has more leverage than the drag near the tail. You lose control, pull out your hair, and swear that KSP is the worst game ever!\n\nBut it\u0027s really just natural, real-world forces at work.\n\n**Part 3:**\n\n*Coping With These Forces*\n\nThe best solution is to mount tail-fins on your rocket so the drag near the bottom is greater than the drag near the nose. Remember, as the rocket tries to turn sideways, the tail-fins actually end up producing more drag because of the exposed surface area. One issue with this is it\u0027s harder to steer your rocket where you want it to go, until you get fins with control surfaces built in.\n\nThe other solution is to make sure that your nose is pointed mostly into the wind at all times. Any little bit of tilt induces a little nose-heavy drag; without any control input the rocket wants to flip. But the torque from the nose-heavy drag is small enough for the engine gimbal and/or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to overcome so long as you don\u0027t tip too far, e.g. less than 5-degrees from your flight path.\n\n**Part 4:**\n\n*Speed Kills!*\n\nOne really important consideration for dealing with air-flow is, the faster you go, the more air-flow -\u003E the more drag -\u003E and the more torque trying to affect your rocket!\n\nIf you use tail-fins this is helpful, to a point, but it does make it harder to steer the rocket for an efficient ascent profile. Without tail-fins the rocket becomes more unstable the faster it goes as the torque on the nose from any minor level of tipping increases. Once you\u0027re clear of the atmosphere, or at least high enough where it doesn\u0027t have much impact (about 35km) you won\u0027t have to worry about it.\n\nUntil you reach 35km, though, it\u0027s best to keep your rocket at reasonable speeds. Remember speed = air-flow = drag = torque. Result: Less Speed; Less Torque. I recommend you keep your rocket below 500m/s until you reach 35km. I usually fly mine at about 450m/s or so.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nAdemdum\n\n**Part 5:**\n\n*Shifting Center of Mass*\n\nAs your rocket ascends it expends propellant. Since propellant is used from the top of the rocket first, the center of mass will gradually shift downwards, closer to the tail. This means that any torque on the nose from induced drag will have more leverage as the rocket ascends. This explains why, sometimes, the rocket seems to be under control one moment and more flippy the next, even though your deflection from the air-flow remains the same (say, between 5 and 10 degrees). Add the shifting center of mass to increasing speeds, and you have a rocket that is becoming more and more touchy by the moment.\n\nHope this tutorial helps!

Here, have some rep.\n\nI have only one minor observation. I\u0027m not sure about this (somebody correct me if I\u0027m wrong), but I think it\u0027s technically the increased *lift* from the fins (due to the higher angle of attack) what\u0027s providing the restoring torque, not the drag. Lift initially [increases faster than drag](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Lift_drag_graph.JPG) as the angle of attack increases from zero. The effect also comes from the *other* set of fins (not shown) which are mounted at 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 from the ones you show, but I agree they are harder to depict clearly.\n\nStill, the general conclusion is correct: adding aerodynamic surfaces to the tail makes the rocket more stable.

It\u0027s called the [**Pendulum Rocket Fallacy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum_rocket_fallacy). It\u0027s so natural that even Robert Goddard, one of the fathers of rocketry, initially worked under this assumption and actually built his first prototypes with the propellant tank -the heaviest part of his rocket- on the bottom.\n\nA simple explanation is to realize that a pendulum is stable with its heavy end at the bottom because it is fixed at the top. A rocket is not, its top is free to move however it likes. Rockets have no inherent stability, which is why you need to add some means for stability control: aerodynamic surfaces for the lower parts of the ascent or, more commonly irl, thrust vectoring on the engines."},{"CreatedByName":"Cirrus","CreatedById":145623,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T22:16:34Z","Content":"Thank you for taking the time to make this guide.

Lowering your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is another alternative that might help.

Gravity *doesn\u0027t matter in any way* to stability once the ship is off the launch pad.  What does matter is thrust vector, lift and drag and their balance relative to the center of mass.  If you\u0027re even a fraction of a degree off prograde (so the airflow is coming from a tiny angle off the body\u0027s longitudinal axis), the nose will produce lift and drag that tend to upset the rocket -- and unless there\u0027s a restoring force, either from greater fin lift (after accounting for lever arm from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E) or from another source of torque (vectored thrust, reaction wheels, or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E), your rocket will tumble.  If the stack flexes enough to see, this will be much worse, because it will also oscillate and may resonate with the speed at which the motors can gimbal, which can even cause a rocket to break up in flight.\n\nIf you\u0027ve flown model rockets and paid attention to their stability requirements, this won\u0027t be a mystery to you.  Those are virtually all stabilized by lifting fins, though a few are stabilized by drag from a conical shroud or even just by having the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E far enough forward that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E of the body is behind it (for a plain cylinder, it\u0027s generally about 1/3 back from the nose, until angle of attack exceeds roughly 30 degrees, then it\u0027s about halfway).  In KSP, we also have gimballed engines (i.e. vectored thrust), as well as reaction wheels and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, so we can make rockets that are stable in flight (at least during boost phase, for gimballing) without fins.  NASA doesn\u0027t use fins, nor does Space-X, because they add mass and drag, hence costing fuel, but their stability control is a bit better than ours.  They manage to do everything with gimballing during boost, but in KSP many rockets seem to require \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E to keep them headed the right direction."}]}
