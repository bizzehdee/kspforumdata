It was done in two parts. These experiments were done manually and without the help of MechJeb, so values aren\u0027t perfect but clear enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, I made a circular orbit at 180km around Kerbin. From any point in this orbit, it took appx 790m/s of delta-V to reach the elevation of the Mun. I then shrunk the orbit to an elliptical with the apoapsis at 180km and the periapsis at 70km--this burn cost appx 82m/s. In this new orbit, burning prograde at the periapsis to reach Mun elevation required appx 778m/s of delta-V, while burning from the apoapsis now cost 870m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, I made a circular orbit at 10Mkm. To reach Minmus elevation from here, it cost 159m/s of delta-V. Shrinking my orbit again to an elliptical with the periapsis at 70km required 377m/s. From the new periapsis, burning to Minmus took 74m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat we see is: the Oberth effect is NOT effective enough to warrant shrinking an orbit.

However, the results were similar. In a circular 10Mkm orbit, escape was reached with 191.6m/s of delta-V. After shrinking the periapsis to 70km (as above--377m/s), the escape delta-V rung in at 84.4m/s, in total over \u003Cem\u003Etwice\u003C/em\u003E the fuel cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, it seems the Oberth effect is only useful if you don\u0027t have to change your orbit to make use of it.

Though, it\u0027s worth noting that the Oberth Effect is always present. It\u0027s just a matter of whether you can maximize its benefit or not, based on what velocity you currently have when you do your burn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yes, usually you won\u0027t want to burn opposite to what your end-goal is (such as shrinking your periapsis, only to transfer to a higher orbit), simply because you are countering some of your existing velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a maneuver that\u0027s similar to this though, which is called a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi-elliptic_transfer\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBi-elliptic transfer\u003C/a\u003E.

As Necrobones mentioned, that would be burning away speed that you\u0027ll have to add later. What you can do is burn to change the eccentricity of your orbit (i.e. a burn with a large radial component). This will drop your periapsis without changing your current speed; that way the dV you spend for this first orbital change doesn\u0027t work against you when you go to burn prograde at periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA while back there was a discussion about the efficiency of a two-burn strategy for leaving Kerbins SOI from a circular orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuch a \u0022first burn retrograde, then burn prograde at Periapsis\u0022 approach can be more efficient than a single burn method.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave a look at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/75542-Should-I-build-a-refueling-station-at-the-edge-of-Kerbins-SOI?p=1074426\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1074426\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis chart\u003C/a\u003E and the discussion for details.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDecreasing Periapsis by a radial burn is an interesting idea ... never thought about that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever I believe that setting up this burn in a way that the Apoapsis points in the right direction is a difficult task - counterexamples welcome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-07T03:33:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think one of the best explanations/demonstrations I\u0027ve seen for the Oberth effect involved fixed \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv burns at different altitude periapsides above an object on a hyperbolic orbit.
