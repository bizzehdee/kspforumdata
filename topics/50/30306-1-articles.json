Not even your patented method of MOAR BOOSTERS solves this issue. Time to call in the big boys. 12 Nuclears produce 600 units of thrust. Said engines with Aerospikes tacked on produce 2100 units of thrust. That works out to be a whole mainsail more in lifting power!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, down to business. Take your 1.25m (or 2.5m if you want multiple engines (use radial attachment points or cubic struts (I like the former (This is too many brackets)))) fuel tank, then add on your nuclear engine. Next, add on a TR18-A Stack Decoupler on the end (The one with the yellow stripes) and then an Aerospike. Finally, take a fuel line and carefully lead it from the tank to the aerospike\u0027s sticky-out-bit. It should attach like usual. And you\u0027re done! This also works for other 1.25m engines to replace the nuke, although I don\u0027t believe any engine but the Aerospike has the required sticky-out-bits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/L2ZdNDV\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/L2ZdNDV.png\u0022 alt=\u0022L2ZdNDV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow: Short profile Nuclear engines (Disclaimer: Not my idea): Useful for landers or just good looks. Requires no debug menu, either. Take the X-16 tank or the FL-T400 tank and just place it on top of the tank, then use W or S twice to flip it over so it will hopefully stick out the bottom. If you want multiple engines, use the X-16 tank and mount the engines on radial attachment points, before repeating the process with symmetry on.
