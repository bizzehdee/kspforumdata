This is the Kestrel. Here I have retrofitted it with Juno engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022814yQhL.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/814yQhL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere you can see that it is flying pretty well, for a propellor aircraft I just retrofitted with Junos. If your propellor aircraft flies horribly, replace the propellors with engines and see if it still flies horribly. It may be a problem with your aircraft, not your propellors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is the Kestrel with propellor engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022M9dbFb8.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/M9dbFb8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is how I have set up my craft. The two engines rotate in opposite directions, which cancels the torque. (You can also mount it on a freewheeling servo, like Brikoleur did.) You do this by right-clicking one and clicking the button labelled Rotation Direction. The propellors have been set up so that they are deployed - this means if I change the authority limiter I change the angle they are at. However, they are still at the default position (producing no lift) as the limiter is set to zero. The engines are bound to the throttle and the propellor deployment is bound to [K] and [I ]\u003Cem\u003E. \u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is the first problem you may encounter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022AOG4tVN.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/AOG4tVN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne set of blades is deploying in the wrong direction. This is a simple fix, you just change either Deploy Direction to inverted, or you invert the controls in axis groups:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022DbUK6CE.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/DbUK6CE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother problem you could encounter is engine torque, which makes one wing hit the ground. Either you re-design your plane to limit the effects (moving gear further out etc.), or you can counter the torque. You could mount the engine on a freewheeling servo like in Brikoleur\u0027s guide to helicopters, or you can go the MOAR POWER route and add a counter-rotating engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you find yourself running out of power, you can add fuel cells, RTGs or solar panels. Panels are very good as unless you fly really, really far from Kerbol you will produce way more power than the motors need. This craft draws about 6EC/s and the panels output 30EC/s. If you want to fly at night, fuel cells are very powerful but they do have the downside that you have to refuel eventually. RTGs produce power indefinitely but are very heavy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor info on flying your propellor aircraft check out my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/186596-173-stockdlc-flying-propellor-aircraft-etc/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Eother tutorial\u003C/a\u003E!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-07-29T11:35:31Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2019 11:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by fulgur\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
