At the time there was nothing wrong with this.\n\nNow all the upper stage engines have their own distinct advantages and as you play the campaign you will notice that even though the Terrier is less efficient than the Poodle, that in some cases using the poodle might be wasteful, or using the terrier engine might be wasteful.\n\nSo this tutorial will be basically a list compiled from \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv -\u003E calculations involving a theoretical rocket made of one 2 meter tank with a 2 meter command pod on top of it I hope to show the actual efficiency of each engine by compiling this data on efficiency.\n\n**48-7S \u0022Spark\u0022 Liquid Fuel Engine**\n\nThis engine, has a low vacuum Isp because of it\u0027s small size, as such it has it\u0027s limits in efficiency but it has it\u0027s uses.\n\nwith a Rockomax X200-8 fuel tank and the Spark the \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv -\u003E for our simple rocket with a total mass of 8.7 tons (full) would be 1811.56 m/s\n\nwith a X200-16 it does even better with more fuel and a better ratio between dry mass and fuel, now it has a higher \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv -\u003E of 2740.64 m/s\n\nNow lets compare it with the **LV-909 \u0022Terrier\u0022**\n\nwith the X200-16 the Terrier performs much better than the spark. for an increase in total mass of just 0.4 t we get 3002 m/s of \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv -\u003E\n\nbut with the smaller fuel tank the Terrier gives us less for our money with the X200-8 tank the \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv-\u003E is only 1959 m/s\n\nso with the larger tank the Terrier gave us \u002B 262 m/s of \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv-\u003E while with the smaller rocket the Terrier only gave us 148 m/s extra.\n\nThe **Rockomax \u0022Poodle\u0022** engine is even less forgiving because of it\u0027s increased mass, with the X200-8 tank (the smallest 2 meter tank) the Poodle only gives 1666 m/s ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) so if you decided to go for the poodle\u0027s extra 5 seconds of Isp with a smallish upper stage you actually lost - 293 m/s of ability to go places (maybe more or less depending on payload)\n\nthe Rockomax is also pretty much just more pounds on the larger rocket with the X200-16 tank since it only gives 2642m/s of \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv-\u003E which is - 360m/s less than the \u0022Terrier\u0022 and 98m/s less than the \u0022Spark\u0022.\n\nand which one is cheapest? the spark. the terrier is only 120 bucks extra though so with a small rocket the terrier is probably your choice for shifting medium payloads and even really small rockets benefit from the terrier. \n\nNote: It\u0027s only with very small payloads that the Spark really excels on all fronts (things less than 3 tons or so) and at that point the \u0022Ant\u0022 engine is probably more efficient with 315 secs of Isp. the Spark is really a landing engine for small landers on atmosphere-less bodies. Good places to use the Spark for landing (on a probe for instance) have low gravity like the Mun but not so little as to make the high thrust redundant like on Gilly, Pol or Bop\n\nThe Moral of the Story is; do your Delta V calculations, the game gives you all the information you need to make the right engine choice for each part of the mission. You don\u0027t have to be exacting about it but in deep space, with no reason for great amounts of thrust, I would suggest going to this website [http://www.strout.net/info/science/delta-v/](http://www.strout.net/info/science/delta-v/) and at least make sure that you are making the most economically sensible decision with your rocket.\n\nHere are some rules of thumb:\n\n-In order for an LV-N \u0022Nerv\u0022 rocket to make any sense you need something the size of a big orange tank. \n\n-A poodle is rarely more efficient (need a very big tanker) than the slightly less efficient-on-paper Terrier, and the only reason to really use it for anything is as a landing stage for big heavy landers, and as a final stage on smaller rockets where the thrust is still necessary to get to orbit.\n\n-your rocket must be positively tiny for the Spark to be more efficient than a Terrier\n\nI hope this tutorial helps someone, just sitting down to write it was enlightening for me though\n\nGood Luck, and Fly efficiently!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T17:38:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 05:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Halsfury**"}]}
