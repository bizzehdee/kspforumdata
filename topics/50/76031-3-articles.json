Not all Linux users are jerks. If I had to guess, you\u0027re either having issues with shrinking a partition to make one for Linux or Grub is giving you issues after you\u0027ve done everything else (9 times out of 10, Grub is where I get Linux install issues...like 3 days ago\u003Cstrong\u003E*\u003C/strong\u003E). My recommendation is to use Linux Mint 17 XFCE (what I\u0027m currently using to play KSP) because it\u0027s easy to install and setup as well as being supported until 2019. The Mint/Ubuntu is also good at helping new Linux users out, which is a good benefit to someone like yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe dude who suggested the new HDD wasn\u0027t technically wrong. My HDD setup is like this -- 320GB Linux hdd with 2 GB /boot partition, 8GB swap partition (equal to my ram...I\u0027m old school here), and the rest to my root partition ( / ). No home or any other crap (my old /home is my next HDD).Next HDD is 320GB all for Windows 8.1 and its boot partition. Last HDD is a 2TB drive with 2 partitions, 1.5TB ZFS volume with all my backups for Linux and a 500GB partition for backing up Steam games, all my isos \u002B roms, and for transfering things from Linux to Windows (Windows can\u0027t read Linux partitions while Linux can read/write Windows partitions). While it is a bit silly to buy a HDD just for one game, a HDD for another OS, a game, and all you\u0027ll learn from Linux is really worth that cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just realized something -- If you\u0027re trying to install any Linux on that HDD with OSX, remember that OSX uses GPT instead of MBR, and with GPT, you also need a \u0022bios boot\u0022 partition (2MB iirc) for Linux to even boot up. The MBR to GPT transition, which has been going on for the past few years, is the source of many headaches in the Linux install world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and whoever suggested that you only need 10GB was full of it. Mint 17 XFCE (which is the 2nd lightest one) clocks in at 18 GB with nothing but the boot partition, base system, Steam, KSP, and proprietary graphics drivers plus the dependencies needed to compile them (18 GB is my total installed size under my root drive, 16GB, \u002B the 2GB of my boot partition)...that doesn\u0027t even include a swap partition which should be 4GB minimum. I recommend this setup for partitions for you -- shrink 30 or 40GB away from Hackintosh, make 2mb for bios boot, 1GB for /boot, 4GB for swap, and whatever is left for root ( / ). And ensure that Grub is pointed to that disk (the menu below the installer\u0027s partition table). If possible, put the swap at the front of the HDD -- that is a bit dangerous and is best done if you have a dedicated power supply...like running your PC from a generator...seriously...it takes a while and if you lose power, you lose the data on the disk. Shrinking/Growing a partition doesn\u0027t take much time at all so you\u0027ll be safe doing that from the wall plug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, if you want to try it again, start up a new thread here, PM me that you have (because I likely won\u0027t see it otherwise), and myself (and possibly others) will be glad to help. And again, I recommend Mint 17 XFCE...the installer is literally clicking next a bunch, filling out a form for user name, password, etc, and setting up partitions. It really doesn\u0027t get any easier than Ubuntu/Mint installs, but I can help with Debian, Arch, Manjaro, Funtoo, Ubuntu, \u0026amp; various Crunchbangs. I prefer Debian and its derivatives like Mint and Ubuntu (apt package management is the shizzle). I have 12 years of Linux experience, 8 of those have been running pure Debian and the rest a mix of everything else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E*\u003C/strong\u003EI installed Mint 17 just fine, rebooted, and it booted into a Grub error (that didn\u0027t have an error message...just Grub failed...). So I go WTF, boot the live disk back up, and sure enough everything is located where it should have been. So I rebooted and nothing but the grub warning it gave before. I finally realized that the Mint installer embedded itself into the wrong HDD\u0027s mbr (master boot record). So I hit F11 (my BIOS boot selection menu), changed to my 3rd disk (2nd is exclusively Windows), and it booted right up. Rebooted, went to the BIOS, physically set my 3rd disk as the first HDD to boot up, and all is well. I get a Grub menu and from there I can boot up Mint (with various options) or boot up Windows.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-29T15:25:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022skeevy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022skeevy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1)\u003C/strong\u003E If you want to give a go at a Linux install again, plenty of us here, like myself, would be glad to help.

And yeah, Linux is the real fix for KSP. Linux doesn\u0027t suck, but lack of knowledge and experience can make one think it does....well, the graphics drivers do suck when compared to the Windows equivalent. Have you heard that AMD\u0027s gonna open source their Linux drivers? It\u0027ll be interesting if/when they do (especially since I have an AMD/MSI R7 260x).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlackware....you would say one of the very few distros that I\u0027ve never installed.

It is the oldest running distro after all, but I always find myself going back to Debian regardless of what I install....probably gonna wipe Mint and go back to Debian Testing or Siduction just so I can start with minimal and end up with only LXQT as my DE (as well as go back to a ZFS root).
