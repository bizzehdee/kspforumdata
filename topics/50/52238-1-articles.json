I have been trying to do gravity assists with well varied results and some how its pretty obvious when you show it, after all I use the same basic techniques to get to Duna and Laythe and back with my spaceplanes but actually understanding how to exploit it to its maximum still eluded me a bit. This helped a lot in explaining how to think about gravity assist and how to plan for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I would love to know what mod that was to change the Conics mode.

But I haven\u0027t had much success getting the timing right.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T16:44:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESetting up a mission where you start from object 1, get a gravity assist from object 2, and immediately intercept object 3 at your new apoapsis is entirely dependent on having the planets align properly, there\u0027s nothing you can do to change that. So you\u0027ve got two options, either...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Use a launch window planner tool to figure out what date you would need to launch in order to get a perfect assist to intercept, assuming you also do all your burns perfectly, or\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Just get your gravity assist to raise your apoapsis to the altitude of object 3, and then simply loop around in elliptical solar orbit until you have a close approach at apoapsis, then make small correction burns to get your intercept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E99% of the time I go with option 2.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
