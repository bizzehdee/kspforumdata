In this guide, we will be covering things like calculating the full Delta-V of your ship, explaining how to perform transfer maneuvers, getting Thrust to Weight Ratio, calculating the Peak G-force experienced during a particular burn, also calculating Delta-V needed for a full-Hohmann transfer and much more.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDelta-V (change in velocity) is the bread and butter of rocket science.\u003C/strong\u003E It is probably the most important thing to know about your rocket because it determines what your rocket is capable of achieving. Among the several things we will explain in this basic tutorial, Delta-V is most likely the most useful thing you will apply to Kerbal Space Program while building a rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo find the Delta-V of your rocket -- each stage at a time -- we have to sum up the part masses of every single part of the stage. When summing up fuel tank masses, it may be easier to write them like this on your paper:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFull Mass: x\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDry Mass: x\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason for this is that it will be easier to calculate Full Mass and empty mass. So, simply sum up your entire stage mass. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next important part of this set of calculations is to find your engine\u00C3\u00AF\u00C2\u00BF\u00C2\u00BDs \u00C3\u00AF\u00C2\u00BF\u00C2\u00BDSpecific Impulse\u00C3\u00AF\u00C2\u00BF\u00C2\u00BD. Specific Impulse is a measure of how fuel efficient an engine is (the greater the Specific Impulse, the more fuel efficient it is). In the case of the non-vectoring stock engine has an vacuum specific impulse of 370. So here, we must apply the Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation. More informally known as \u00C3\u00AF\u00C2\u00BF\u00C2\u00BDThe Rocket Equation\u00C3\u00AF\u00C2\u00BF\u00C2\u00BD. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt states: Delta-V = Isp*9.81*ln(m1/m2).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Em1 = total mass of the stage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Em2 = dry mass of the stage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo go ahead and sum up your stage\u00C3\u00AF\u00C2\u00BF\u00C2\u00BDs full mass with fuel. Then, go ahead and sum up the mass MINUS the fuel mass. Input these into the equation in the place of m1 \u0026amp; m2. So, we will show a quick example, here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img502.imageshack.us/img502/490/screenshot7ex.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot7ex.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage 3 (TMI, Mun lander, Return):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFull mass: 3.72\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDry mass: 1.72\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIsp: 400 s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelta-V: 3027.0 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage 2 (Kerbin orbit insertion)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFull mass: 7.27\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDry mass: 5.27\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIsp: 370 s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelta-V: 1167.8 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage 1 (Ascent):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFull mass: 38.52\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDry mass: 14.52\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIsp: 350 s (estimated due to atmospheric flight)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelta-V: 3349.9 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal Delta-V: 7544.6 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo calculate the Isp for multiple engines with different Isp values, you need to take the weighted average of the specific impulses relative to thrust. The equation looks like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Isp_1*thrust_1 \u002B Isp_2*thrust_2 ...)/(thrust_1 \u002B thrust_2 ...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will give you the correct Isp to use for your delta-V calculation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe next very basic part of this tutorial is how to perform a transfer maneuver itself.\u003C/strong\u003E This kind of action is called a \u00C3\u00AF\u00C2\u00BF\u00C2\u00BDHohmann Transfer\u00C3\u00AF\u00C2\u00BF\u00C2\u00BD and it requires two burns at opposite points in an orbit. Adding velocity will boost our apoapsis higher. We would then simply wait until we hit our newly established Apoapsis and then add more velocity to boost our Periapsis to circularize. Or, we could drop our orbit by subtracting velocity by burning \u00C3\u00AF\u00C2\u00BF\u00C2\u00BDretro-grade\u00C3\u00AF\u00C2\u00BF\u00C2\u00BD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe can also apply some Delta-V calculations to find out how much thrust we will need to perform this maneuver. We will break this burn up into impulses. For example purposes, we will start at a 100KM orbit and then boost into a 200KM orbit. Both circularized. The formula for the first burn is the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/math/e/9/2/e92122ee1e648aa7cfc689d7d1f65844.png\u0022 alt=\u0022e92122ee1e648aa7cfc689d7d1f65844.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the formula for the final burn in the transfer:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/math/5/4/6/54622804d7426a2bed1a1f425de5bb04.png\u0022 alt=\u002254622804d7426a2bed1a1f425de5bb04.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eu= Gravitational Parameter of Parent Body. (3530.461 km^3/s^2 for Kerbin).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Er_1= The Radius of our first orbit. (100 km in this case).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Er_2 = The Radius of our second orbit. (200 km in this case).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis formula will give us our velocity for the burn in km/s (multiply by 1000 to convert it into m/s). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u00C3\u00AF\u00C2\u00BF\u00C2\u00BDs important to make sure that you will have the Delta-V in the stage to make this burn. Again, you can do that by using the Delta-V calculations on pages 1 \u0026amp; 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENext, we will explain how to calculate fuel flow in mass\u003C/strong\u003E to see how much fuel a burn uses up in a specific amount of time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we know the delta-V needed for the burn and the total mass of the rocket before the burn, we can calculate how much fuel is required to complete the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, we calculate the mass of the rocket after the burn is complete. To do this, we use the (russian guy) equation, inputting the initial mass and delta-v of the burn. We can then solve the equation for the final mass after the burn. The difference between these two masses will be used to determine the length of time that is needed to complete the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe equation for mass flow rate of fuel, given Isp and thrust, is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Em_dot = thrust/Isp\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhere m_dot is the mass flow rate of fuel consumed (in seconds)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDividing the difference between initial mass and final mass for the burn by the mass flow rate of fuel, we arrive at how many seconds are required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mass flow rate of fuel can be converted into the consumption rate of the fuel units used in KSP (Liters, I presume). The conversion ratio is 1 mass unit per 200L of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERather easy is the formula to calculate the orbital velocity of an orbit.\u003C/strong\u003E This assumes circular orbit or the velocity of a specific point in an orbit. For this, we simply do this calculation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esqrt(u/r).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eu = Gravitational Parameter of parent body. (km^3/s^2)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Er = radius of orbit. (km)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we input the radius of the orbit in Kilometers, our orbital velocity will come out in Kilometers per second. In a 100km orbit, our radius will be 700km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeaning our velocity will be ~2.24578 kilometers per second (km/s), or 2245.8 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA delta-v map consists of approximate amounts of delta-v\u003C/strong\u003E needed to get from one place (whether it be on the ground or in space) to another. The detla-v values we have for our delta-v map are approximate and include a fudge factor (in case we slip up on our piloting). Our map is as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch to 100km Kerbin orbit: 4700 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrans-Munar Injection: 900 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding on the Mun: 1000 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch from Mun and return to Kerbin: 1000 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal delta-v: 7600 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we design our rockets to have 7600 total delta-v, and the acceleration of the launch stages are adequate, we can have confidence that our rocket is able to land on the Mun and return to Kerbin. A rocket with a little less delta-v can accomplish this goal, but it is less forgiving of less efficient piloting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECalculating Thrust to Weight Ratio is only three very simple steps. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is important to know the thrust to weight ratio of your rocket to ensure your rocket will actually liftoff. If your TWR is less than 1, you can bet that you won\u00C3\u00AF\u00C2\u00BF\u00C2\u00BDt make an inch in altitude when starting from the launch pad. The minimum optimal TWR to have for your rocket at launch is 2.2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe formula for this is simply the thrust of all of your current stage engines engines divided by the weight (mass * 9.81 m/s^2) of your stage, fully fueled. At the same time, this will give you the minimum G-force you can expect on the current stage. Your peak G-force will occur instantly before fuel depletion. The way to calculate this is to simply divide thrust by the dry mass of your stage\u002Bthe fully fueled stages above it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EIn conclusion: This guide will hopefully have helped with designing your rockets to allow you to get the job done -- whatever it may be -- with no test flights first.
