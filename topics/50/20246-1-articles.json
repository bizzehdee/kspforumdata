This is intended as a primer for smart rocket design. If you already have something reasonably sized and Duna-capable, but just have issues with actually intercepting it, skip ahead.

They are heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s go over those in order and see how they apply to rocket design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(1) Thrust is more important than fuel capacity on Kerbin takeoff\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is probably a rehash for just about everyone, but...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGravity stinks. It constantly pulls you down, robbing you of your upwards speed. If we were doing math, I would bust out some vectors here, but we\u0027re avoiding that, so we\u0027ll just say that it would be nicer to fly mostly sideways instead of straight up, so we don\u0027t lose so much of our forward speed to gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin has an atmosphere. The Kerbals are happy for that because it lets them breathe, but it also means you can\u0027t just fly off sideways, because the air robs you of speed too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, missions take off vertically, clear the dense air, and THEN turn sideways. \u0022But Treb, I already knew that. I know all about gravity turns.\u0022 Yes, but the implication for rocket designs must be kept firmly in mind. You want to get out of the lower atmosphere as soon as possible. That means accelerating fairly hard, which means more engines pushing less weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) Never use small tanks where a big one will do\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is for two reasons. One is strictly performance-related: keep the parts count low and make your computer happy. The other is for stability reasons: tall spindly rockets with lots of parts tend to be more wobbly and unstable in the upper atmosphere. One short fat tank is worth four tall skinny tanks. The tall fat one is worth eight. Wherever possible, make the switch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(3) Never use nuclear engines where there is a lot of air or gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe entire point to the nuclear engines is their incredible fuel efficiency. However, they\u0027re only efficient in very thin air or vaccuum. In atmosphere, they\u0027re horrible and burn fuel faster for their thrust level than most engines, making them pointless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn high gravity, the lack of thrust makes them waste a lot of power fighting gravity. You\u0027re usually better off with a high thrust rocket to get you up high and moving fast. On an airless world with lots of gravity (ie, when you reach Tylo) the nuke engines are more useful lower down (because you can make your gravity turn immediately) but you still want something to provide an initial burst of acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(4) Discard the biggest stages first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis comes with an asterix, because there is an exception for solid boosters, which will burn out before the liquid stages. Apart from this, though, it certainly applies. This is my most violated rule. Even people who know better, like most of the people who have been to Duna, violate this one. Even professionals do (the Falcon Heavy violates this rule)!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAround here, this is mostly because of improper asparagus staging. Now, if you know what asparagus staging is, skip this paragraph. If you don\u0027t, this involves making multiple radially-mounted stages linked by fuel lines. The simplest asparagus staging goes like this: you have a central stack of tanks and an engine underneath. Mounted radially are two more stacks of tanks and engines. Fuel lines go from the two stacks on the side to the center engine. The fuel tanks for the side stacks feed all three engines. When they are empty, the side stacks are separated and the central stack of tanks, which are still full, feed the center engine. A more complicated asparagus booster would add another pair of tank stacks which would feed all five engines before being discarded, after which the \u0027simple\u0027 asparagus stack would take over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere people violate this rule is by making all those stacks of tanks the same size. Remember, we want thrust, and thrust means engines. Those tanks of fuel will get lighter and lighter as the fuel is burned off, which means the thrust-to-weight ratio of the rocket gets better and better as it goes. So, we want the stack of tanks to be discarded first to be the largest and the last, central stack of tanks to be the shortest. That way, we have the most engines firing for the longest period of time during the launch. In my Duna stock rocket, the first pair of stacks are each three large tanks tall, the second pair of stacks is two tall large tanks and one short large tank tall, and the central stack is two tall large tanks tall. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a side benefit, the taller side tanks make great places to attach struts to your upper stages/lander to reduce swaying when launching.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(5) Use as few nuclear engines as possible, because they are heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs mentioned, you shouldn\u0027t be using them in heavy air or in heavy gravity. This means that, on Kerbin, you light them up only after you\u0027ve reached orbit. This means you have to haul them up out of the planet\u0027s gravity well. And they aren\u0027t made of feathers and styrofoam; the nuke engines are heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith their low thrust, the temptation is to stick a bunch of them on the vehicle in order to quickly accelerate. Fight this temptation. Hauling a bunch of extra NERVA stages into orbit adds a lot of weight that the stage beneath has to lift, making it heavier, making the stage before that heavier... don\u0027t start down that path! You are in orbit. Thrust to weight no longer matters much. Be patient, and let less engines fire for longer. ONE nuclear engine suffices for flying to Duna or wherever - just be patient. If you don\u0027t already know, physical warp is toggled by RightAlt \u002B \u0026gt; whenever you want it, which will speed up the amount of time you will take.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDESIGNING THE ROCKET\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs KSP makes you build rockets from the top down, let\u0027s build our rocket lander-first!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPick the 3-man capsule. Put a big parachute on top and a big decoupler on the bottom. Obviously, this is for the big finale, when your brave Kerbals detach and re-enter Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. Would that all our stages could be this simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, the landing and ascent stage. Duna does not have thick air or high gravity. This means nuclear engines are a viable means of propulsion (they get about 750 ISP or so on Duna\u0027s surface!) so we\u0027ll use them and save a lot of fuel. Put a small fat tank right under the decoupler there. This will provide the bulk of our fuel. Now, we can\u0027t put the nuclear engine on the bottom, unfortunately, because nuclear tanks are very tall and our lander legs won\u0027t reach. That means we have to put them to the side. We also need to be balanced, so the minimum number we can use is two. Put two of the short, small tanks high up on the sides of the middle tank and put the nuclear engines under them. Duna might not have much air but it does have some, so put a pair of big parachutes on top of those side tanks. Strut them securely to the big tank so they don\u0027t get ripped off. Add struts from the parachutes themselves to the little tanks if you are cautious (might come in handy at Duna). Now you\u0027ve got a lander than can take off from Duna and make it all the way back to Kerbin, thanks to the nuclear engines. Put another decoupler under the center tank. Finally, add the finishing touches - lander legs and ladders. Make sure the legs are placed low enough to keep the two engines clear of the ground!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next stage will carry us from an orbit around Kerbin to Duna. You really only need one of the taller fat tanks to do this, given nuclear engines. Now, in the spacecraft I linked up above, this has its own nuclear engine, but the truly weight-frugal can eliminate it with a bit of cleverness. Instead of providing it with its own engine, just use the ones in the stage above! Run a pair of fuel lines from this tank to the two nuclear engines on the lander above. Remember to move the engine icons from the lander stage to this stage in the VAB, otherwise they won\u0027t light! Put another decoupler under this stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bottom part is all booster, and needs to be able to get everything above into orbit. I used asparagus staging with two pairs of radial stacks, with 12 of the tall fat tanks and 2 of the short ones, with a total of 5 \u0027Mainsail\u0027 engines firing at takeoff. Feel free to experiment here, keeping in mind the lessons above. As long as you can get the lander and that one big tank of fuel in orbit, you\u0027re good!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uoVH3h.png\u0022 alt=\u0022uoVH3h.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-24T23:42:21Z\u0022 title=\u002209/24/2012 11:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 24, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Trebuchet-Launch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eremoved random spaces\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Trebuchet-Launch","CreatedById":29863,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-24T23:35:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFLYING TO DUNA\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, before we go any further, I must drive home an important point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDO NOT SEND ONE SHIP AT A TIME. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust don\u0027t, especially if you don\u0027t know the math. Instead, launch multiple spacecraft. There is a very good, practical reason for this. We are going to be eyeballing it. Duna has a tiny SoI and we can\u0027t tell, at a glance, if we\u0027ve missed it because we\u0027re going to pass slightly in front of it or slightly behind it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we send, say, three spacecraft at a time, they won\u0027t all be on exactly the same trajectory, either. MechJeb we are not. Odds are, however, fairly likely that one of a group of spacecraft leaving during the same departure window WILL intercept Duna\u0027s SoI. And - just like that - now we do know where it will be when our spacecraft arrive! This means that we can adjust our course on the other ships which missed, because now we do know how they\u0027re missing Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qv9A2h.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qv9A2h.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an additional benefit, of course, you get to explore multiple locations on Duna. Or, for that matter, you can divert one of the fleet to Ike instead!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are three parts to our trip to Duna. One is initial departure, the second is making course corrections to off-target rockets, and the third is capture into Duna orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeaving is reasonably easy. Let\u0027s do it in an organized fashion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, put up all of your spacecraft save one into orbit already. Let them hang out in orbit for a while. Now, with the last one on the pad, go into map view. Zoom all the way out so you can see Duna and Kerbin slowly circling their sun. Now, imagine the orbit of Duna as a pizza with eight slices. You can probably picture the width of a slice well enough, right? We want to leave Kerbin when it is one slice behind Duna in its orbit. This will put us on an intercept path.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, fast forward until you are a slice behind. Now, when to launch exactly depends on how much thrust you have in orbit, once you\u0027ve discarded the chemical stages. Launch in the late afternoon to give yourself some time to burn the engines in orbit. Once in orbit, pick up speed and accelerate prograde until you escape, passing behind Kerbin\u0027s night side into Kerbol orbit. Zoom out in map view. Keep burning prograde, watching your apoapsis slide outwards towards Duna. Once it touches Duna\u0027s orbit, if you don\u0027t have an intercept then, burn a little more, pushing the apoapsis beyond Duna a bit, to see if you can get an intercept. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t, switch over to one of your orbiting craft. Warp to the right spot in orbit (late afternoonish to the dusk line) and escape Kerbin orbit. Push that orbit out to Duna\u0027s and a bit beyond, hoping for an intercept. If not, try the third, etc - however many you have in orbit. It shouldn\u0027t take too many, unless you used a very uneven pizza slice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, now one of your brave Kerbals has managed to get an intercept. What about his buddies? Well, we\u0027re going to adjust their orbit towards his! We can see the trajectories of other spacecraft as gray orbits in the map view. We know which one crosses Duna\u0027s SoI when it crosses Duna\u0027s orbit. Now we need to bump everyone else\u0027s orbit so it goes there, too. You are probably thinking, Treb, I don\u0027t know how to do that. No problem, that\u0027s the purpose of this section on midcourse corrections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2FdwRh.png\u0022 alt=\u00222FdwRh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, we should look at inclination. Perhaps you left in a slightly inclined orbit and are missing Duna above or below. Zoom out and rotate the view. Look at where the successful intercept is. Is the yellow line (you\u0027re still in Kerbin\u0027s SoI, right?) heading above or below Duna\u0027s orbit at that point? Determine which it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it is ABOVE Duna\u0027s orbit at that point, twist your rocket around to heading 180, elevation 0. If it is BELOW Duna\u0027s orbit, turn your rocket to heading 0, elevation 0. Light the engine up gently. This should slowly change your orbit\u0027s inclination. When it reaches Duna\u0027s orbit, hopefully you get an interception. If not, we\u0027ll go to the next section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, you have the correct inclination. Are you passing in front of or behind Duna? Let\u0027s take a look at that orbit again. Look at the successful intercept again, and then look at your ship\u0027s trajectory. Is it in FRONT of the successful intercept, further along Duna\u0027s orbit, or BEHIND the successful one, closer to Duna?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it is IN FRONT of that intercept, turn you rocket to elevation 90 (straight up, directly away from the surface of Kerbin). If it is BEHIND the successful intercept, turn to elevation -90 (straight down). Turn up the thrust gently. This will move where you intercept Duna\u0027s orbit in the correct direction slowly. You should get an interception at some point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(In the picture above, the off-course Kerbals were behind the successful intercept)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf, after your orbit crosses the same spot as the successful intercept and you still don\u0027t have a Duna encounter, switch to the next non-intercepting rocket and repeat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach additional successful interception pins down Duna\u0027s location a bit more, and lets you tweak the courses of the remaining ones more as well. Eventually, everyone should have a Duna encounter. If for some reason you still don\u0027t, get started on the way to Duna anyhow. Warp at high speed until you\u0027re halfway there. Now, you should see where the non-intercepting rockets have gone astray. Either they are going too fast and ahead of their buddies, or too slow and behind. Burn retrograde or prograde to fix their speed problem and tweak their orbit as indicated above. NOW you should have intercepts for everyone! Break out the champagne in Mission Control and get ready to explore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapturing into Duna orbit is easy. It\u0027s the same as any other orbital capture, although the relative speed is higher. Switch to the craft closest to Duna. When it enters Duna\u0027s SoI, burn retrograde until it captures into an orbit. Do this for all the rockets you sent out, then lower their orbits in the normal fashion until everyone is in Duna (or Ike, if you want to send someone there) orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/P6Yleh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022P6Yleh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll probably end up in assorted crazy orbits.

When they fully open, it will violently and your lander will bleed speed at an incredible rate. Soon after you will be headed generally straight down but swaying all over the place violently. Get that under control quickly and get your engines pointed straight down. Once you\u0027ve gotten the lander stabilized the hard part is over.
