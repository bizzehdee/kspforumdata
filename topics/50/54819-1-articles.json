Then, I use the Alt mouse click to copy and paste that pair to the next position and rearrange the fuel line. I then copy and paste once or twice more depending on the design. It is a lot easier to then set up the staging on the decouplers individually. (Note, stage six is used to drop engines when near orbit so the LV-N can use the remaining fuel in the asparagus as drop tanks more efficiently.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iV70xIE.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022iV70xIE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou also need to run fuel lines near the base of the fuel can.
