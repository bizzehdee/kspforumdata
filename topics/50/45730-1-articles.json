TJ here, this is how to land on the Mun and other planets, For you new Keralnaughts landing is probably a huge challenge, Well I will give you a quick tutorial, Ok we\u0027ll be Landing on the Mun first, so step 1 get yourself as circular as an orbit As possible, step 2, rotate your orbit so your apoasis is about 45 degrees ahead of the Mun, then fire until you see your orbit goes purple, and you see an orange section with a sphere near it. step 3 Time warp until the orange orbit turns blue, then see that little circle with the X In it? throttle up, until your rocket\u0027s orbit is straight down, get to the top dot on the nav ball, that\u0027s vertical. deploy your landing gear and hope for the best. check out my other tutorials on how to get back to kerbin, and go to other planets.
