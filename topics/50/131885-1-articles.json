Ballistic Coefficient (BC) is the craft mass divided by the effective frontal area. It is basically a measure of how strongly drag slows you down--the higher your BC, the less influence drag will have on you, the lower your BC the faster you\u0027ll slow down. Think bullets (very high BC) vs rocks (medium BC--heavy, but lots of area) vs paper (very low BC flat-on, medium BC edge-on). Total heat load, Q, is the total amount of heat a given reentry will saddle you with. Peak heat flux, q\u0022, is the maximum heating \u003Cem\u003Erate\u003C/em\u003E you will suffer in a given reentry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour BC, combined with any lifting ability your craft has, will determine, for a entry angle and speed, what geometry the reentry will take. Your maximum q\u0022 will determine how low a periapsis (more or less interchangeable with entry angle) you can survive for a given entry speed. Your maximum Q will determine how long you can survive reentry (though remember that the lower you are, the more heat you\u0027ll get).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s three ways to deal with heat: sink it, reradiate it, and use ablator. Everything radiates heat, proporitonal to its temperature\u003Csup\u003E4,\u003C/sup\u003E so some of the heat you take in will radiate back out. Everything has a thermal mass (your temperature doesn\u0027t immediately reach the temperature of the shockwave, it takes heat over time to raise temperature) so you can sink heat for a while. Heat shields have ablator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor Kerbin reentries up to Munar-return velocity, reradiation and sinking is generally enough (there\u0027s a narrow corridor for a single-pass Munar reentry, although you can of course make multiple passes, there\u0027s no life-support-induced time limit). For faster reentries, you generally need a heat shield which (a) has a higher maximum temperature (i.e. you can suffer higher q\u0022 and the higher max temp means much higher reradiation potential) and (b) has ablator which is another way to shed heat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that heat rate scales, roughly, with velocity\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E * density\u003Csup\u003E0.5,\u003C/sup\u003E while drag is proportional to velocity\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E * density. This means that while a shallow reentry will have a low q\u0022, it may have a much higher Q than a steeper one. If you\u0027re better at reradiating heat (i.e. you can reach thermal equilibrium, where incoming heat == radiating-out heat), you want a shallow reentry. If you\u0027re not so good at it, or the reentry is too fast (too high a heat load) you\u0027ll need a steeper reentry, but not so steep that your q\u0022 goes above the maximum at which you can ablate/reradiate at max temperature (if you are at max temp and in flux \u0026gt; out flux, you blow up). BC is relevant here because, as should be intuitively obvious, the lower your BC, the faster you\u0027ll slow down, thus suffering less time at higher (hotter) velocity--and that compounds, due to the cube on velocity!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have lifting surfaces (or tilt your pod during descent to take advantage of body lift) you can fly a lifting reentry. This allows you to stay \u0022artificially\u0022 high in the atmosphere. It also, depending on your roll angle, can let you steer your reentry, just like in an aeroplane. It\u0027s no different than gliding. If you\u0027re overshooting, roll inverted and increase your descent rate; if you\u0027re coming in to the left, roll right so lift pushes you right. Etc. However, lifting reentries--because they stay higher longer--do impose a higher heat load than ballistic ones, though a lower q\u0022. So make sure your craft can take the slow roast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne other wrinkle: the blunter the bit that\u0027s facing the wind, the more likely you are to get a detached shockwave, rather than one attached to your forward-most part. That will greatly lower the shockwave temperature that you feel. For this reason, if you\u0027re flying a spaceplane, always come in bottom-first, not nose-first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPractical examples:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpaceplanes don\u0027t have ablator. That means you need to either sink the heat, or reach thermal equilibrium. Given the above regarding detached shockwaves, and the q\u0022 limit you have due to lack of ablator, you probably can\u0027t come in steep enough to survive just sinking the heat, so you need to fly a very shallow, lifting reentry that keeps q\u0022 low enough you can radiate the heat away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCapsules from LKO don\u0027t have to worry much, as long as it\u0027s just a capsule. If you add on crew cabins or materials bays or whatever, then you do have to worry, because you\u0027ve not changed your frontal area (it\u0027s still a circle of 1.25m or 2.5m diameter) but you\u0027ve increased your mass, raising your ballistic coefficient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTransmunar reentries are on the dividing line, at least for a reasonable-BC craft. You\u0027ll probably be OK without a heatshield if you are careful with periapsis, but shielding would help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInterplanetary flight definitely needs heatshields. A simple chute \u002B Mk1-2 pod \u002B 2.5m heat shield can just barely survive an aerocapture/reentry to Eve at 5.5km/sec. If your BC is higher than that, or your velocity is, you won\u0027t be so lucky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hypervelocity","CreatedById":136426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-11T19:47:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthis is great Nathan, it ties perfectly with my earlier queries, I am learning a lot here and who doesn\u0027t like learning?????\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany thanks!!! new information to introduce to my designs!!!! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Norcalplanner","CreatedById":112223,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-15T09:31:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for explaining what I had sorta figured out by trial and error in my current 3X scale game (where Kerbin orbital speed is around 4 km/sec).\u00A0 I\u0027ve found I use up less ablator with a 20 km periapsis reentry than a 40 km periapsis reentry with a typical capsule and heat shield combo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-17T15:44:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just found this out, and I approve of the informativeness. Just one thing to add: given enough control authority, spaceplanes have a \u003Cem\u003Evariable \u003C/em\u003EBC. Go full prograde, and the plane will knife through the atmosphere, barely stopping at all and generating a completely unsurvivable q\u0022. But go in pointing normal, and the huge drag of the wings will make you stop so high up, the max temperature will be a joke and you\u0027ll be able to use parts with low temperature resistance. At intermediate angles, lift changes things completely, since as say you can fly a lifting reentry and dump the heat at your leisure, but the extreme case of ballistic reentry with wings acting as huge airbrakes is interesting enough to warrant a mention, the aerodynamics and thermodynamics being completely different. You \u0022fly\u0022 like a capsule... only so high that you don\u0027t see anything heat up appreciably.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe comment about bow shock, though, is very interesting. Would you care to go through it in more detail? Because I find it a bit puzzling how KSP handles the foremost part presented to the airflow. Reentering rockets engine-bell first, for example, the engines get incredibly high heat fluxes, especially if they are clustered, but once they blow up the tanks immediately behind them see a much lower heat rate (I\u0027m talking empty tanks, so no big thermal mass to dump stuff in).

For me this is the best explanation to why reentry works the way it does in KSP yet. Also the best explanation to why my orbiter has to reenter as shallow as it does.
