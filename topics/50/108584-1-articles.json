With that in mind, I\u0027ve tried to develop a checklist to maximise the amount of science you can earn in the first two missions. If people can improve on this, I\u0027d like to hear from them, but I think this is the most you can earn on normal difficulty of stock KSP (at least, without the tedium of walking a kerbal around the space centre). I\u0027ve tried to include every step so anyone should be able to follow it. For every step where science is collected, select \u0022Keep data\u0022 rather than reset or transmit:\n\n **First mission:**\n\n1.

Your gaining enough in that first mission, that the second mission is all but guaranteed to reach the thermometer.\n\nScience in each Biome has a maximum amount of available science. Some experiments will give you 100% of the available science in a single report, such as Crew Reports, EVA Reports, Temperature Reports. Others only give a fraction of the available science and thus need to be done multiple times to get all of the available Science such as Goo Canisters, Science Jr, etc.\n\nWhen you do your Science Experiment you will see a Green Bar and a Blue Bar (sorry at work at the moment so working from memory). The Green bar shows you how much of the available science is being discovered with this experiment, a full bar is 100%, an empty bar is 0%. The Blue bar is how much of the researched science you will gain if you transmit the data rather than return the experiment. Some experiments, like the Crew Report, will give a 1:1 ratio if you transmit, so you will get 100% of the data. Others like the Goo Canisters will give you less science if you transmit. Trick is to always physically return the science data if you can, either by bringing the experiment part back or having one of your crew remove the data from the part and store it in the cabin.\n\nIn regards to progression I like to get the basic Plane parts as early as possible, including the wheels, and at least through to the Thermometer. I think I can get all that after my second launch which I generally do with the Rocket listed above (although I take off some of the goo and install a Science Jr) and land in a different biome. At that point once I have the parts I need/want, I make myself a simple car and I visit every building in the Space Center using a Scientist to extract and reset all of the science experiments. With a single Goo Container, Science Jr, Thermometer, Crew Report and EVA Report from each location within your Space Center you can get well over 100 science, if you have the time and patience to the Goo and Science Jr at each location 4 times (this means 4 separate trips, but you should be able to get some more Experiment parts to add in the process) you will be able to extract the maximum science from each area.\n\nSpace Center Biomes are:\n\nLaunch Pad\n\nLaunch Pad Trackway\n\nVAB\n\nSPH\n\nRunway\n\nR\u0026D Center\n\nTracking Station\n\nFlag Pole\n\nContracts Building\n\nAdministration Building (the one where you can trade one resource for another)\n\nCrew Building\n\nKSP Space Center (pick an area of grass near the Space Center, but not within the area of one of the buildings, I generally do this one when travelling in a straight line from the Runway to the R\u0026D building).\n\nBy the end of doing all this, and before I have even left the atmosphere I can have all of the first 3 tiers unlocked and has started working on tier 4."},{"CreatedByName":"Elexorien","CreatedById":141761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T19:39:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Space Center Biomes are:\n\u003E \n\u003E Launch Pad\n\u003E \n\u003E Launch Pad Trackway\n\u003E \n\u003E VAB\n\u003E \n\u003E SPH\n\u003E \n\u003E Runway\n\u003E \n\u003E R\u0026D Center\n\u003E \n\u003E Tracking Station\n\u003E \n\u003E Flag Pole\n\u003E \n\u003E Contracts Building\n\u003E \n\u003E Administration Building (the one where you can trade one resource for another)\n\u003E \n\u003E Crew Building\n\u003E \n\u003E KSP Space Center (pick an area of grass near the Space Center, but not within the area of one of the buildings, I generally do this one when travelling in a straight line from the Runway to the R\u0026D building).\n\nThanks for informing me of the flag pole, I tried it last night on a whim, but didn\u0027t see that it was it\u0027s own biome (I\u0027ll try again tonight).\n\nHowever there are a few more that I have found:\n\nSPH Main Building - separate from the SPH area, just have your rover/car physically touch the SPH building while doing your experiments (Building was upgraded to level 2 each time I\u0027ve run my experiments).\n\nTracking Station Hub - found it last night, same as above, just have to be touching the central building (It was also upgraded to level 2 at the time).\n\nAlso I have found a few spots near KSC that identify as Tundra (no clue why), one of which is almost due south of the Launch Pad.

Following the Scott Manley tutorial:Unlock the Kerbalnaut building to allow EVAs.  Go into space (this is complicated.  Not the going there, but getting back alive is tricky.   I\u0027d suggest a 45 degree path to survive, but would need to test this first.  It gets worse when you realize that Bob is optimal for science but can\u0027t enable SAS).  Once in space, do an EVA and EVA report.  Also learn to do the \u0022science dance\u0022 and get the science from any instrument and then reset the instrument.\n\nA cheap way to orbit is using BACC  SRB and Terrier upper stage rocket.  Experts can try to recover the terrier, but I\u0027ve given up on it.  Again, Bob is optimal for science but lacks SAS (I don\u0027t think this rocket can bring the Science Jr along anyway).  Note the \u0022science dance\u0022 proper involves storing the science in the capsule (and Jeb and Valentina can do it as well, they just can\u0027t reset the instruments).  Practice doing this by hanging onto the capsule as Kerbin whizzes by and do an EVA report as something new whizzes by.  For each different biome you can collect different EVA reports, but each time you have to store them in the capsule (you can only hold one type of each scientific report (\u0022report\u0022 or measurement)).  Once you feel you have all that you are going to get, get back in the capsule and return to Kerbin (thrust at retrograde to reduce your perigee (not sure you can see your perigee at this point) to ~30km.  Dump everything below the capsule (a heat shield is a good idea but shouldn\u0027t be required) and when your parachute icons turn green (\\*after rentry\\*, they might be green in the upper atmosphere but won\u0027t survive rentry if you open them then) hit the space bar to open them.  Experts can amuse themselves trying to salvage the upper stage engine: I gave up after awhile and don\u0027t think it can be done with unmodded KSP with a minimal tech tree."},{"CreatedByName":"Quijote","CreatedById":152455,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-18T16:38:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 5/1/2016 at 6:29 PM, wumpus said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Scott Manley tutorial:Unlock the Kerbalnaut building to allow EVAs\n\u003E \n\nHi, ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif \u0022:blush:\u0022)\n\nSorry I need help, I can\u00B4t find this tutorial"},{"CreatedByName":"RattiRatto","CreatedById":162231,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-20T11:43:24Z","Content":"Thanks for the tips!\n\nThis thread made me discover scott manley videos, which were extremely helpful and clear.
