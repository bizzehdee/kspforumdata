As you rightly say, it\u0027s best for someone who already has an inkling on how to use manoeuvre nodes. Only comment I can really add is that I would remove the seperatrons and make the craft a single stage, just in case someone accidentally presses the spacebar and loses 4 engines and the landing legs in one swift go - especially if they decide to go for a landing after reaching the Mun. If you do that, you might also want to lose the central engine, as it is not currently being used, or include it in the stage with the other 4 engines for a bit more thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-16T17:41:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually I didn\u0027t build the craft myself this time.
