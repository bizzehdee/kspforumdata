Do you want some fancy new engines? Want to design massive craft? Even want to add entire planets and moons to the game? There\u0027s only one issue: How do you make such things a part of the game?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a quick guide for installing mods and addons to Kerbal Space Program. Firstly, let\u0027s start with some simple terminology (what words mean), so you know what I\u0027m talking about later in the guide.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETerms\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMod: A modification, commonly called a mod, is anything that changes or adds things to a program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlugin: A bit of software that is sometimes needed for certain things to work (e.g. Firespitter.dll is usually required for most parts that have animations)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGameData: Can be the KSP GameData folder, located in the root folder of the game, or can be a mod\u0027s GameData folder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRoot folder: Usually a folder named \u0027Kerbal Space Program\u0027. Once opened, it contains all files for the game, including IVAs, textures, sounds, and most importantly, parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExtract/Unzip/Unpack: They all mean the same thing, but generally it just means to \u0027Extract all\u0027 the mod\u0027s .ZIP file (the file which get\u0027s downloaded and contains everything for the mod).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nreadme: A text file, usually found in most mods, that can contain installation instructions, licenses, changelogs, or other things. You should always read the mod\u0027s \u0027readme\u0027 file (if it has one), because that usually contains installation instructions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPart 1: Searching \u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you want a mod, except where to get it from, you wonder. These are the links to the most common sites for KSP mods, including the KSP Forum\u0027s own mod page.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP Mods on Curse: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://mods.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://mods.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP Forum\u0027s Mod Release Thread: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/forum/34-add-on-releases/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/forum/34-add-on-releases/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpaceDock: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://spacedock.info/kerbal-space-program\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://spacedock.info/kerbal-space-program\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you\u0027ve found your mod, time to download it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart 2: Downloading \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027ve found a certain mod that you like, and you\u0027re ready to download it. However, caution is advised, as not all download links work, and you\u0027re computer\u0027s safety and KSP game safety may be at risk. Before proceeding, you should check the version history. It\u0027s no use downloading a mod for version 1.1.2 if your KSP version is 1.3, is it? Sometimes, but very rarely, mods that have higher versions that your game version may work (I downloaded a mod for version 1.0.5, and I installed it for KSP version 1.0.0, and it worked fine). But usually, downloading mods not for the current version can cause glitches, cause missing parts, corrupt a save file, or even break the game entirely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecondly, make sure the download link works. On Curse, since the mod is based on the site, and the download link is on the site as well, every mod should download. But sometimes, especially for old mods that haven\u0027t been updated in a while, the download link may not work. It may deliver a blank page. It may do nothing. It may give a 404 error (that page doesn\u0027t exist anymore). This is very frustrating, as you really want a cool mod, but you can\u0027t download it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext, be wary of downloading from dodgy-looking websites. They may contain malware, Trojans, or viruses that could harm your computer. Always scan something for malware before downloading it, just to be safe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart 3: Installing\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you\u0027ve successfully downloaded your mod. Open the mod folder, and look around for a \u0027readme\u0027 file if it has one. That file would usually contain installation instructions for the mod. For example: \u0027To install \u0027Cat Flags\u0027, unpack everything to the root folder, overwriting previous versions if there are any\u0027. This means that you need to go to the mod\u0027s .ZIP folder (the one it came in), right click it, select \u0027Extract All\u0027, and locate your folder named \u0027Kerbal Space Program\u0027, that contains all the files for the game. Once you\u0027ve found it, select \u0027Extract\u0027, and it should put everything in there, nice and neat and tidy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, for most mods, you will not have to extract everything to the Kerbal Space Program folder. Nearly every mod has a \u0027GameData\u0027 folder, containing all the parts, textures, sounds, and everything else with it. For most mods, you would just copy the mod\u0027s GameData folder to your GameData folder, located in the root folder of the game (Kerbal Space Program). However, a common mistake is to copy\u003Cem\u003E the \u003C/em\u003Emod\u0027s GameData folder to your GameData folder. This will create a GameData folder INSIDE KSP\u0027s GameData folder, usually causing issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you should do, is open the mod\u0027s GameData folder, and select everything inside it, and copy all of that to your GameData folder, so you don\u0027t end up with a GameData folder in KSP\u0027s GameData folder. (A bit confusing, but stay with me!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart 4: Launching the game\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you\u0027ve now installed the mod. Simply, whenever you\u0027re ready, launch the game. Hopefully, the game should load fine without crashing or freezing (usually caused by incorrect installation of the mod). Hopefully, all the mod\u0027s parts should be there (missing parts are usually because of incorrect installation). Hopefully, there should be no bugs or glitches with the mod, affecting your game (usually caused by an incorrect installation, but sometimes happens because of the mod. In the latter case, wait for a bugfix version of the mod, and then download that one).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this long-ish guide helps you, TCIS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-14T02:45:51Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2017 02:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by The_Cat_In_Space\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
