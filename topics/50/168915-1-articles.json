Don\u0027t try to actually do that, it will get you nowhere. Actually useful assists have a much smaller angle. Because a picture says more than a thousand words:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022simple_gravity_assist.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022275\u0022 src=\u0022http://ksp.schnobs.de/stuff/simple_gravity_assist.png\u0022 width=\u0022977\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe above shows two maneuvers leading to Duna, one of them doing a close flyby of the Mun (PE \u0026lt;20km). Note how the trajectories leading out of the Kerbin system are nearly parallel. That is no coincidence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow to set it up:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nuse a probe or whatever to plot an ordinary maneuver straight for your destination.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\non the vessel that actually goes, set the probe as target (so you see it\u0027s trajectory), then plot a close flyby of the Mun that takes you out of Kerbin on a parallel course.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nright-click the Munar PE so it remains persistently readable\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nzoom out, select actual destination as target. You should already be pretty close.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nif you can\u0027t see an interplanetary trajectory, place a maneuver on the last stretch you see (probably between Mun and leaving Kerbin). That maneuver doesn\u0027t need to do anything, it just has to be there so you see the trajectory.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nusing Precise Node or similar tools, make small adjustments to the departure maneuver in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E: a few seconds sooner or later, small changes in delta-V. Keep an eye on munar PE and see to it that it remains positive. That\u0027s why you clicked it in the first place, this will save you a lot of zooming in and out.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you need a plane change, you can get that for cheap by doing a mid-course maneuver about 1/3rd of the way to the Mun. Put that maneuver down before zooming out.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is more worthwhile the slower you go. For ballpark figures, you can expect to steal 80m/s or more when going to Eve or Duna, but only about 50m/s when going to Jool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-04T07:52:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/04/2018 07:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 4, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Laie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
