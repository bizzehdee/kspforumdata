Yesterday I spend 4 (four) hours on low-distance approach trying to my first dock, without success. I did counless attempts to dock, on extremely low speed and with pinpoint precision, they touched but not docked. Runned out of monopropellant and smashed both ships to the ground in angry (unmanned, yes). After this I realise what something must be very, very wrong. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo words about test ship design.
