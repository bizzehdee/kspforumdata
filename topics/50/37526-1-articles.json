So yes it can keep you pointed forward, ie; the horizon, but if your rover rolls a little left or right it will keep that new roll value as if you intended to do it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the satellite rig, I think it\u0027s still more than twice the size it needs to be. Got it all strutted properly this morning and all in it was 180 parts and 460ish tonnes. I can probably cut that down to about 70% sticking with conventional rockets and no jet engines. The design is purpose built to capture directly at Laythe instead of Jool, and then send the 4 outer probes to the remaining moons from an elliptical Laythe orbit before the inclination and circularization. Did a test of the fl-t400 sized probes which has 3300m/s of dV, it had enough fuel to easily get to all the other moons from a 150km circular Laythe orbit. The half sized ones have 2300 each but I may dump those for 4x fl-t400\u0027s due to non optimal inclination changes some people may want to do. The t200 on the nose will left as is and used for Laythe since its already there, and the nuclear stage will have enough fuel left to put it in the proper orbit and inclination before it splashes down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Benie","CreatedById":70327,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-18T17:15:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis seems cool.

The only reason I say probe core is to ensure you have some torque on rovers that use EVA seats instead of capsules.
