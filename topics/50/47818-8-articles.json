So, thing that is happening with your craft design, so it start to wooble whenever you try to make loops by constant pitching up or down is that your overall control surfaces have too much control authority.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeaning: when you keep key \u0022S\u0022 pressed to pull up plane all time, your AoA becomes too large, so you have pushed plane in area where you start to loose lift and piching moment(yelow line) forces becomes much larger than forces from control surfaces that pitching plane up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo handle this problem, lower pitching authority on control surfaces by one at a time until you are able to pitch up all times without falling in wooble effect. If you have gamepad ort joystick you can use analog controls in a way that you not reach maximum pitching. Without analog controlers you can use trim controls ALT \u002B (W,S) keys on windows, or whatever \u0022mod\u0022 key is on your OS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your pitching controls are already set on low, so lowering further will cause more issues than it solve problems then you have to adjust pitching moment(yelow line) in FAR graph to produce less force. It is described in other picture how to do it - by moving \u0022fulcrum\u0022 or leverage on tail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are looking for example, try \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108954-KCS-SpacePlanes-Craft-Repository?p=1702710\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1702710\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESporty Mk1\u003C/a\u003E plane.
