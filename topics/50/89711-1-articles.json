This is a general tutorial on how to remove the WIN64 block for your favorite mod. As mod makers may have various methods to prevent KSP WIN64 from running their mod I will try and make this a general as possible without leaving out any pertinent details. However, just as with many of life\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s tasks there is always more than one way to do things. SO the method I show you here may not be the best, the fastest or most efficient. Also mod makers may use various methods to block KSP WIN 64 from running. I will here cover the most common method, and cannot immediately solve other variations, and\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E I WILL NOT\u003C/span\u003E be giving particular information on how to unlock any particular mod unless I receive \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003EEXPRESS WRITTEN\u003C/span\u003E consent from that mod maker.

This is a rather large program (4GB) sorry about that. This is a free program from Microsoft. Follow the direction on web site to download and install. Skip the Azure installation! I am sure Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows and Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop would do the job as well I just happened to grab the first one I saw and it did the job for me so if you want the screenshot to match up use that one.

You will need to download the source code for mode you want to remove the Win64 block from. Unzip the code into a folder. If you want to modify more than one mode perhaps a set up like the pic below will work for you. I am using widows7 x64 so if you have different windows things may not look the same.
