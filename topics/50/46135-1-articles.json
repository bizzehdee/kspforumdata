This was calculated for an equatorial retrograde orbit (highest airpseed). For a prograde orbit, the figures should be similar, perhaps a little lower. It should be noted that the final apoapsis is \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E sensitive to the atmospheric periapsis used.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done quite a few aerocaptures at Duna but always prograde. For prograde, 10-12km is usually the best bet. Within the range, the specific Pe altitude is HUGELY dependent on your orbital speed relative to Duna. The faster you\u0027re going, the lower you have to go in the atmosphere to get the desired results. Of course, the desired results can differ a lot from case to case, but assuming you want to end up with the same Ap, the faster you\u0027re going, the deeper you have to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, I recently sent a flotilla of 3 ships to Duna, all launched within a couple hours of each other but with arrivals spread out over 28 days. The 1st to arrive was going like 1500m/s upon entering Duna\u0027s SOI and needed a Pe of 11km to get an Ap of over 2Mm, about 3/4 of the way out to Ike. Which was fine because this ship was going to Ike anyway. This was the only 1 of the 3 to produce fireworks. The 2nd ship arrived 10 days later going a bit slower. I wanted this one to end up in a 500km orbit. Using a Pe of 11.8km, I got an Ap of 485km or so, close enough. The 3rd ship arrived 28 days after the 1st doing about 940m/s. It\u0027s goal was a 150km Ap, and using an 11.8km Pe again gave it 146km, again close enough. So, both these ships used the same Pe but got very different Aps because of their different speeds. And the ship that went the deepest ended up with the biggest orbit, due to its much higher initial speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: The Pe\u0027s listed above were set when the ships were at 90km altitude. That\u0027s basically you\u0027re last chance to tweak the Pe before you enter Duna\u0027s atmosphere. The actual Pe\u0027s when the ships got there were somewhat lower due to the braking on the way to them (the 1st ship got down to 10km for example).

This is because the whole thing is so dependent on the ship\u0027s speed relative to Duna upon arrival and that will never be the same 2 times in a row. Your ship will always start in a slightly different orbit and you\u0027ll always do the transfer burn slightly differently, and then do some mid-course tweaks (or not) slightly differently. At Duna, a difference in speed of just 100m/s has a profound effect both on how deep you need to set your Pe to get captured at all, and the Ap you end up with afterwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven this state of affairs, and the utter lack of in-game instrumentation to help, the only thing you can do is \u0022have the boffins at Mission Control run simulations\u0022.
