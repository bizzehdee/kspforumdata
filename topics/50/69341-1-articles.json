I\u0027ll share how i\u0027ve done it. I\u0027ve grabbed a Class C so far and put it into kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Build big... really big\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is why SQUAD gave us all those big rockets. In order to successfully grab an asteroid and bring it back home to Kerbin you have to deliver some serious firepower to it. This especially goes for anything Class C or bigger. While you\u0027re building big... those liquid rocket boosters are amazing at getting your big rocket into orbit. My second attempt to move an asteroid was on a class E that was going to hit kerbin (oh noes it\u0027s Deep Impact/Armageddon). I tried to use the Skipper rocket but it was woefully under-powered for the task.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse of RCS is recommended but not necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1b: The liquid rocket boosters will probably be the last engine you ever need to unlock\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Plan your launch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis comes in 2 steps...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA. Track the asteroid you want to grab\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB. Line up your launch with the direction it will pass kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you see an asteroid in the tracking station you can tell the station to track it. This lets you know when the asteroid will intercept Kerbin\u0027s SOI. Now on a spacecraft you have in orbit target the asteroid. You\u0027ll be able to see how it is going to pass by kerbin. This is important to let you align your ship with the orbit of the asteroid when you take off. You\u0027ll save a lot of delta-V doing this. You need all the dV you can get when you get to the asteroid. You\u0027ll be launching in directions you\u0027ve never thought of before. I\u0027ve had one launch going due south. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is also a good way to intercept a spacecraft at an odd angle or to go to Minimus without doing the phase correction burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Launch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou want your interceptor to be in orbit before the asteroid enters kerbin\u0027s SOI. This is especially true for shallow passes where the asteroid is beyond the orbit of Minimus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Intercepting the asteroid\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore you can intercept you need to match the phase. Plan a maneuver at the ascending or descending node. Adjust this maneuver so that the node\u0027s angle reads 0.0. If it\u0027s dancing around a lot then you\u0027ve got it. Now you can plan the intercept burn. Place this burn on the exact opposite side of your orbit from the asteroid\u0027s periapsis to start. Expand the prograde marker so you get the intercept bugs to appear. Now project several orbits ahead until the target position bugs are past the Periapsis. This is where you look to intercept. Move the position and strength of your intercept burn to get one of your position and the target position bugs to line up. For shallow intercepts you can be off by a few hundred km. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Shallow intercept course correction burn\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHalf way to the intercept you may need to do a course correction burn. Stick to purple or blue direction and get your intercept within 100km. You have ample time to get the burn right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Intercept time. When you\u0027re within 300 km of the asteroid switch to \u0022target mode\u0022 on the navball by clicking the spot where your velocity reading is. It defaulted to \u0022orbit\u0022. There\u0027s \u0022surface\u0022 and \u0022target\u0022. You want \u0022target\u0022. Now find the retrograde vector (green x marker) and burn towards it till your velocity is under 200m/s. (highest this has ever been for me was 1200) There should be a pink asteroid retrograde marker. Burn on the opposite side of that marker to make your retrograde marker line up. Keep 100m/s until you\u0027re within 15km then drop it to 50m/s. Keep the markers lined up so you can use the velocity you have. Within 2 km drop the speed to 5m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you set the trust limiter on your engine you can get finer control over the throttle. That big Kerbodyne rocket can be as accurate as the 909.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Capture. You brought the grappling hook with you didn\u0027t you? Arm it. Right click the asteroid and select \u0022target center of mass\u0022. You\u0027re going to dock with the asteroid now. RCS helps here but you\u0027re not docking with a docking port. Aim doesn\u0027t have to be too precise. Keep your speed under 4m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Aligning the center of mass. Now that you\u0027ve hooked onto the asteroid you have to align the center of mass so that you can drive it. Right click the hook and choose \u0022free pivot\u0022. Turn off RCS and use reaction wheels for this: align the spacecraft such that the center of the navball marker is centered on the asteroid\u0027s center of mass purple marker. If you don\u0027t do this when you throttle up you\u0027ll induce spin on the asteroid. If you do this then you can fly straight. Once aligned right click the hook and choose \u0022lock pivot\u0022. Now you can fly striaght. The angle of incidence for your hook doesn\u0027t matter, only that the center of mass is lined up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. Bring it home: Switch to orbit mode on the navball and burn retrograde until you have a periapsis. Put the Periapsis around 1 million meters or a little lower. Park your asteroid as you would a normal spacecraft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recommend doing this with a probe so you don\u0027t have to inadvertantly sacrifice kerbals when you find out your rocket ended up with 30 deltaV attached to the asteroid. This is also why you built big in step 1. My class C asteroid grabber has 5000 delta V before it latches on but only 900 when it\u0027s attached (depending on the size of the rock). Class A and B asteroids can be handled by smaller craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-14T14:39:30Z\u0022 title=\u002204/14/2014 02:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by michaelhester07\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Elock the pivot\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-14T14:42:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, one of the most successful methods of capture I have found is to lower/raise the periapsis to 35 Kilometers. That way you get an aerobrake capture, which you can then extend the periapsis back up to 70\u002B kilometers. I tried that with an E-Class (Was on a 500,000 Km periapsis, I was trying to capture it. Don\u0027t ask.) and failed miserably, as the 6-NERVA engine cluster only had about 75m/s DV once I attached it...
