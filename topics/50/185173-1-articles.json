I am a noob in KSP, so the maths are being copied direct from the wiki, and some get in forums(rocket formula). This document is made in LaTeX, if you want to contribute you don\u0027t need to know what this is to work with me, i need most gidance and Calcs. Post here your contribution, use git, or email me.

For now, i think is better to make a little chapter with the \u0022most used concepts\u0022, and chapters that dig deeper in the topics. I am up to yours toughts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
