Its main downside is that it\u0027s not possible to plan very well, as your final trajectory depends on your craft, your planetary intersect, your periapsis, and what you do during the capture. Usually aerocapture involves trial and error with a couple of quicksaves/quickloads.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow I describe\u00A0a technique for more controllable aerocaptures. It is applicable to Duna, Laythe, and Kerbin*; Eve and Jool would require exceptionally robust designs with creative use of heat shields at least.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDesigning the craft\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo execute this technique, your craft will need some plane-like characteristics, even if it is not an actual spaceplane. Specifically, it needs to be \u003Cstrong\u003Eslippery along one axis\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003Edraggy along another axis,\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0you need to be able to \u003Cstrong\u003Econtrol its attitude\u003C/strong\u003E while it is in the atmosphere, and you need to be able to \u003Cstrong\u003Esurvive the thermal load\u003C/strong\u003E of the atmospheric entry (easy for Duna, a significant challenge for Kerbin, depending on where you\u0027re coming from). There are various ways to do it for a rocket-like craft -- winglets with control surfaces, big empty fuel tanks and reaction wheels/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E -- but designing these is left to the reader. Your craft should\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0rely on heat shields as primary thermal protection as this significantly limits your options in executing the technique.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow we\u0027re assuming your craft has a plane-like geometry: pointy and slippery when pointed prograde, wide and draggy when pointed radial out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe technique\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nDo preliminary research to determine a rough aerocapture altitude for your target, e.g. 15 - 20 km for Duna.
