I\u0027ve been raging for a long time because of this. One of the reasons it that there is some confusion from the forum people with the old SelectRoot mod, which was doing the same thing, but differently. People still explain how to use root part as if they were dealing with SelectRoot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here we go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the root part?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the best and simplest explanation I\u0027ve found: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104700-What-s-the-point-of-the-first-step-of-re-root-tool?p=1626941\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1626941\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104700-What-s-the-point-of-the-first-step-of-re-root-tool?p=1626941\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1626941\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, every ship/rocket/assembly starts from a single part. That\u0027s the one part onto which you click to move the entire rocket around with the mouse. The root part tool allows you to change that part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe root part becomes very important when you start working with subassemblies, because the KSP gui goes all crazy when you try to attach that assembly to your main ship. It will try to attach it starting from the root part. So if your root part is, let\u0027s say, a docking port, then everything goes well. But if your root part is, let\u0027s say, the pod, then it might not attach the way you want it to attach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow to use the root part tool (simple solution)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany people say \u0022just click on the new root part\u0022. FALSE. Kerbal\u0027s gui tells you to click on \u003Cem\u003Etwo \u003C/em\u003Eparts, and it\u0027s extremy (\u003Cem\u003Eextremely!\u003C/em\u003E) confusing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m not going to go into the details, I\u0027m just going to explain the simple solution: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) click on the \u0022root part\u0022 button\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) click on \u003Cem\u003Eany \u003C/em\u003E stupid part that touches your new root part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) click on you new root part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Nothing happened, apparently. But if you did it correctly, now if you click on the \u0022place\u0022 button (to go back to normal edit mode), and if you click on your new root part, that\u0027s now the part that you may use to move everything around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you screwed up, and if that click messes up with your build, never forget that you can press Ctrl\u002BZ to cancel your last action.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf someone feels like they\u0027re able to explain why you need to click on two parts, and what part should be chosen, then feel free to do so, but please do better than the people before you, who either misunderstood the question, or explained something enirely different.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-05T19:26:38Z\u0022 title=\u002209/05/2015 07:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jeancallisti\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MGM","CreatedById":150672,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-09T05:22:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, I commented on that in another post: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104700-What-s-the-point-of-the-first-step-of-re-root-tool/page2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104700-What-s-the-point-of-the-first-step-of-re-root-tool/page2\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe two-step does work on subassemblies, but you have to have the subassembly selected so you\u0027re dragging it around when you click on the root tool.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
