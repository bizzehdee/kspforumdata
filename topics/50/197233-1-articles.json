I want to help new playere start a science mode playthrough and teach them the techniques and skills ive gained after years of ksp. This series teaches new players how to build their first rockets, their first aircraft. Their first flight to mun, and minmus orbit, their first space station and their first mun and minmus landing. I wanted to make sure that there was a fresh tutorial for ksp, as I know the steep learning curve required. In this series, I do my best to not use complicated terms, explain everything the best I can, and show you the simplest, while not always the best, ways of getting to your locations. Each lesson builds upon the last. And before you know it, you are a ksp master. Come check out the series, let me know how I did, and share it with other new players to help them get started in this amazing game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLNNo-0yak7HWb_tjRds3AxRE70uXh3Xdw\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
