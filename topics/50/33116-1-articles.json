These are the points where the two orbits intersect (regardless of different altitudes.) Click on the current vessel\u0027s trajectory line right where the \u0022DN\u0022 marker is. This will add a new maneuver node.

There will be new markers that indicate intersection points. Hover over those to see the projected closest approach distances. Notice that it will most likely be very far away. You can now modify the time of the maneuver node by dragging it around the current trajectory. To do that, grab the maneuver node by its little \u0022ring\u0022 and dragging it around. If you\u0027re lucky, a little bit of dragging should bring one of the intercepts down to as little as 5 km or even lower. It might also be possible that you have to wait for a few orbits to get a good start (use timewarp to do that.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you have a good maneuver node set up, execute it, then delete it.

Ideally the relative velocities between the vessels is zero. To do so, create a new maneuver node at the intersection point.

Notice that the navball should be displaying velocity relative to the target (it should read \u0022Target\u0022 at the top.) If it doesn\u0027t, click at the text until it does. What you will want to do is to bring your velocity relative to the target down to ideally zero.

What you will want to do is move the prograde marker onto the target marker on the navball. That means your vessel is moving right in the direction of the target and not just flying by.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trick is in how the prograde/retrograde markers react when you burn: The prograde marker (direction you\u0027re moving in) will always move to the current location on the navball when burn - you\u0027re \u0022dragging\u0022 it towards yourself by burning. The retrograde marker (direction you came from) on the other hand is always being pushed away from you when burning. So with this knowledge it is quite easy to move the prograde marker onto the target marker (while at the same time the same will happen with both vessel\u0027s opposite markers.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EApproach Speed\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this step, you\u0027re wanting to approach reasonably fast, but not so fast that you don\u0027t have time to react. I personally use a simple formula: Take the distance to the target, multiply it by 10, then use that value in m/s for the approach speed. For example, say you\u0027re 2 km away from the target: 2 times 10 is 20, so just use 20 m/s for your approach speed.
