You will only notice it in some circumstances. It also depends on what OS you are running to how much it actually affects the simulation time because each OS runs their graphical rendering a different way even though they use the same engine (with an exception to OS X, which I am not entirely sure if it has any option to use DX 9/10/11 etc). SO, although you may not notice it, 7/10 it is there but you just don\u0027t realise it. Now you are probably thinking, \u0022well if I don\u0027t realise it, why did you bring it up?\u0022. That\u0027s a good question. I brought it up because - because KSP now spends longer on each physics calculation a potential bottleneck may/will occur when more parts and ships are in the physics calculation range at once. Your 1000 part ship that your computer can reasonably handle using DX 11 (or whatever DX you use), your computer may not be able to handle OR there will be a physical decrease in speed whilst using OpenGL. Again, depends on the DX version you are benchmarking against if you are going to do this. Also depends on the OpenGL version you use to benchmark this AND the OS you are running. On some occasions also depends on your hardware.

Google search \u0022me\u0022. No, don\u0027t actually do that. I have done several benchmarks in the past on a variety of games benchmarking their performance with rendering as DX and OpenGL. I have done these benchmarks on KSP and whilst using OpenGL, CPU usage is increased and simulation time was about 1/3 more. As I said in my post, it all depends on your system. What hardware you have, what DX version you are running, what OpenGL version you are running, and what OS you have. There is a combination of the 4 that allows OpenGL rendering with no extra impact on simulation times, or physical lag, however I am yet to find this combination. Linux looks promising for it though, so far having only a 19% increase on simulation time while running OpenGL compared to the Windows benchmark which was a 37% increase in simulation time. Both DX versions were the same release, both OpenGL versions were the same release and both OSes were tested on the same hardware.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bilfr3d","CreatedById":75448,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-06T21:17:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E^^^^ The same KSP version was used and the same craft was used on both tests/benchmarks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Synthesis","CreatedById":26557,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-06T21:58:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FreeThinker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FreeThinker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat do you mean by half speed?

If OpenGL is not working for you (or you just don\u0027t like the way stuff looks with it), your best bet would be to use KSP 64 bit. But because of the highly instable 64x build on windows, I would not recommend using it on windows, but instead installing Linux as a dual boot with your windows system. The Linux 64x build is a lot more stable and with the 64x build, you can use more RAM hence load more mods. You could try using the windows 64x build, but be prepared for frequent crashes, bugs and errors. Until the windows 64x build is fixed (which is not a SQUAD problem btw, it is unity), the only USEABLE 64x build is on the Linux system.

Google search \u0022me\u0022. No, don\u0027t actually do that. I have done several benchmarks in the past on a variety of games benchmarking their performance with rendering as DX and OpenGL. I have done these benchmarks on KSP and whilst using OpenGL, CPU usage is increased and simulation time was about 1/3 more. As I said in my post, it all depends on your system. What hardware you have, what DX version you are running, what OpenGL version you are running, and what OS you have. There is a combination of the 4 that allows OpenGL rendering with no extra impact on simulation times, or physical lag, however I am yet to find this combination. Linux looks promising for it though, so far having only a 19% increase on simulation time while running OpenGL compared to the Windows benchmark which was a 37% increase in simulation time. Both DX versions were the same release, both OpenGL versions were the same release and both OSes were tested on the same hardware.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntresting.

To be perfectly honest, Linux is probably the best way to go if you want lots of mods. The x64 build on Linux is actually stable. The issue with Linux though is the drivers for graphics cards, which are not always as efficient as the Windows variants. Because Linux is open-source, I also believe that D3D is not available as a renderer on Linux. I am not completely sure about that, but it makes sense as OpenGL is open source, D3D is not, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
