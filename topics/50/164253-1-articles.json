It covers all the basics of Kerbal Space Program, for the absolute, complete beginner. In this guide, you will learn how to:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nInstall the game\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKnow what the various modes are\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNot screw things up\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nReady?

On top of that, if your computer has an administration password, you will need to know it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, open your preferred internet browser (e.g. Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer), and either just search for \u0027Kerbal Space Program\u0027, or go to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewww.kerbalspaceprogram.com\u003C/a\u003E. Once there, you will go to the KSP store, or just click on one of the many \u0027buy KSP\u0027 tabs scattered around the page. Then, as with all internet purchases, you will be advised to type in your credit card number, and everything else needed (e.g. email address). Then, just click \u0027buy\u0027. Kerbal Space Program is a digital game, meaning that you won\u0027t receive a hard-copy (an actual physical version). Your browser should start downloading the installer setup and some other files. Once they have been downloaded, pick an \u0027installation location\u0027 for them (where you want the main KSP folder to be). You will be directed by a \u0027installer/setup wizard\u0027 for the game. Simply follow along with the instructions, and the game will install. Then, once it\u0027s finished, just click on KSP.exe, and let your journey begin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart 2:\u00A0Loading, Creating Your First Game\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the game loads for the first time, or quite frankly, every time, you will see the \u0027SQUAD\u0027 monkey logo, and then a picture. Down below, will be a black and yellow bar. This shows the game files loading. For example, you would see \u0027gamedata/squad/parts/mk2/mk2pod\u0027 or something. This is a particular part that is loading. If you aren\u0027t interested in looking at all of that, look at the humorous\u00A0yellow text above the loading bar.\u00A0It\u0027s very entertaining! After the\u00A0loading bar has loaded (duh!) , the screen will go black, with a\u00A0\u0027loading\u0027 icon (planets going around a sun). Then, the main menu will appear, along with the glorious Kerbal Space Program theme.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://goo.gl/photos/LQZYtdodqZkEqkJz6\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://goo.gl/photos/LQZYtdodqZkEqkJz6\u003C/a\u003E (this is a different loading screen, but you even get a sandcastle every 40th time!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter clicking \u0027Start Game\u0027, you will have some options. \u0027Resume Game\u0027 gives you a list of your games (saves) already in progress, \u0027New Game\u0027 gives you the option to create a new game, and \u0027Go Back\u0027 is pretty self explanatory, delivering you to the previous menu. But we want \u0027New Game\u0027. Click on it, and you will be met with the options to rename it from \u0027default\u0027, pick the mode, pick the flag (the emblem that you will use), and to press \u0027Start\u0027. You can rename your game to anything you want, and choose a different flag, but you may be wondering about the different modes. \u0027Career\u0027 is where you start as a small space program, and use funds to build things. Complete \u0027Contracts\u0027 to earn \u0027Reputaton\u0027, which gives you better contracts, and more funds. It\u0027s a fun mode, but if you fail, then you lose funds and reputation. \u0027Science\u0027 is where you don\u0027t worry about \u0027Reputaton\u0027 and \u0027Funds\u0027 but only about \u0027Science\u0027. Use \u0027Science\u0027 collected on missions in the RnD (Research and Development) lab to purchase new things from the \u0027tech tree\u0027 (the thing that allows progression to new things to unlock). It\u0027s not as challenging as Career, but is still a bit difficult some times. And then, there\u0027s \u0027Sandbox\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0027Sandbox\u0027 is where everything\u0027s unlocked from the start, you have unlimited funds, and can do basically anything you want (even more, with mods). I\u0027m going to use that mode as my example. After clicking on a mode, and adjusting the settings (e.g. difficulty, re-entry temperature, reverting flights, respawning crews), click \u0027Start\u0027, and your off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the game loads from there, you will be met with a big open green space, with a large area of buildings in the middle. This is the Kerbal Space Center, or \u0027\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027 for short.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll the buildings serve different purposes, listed below:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe big, tall building in the middle, is the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, or Vehicle Assembly Building. This is where you build rockets, and launch from the Launchpad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe building next to the runway is the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, or SpacePlane Hangar. This is where you build planes, and take off/land at the runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sprawling complex at the bottom-right is Research and Development, or RnD, and is where you will use Science to get new parts in the \u0027Career\u0027 and \u0027Science\u0027 game modes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe big rotating communication dishes are the Tracking Facility, which shows all craft currently active, all debris (discarded rocket stages, bits that broke off, etc), and unknown objects (marked with a \u0027?\u0027, and are asteroids of varying sizes).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe area with the fountain and flag pole, with the crescent-shaped building is the Astronaut Complex, where you can hire new applicants to become astronauts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeside that is the Administration Building, where, in \u0027Career\u0027, you can select new \u0027strategies\u0027 (for example, earning more Science in exchange for less funds from missions), to help your space agency grow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a small building at the left side of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, which is Mission Control. Mission Control is where you can accept different contracts in the \u0027Career\u0027 game mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are some photos of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, taken while I was flying around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://goo.gl/photos/wcpJxGFZNfbSCL7c9\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://goo.gl/photos/wcpJxGFZNfbSCL7c9\u003C/a\u003E - A plane comes in to land at the Runway\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://goo.gl/photos/C2rSHgCyZ4d5oUGW9\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://goo.gl/photos/C2rSHgCyZ4d5oUGW9\u003C/a\u003E - A failed attempt at a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E landing on the roof of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E results in the craft getting stuck\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://goo.gl/photos/gFTZEoTxAYkYJgVh8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://goo.gl/photos/gFTZEoTxAYkYJgVh8\u003C/a\u003E - A commercial airliner, full of tourists, landing at the Runway.
