Don\u0027t know what I\u0027m talking about? Think about Hermes (from the Martian.) that\u0027s what I\u0027m talking about. I know from experience that these things can be hard to build, but never fear! Jeb knows all, so I\u0027ll let him explain it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhey everyone! Jeb here! I\u0027m going to teach you the basics of building an interplanetary transfer craft. I would include images of the craft I\u0027m about to describe, but my camera lens broke on the ascent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe craft I\u0027ve built(ordered from the catalog) as an example is a deadalus-class transfer habitat ship. It uses\u00A04 giant solar panels and is propelled by 16 ion engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwith ships like this, there are several things you should not do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDON\u0027T:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nuse the small docking ports, they\u0027ll make your ship less maneuverable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nuse huge fuel tanks or huge liquid fuel engines. For the love of God, use ion engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnote: nuclear engines are fine, but keep in mind that they don\u0027t gimbal at all and they\u0027re heavy as hell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nforget to have lots of antennae. At the very minimum, for going past the mun, you\u0027ll need one\u00A0main antenna and one backup antenna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDO:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUse large solar panels for going past the mun, or anywhere, really.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nuse radiator Systems, not panels, if you\u0027re going close to the sun (Moho or eve).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\npack extra fuel if you can, just in case. This goes for pretty much any spaceship ever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ninclude a maneuvering system to move the ship. Trust me, this one\u0027s a pain in the S.A.S.(literally) if you forget it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ninclude a science lab. It makes doing science on long trips so much easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe daedalus class has a couple of different crew cabin types, because kerbals, like humans, require new scenery and room to roam. It has a lab, a hitch-hiker module(recreational space), 3 cupolas, and four mk2 crew cabins attached radially. It\u0027s main command module is a mk1-2 command pod. It has 2 airlocks, two large and two small docking ports, and one Vehicular airlock (basically a sheltered docking port). I recommend all of these\u00A0for a ship like this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry to follow as many of these guidelines as possible, and in no time at all you\u0027ll have a fantastic interplanetary ship!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah Kerman, signing off!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-01T15:57:14Z\u0022 title=\u002203/01/2017 03:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 1, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by whitejj01\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
