If I\u0027m missing something, I hope others will add their knowledge below. I make no guarantee it will work for ALL previous saves; but this is how I managed to retrieve my own older vehicles, and I hope it will aid some of you to do the same as I wasn\u0027t able to find much information of how to do so, and had to work it out step by step myself!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003ESTEP 1: PREPARATION\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou will need the \u0022persistent.sfs\u0022 file from your old save. Make a copy of this somewhere, so you don\u0027t accidentally ruin it. We will be working from the copy only.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso make sure to make up your current save file somewhere safe, so you don\u0027t lose it.

You can re-open it later to see if your changes stick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRun the editor. Then click \u0022File\u0022 and select \u0022Open\u0022.\u00A0 Point it at the copy of your OLD \u0022persistent.sfs\u0022. This is where we shall be taking the data from. Then click \u0022File\u0022 and \u0022Open\u0022 again, and select the current saved game\u0027s \u0022 \u0022persistent.sfs\u0022 file. You should then have two tabs open, which looks a bit like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://s32.postimg.org/vqoef89s5/Tabs_Open.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Tabs_Open.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNotice I\u0027m retrieving a lot of vessels and kerbals from all the way back in version 0.20.2.\u00A0 And it works, I promise!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExpand the tab that says \u0022FLIGHTSTATE\u0022; most of what we need to get at is in there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight click the line that says \u0022UT = xxxx\u0022, then hold down SHIFT \u002B Right Click on the very last VESSEL in the list, and select \u0022Copy\u0022.\u00A0 You should have selected all your old ships, and a lot of Kerbals. Flags are classed as \u0022VESSEL\u0022s so these should be moved too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow swab to the new save tab, and delete the \u0022UT\u0022 line there. Then right click on the Flightstate line, and \u0022Paste\u0022 to add the old values in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are moving to an new saved state that has other vehicles active, right click on the \u0022activeVessel = x\u0022 in the new save, select \u0022Edit\u0022, and change the value from to (New \u002B Old). In my case I had none active in the new, so left \u0022activeVessel\u0022 as 8, the old value.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to take things slowly, move a single \u0022VESSEL\u0022 first that doesn\u0027t have a Kerbal in it, and is remotely controlled somehow; once done, in the editor still, make sure the New file tab is highlighted, then click \u0022File\u0022 and then \u0022Save\u0022. Point the editor back at the new save file and over-write it. You did back it up first though, yes? Now we can start KSP or load it from the title screen and see if our changes have stuck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://s32.postimg.org/zfbujxb9h/Save_As.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Save_As.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are two issues that can cause problems here. The first is that without the Universal Time matching the old save, KSP seemed to get confused as to where ships etc are supposed to be, as planets etc aren\u0027t where they should be. This I believe is what the UT line does, so I copied it across. If you have other ships active, and thus are trying to move to a save in a different time frame, this may prove an issue. Please let me know in comments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecondly ships with multiple crew and multiple sub-components (like space stations or two docked ships) loaded, but weren\u0027t able to be Flown from the Space Centre. There are two ways to fix that. The easy way, and the hard;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003ETHE EASY WAY:\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnder the editor, re-copy from the old file only the Kerbals listed, and paste them into the new \u0022ROSTER\u0022 line on the new save.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://s32.postimg.org/kki78mvd1/Crew_Copy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Crew_Copy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis meant they were duplicated in two places in the new save, but it didn\u0027t seem to cause any trouble so I just ignored it. You should now be able to fly your old craft with the old crew back aboard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003ETHE HARD WAY:\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe you don\u0027t want to try and retrieve the old crew, because it means you end up with duplicate Jebs all over the place. Or maybe the above hasn\u0027t worked for you for some reason?\u00A0 There is a way to re-generate a fresh crew in game though. And that is... simply fly back to it and get close enough that you can swap with the [ and ] keys between your two ships, and the missing crew will be replaced with new ones. My Munbase, abandoned for nearly 3 years, was visible on radar but couldn\u0027t be accessed at first, so I sent some brave Kerbals out to see if aliens had eaten them, or they\u0027d eaten all the snacks since I was last able to load them up and had starved to death; once within range, the lights spookily came back on and fresh faces could be seen peering out the windows...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/447358656219631917/BEDFB777E269789B65C496CC66993C2840E0A45A/\u0022 alt=\u0022BEDFB777E269789B65C496CC66993C2840E0A45A\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood job Sherbald Kerman was already bald, or all his hair may have fallen out due to shock! To avoid this issue in the future, I plan to have at least one automated control system aboard my space stations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003EMY SHIPS WONT LOAD!

They can be retrieved, but it requires much longer fiddling.\u00A0 Bear in mind the following condition must be met; The ship can\u0027t use the missing part as a connection between two other parts. If it does (say you have a seat stuck on top of that part) it just won\u0027t load if it\u0027s removed, as far as I can tell.\u00A0 Correct me in comments below if I\u0027m wrong! On the above space station, I had some old MapSat scanners mounted radially however, and I was able to fix these.

And when we try and open them in VAB it should warn us again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnder the \u0022FLIGHTSTATUS\u0022 lines in our New Save, find the VESSEL, in this case Munbase, and double click it.

However because the old file format might carry across, you may still get this error when you attempt to load in KSP:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://s32.postimg.org/sgrsihxs5/VAB_Edit.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VAB_Edit.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can \u0022Attempt To Load Anyway\u0022; the vehicle should appear in the background, and even though you get the error here a second time, just click \u0022Cancel\u0022. Now you just need to do one small edit, even just take apart and put back together the vehicle, and then re-save over the old version to correctly update it and use it from then on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it doesn\u0027t load a second time, and only one for me did not because I made a slight error editing the CRAFT file by hand earlier, you won\u0027t be able to load it in KSP at all, and it won\u0027t appear no matter how often you click Attempt To Load. The way around this is to create a blank CRAFT file in KSP, then using the editor, copy all the parts data etc back across from the old file, then re-open in KSP and see if you can save it that way.
