Linux 64bit is the only way to go if you want to play a heavily modded KSP. I could probably push this to 80 or 100 mods if I enabled ATM (I only have 8GB of ram, so I\u0027m getting close to my no-ATM limit). I can\u0027t tell ya how nice it is playing with all these mods with no texture compression and pretty parts. All my slowdowns, usually from 60 to 30 or 40fps, are related to my crap quad core CPU clocked at 2.5ghz and 100\u002B part ships. I\u0027d love a 4-5ghz AMD FX. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy system starts to slow on stock when I hit the 100 part mark. I\u0027ve OC\u0027d to 3Ghz and that really didn\u0027t help much, so it\u0027s down to needing a new system, because, let\u0027s face it, there really isn\u0027t a point at throwing money towards a Socket 775, DDR2 based system, or at least no more than the $150 I did for the motherboard and ram. It\u0027s still playable up to the 250-300 part range...but just barely (stock and modded)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Veelay","CreatedById":122147,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-30T16:36:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m running an integrated Intel chip (HD 4000), and OpenGL refuses to load on my machine.
