That\u0027s because capture burns typically put you into an eccentric orbit that gives you an phasing orbit with a long period to play with. \u00A0Assuming the relative-inclination adjustment is reasonably cheap, the Orbit Phasing can basically be as just efficient as a Hohmann Transfer when arriving at a body. \u00A0Regarding the choice between the two flavors of Orbit Phasing, if you can do the more efficient one, always do it. \u00A0The less efficient one (the one with the radial burn) is just easier for beginners to setup the tangent point. \u00A0There\u0027s really no advantage to it beyond that.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nParallel Orbit rendezvous is arguably the most simple from a conceptual standpoint. \u00A0Ships in higher orbits go slower. \u00A0Ships in lower orbits go faster. \u00A0If you get two orbits lined up inclination-wise, and have a tiny difference in altitude, very slowly drift near the other\u2026 eventually. \u00A0You can also think of this being technically equivalent\u00A0to a Hohmann Transfer with a very tiny\u00A0transfer-maneuver. \u00A0The major downside to this technique is that it\u0027s\u00A0painfully slow. \u00A0 We\u0027re talking a rendezvous that can take literally days. \u00A0So from a gameplay standpoint, I don\u0027t like this technique at all. \u00A0It\u0027s only redeeming quality is that it\u0027s really useful for docking very low-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E ships together. \u00A0For example,\u00A0docking with big, heavy, fully loaded fuel-tankers. \u00A0It\u0027s nice for for that scenario because the fuel tankers can\u0027t really spin the ship around 180-degrees easily to burn the main engine for steering the final approach, so small precise burns are nice in that situation. \u00A0If the difference between the initial orbits is small enough, final approach can be done via \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E-translation thrusters. \u00A0Also some trivia: \u00A0I totally made up the name of this technique. \u00A0As best as I could tell, this technique is not used in the real world and thus had no name. \u00A0So I made a name up. \u00A0If anybody does find documentation of this technique having a real-world name, feel free to tell me.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding launching guides, I doubt it\u0027s necessary to diagram, it\u0027s trivial enough to explain textually: \u00A0If your rendezvous target is in equatorial orbit, launch whenever you want to, it makes no difference. If your rendezvous target is in a significnatly inclined orbit you must\u00A0launch your ship directly into the inclination of the orbit of the rendezvous target. \u00A0You\u0027ll probably have to do a tiny inclination adjustment once in orbit, but hopefully not\u00A0much. It\u0027s made easier by (1) double-clicking Kerbin (or whatever body you are launching from) in map view so the camera centers on it instead of your ship and then (2) zooming out your camera enough to see the target-ship\u0027s orbit. \u00A0Then (3) while keeping the camera above the equator, orbit the camera around the planet\u00A0until the target\u0027s orbit appears to become a thin diagonal line. \u00A0In other words, you want the camera positioned exactly above\u00A0where the target\u0027s orbital plane slices into the equator\u0027s plane. \u00A0Then (4) wait for the body to rotate such that the launch-site lines up with the point the camera is facing. \u00A0Then you just tilt the rocket northward or southward upon launch by the right amount. \u00A0Kerbal Engineer lets you see your relative inclination, and keeping that number near zero helps you fine-tune the inclination as you launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-18T06:22:57Z\u0022 title=\u002209/18/2016 06:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 18, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Entropius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal101","CreatedById":157058,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-25T14:14:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis tutorial gave me a lot of inside info and put everything nicely together, when I was learning it back in days.

That\u0027s because capture burns typically put you into an eccentric orbit that gives you an phasing orbit with a long period to play with. \u00A0Assuming the relative-inclination adjustment is reasonably cheap, the Orbit Phasing can basically be as just efficient as a Hohmann Transfer when arriving at a body. \u00A0Regarding the choice between the two flavors of Orbit Phasing, if you can do the more efficient one, always do it. \u00A0The less efficient one (the one with the radial burn) is just easier for beginners to setup the tangent point. \u00A0There\u0027s really no advantage to it beyond that.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nParallel Orbit rendezvous is arguably the most simple from a conceptual standpoint. \u00A0Ships in higher orbits go slower. \u00A0Ships in lower orbits go faster. \u00A0If you get two orbits lined up inclination-wise, and have a tiny difference in altitude, very slowly drift near the other\u2026 eventually. \u00A0You can also think of this being technically equivalent\u00A0to a Hohmann Transfer with a very tiny\u00A0transfer-maneuver. \u00A0The major downside to this technique is that it\u0027s\u00A0painfully slow. \u00A0 We\u0027re talking a rendezvous that can take literally days. \u00A0So from a gameplay standpoint, I don\u0027t like this technique at all. \u00A0It\u0027s only redeeming quality is that it\u0027s really useful for docking very low-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E ships together. \u00A0For example,\u00A0docking with big, heavy, fully loaded fuel-tankers. \u00A0It\u0027s nice for for that scenario because the fuel tankers can\u0027t really spin the ship around 180-degrees easily to burn the main engine for steering the final approach, so small precise burns are nice in that situation. \u00A0If the difference between the initial orbits is small enough, final approach can be done via \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E-translation thrusters. \u00A0Also some trivia: \u00A0I totally made up the name of this technique. \u00A0As best as I could tell, this technique is not used in the real world and thus had no name. \u00A0So I made a name up. \u00A0If anybody does find documentation of this technique having a real-world name, feel free to tell me.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding launching guides, I doubt it\u0027s necessary to diagram, it\u0027s trivial enough to explain textually: \u00A0If your rendezvous target is in equatorial orbit, launch whenever you want to, it makes no difference. If your rendezvous target is in a significnatly inclined orbit you must\u00A0launch your ship directly into the inclination of the orbit of the rendezvous target. \u00A0You\u0027ll probably have to do a tiny inclination adjustment once in orbit, but hopefully not\u00A0much. It\u0027s made easier by (1) double-clicking Kerbin (or whatever body you are launching from) in map view so the camera centers on it instead of your ship and then (2) zooming out your camera enough to see the target-ship\u0027s orbit. \u00A0Then (3) while keeping the camera above the equator, orbit the camera around the planet\u00A0until the target\u0027s orbit appears to become a thin diagonal line. \u00A0In other words, you want the camera positioned exactly above\u00A0where the target\u0027s orbital plane slices into the equator\u0027s plane. \u00A0Then (4) wait for the body to rotate such that the launch-site lines up with the point the camera is facing. \u00A0Then you just tilt the rocket northward or southward upon launch by the right amount. \u00A0Kerbal Engineer lets you see your relative inclination, and keeping that number near zero helps you fine-tune the inclination as you launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the breakdown.\u00A0 One more thing I would add to your description of when to use parallel is that I sometimes find that I end up using it if the rendezvous target is orbiting so low that Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere prevents me from doing one of the other options, or if fuel is tight and I can\u0027t raise and lower orbits too much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kurld","CreatedById":79950,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-04T21:01:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been playing this game off and on for three years and never realized you could right-click the maneuver nodes to get \u002Borbit and -orbit.
