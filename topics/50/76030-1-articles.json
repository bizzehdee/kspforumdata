The graph is misleading to say that the SP-L 1x6 is more efficient than the others. Otherwise good job. Would be interesting to see how they perform at really low or really high orbits, closer than Moho or farther than Eeloo. You also probably don\u0027t have to include the moons as they are all the same as the planet they orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
