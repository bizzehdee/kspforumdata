Threads tended to have pictures and images of the Easter eggs themselves, but not necessarily the locations and surrounding areas. My brother and I worked together to make an exhaustive guide, and after many (many) hours of searching, I present to the KSP community an exhaustive guide to all locatable Easter eggs in .23. Also, if you find any major mistakes, such as missing an Easter egg, please let me know in an in-forum PM as I was primarily responsible for locating these and I could do a followup video. Almost all information needed to find them is in the video, and I\u0027ll probably work on a tips and tricks video on my spring break.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/WPhkiAbJhys?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeedback would be awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m kind of new to here so if I\u0027ve posted in the wrong forum please relocate it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheDataMiner","CreatedById":45648,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-17T04:29:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery usefull!
