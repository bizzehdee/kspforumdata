Inline cockpit is quite far back. \u00A0 The fly by wire unit has a pointy antenna thing on the nose, that moves the bow wave well forward of the cockpit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. large wing area means it stays high until it has lost a lot of speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. engine pre-cooler makes a good radiator. As do the jet nozzles on the rapier. these parts surround the cockpit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
