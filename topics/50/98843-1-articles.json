Manouver nodes assume instantaneous burns, so if your vessel has to do a substantially long burn to escape they become inaccurate. One of the techniques to minimize that effect is to split up the single big burn into a succession of smaller burns (sometimes called \u0022periapsis kicking\u0022), but that introduces its own problems:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n- The time taken completing the interim orbits makes it hard to hit the transfer window precisely.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n- Ejection angle changes as Kerbin revolves around the Sun, so your periapsis may not be where you want when you make the final burn.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nTo sidestep the above issues, I have applied Kepler\u0027s 2nd Law and the Vis-viva equation to precompute a simple series of small burns (300m/s or less) to complete before escape, applicable to any interplanetary transfer from Kerbin:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EInital Orbit: 100km circular.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EBurn 1: Raise apoapsis to 658km, costing 300m/s of \u0394V.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBurn 2: At next periapsis, raise apoapsis to 2,250km, costing 300m/s.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBurn 3: At next periapsis, raise apoapsis to 31,930km, costing 298m/s.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBurn 4: At next periapsis, burn to transfer, costing 20m/s plus the remainder of the transfer burn.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETo hit the transfer window correctly, schedule the first burn for as close to \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#0000FF;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E11 Kerbin days (66 hours)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E before the ideal transfer time as possible.
