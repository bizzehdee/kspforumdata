However, KSP 1.0 has changed the way parachutes work, turning the water into a promising solution for landing large, topheavy rockets that would have trouble staying upright on land (even on the mildest of slopes).  \n\nWater has two major advantages:  \n\n- It\u0027s always flat. No mountainsides here.  \n\n- When something lands in water, the bottom parts don\u0027t suddenly have to carry the weight of the rest of the rocket and run the risk of snapping off - to a degree. In KSP 1.0.5, small parts can still break off if they find themselves beneath something heavy. Struts are a lifesaver in these situations.  \n\nThere\u0027s also one caveat: water does NOT ignore collision tolerances, and that includes any part that touches it. Even if the rocket as a whole is stationary, if it rotates fast enough that one end hits the water at a higher speed than the collision tolerances of those parts, they will crash and explode. Therefore rockets that are meant to land in water must include enough parachutes, or reverse thrust, to slow down to below the lowest collision tolerance of any part on the craft - for most parts this is 6 m/s. If you\u0027re not sure you have enough parachutes, feel free to spam them for the first few launches.  \n  \n**Step 2: Find your rocket\u0027s \u0022centers\u0022**  \n\nIn the editor, as you most likely well know, you can display three important \u0022centers\u0022 for your craft: the center of mass, center of thrust, and center of lift. We\u0027re not concerned with the center of thrust in this tutorial, but the other two are relevant.  \n\nThe center of mass is fairly self-explanatory. As your rocket comes in to land and experiences the various aerodynamic forces, it will pivot more or less around this point. When you land, the rocket will rotate around the point of contact based on the distance between the center of mass and the ground, so if this point is high up, the rocket will be \u0022topheavy\u0022 and tip more easily than if this point is near the bottom (yes, this does seem painfully simple, but it mustn\u0027t be forgotten).  \n\nThe center of lift isn\u0027t *really* relevant here, but what is relevant is the \u0022center of drag,\u0022 which tends to follow the center of lift, particularly at low speeds (as you will hopefully be going when trying to land). When you\u0027re going up, this should of course in most cases be behind the center of mass, and consequently if your rocket made it to space then you\u0027ll find the center of lift is accordingly low on the rocket. This is important because if your rocket \u0022magically\u0022 slowed down sans parachutes, it would naturally point \u0022forward\u0022 and thus down, hitting the surface nose-first. Generally we don\u0027t want that when landing, because when the other end hits it will carry with it the engines and winglets, which are heavy and fragile respectively and thus likely to be damaged on impact (particularly if we miss the water and end up on land).  \n\nA third \u0022center\u0022 that will be involved here is the \u0022center of parachutes\u0022 (shown below in green). I doubt this is a real physics term, but hey, I\u0027m not a physicist and this is what I\u0027ve discovered. This point is not visible in the editor, but it represents the average point at which the drag force from the parachutes is applied, based on their locations, sizes, and state (inactive, partially open, or open). This point may well be the most important one in this tutorial, because it determines which way your rocket will be pointing when it touches down.  \n[![9BIPl28m.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/9BIPl28m.jpg)](http://imgur.com/9BIPl28)  \n\n(In case they\u0027re hard to see, note that there are four radial parachutes mounted at the top.)  \n\nIn order for the strategy later in this tutorial to work, most of your parachutes should be clustered around the center of mass so that the \u0022center of parachutes\u0022, i.e. their average position, is roughly on the center of mass. More precisely, the main group of parachutes should be centered just a smidgen *behind* the center of mass so that the rocket has a small amount of torque tilting it nose-down. Not to worry, this will be countered in the next step. If your rocket has winglets, they will, as discussed earlier, cause it to tilt, so the \u0022center of parachutes\u0022 may need to be moved a bit further forward to compensate.  \n  \n**Step 3: Asymmetrical parachutes**  \n\nHere\u0027s where it gets interesting. Most likely you found that the centers of mass, drag, and parachutes were all near the back end of the rocket, since the back contains both the engines and the winglets whereas the front is just empty fuel tanks. On the opposite end of the rocket, add just a few parachutes in pairs *without using symmetry*, but arranged into symmetrical pairs (the Offset gizmo is useful for this). They will look symmetrical, and behave in a balanced fashion when undeployed, but by being placed singly they can be tweaked differently on different sides of the ship.  \n[![u4oD3fAm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/u4oD3fAm.jpg)](http://imgur.com/u4oD3fA)  \n\nLeave the parachute(s) on one side set to open along with the main group, and tweak the other(s) to open at 50 m. Generally I\u0027d suggest also setting these to deploy early and setting the rest to deploy later, e.g. at 0.5 atm, so that you don\u0027t have to wait around for 20 minutes while your ship slowboats down from 20 km.  \n\nWhen the rocket reaches 500 m (or whatever altitude you picked), the main group of parachutes and the asymmetrical parachute(s) on one side will open, while the asymmetrical parachute(s) on the other side will remain partially open. This will cause the \u0022center of parachutes\u0022 to be skewed to one side of the rocket, causing it to tilt away from vertical (nose-up or nose-down) and possibly even assume a horizontal position. It should remain tilted in this fashion until the last minute when the second group of parachutes opens. When it does, the \u0022center of parachutes\u0022 will return to the center of the rocket, but since this occurs at a mere 50 m, there won\u0027t be enough time for the rocket to return all the way to vertical before landing. If everything goes well, the rocket will touch down at a significant angle, causing the main group of parachutes (or most of them at least) to despawn, but the asymmetrical group at the top end to remain open, guiding the top pieces down to a gentle repose and looking something like this:  \n[![lShz0eKm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/lShz0eKm.jpg)](http://imgur.com/lShz0eK)  \n\nLying on its side, the rocket won\u0027t have to use its SAS to remain stable and will remain still until it is recovered at your leisure.  \n  \n**Step 4: Adjust and run tests**  \n\nOh no~! You followed all my steps to the letter and the rocket flipped all kinds of crazy ways and exploded! Or perhaps it turned fully vertical before landing, then tipped over and crashed. No worries, I saw this coming. Go ahead and revert to Vehicle Assembly. Most likely one of the following situations occurred:  \n\nThe rocket nose-dived, then landed on its delicate little fins and/or the engines smacked into the water or land too hard:  \n[![wPdyPLXm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/wPdyPLXm.jpg)](http://imgur.com/wPdyPLX)  \n\nThis means that the true center of drag, i.e. the combination of drag from various parts, winglets, and parachutes, was just a bit behind the center of mass, so when the first group of parachutes opened, it assumed a tilted orientation with the nose pointing down, causing the nose to touch down first.  \n\nImagine the center of mass as the fulcrum of a lever. On the short end is the main group of parachutes, and on the long end is the smaller asymmetrical group with half open and half partially open. If the nose points down, it means that the asymmetrical group is too \u0022weak\u0022 and doesn\u0027t have enough leverage to turn the rocket nose-up. It should either be moved farther toward the front of the rocket, or if this is not possible, the main group should be moved a slight distance farther forward to give it a shorter lever on which to work and thus less leverage. Remember that the effects of any winglets may have given the main group a helping hand in pointing the rocket down, so the main group may have to be centered right on the center of mass or even possibly a short distance in front of it.  \n\nThe rocket went completely vertical with the nose pointing down:  \n[![W49Jf9em.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/W49Jf9em.jpg)](http://imgur.com/W49Jf9e)  \n\nThis means that the center of drag with the main group of parachutes open was too far behind the center of mass, and the first half of the asymmetrical group did not have enough leverage to tip the rocket more than a few degrees. Thus when the second group opened, those parachutes found themselves on the opposite side of the central axis of the rocket, as illustrated here. Consequently, when they opened, they turned the rocket back toward a nose-down orientation (instead of a nose-up orientation as intended).  \n\nThe solution is to move the main group of parachutes forward, most likely closer to the center of mass. This will make the torque they generate smaller, allowing the smaller group of asymmetrical parachutes more control over the rocket, so that when the first half open, they will tilt the rocket far enough that the second half open on the same side of the center of mass. If this occurs properly, they will try to rotate the rocket toward a nose-up orientation *through* a horizontal orientation, which will leave it greatly tilted on impact and allow a gentle sideways landing.  \n\nThe rocket went completely vertical with the nose pointing up, landed, then tipped over:  \n[![zJh0Oprm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/zJh0Oprm.jpg)](http://imgur.com/zJh0Opr)  \n\nThis means either that the asymmetrical group of parachutes is too powerful (perhaps there are too many in this group, or it is too far forward) or that the main group of parachutes is too far forward and thus pulls the rocket into a nose-up orientation before the second group opens.  \n\nTo solve this, try moving the main group of parachutes back a small amount. If that doesn\u0027t work, and there is more than one pair of asymmetrical parachutes, try reducing the number of asymmetrical parachutes and increasing the number of parachutes in the main group. It\u0027s okay if the parachutes seem to be clumped around the bottom end of the rocket instead of the top as seems more intuitive - remember that despite what its shape suggests, the rocket\u0027s center of mass is probably very close to the back end.  \n\nI strongly advise performing several test launches, e.g. with an almost-empty rocket just hopping off to the ocean east of KSC, and adjusting the parachutes\u0027 positions a little at a time until everything works properly. I myself did about 50 test launches trying to figure all this out, so while you hopefully won\u0027t have to do anywhere near that many, it\u0027s entirely possible you\u0027ll need five or six tries to get everything balanced right.  \n  \n~~Demonstration craft file: **[Download](http://Download)**~~ - Broken in KSP 1.0.5.
