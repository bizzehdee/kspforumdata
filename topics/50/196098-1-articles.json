Discussion is welcome, I will gladly fix anything\u00A0people can find that is off the mark.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese tables are to be used in combination with DeltaV maps to help you plan out your missions. The upper left table shows the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E to get from a moon of a planet to a target planet by dropping from the moon to its parent, and then ejecting with the help of the Oberth effect. For example, it would take a total of 270 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E to burn from low Minmus orbit into a low pass of Kerbin and another burn to an Eve flyby. Or, conversely, it would take 270 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E to come from Eve, decelerate at Kerbin periapsis, and circularize around Minmus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe table below it shows the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E to get from a moon of a planet to a target planet without a burn to a low pass. For example, it would take 980 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E to eject directly from Vall to a Kerbin encounter. This one works in reverse as well, in that it would take 980 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E to insert at Vall coming from Kerbin. Below this chart there is a list of the cases in which it is beneficial to use the Oberth effect.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe upper right table shows the altitude at which it takes the least DeltaV to eject from one planet to another, or one Jool moon to another. There is always a sweet spot between getting the benefits of the Oberth effect and the extra DeltaV it takes to climb out of a gravity well. From Kerbin, a 360km orbit takes the least DeltaV to eject to Jool, so that may be a good spot to assemble or refuel your ship. It will take more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E to get to 360km from a low orbit, though, so this altitude only minimizes the transfer \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E. Like the other charts though, it works in reverse as well, so if you want to set up a comms satellite in a circular Eve orbit, the altitude at which the injection is the least is 30600km.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(For this chart, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E means the optimal altitude is as high as possible inside the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, and 0 means the optimal altitude is as low as possible)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Jool moon transfer table functions as a DeltaV map for the Jool system. For example, it would take 265 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E to eject from low Vall orbit to flyby Laythe. It also works in reverse, so a trip from low Vall orbit to low Laythe orbit and back without aerobraking would cost 265\u002B600\u002B600\u002B265 DeltaV. \u00A0Below this chart, the sum of all the rows and columns for each body are listed. Bop would be the best place\u00A0for a Jool refueling station because it takes the least total DeltaV to visit every other body one at a time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nCombining these charts can provide a lot of insight into your mission planning. Most people agree that the best place to refuel before an interplanetary mission is Minmus, and the charts agree with that. However, the optimal transfer altitude to Eve is very close to the orbit of the Mun. Refueling and transferring from the Mun is only 80 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E more, and it may pay for itself with easier timing and less inclination changes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother common misconception is that Pol is the best moon to refuel on in the Jool system. However, Bop requires much less DeltaV to transfer to and from the other moons in the system, and requires less DeltaV to go to and from Kerbin because of its higher orbital speed. Even Vall may be a better refueling stop than Pol; Laythe, Tylo, and Kerbin can all be more easily reached from Vall than from Pol\u0027s high and inclined orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, many people use the Oberth effect of the parent planet when ejecting from a moon back to Kerbin. There is only one case in the game when it is obviously beneficial: when it is possible to exit Gilly at its apoapsis, swing all the way down to Eve, and eject to Kerbin. Oftentimes Gilly\u0027s orbit does not make this possible, but when it is, you can save over 100 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nDisclaimers: most of the numbers were calculated, not taken from gameplay, and may not factor in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E boundaries or other gameplay quirks. They do not factor in eccentricity or inclination, or the altitude of your starting or destination orbits. They are rounded for a reason. I took them from the sources below and edited a few places where there were obvious faults.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSauce:\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/116160-best-place-for-an-interplanetary-launch-facility/#comment-2070116\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/116160-best-place-for-an-interplanetary-launch-facility/#comment-2070116\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/33699-efficient-hohmann-transfer-altitudes/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/33699-efficient-hohmann-transfer-altitudes/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James M","CreatedById":167171,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-06T07:18:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGonna have to try using this later\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022^_^\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_happy.png\u0022 title=\u0022^_^\u0022\u003E\u00A0Thank you!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
