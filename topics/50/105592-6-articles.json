My first Mun landing in 1.x, and as soon as Bob disembarked, the game decided to see how much power can my CPU use. Pretty much halted my whole computer. However, it DID NOT CRASH. After a while, it proceeded almost normally, then struck again. I tested with x32 version, and there was no such issues. \n\nHowever, a note: In this particular save game, there has been a lot of mods added and removed during play, so it doesn\u0027t have to be an x64 thing, but it DID stop when I returned to x32. \n\nSo, I guess it\u0027s worth mentioning."}]}
