You know the giant engine for the 2.5 parts. Well, do you miss the old texture? You can bring the old texture without mods or going back to old versions. This is possible to do on console fo console players. \u00A0First go into the Space Plane Hanger or the Vehicle\u00A0Assembly Building. Then look through the pre-made crafts. Scroll down or up in both tabs until you find a picture of a craft with the old Mainsail texture. The craft in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E should have the old Mainsail Texture (unless Squad fixed that already).
