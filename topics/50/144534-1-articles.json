I\u0027ve already gotten\u00A0into orbit and set up all the maneuver nodes I need to to align myself with the other ship. Right now, my only issue is the interception. I\u0027ve been told I can delay the maneuver nodes in order to get the interception nodes close together, but every time I delay the first maneuver mode, it messes up every other node and I don\u0027t understand why that\u0027s happening. Could someone please explain how delaying these nodes works?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-03T15:53:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, the parameters nodes store are node time (not locatiion!) and amount of prograde, normal and radial burn. Whatever these mean at the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you change the first node, your planned trajectory changes. The other nodes retain their time (but the location at that time will be quite different!) and their burn amounts (but at the new location, normal, radial and prograde will be entirely different directions!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, it makes no sense to prepare more than 2 nodes ahead. You can use more for planning, but after the first burn they will be entirely useless. And even the one ahead will require adjustments. Say, you plan your Kerbin departure and Minmus capture nodes - the Minmus capture at the periapsis of the flyby. An error of 0.1m/s, or of 1s of leaving Kerbin orbit (even resulting from the fact your burn is not instanteous!) will change arrival time by hours. As result, your arrival node will move by hours from periapsis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, first, for rendezvous: how many nodes do you need? If you\u0027re skilled, one. If not so much, two - plane matching and encounter. Encounter will be probably many hours past plane matching and the error of your burn will accumulate so much there is absolutely no point to plan it before the plane change burn. Just perform each phase of the operation before preparing the next, instead of trying to squeeze all the planning into the beginning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re making more nodes than that, you\u0027re doing something definitely wrong. (Sometimes, I create an extra \u0022orbit-matching node\u0022 at the rendezvous point, visually matching my new orbit with the target, but its role is definitely \u0022advisory\u0022, the final phase of the rendezvous must be improvised using instruments and visual cues, it can\u0027t be done with nodes and planned burns.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StahnAileron","CreatedById":139783,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-03T16:20:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReally, you shouldn\u0027t rely on multiple nodes in one fell swoop. Set one, execute, set next, execute, ad infinum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe time between node executions is usually long enough that you have plenty of time to set and adjust a new node long before you need to execute it. KSP itself, players, and even autopilots are not precise enough to be able to execute each node exactly as planned.\u00A0I\u0027ve used multiple nodes for rough planning (making sure I get encounters, around WHEN I need to due the burn, how much delta-V I might be using, etc.), but I only\u00A0execute\u00A0one node at a time, even with an auto-pilot like MechJeb.
