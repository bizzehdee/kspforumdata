There are loads of excellent tutorials and guides telling you how to match orbits and approach your target. Once I had master those skills, I was a little disappointed that those final 100 or so metres could become a frustrating dance around my first orbital refueling station. So much so that my fuel tug that services the station has been fitted with a Claw so it can clamp on any where But, after some trial and much error, here\u0027s my tip for those last 100m or so\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Design. When designing a craft for docking in the VAB, detach any lower stages and turn on the \u0022Centre of Mass\u0022 indicator (one of 3 buttons to the lower left of your screen). You want to place your RCS thrusters at an equal distance fore and aft of that CoM. You want to be able to move your ship up/down \u0026amp; left/right without its attitude changing (ie nose stays pointing in the same direction and no \u0022wiggle\u0022 after firing your thrusters). Two sets of 4 thrusters makes life easier when it\u0027s time to dock. I use an extended ladder as a rough \u0022tape measure\u0022, placing it on the CoM, counting how many rungs down one set of RCS thrusters are. Then I detached, rotate and reattach the ladder and count the same number of rungs for the matching set.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. NAV ball. When you are close to your target (~100m), reduce all movement relative to your target to 0.0 m/s. This can be tricky, but the NAV ball can help. Apply about 0.2 m/s forward thrust and you\u0027ll see the yellow prograde indicator appear. If it\u0027s not right in the middle of the NAV ball, you have some additional motion. Using short taps on the thruster buttons (default H = forward N = backwards K = up I = down J = left and L = right) tweak the prograde indicator until its centred. Then press N to slow down and you should come to a complete stop relative to the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Precision. It\u0027s much better to make adjustments in one plane at a time to begin with. With your thrusters placed evenly, you can drift one way and stop again with ease. If you do find you still have residual movement, repeat 2 above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Line up. Set the docking port you are aiming from as your target and \u0022Control from Here\u0022 on the active ships docking port. Once you\u0027re about 50m away, stop then turn off your RCS and use the WASD keys to align your ship perpendicular to the target docking port. The reason for turning purely with torque wheels is that, although slower, it doesn\u0027t change your velocity. Now you can reinitialize the RCS and line up the target indicator with the centre of the NAV ball. Thrust forward again and cancel out any unwanted motion in either of the other two planes using 2 above. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Move in. Once you feel comfortably lined up, click on the target indicator next to the NAV ball to lock on to your intended docking port and again remove any residual movement by using your thrusters to line up the prograde marker. Reduce forward velocity to 0.1 m/s, turn off your SAS and RCS and wait for contact\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Finally. Remember you can use \u0022time warp\u0022. It\u0027s better to execute your final manoeuvres at a few 10ths of a metre per second and speed up time, than try and rush things by moving faster. Just be careful which key your finger is hovering over. Repeatedly pressing \u0022\u0026gt;\u0022 in panic, instead of \u0022\u0026lt;\u0022 can completely ruin your encounter!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-17T14:31:40Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2015 02:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Clipperride\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EYou always spot simple errors after posting\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clear Air Turbulence","CreatedById":149987,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T05:38:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is very useful advice.

For RCS placement, there are mods to show you where the dry COM and wet COM are (eg RCS build aid). If you don\u0027t want to use a mod, then you have to manually add/remove fuel and try to find the best spot. On a small ship, I\u0027d probably put 4 or 6 rcs ports as close to the COM (if it shifts a lot after burning fuel, it\u0027s pretty tricky) as possible, and use pod/core torque for rotation. Anything bigger than a few tonnes, you need a lot more rcs to have the responsiveness though, so as it says above at least 2 sets at an equal distance above and below COM (when building in the VAB).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clipperride","CreatedById":149816,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-10T09:17:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for the feedback, Im glad you found it useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t use Mods and so, in the VAB, I manually tweak the amount of propellant in the stage that docks to see how the CoM changes (right clicking on the tank allows you to change the fuel / oxidiser levels.).
