The nose is overkill and that nets you a little d/v.\u00A0 Brings the ship in at 29,060 roots (in hard). A single extra tank on each of the early dropped asparagus setups brings you to 7,618 d/v.\u00A0 You can easily intercept and orbit Eeloo with that, though you won\u0027t land there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, I realize you\u0027re bringing a ton of science along, but for an early Mun Landing, a single upgrade to the pad is all you need for a consistent flyer that\u0027s cheap:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00229xQQQYD.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/9xQQQYD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n30 tons, 30 parts.\u00A0 Thumper SRBs give you a lot of bang for little part count in the early stages of career.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat ship runs a T30 on the tail after the BACC\u0027s run out, finishes orbital insertion on the Terrier, which also handles the Mun injection burn, Mun orbital burn, and most of the braking burn.\u00A0 The spark on the tail is what you land with and come home on.\u00A0 Aero at 42k to keep from detonating during insertion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, if you want to bring your science along, you\u0027ll absolutely have to beef up your available part count, but can still be done on the cheap:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022FrvQw5o.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/FrvQw5o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1 more\u00A0Thumper and a spare FL-T100 on the lander is all the modifications that needs when adding in the heat shield, cargo bay, 200 battery, goo/therm/pressure.\u00A0 38 tons, 41 parts, 18k in roots.\u00A0 Cash is important in early career, so I absolutely recommend SRBs once you get the Thumpers.\u00A0 The Trashcans are meh, they\u0027re fine for very early orbiting but aren\u0027t really needed.\u00A0 At 850/Thumper, they\u0027re cheaper than just the engine of a T30 (1,100) or a T-45(1,200), nevermind the fuel, and have more ASL \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E than any of the other engines you have available at that moment, so you don\u0027t have to start throwing engines at it to lift more engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre these designs still valid?\u00A0 I\u0027m trying to build your bottom one and the stats just don\u0027t work out.\u00A0 I can\u0027t get into orbit, get to Mun, Land, take off and get back with that little bit of engine.\u00A0 I do have a bit more weight up top and I\u0027m not leaving the science jr. at home because I need to recover all the science.\u00A0 But even if I switch to 4 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s it\u0027s not enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-04T18:31:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223629485\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022151932\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221562263820\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002289401\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jpinard\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 minutes ago, jpinard said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre these designs still valid?\u00A0 I\u0027m trying to build your bottom one and the stats just don\u0027t work out.\u00A0 I can\u0027t get into orbit, get to Mun, Land, take off and get back with that little bit of engine.\u00A0 I do have a bit more weight up top and I\u0027m not leaving the science jr. at home because I need to recover all the science.\u00A0 But even if I switch to 4 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s it\u0027s not enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027d prolly have more success starting your own thread asking for help with early Mun lander designs than poking around in 3 year old threads.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bootsam","CreatedById":198563,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-21T11:21:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy fist Munar was pretty much the above.
