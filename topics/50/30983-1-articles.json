It shouldn\u0027t be too far ahead of the mass center or the craft will nose up, then dive and crash. Too far back and you simply won\u0027t take off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Landing gear placement. It needs to be very sturdy, including what it is based on, some things just won\u0027t hold it. Should usually be placed so that the wings would have at least 3 grades angle pointing upwards, 5 is best. Also there\u0027s the problem of anything behind the rear landing gear clipping the terrain and exploding. So place them as far back as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPossible issues:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=Can\u0027t compensate for the nose up momentum, goes into a loop and crashes: \u002BCoL too far ahead of CoM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=Can\u0027t take off at all(could be any of the following): \u002BCoL too far back of CoM \u002BWings are at less than 3 degree angle \u002BNot enough lift\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=Rear end clips terrain: \u002BLanding gear placed incorrectly And possibly \u002BToo much nose up effort, ease up on the controls\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPreferable:configure the craft to take off of the runway, not halfway to the ocean. it is a good idea to do so and will sometimes make landing that contraption much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2:\u003C/strong\u003E The smoothest part of the flight where if you could take off less things can go wrong with good piloting. Then again:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Control surface placement. Control surfaces will apply torque. Torque depends on distance from the CoM. Place control surfaces as far away from CoM as possible for best effect(along the craft, not to the side, unless you want to do barrel rolls like crazy). Don\u0027t overdo the amount of control surfaces or the craft will twitch badly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPossible issues:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=Veering off to the left/right without an ability to compensate: \u002BTail fins! lots of them. possibly delta wings as tail fins. and don\u0027t forget control surfaces\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=Twitching wildly, comes in two flavors: \u002BToo much control surfaces, the smallest push results in a huge torque \u002BIf the whole structure is shaking you need more struts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=Falling into a roll/loop without an ability to stabilize: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither: \u002BYou are a horrible pilot\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr \u002BCoL too far from CoM, which if engines are active and aligned with CoM produces a nasty loop after engine thrust is changed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso: \u002BToo many high drag parts in the front, move them behind CoM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you took off without going into a loop the only other possible explanation would be \u002BFuel tanks too far away from CoM and drained unevenly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd sometimes: \u002BPlaced high lift control surfaces on the wingtips like a fool. Never place anything that far sideways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=Rolling when trying to turn: \u002BOnly one tail fin with a control surface high up will do that to you, place at least 2, close to CoM vertically and as far away from it on the horizontal plane as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPreferable: balance the CoL and the fuel tanks with CoM so that no nose up/down moment would be produced and an ASAS could handle this part of the flight without too much control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3:\u003C/strong\u003E Worst part of the flight, with increasing speed producing huge amounts of lift and drag, air density dropping and jet engines about to stop working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-MOAR air intakes, you need as many as you can get. ram air intakes work well, radial for some reason didn\u0027t do so well for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-MOAR control surfaces. If it does not lead you into at least a small twitch at lower altitudes, it is not good enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Finer CoL-CoM balancing, you will really need all the stability you can get\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-It is important to understand that for most configurations at these speeds the nose-up/nose-down you are experiencing if trying to maintain heading close to prograde is not due to torque from balancing CoL, but probably from drag which is applied rather mysteriously to the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Balancing Center of Drag, there is no indicator as to where it is, but it is sufficient to place high drag parts behind the CoM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Higher altitude allows for more velocity, reaching 1500 m/s on jet engines alone is possible at heights above 20 000 provided enough air intakes to keep engines active.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPossible issues:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=Nose-up/nose-down without an ability to compensate after switching engines/adjusting jet engine thrust/changing heading angle: \u002BNot enough control surfaces, you need more at these altitudes Or \u002BMisaligned engines, you will need them in line with CoM to get to space anyway so keep that in mind Or \u002BWeird drag moment, you need to balance the high drag parts i.e. air intakes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=Jet engines don\u0027t have enough air: \u002BAir intakes. you need them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=Not enough speed gain, getting to 30 000m at 500-800m/s speeds: Either: \u002BNot enough engine thrust Or \u002BToo much lift. Yes, with too much lift you will actually lose horizontal speed in favor of vertical component. Can be circumvented by decreasing engine thrust or maintaining a very small angle to prograde provided your Drag center is behind CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPreferable: at least 1200 m/s before switching off jet engines, it will make reaching orbit easier. and a decent vertical speed as room for error in the likely case of losing control while switching engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E4\u003C/strong\u003E Finally, with the worst behind all that\u0027s left is to gain height and speed to reach orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Air drag becomes minimal at about 40 000, at this point RCS becomes a valid control mechanism. Any use of RCS below 40 000 is a waste, if you can\u0027t control your craft without it below that point - go back to the drawing board, invest in control surfaces, do something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Consider rocket engine thrust to weight ratio as well as efficiency. Aerospikes are efficient but heavy and will usually not lift you up fast enough, so other engines as an additional boost may be needed. Mainsail is a beast and can push most freighters, even the Skipper can manage this with a little worse power to weight ratio but still lighter than 4 aerospikes, for smaller craft consider Rockomax 24-77 as boosters, as highly inefficient they may be, the gain in altitude and saved time makes up for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPossible issues:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=CoM not aligned with CoT, a nasty surprise to get when you got all that way up to space: \u002BJust... don\u0027t forget this during construction\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=RCS balancing: \u002BAdjust for empty fuel tanks during construction, better yet - position fuel tanks close to the CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPreferable: Efficient engines for gaining speed when above 50 000m when there is enough room for slow burn and good booster engines to make that room and push past the nasty 30 000-40 000 barrier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBonus: Landing\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Again, balancing Drag. Put the air intakes in the back and you\u0027ll be fine. Don\u0027t forget to open them during reentry and you\u0027ll be safe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpd: added info on Drag balancing, that\u0027s the last part I needed for a perfectly functional craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpd: added some info on control surface balancing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpd: added miscellanious info\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this wall of text will be helpful to somebody.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll these horrible things happened to me and keep happening to me on a regular basis, none of the characters and events in this post are fiction and should resemble real issues anyone can come across.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of this post was written during KSP 0.20, but contains general physics that will probably be useful for years to come unless the space kraken invade Kerbin and all our base will belong to them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo kerbals were harmed during the production of this craft.

The lift position seems like it really only matters with takeoff. Many of my heavy designs use the end of the runway to get their Angle of attack needed for liftoff. The main reason for this appears to be at way that wings cause lift, which doesn\u0027t seem to work like it should. Also, as CoM will change from fuel burn, it makes it impossible to balance over the course of a flight without variable geometry wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUntil wing lift works a bit more like you would expect, space planes are really just horizontal rockets that glide...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jod","CreatedById":68384,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-08T06:35:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nodrak\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nodrak\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eas CoM will change from fuel burn, it makes it impossible to balance over the course of a flight without variable geometry wings.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrue, I have problems with that during reentry, but there are workarounds for that.
