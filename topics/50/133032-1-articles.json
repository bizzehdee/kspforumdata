Just look at these screenshots:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SYbSmXY.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SYbSmXY.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst you make an album by just uploading it to something like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EImgur.com\u003C/a\u003E. This will not work with\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s5.photobucket.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPhotoBucket\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext, look closely at the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EALBUM\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0URL. Not those of the individual images, but the top at the album itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HlsNPPS.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HlsNPPS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake the last 5 letters. In this case it\u0027s imgur.com/a/\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FFA500;\u0022\u003EZRBfX\u003C/span\u003E. Copy these 5 letters*.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext, when editing a topic, look up at the editing toolbar. You know, the one with the Font option? Look to the far right. You see that little \u0022I\u0022 in a box with a green dot? Click that. You should get a thing like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/v5Z1Sgs.png\u0022 alt=\u0022v5Z1Sgs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt does not start with the 5 letters in it. You need to paste them from your clipboard. You can even just press CRTL\u002BV (Option\u002BV for mac) and it\u0027s there!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPress OK. You\u0027ll be amazed at what happens!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yCc1Ahv.png\u0022 alt=\u0022yCc1Ahv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLook at that! Now when someone passes your thread you don\u0027t need 800 images all loading together, dropping processing power to less than minimum! It DOES keep your computer from dying, and mine from grinding its CPU to dust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease use this for any albums more than 5 images. It\u00A0saves everyone a lot of hassle. Also, a \u003Cstrong\u003Etip for taking good pictures\u003C/strong\u003E: Don\u0027t take 6 of one instance. Only take them at key moments. Orbit, transfer, Mun SOI, descent, landing. One each! I don\u0027t need 56,948 pictures in a stop-motion film about how you can\u0027t not press that F1 key! Don\u0027t say \u0022Oh but it looked so nice and here\u0027s jeb and here he is again and here\u0027s jeb with val and\u0022 because most people here have seen the same images themselves, and anything more than 2 is too much. Keep it to 1 picture per 1 event. That\u0027s not to say don\u0027t take any, just don\u0027t\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Espam\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0them. \u003Cstrong\u003EIf you\u0027re doing the same thing you were last picture\u003C/strong\u003E, I cannot stress this enough,\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EDON\u0027T TAKE ANOTHER\u003C/strong\u003E. If an album about all your ships, and you have a lot, keep it to 1 per ship. 6 is too much. (Unless it\u0027s only 6 ships, in which case it\u0027s OK. If you have 40 ships no one will sit through that.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHandy hint: Keep most albums under 40 images at all times. If you want people to see them all, keep it brief and to the point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*Not THESE 5, it\u0027s\u00A0MY album. When you upload copy your own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
