All you really need to know is...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlags must be 24 bit color depth PNG format;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey will be resized to 256 x 160; (So if it isn\u0027t it will be stretched or shrunk to fit.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally Drop them in your folder at KSP_(insert OS)/GameData/Squad/Flags\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022They also have to have a 24 bit colour depth. I made mine in GIMP and exported as a PNG, but it was a 32 bit PNG. Had no idea how to change it, tried messing with palettes and such, and then used another program (ACDSee, which I\u0027ve used for years as an image display and quick photo-editing software) to resave it and it was automatically saved as a 24 bit file with no obvious loss of quality (bonus!). If you are using GIMP and having this problem, I\u0027m not sure if other image editors would do the same, but you can try it. Maybe even MS Paint would do it as a quick conversion tool.\u0022 - KerBlammo!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/2syg2EeOLFI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave fun and happy capping some flags on planets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-28T02:11:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2013 02:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by KillerMx1337\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMore useful info, Thanks KerBlammo!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Holo","CreatedById":39606,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T05:03:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENope, you put them in KSP_(insert OS)/GameData/(insert name)/Flags.
