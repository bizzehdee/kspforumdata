What\u0027s that huge monopropellant tank for? We all tend to think that since we\u0027ll be docking a lot we\u0027ll need lots of RCS fuel but once you practice a bit you find it\u0027s ROCKET fuel you need. The good thing is you can easily add that, of course, because you have all those open docking ports at the moment. My space-station design should be familiar - pretty much everything in Chapters 7 and 8 is what I\u0027m using to go anywhere/everywhere. There are some differences in my current \u0027standard\u0027 station - it has even more docking ports; 2 landers, 2 lander drones, 2 scooters, 2 \u0027visitor\u0027 (usually Crew Shuttles) and 4 fuel/others - but the basics are the same. The purpose is still to be a centre of operations for a planet or moon, providing refuelling capability, \u0027home\u0027 for station, tractor and lander crew, transit accommodation for other mission crews. Given that I\u0027m working in careeer mode now the lab and scientific equipment also has (or will have) a purpose, so they tend to be 2 more (lab) people around than I had before.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe monopropellant tank is for refueling and - yeeees - docking. I didn\u0027t practice docking much, but I\u0027ve done it twice and it worked out pretty well so I just hope I can do it again when constructing my station. But there is one thing that really bothers me. When I flied ... flought ... flight?

And it didn\u0027t wobble just a little bittle (just a little bittle bittle, tziiiiiiing xD), it wobbled that much that I needed to try again 4 times, and it only worked then because I decoupled my boosters (not SRBs, Rockomax Skipper-powered-boosters) a bit early with about 25% fuel left and then.. it still wobbled, but I could control it with 12 RCS thrusters and an ASAS module. Do you know what causes this? or do I just need MOAR STRUTS?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and about that Tractor rocket thing from your tutorial.

My school days were long, long ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have time to play KSP but what I\u0027m spending that time on is mostly the current career mode game, I don\u0027t have time to do much in sandbox as well. Remember that I said I\u0027d typically spend about 3 hours on building and testing a single vehicle design so although I\u0027ll probably spend 3 hours a day on KSP that\u0027s one ship. Another day I might just use existing designs and run through several missions/contracts and on other days I\u0027ll just be reading and writing. So when I\u0027m planning and developing stuff it\u0027s only once or twice a week that I\u0027ll just mess around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring each docking, if it\u0027s a good one you\u0027ll be using 2 - 5 units. Even before you\u0027ve practiced a lot you probably won\u0027t use more than about 10 - 20. That means that the big, heavy monopropellant tank you have can provide RCS-fuel refills for ~38 ships. In practice most ships will be coming up, visiting and going back to the surface so they don\u0027t need any more monopropellant. It\u0027s only the ships that are going off to dock with something else, or going on a mission and needing to re-dock with the space-station that need topping-up. That tank, big and HEAVY, therefore has enough for about 38 onward missions to, say Minmus/Minmus. Do you think you will be doing that many? Do you think you have enough liquid-fuel and oxidiser in that little tank to power 38 (return) lunar missions? You might just have that station as a docking-practice platform of course but look at the tiny amount of RCS-fuel I put on my stations - 2 x 150 cylinders per 2,880 liquid fuel orange tube - and that\u0027s assuming the fuel modules will be using RCS to dock and de-orbit themselves! The thing I\u0027m hinting at here is that you hardly ever need as much monopropellant as you think you do and if you really want to take that HEAVY!! tank up to orbit you should expect to match it with huge amounts of rocket fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s impossible to really say why your ship wobbled during launch without seeing any pictures of it on its launch vehicle. I can guess at several things though. First, you haven\u0027t read, or taken notice of, what I said right at the start of the station core construction details, \u0022The PPD-12 cupola module offers a great view but is a pig to launch! The usual impulse it to stick it on top of your station (or other vehicle), facing forward.\u0022 Since you have a cupola at one end, I\u0027m assuming you still went ahead and launched it at the top of your rocket, facing forward ^^. Right behind that BIG, HEAVY, HIGH-DRAG part would be the BIG hitch-hiker\u0027s container (ok), then the BIG, HEAVY RCS-tank. All that BIG, HEAVY, HIGH-DRAG section sits on top of a little fuel-tank, hubmax and docking port. See any problem in the making here? The station itself is fine structurally, but how did you connect it to the launch vehicle? If it was just at the docking-port I\u0027d guess that was where the ship bent and wobbled. You really need to put struts (probably from the bottom of the Rocomax converter) across joints like that. Check the pictures of Long Tom or Cartographer Heavy at launch (click to go to imgur, click again to see full size, magnify if you need to) - they are strutted for the same reason, most of the others aren\u0027t because they\u0027re light/short payloads and the rest are using large docking ports, which are more stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy stations can more or less look after their own orbits but the tractor light is used for bigger corrections if they are needed - it\u0027s LV-N engines are more efficient. The main job of the tractor \u003Cem\u003Elight\u003C/em\u003E is to tow stations, fuel modules and, especially, landers around within a planet\u0027s system - LKO to Mun/Minmus, Duna to Ike, etc. - and back to the station. It also does gross plane-changes for the landers, which otherwise might not have sufficient fuel to reach a landing-site far from the equatorial plane. It will then stand-by to rendezvous with them when they re-orbit and take them back to the station once more, plane-changing again as required. Again, this is all making use of its LV-Ns\u0027 vacuum fuel-efficiency (high ISP). The tractor \u003Cem\u003Emedium\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s job is to haul the same stuff on interplanetary missions; such as getting a station to Moho in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-10T01:11:50Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2014 01:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Pecan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Volcanix","CreatedById":117245,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-10T09:22:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWait, 2-5 units of mono prop for an experienced player?
