Do you want to shoot it off into space? Put it in orbit around a planet or moon? What size of asteroid do you want?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you\u0027ve decided what you want to do with it, then I advise planning it out on a piece of paper before actually attempting it, so you don\u0027t forget anything important.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart 2: Construction!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOnce you\u0027ve planned it out, then it\u0027s time to get building! You can use either a rocket or a spaceplane, but a rocket is preferable. Design a rocket that has lots of fuel and Monopropellant, as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters will be VERY handy in stopping you from hitting the asteroid, and making precise movements. Once you\u0027ve built a suitable spacecraft, then attach at least one AGU to your design, preferably a large distance away from the ship (I.e. mounting it on girders at the top of the command pod). Once you\u0027ve chosen the crew, built the craft, and everything else, then it\u0027s time to launch!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart 3: Small Fish In A Big Pond\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHopefully your craft should get into Kerbin orbit. Heading straight for your target isn\u0027t ideal as soon as you\u0027ve launched, I suggest getting into an orbit anywhere from 125 to 200K. That means less distance between you and your destructive, rocky, friend, floating out there in the massive pond, that is, space. The easiest thing to do next would be to create a manoeuvre node that intercepts your target, and provides some distance between it, so you don\u0027t end up getting there, but slamming into it, potentially sending it towards a planet or moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart 4: Patience, And A Steady Hand\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Once you\u0027ve setup a manoeuvre node that intercepts your asteroid, complete the necessary burn. If you followed my advice, then fuel shouldn\u0027t be an issue. Once the burn is done, timewarp as much as you need to, to cross the large distance between Kerbin and the asteroid. I suggest time-warping down gradually as you get closer, as you don\u0027t want a collision that could\u0027ve been avoidable! Now that you\u0027re heading towards it at quite some speed, turn your craft around, and FIRE THOSE ENGINES! Do this to stop you from crashing into it or missing it. Once you\u0027re close to the asteroid, and have basically stopped all forward motion, then prepare for grabbing!.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart 5: Steady...Steady...Steady!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you followed my advice with fuel, then you should also have heaps of Monopropellant as well as fuel handy.\u00A0Deploy your AGU, and right click on it, selecting \u0027Control From Here\u0027. This will change the keyboard controls to what it \u0027sees\u0027, making it useful for grabbing. This is also a handy tip if you are docking to something. Go slowly, using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters to move in. Once you\u0027re close enough, the \u0027arms\u0027 of the AGU should be touching the asteroid. If you\u0027ve successfully grabbed it, then the camera should change, and you will know that you\u0027re attached!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
