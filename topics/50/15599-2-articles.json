Changing their place will come naturally as you start burning, at which point you will find yourself either at Pe or Ap, depending on whether you\u0027re burning Prograde or Retrograde.\u003Cp\u003EIf you were talking about a plane change, you have to burn toward the normal (or anti-normal) of your current orbit, until you have the desired orbit. Your Pe and Ap may have changed by then, and you can adjust them easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks! It seems so obvious after reading your description.
