In this week\u2019s forum I\u2019ll be teaching you on making and\u00A0 executing maneuver nodes.

So\u00A0after you launch and the fuel in your first stage is out, press spacebar to decople. \u00A0When you are in space click M to view map and click the apalaps and a button that says \u201Cadd maneuver \u201C . When you do, a wired thing will appear. Fiddle around with in till you have a complete circle around Kerbin. You may notice that when you finish makeing your maneuver a green line will appear. You should have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E on so click on the button directly right of the green button you are on. When it\u2019s on and your close to the maneuver node, fire your upper stage and watch map view as the maneuver you made will form.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope\u00A0you learned how to make and execute maneuvers. Now that you know this you can fly anywhere in the solar system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsee you next week!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-09T04:57:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving to Tutorials.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-09T14:04:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, first off; It\u0027s great that you want to help people, it really is! Very commendable, your heart is certainly in the right place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour tutorial is...solid but perhaps needs a bit more, elaboration? For instance you tell them to \u0022fiddle with the maneuver node\u0022 perhaps you should explain to them how and why each arm works and what it does? Pictures are always nice as well, and a great way to \u0022catch the eye.\u0022 If you look around the tutorial section there are a lot of really nice tutorials already made; so if you want to \u0022stand out in the crowd\u0022 so to speak, you are going to want to go that extra mile. If you really like helping people another good thing you can do is to watch the \u0022Gameplay Questions\u0022 area of the forum and help answer peoples questions as they pop up. I think you\u0027ll find that a lot of the times you can be more helpful offering specific advice as it\u0027s asked, instead of trying to cover it all with a blanket tutorial. Don\u0027t let that stop you from trying though!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou keep on doing you, and best of luck.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NASAbulbafan","CreatedById":185007,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-09T14:37:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks again\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
