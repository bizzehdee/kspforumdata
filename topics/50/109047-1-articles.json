I would like to do that, then immediately re-enter Kerbin\u0027s SOI to orbit, land, and recover. How do I do that?\n\nI can easily enter Kerbol\u0027s SOI. However, if I then retro-fire engines, I plunge towards Kerbol, which is the expected behavior.

This will take you a bit above kerbins orbit, and kerbin should catch up to you if you do it right. (if you need more detail let me know I\u0027ll try a better explanation.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Apollo13","CreatedById":74572,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T15:06:15Z","Content":"@Endersmens: Thanks, I\u0027ll give that a try.

The method I used was to just burn from LKO until I got an escape trajectory. Once you\u0027re in Kerbol orbit, fire directly at Kerbin and you should be recaptured. This works as long as you\u0027re barely escaping Kerbin."},{"CreatedByName":"Hannu","CreatedById":60596,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T16:36:27Z","Content":"Easiest way to find directions is to make burn so that ship escapes to Kerbin\u0027s orbital direction. Put maneuver node so that you just escape. It should be about 900 m/s from low orbit. Then adjust time so that interplanetary apoapsis is as high as possible (avoid moons). Apoapsis is typically about halfway between Kerbin and Duna. Execute the burn and wait until you escape from Kerbin\u0027s SOI. Then do the science stuff. After that create a maneuver node with about 200 m/s retrograde dv. Adjust dv so that you get an an encounter after couple of hours. Execute burn, dodge attacking M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, adjust periapsis and land back to planet. \n\nThat strange 200 m/s is error from patched conic gravity model of KSP. Escape velocity of Kerbin at the edge of SOI should be about that but game does not take Kerbin\u0027s gravity into account at large distances. So you get freely such an energy every time you leave the planet."},{"CreatedByName":"Apollo13","CreatedById":74572,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T18:01:42Z","Content":"Thanks for the ideas, guys.
