While you can send flotillas to Mun and Minmus, the short travel times and the fact you don\u0027t have to wait on a launch window make this unnecessary and overly complex; better there to send 1 ship, let it arrive, then send the next. Thus, this guide only discusses interplanetary flotillas, the need for which is created by launch windows (actually, departure or transfer windows) only happening every so often. As such, this guide is intended for players who are already familiar with sending single ships on interplanetary missions and want to up their game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo why send a flotilla instead of a single ship? Well, it depends on mission complexity. The more things you want to do, the bigger a single ship becomes, which makes it harder to launch/assemble and control, the more fuel it burns for the same delta-V, and you start running into part-count issues. Also, eventually you\u0027ll have to start compromising on mission capabilities or even drop some things you originally wanted to do. Plus, you also run the risk of a single failure scuppering the entire project, and will then have to wait a long time for rescue. With a flotilla, OTOH, you can put each mission task on a separate ship and thus optimize it for that particular job. Each ship will thus be smaller with all the advantages that entails, and a failure only impacts that part of the overall mission. Plus, you can build in redundancy and self-rescue capabilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, there are drawbacks to flotillas. First, you have to launch a lot of stuff and make many dockings. Then you have to do the transfer burns for all the ships on the same day, one after the other. This can take a substantial amount of your real time, especially if you have long burn times and lots of ships, so you might have to reserve most of a day off for it. And you have more ships in flight, which might be an issue for you depending on your hardware. But that\u0027s really the extent of the disadvantages and they\u0027re worth it for the enhanced mission performance and survivability you get for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA common fear for 1st-time flotilla users is that multiple ships will arrive simultaneously and they won\u0027t be able to do what\u0027s needed (like aerocapture) for 1 ship before having to do that for the next. While this might be a problem at Mun or Minmus (which is why you don\u0027t send flotillas there), it\u0027s not a problem anywhere else. In general, you\u0027ll be burning the ships at least 15 minutes apart and each burn will have a little error in it. Over the course of an interplanetary trip, these slight differences will translate into plenty of time between ship arrivals. Eve is the worst case with arrivals only a few hours apart but that\u0027s plenty. While you might not be able to finalize the orbit of 1 ship before dealing with the next, you can at least get them aerocaptured and their Pe\u0027s out of the atmosphere before the next arrival. Elsewhere, there\u0027ll be days or weeks between arrivals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, that\u0027s what flotillas are and a nutshell comparison with doing the same mission with a single ship.

That is, you have payload modules for specific tasks and tug modules to move them around. All these modules should have large docking ports at least for where they\u0027ll be connected while under thrust, to avoid wobbles. It\u0027s best to have big docking ports on both ends so you can stack multiple modules as needed, or mix and match to create expedient ships or stations with various capabilities you hadn\u0027t thought of before you left. Modularity begets flexibility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf some modules require small docking ports, make sure several other modules also have at least radially mounted small docking ports. But in general, try to avoid small docking ports unless absolutely necessary like for small landers and spaceplanes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EI.2 Probe Cores All Around\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery single module needs a probe core and the power to keep it running. This is so you can send crewless modules around on their various tasks at the destination, whether they had crew originally or not. In fact, you\u0027ll probably need this anyway for launching and docking all the modules because few, if any, will have Kerbals aboard. In general, you\u0027ll put all the Kerbals in 1 or 2 ships at most and their mission equipment in however many other probe ships that will all rendezvous at the destination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you\u0027re into MechJeb, every module should have that, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EI.3 No Ship Left Behind\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the main risks to flying flotillas is forgetting about 1 or more ships in the early part of the trip when they\u0027re all doing the same things in quick succession. You have to make sure they all do their departure burns, all leave Kerbin\u0027s SOI, all do their mid-course tweaks, and eventually all arrive. The solution to this problem is Kerbal Alarm Clock, which brings us to the next section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EEDIT: I.4 Quick-Save Frequently\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy this point in your KSP career, you should be hitting F5 just before you do something major and just afterwards if it goes OK, and pretty much every time you have nothing better to do. There are scads of points in dealing with flotillas that you should quicksave after.

SET MISSION GOALS\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need a plan so developing one is the 1st step. First, you set the big-picture, strategic objectives. To justify having a flotilla, you need a fairly large and/or complex set of objectives; otherwise you could probably do it with a single ship. Generally, if the set of mission goals involves going to multiple moons and/or inclinations in the destination area, and/or multiple very different tasks, and/or involves returning some ships and leaving others behind, it\u0027s a good case for doing a flotilla. For example, a set of mission goals that would justify a flotilla could be to send an expedition that will\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003Emap both Duna and Ike with SCANsat,\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Escan both for Kethane, \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Egather and return all possible science from the Duna/Ike system,\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eleave behind a permanent station in Duna orbit, and\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eset up a Kethane operation based on Ike to supply the flotilla during the mission and be ready for future expeditions.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027ve got your mission goals, you can start envisioning how you\u0027ll accomplish them, which lets you start designing the ships you need. The above list will be our example for the rest of this guide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIV. DESIGNING SHIPS\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe general process is to look at your list of mission goals and separate them out into jobs for individual mission payloads, then build both these payloads and a way to move them around. While doing this, you also consider which tasks can be combined in a single payload and which have to be done individually, which determines how many ships you need and their general characteristics. General guidelines for making these decisions obviously include whether something will stay there or come home or will need to operate simultaneously in different places. But another one is high operating inclination. Generally, you want to keep your main pieces close to the equatorial plane, so things like mapping probes that live in polar orbits, even at the same planet, should be separate from permanent stations that will serve as ports for this expedition and any future one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, let\u0027s consider our example Duna expedition starting with the mapping jobs. Ike is close enough to Duna and has low enough gravity that a single probe can do both. But while SCANsat mapping requires a polar orbit, there\u0027s no real need to do Kethane from more than about a 35^ inclination at either place because you\u0027re very unlikely ever to use Kethane at higher latitudes due to the wastage of fuel required for significant plane changes to get back into equatorial orbit where you need the product. This suggests 2 probes, as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EA SCANsat probe to do both Duna and Ike. Assuming it will capture into polar orbit at Duna, it needs enough delta-V to get down into a near-equatorial orbit, transfer to Ike, and get back into a polar orbit there.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EA Kethane probe to do both Duna and Ike. It will do a similar flight but only go to 35^ inclination instead of polar so doesn\u0027t need as much delta-V.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, we need to gather Science! For this we need a Duna-capable lander with all the science parts we want to carry. This lander will also work on Ike and its science parts will be used as well to get data from high and low orbits at both places. The Duna orbit data can be obtained as the lander enters the Duna system. The lander will then need to make 2 sorties down to Duna, one for surface and one for \u0022flying over\u0022 data. It will also need to make 4 trips to Ike, for high orbit, low orbit, surface, and \u0022just above\u0022 data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis lander will be our main fuel-consumer during the mission and will thus define the size of the Kethane operation we need. We also need a Mobile Lab to rearm the goos and bays between lander sorties, and this could also serve to store all the data, which makes more role-playing sense than storing it all in a capsule (we\u0027ll have dozens of stored experiments at the end). So the Mobile Lab will also be the core of our return vehicle. This gives us 2 more ships:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDuna-capable lander that can also get from low Duna orbit to the surface of Ike and back on a single tank. The round trip to Ike is about 2000m/s, less than what a chute-less lander should have to be safe for a round trip to Duna, so no worries there.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EA return vehicle built around a Mobile Lab and whatever else we want to attach to it. The Mobile Lab at least must be capable of landing safely on Kerbin.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow we need to consider the permanent Duna station. This only really needs to be 1 or more big fuel tanks for the Kethane system to fill up and these can be the same tanks used to move the station out there. But we want living quarters for the crew and, for role-play, a 2nd Mobile Lab that will do imaginary science from orbit. The return vehicle and the lander will dock to this station during operations at Duna so the station needs multiple docking ports. Mobile Labs need a crew of 2 to function, we want to return 2 Kerbals with the data, so that means 4 Kerbals total. And because the lander and return vehicle will dock with the station at Duna, all the Kerbals can ride out in the station in a single Hitchhiker. This suggests the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EA permanent station consisting of a Mobile Lab, a Hitchhiker, a fuel tank, and a number of docking ports.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis leaves the Kethane system, which can be quite complex if you want high efficiency. But the Duna-Ike system doesn\u0027t require high efficiency so we\u0027ll just put everything on 1 vehicle. This means drilling and refining both on Ike and delivering finished LFO and mono to the station. The main question thus is how much fuel we need to move at once. Counting fuel used in taking off from Ike, rendezvousing with the station, and returning to Ike, such a system will deliver a little less than 1/2 the fuel it starts with to the customer. The lander will need a major refueling after every sortie that lands so you need to deliver at least that much each trip, more if you want to cut down on the number of tanker runs and if you have space to store the extra at the station. And of course the return vehicle will need some fuel to get home if it didn\u0027t bring enough with it to start with. So decide on how big a rig/refinery/tanker ship you want and build it, keeping in mind that you have to get it off the ground and to Ike.

Simple rockets with sufficient delta-V will work for them. But the other ships will need at least transfer tugs. Depending on how heavy you make things, you can built the transfer engines on a permanent attachments, disposable stages, or separate tug modules docked on in orbit. It\u0027s generally handy to go with docked transfer tugs because this increases flexibility. And being able to remove the tugs to a separate orbit helps keep part count under control when you dock the station, return ship, and lander together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: It\u0027s VERY important to build ships with reasonably short transfer burn times. First, remember you have a whole flotilla to burn and the longer each one takes, the more of your time it will take. Also, the longer the burns, the less accurate they are and the more they interfere with the burns of other ships. Thus, in general, try to build for transfer burns of about 5-6 minutes, which takes a TWR of about 0.75. Don\u0027t go over 10 minutes or you\u0027ll hate yourself. If you can do less than 5 minutes, by all means do so. If some of your ships are small, light probes, try to give them conventional transfer stages instead of nukes, so their burns will be 1 minute or less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EV. LAUNCHING THE FLOTILLA\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunching means getting everything off the ground into parking orbits and docking whatever needs it. This is NOT done at the so-called \u0022launch window\u0022. \u0022Launch window\u0022 is a misnomer; it\u0027s really a \u0022transfer window\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EV.1 Timing the Launch\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe actual launching and docking process is time-consuming, both in gametime and realtime, so needs to be done some time before the transfer window comes around. There will be the inevitable failures requiring redesigns, which will consume even more time. It takes a couple of game days to get a typical flotilla all up and docked, so I recommend starting the process a least 1 game week prior to the transfer window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, as soon as you get everything up and parked, you\u0027ll start having second thoughts, realize you\u0027ve forgotten some vital part on a ship, discover 2 modules won\u0027t dock, or think of a better way to do the mission. This means de-orbiting and replacing 1 or more ships, which also consumes gametime and realtime. Therefore, getting started a month of gametime before the transfer window is probably better, especially if you need to do a lot of designing and testing of ships, tugs, and lifters beforehand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: When docking payloads and tugs, do the rendezvous with whichever module is lighter because this will burn the least quantity of fuel for the same delta-V. But once the modules are close enough, always control the payload during the actual docking. This preserves the payload\u0027s ship name for the completed assembly, which is the name you\u0027ll be looking for when searching the map and alarm lists for the ship you\u0027re interested in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, when you decide to send a flotilla somewhere, you need to set an alarm with Kerbal Alarm Clock to tell you when to start the launch process. Just create a transfer window alarm and give it however many days or months lead-time you feel comfortable with. Get all your ship design and testing done before this, so when the alarm goes off, you can start launching and docking immediately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EV.2 Executing the Launch\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunching puts things in parking orbits and the purpose of parking orbits is to prepare for the transfer burns. Executing the transfer burns is inevitably a bit chaotic but you can reduce the chaos by carefully executed launches. IOW, don\u0027t just throw your ships into the same orbit one after the other. This adds to the chaos of departure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs will be discussed in the next chapter, when doing the departure burns, you\u0027ll need to be able to quickly find and select individual ships off the map. So what you want to do is space your ships\u0027 parking orbits out both horizontally (in the same orbit) and vertically (at different altitudes). Horizontally, try to keep spacing in the same orbit no closer than about 1/4 of an orbit, 1/3 is a bit better, so 3-4 ships max per orbit. Vertically, put ships into orbits spaced about 25km apart, which is enough to clearly distinguish their paths on the map. So say 100km, 125km, and 150km, which is enough for a flotilla of 9-12 ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t worry about interlacing the spacing of ships in different orbits because that isn\u0027t necessary and won\u0027t keep anyway in the time between launch and departure. But before firing the engines of any launch, look at the map. You just want to put the ship into whichever orbit has an open space at the time. You might have to wait on the pad 10 minutes or so until and opening comes around, and then launch to that orbit\u0027s altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd don\u0027t forget the note mentioned above on how to dock payloads and tugs. You want the finished assembly to end up in the proper place so that\u0027s the place you launch whichever module will hold still while the other rendezvous with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, that gets your flotilla from drawing board to parking orbit. All that\u0027s left is whatever last-minute adjustments you want to make and then send it on its way. That will be the subject of the next chapter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETO BE CONTINUED\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-18T17:37:22Z\u0022 title=\u002202/18/2014 05:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Geschosskopf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-18T17:25:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rhyunix\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rhyunix\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAn interesting guide\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks but it\u0027s just getting started \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-18T19:13:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ECHAPTER 3: GETTING THE FLOTILLA UNDERWAY\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVI. THE DEPARTURE BURNS\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesigning, building, testing, launching, and docking all the mission modules is rather boring and takes a lot of your time, with nothing to show for it except a crowd of ships in LKO. Then you wait and second-guess yourself until the day of the transfer window, when it\u0027s too late to make any more changes and you have to do the departure burns. This is also time-consuming and all you have in the end is a bunch of ships in interplanetary space, but it\u0027s at least hectic enough to stay exciting. And it\u0027s also the last great chore in the whole flotilla process. From here on, the workload decreases dramatically and you start appreciating the investments you\u0027ve made up to this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EVI.1 Departure Preparation\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt some point between launching and the day of departure, you need to create a maneuver node alarm in Kerbal Alarm Clock for each ship in the flotilla. It\u0027s a good idea to create the alarm for a ship as the last step in its launch process once its in parking orbit, so you don\u0027t forget it later and leave it behind when the others leave. Note that these alarms are simply a checklist to make sure you burn all the ships in the flotilla. You will not actually use any nodes created now except maybe the earliest one, and the other ships will not actually leave at the times you set. But the pop-up boxes for these alarms will be your checklist, which you check off as you burn that ship, and they all ensure you begin the departure process on the day of the transfer window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause you launched at least a week before the transfer window, the nodes you\u0027ll be creating for these alarms will be many orbits in the future. To make sure they get set for the correct time, use MechJeb to create the nodes. The process goes like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESet the ship\u0027s target planet\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOpen MJ\u0027s Maneuver Planner, scroll to the \u0022Transfer to Another Planet\u0022 function, and click \u0022Create Node\u0022.

But before you do, make sure you yourself are ready. Each burn has to be done in realtime so getting the whole flotilla underway will require the sum of their burn times plus time in between to do various other tasks. This requires a fairly substantial amount of realtime, so don\u0027t start burning until you have enough contiguous free time to get it all done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EVI.2 Doing the 1st Burn\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, you have the free time required and are ready to go. Now just fast-forward until the earliest node alarm for the flotilla goes off. Now you have about 20-25 minutes of realtime to set this ship up to do its burn. This ship and all others will require you to do a pre-burn checklist so I\u0027ll cover that here, but remember you have to do these same steps for each ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWhen the alarm goes off, click \u0022Jump to Ship and Restore Maneuver Node\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECheck the \u0022Delete on Close\u0022 button for this ship\u0027s alarm and close the alarm, removing it from the KAC list.

Ignore them but DO NOT CLOSE THEM. Just drag their pop-ups off to the side of the screen and keep doing what you\u0027re doing with the active ship. The crowd of alarm pop-ups will be your accountability checklist to make sure you burn all ships in the flotilla.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, 1 burn down, however many more to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EVI.3 Doing the Other Burns\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, so the 1st ship is on its way. Now you have to switch to another ship and do it. Ignore the order in which their node alarms went off. What you want is the ship in the best position to do its burn. So go to the map view and focus on Kerbin. The path of the ship you just burned will show you where the transfer node needs to be relative to Kerbin, so look for a ship that\u0027s at least 1/4 to 1/3 of an orbit away from getting to that point. This is why you need to space your ships out in their parking orbits during the launch phase; it makes finding the next ship to burn much easier. Anyway, decide which ship icon is in the best place to burn next, mouse over it to learn its name, then jump to it using KAC. If that ship\u0027s alarm has already popped up, jump to it using that. If not, jump to it by clicking on its name on the list of upcoming alarms. Jumping between ships with KAC usually works better than doing it with KSP\u0027s built-in mechanism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027re at the next ship, the 1st thing you\u0027ll see is all the popped-up alarms in the center of the screen again. So drag them out of the way again. Then go through the same pre-burn procedure listed above for the 1st ship. Close and delete this ship\u0027s alarm, set control from here, blip the throttle, delete and recreate the node, etc. Then do its burn, ignoring and dragging away any more alarms that pop up in the meantime. And once this ship\u0027s burn is done, repeat this whole procedure for the next and the next, until they\u0027re all done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, do a couple of checks to make sure you\u0027ve burned all the ships. All the node alarms should be dead and gone. Each ship should now have a new alarm set for leaving Kerbin\u0027s SOI in a few hours so make sure they\u0027ve all got one. Finally, focus the map back on Kerbin and make sure nothing you want to take with you is still in orbit. Once you\u0027re sure everything\u0027s on the road, pat yourself on the back and celebrate with an adult beverage of your choice. You\u0027ve successfully launched your 1st flotilla.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: It sometimes happens that Mun is in the way when it comes time to do the burns. Usually this isn\u0027t a disaster-the ships are going by way too fast for this to screw up their trajectories unless they pass VERY close or run into it. HOWEVER, even a distant fly-by is a problem because you have KAC set up for automatic SOI change alarms, which interfere with other burns. So before lighting off the 1st burn, make sure Mun\u0027s not going to be a problem. If it is, just fast forward a little until you can get by it without an encounter. A few hours more or less on the transfer window doesn\u0027t make enough difference to worry about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVII. LEAVING KERBIN\u0027S SOI\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ve done all the burns and the members of the flotilla are all on escape trajectories away from Kerbin. Even for insane flotillas of over 20 ships, the 1st ship should still be in the vicinity of Minmus\u0027 orbit by the time you burn the last one. Thus, you have some hours of gametime to wait before any leave Kerbin\u0027s SOI. And you\u0027ll know when this happens because you set up Kerbal Alarm Clock to create SOI-change alarms automatically with 5 minutes lead time. So there\u0027s really nothing to do at this point but admire your work, take some \u0022last look at home\u0022 screenshots, and fast-forward until the 1st SOI alarm goes off. When that happens, jump to that ship and delete its alarm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, you\u0027re at the 1st ship about to leave Kerbin\u0027s SOI. Go to the map view, zoom in until the ship\u0027s blue line fills about 1/2 the screen, and put your cursor over the far end so you can see the time until it happens. Then go to 50x warp, keeping the cursor on the end of the line as it moves toward the ship so you can read the time all the way in. When it gets to about 1 minute, slow down to 10x warp and keep it there until the SOI change happens and the blue line gets drawn out towards the target planet. You\u0027ll probably have to zoom the map out some to see this happen. Once this happens, go high warp again until the next alarm goes off. Then jump to that ship and repeat the above process. Then repeat for all remaining ships in the flotilla.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou shouldn\u0027t have to worry about other alarms popping up while changing SOI for a different ship. By the time they all get out near the edge of Kerbin\u0027s SOI, there will be way more than 5 minutes between ships. But if this does happen, just ignore the alarm and remember that it includes a 5-minute cushion so can\u0027t happen until the ship you\u0027re flying now has already done it\u0027s change. Then jump to the open alarm without warping. Nothing to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: This method of doing SOI changes at 10x warp is one you should use in all situations, whether you\u0027re doing a flotilla or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVIII. FINAL NOTES\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless you\u0027re going to Eve, this is probably the end of the hassle unique to flotillas. From this point on, it\u0027s very unlikely you\u0027ll be dealing with more than 1 of the flotilla\u0027s ships at a time until they all meet up at the destination. They\u0027ll be doing their mid-course tweaks at different times and will probably arrive days, weeks, or even a month or 2 apart at the destination. And even at Eve, they\u0027ll at least be hours apart and you only need a few minutes for the critical maneuvers for any one ship.

Thus, you get the same sort of thing as at Jool with multiple ships in the \u0022approach pattern\u0022 between SOI entry and aerobraking. In both cases, you have the same worry: can I get Ship A in a safe orbit before I need to switch to Ship B? The reason this is a worry is because while you\u0027re flying Ship A, Ship B is getting closer to the air or to the last point you can adjust its Pe before the air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt both planets, the critical interval where you really have to fly a ship to make sure it ends up in the right place lasts about the same amount of time. The difference between the planets, though, is that at Eve, this critical time interval is a significant portion of the difference between ship arrival times. This is definitely not the case at Jool. A ship just entering its SOI is at least a week away from Pe, often more, so there\u0027s no worry at all that you\u0027ll be flying Ship A while Ship B lithobrakes or gets slingshotted Kod knows where.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for an Eve flotilla, it\u0027s often the case that you have to aerocapture Ship A into a highly elliptical, big Ap orbit just to buy time because you know it\u0027ll take it a day or more to make the circuit, by which time all the other ships will have arrived. Immediately it\u0027s clear of the air, you jump to ship B and aerocapture it however seems most efficacious at the time. Then Ship C. Then you might have a chance to go back to Ship A and tweak its Pe a bit so next time it comes around, it\u0027ll end up where you want it. Then here comes Ship D, after which you jump to Ship B and tweak its Pe, and so on. Sometimes, you might have to tweak a Pe completely out of the air and park that ship just to take it out of the equation for the time being, then bring it back in a few orbits later once things have settled down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou only run into this sort of thing at Jool if you\u0027re determined to aerobrake directly into an encounter with whichever moon you\u0027re going to, or to at least park in an elliptical orbit out that far in hopes you\u0027ll eventually get an encounter without having to burn again. Due to the long intervals between arrivals, this is the only way to end up with a bunch of ships all orbiting Jool and needing attention more or less at the same time. If you\u0027re willing to do more burning, however, you can avoid this at Jool entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerekL1963","CreatedById":57091,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-20T15:34:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, OK.

In such a case, efficiency comes from 1) moving kethane itself, not finished product, and 2) moving only the kethane itself, not the drills, refineries, and their powerplants. Thus, maximum efficiency comes from having at least 3 separate units: a drilling rig that stays on the ground, a refining station that stays in orbit, and a kethane tanker lander that goes back and forth between them. And of course before that you need a probe to find the kethane, although it can go out by itself in an earlier window. But having 3 separate units means you have to do a flotilla, which most folks are afraid to do. Thus, they lower their efficiencies by having all-in-1 kethane plants, and/or by moving finished product instead of kethane. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my example Duna flotilla above, I took the least-efficient option: moving finished product along with the refinery, drills, and power. On the Duna-Ike run, this has about 40% efficiency. But that\u0027s enough for the purpose of refueling a lander and the return ship. It shouldn\u0027t have to make more than a couple of trips. If that\u0027s all you need, then why bother setting up a high-efficiency operation? You\u0027ve already got 6 ships in the flotilla as it is; efficiency would add at least 2 more. Besides, this example mission to Duna was just to grab the science and go home, leaving the core of a station for future expansion. The assumption is you\u0027ll be going back next time with colonies in mind, and can set up a better kethane thing then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt other places, you can\u0027t afford such inefficiency even at the get-go. For instance, Jool. The main focus of any Jool expedition will of course be Laythe, but it\u0027s stupid to refuel space-bound ships from the surface there, leaving Vall as the only practical source. But it\u0027s a significant trip between Vall and Laythe, so you really need an efficient set-up. That\u0027s where you put every function in a separate unit. In fact, you\u0027d need at least 5: a drilling rig on Vall, a kethane tanker lander, a refining/transshipment station at Vall, a kethane shuttle between Vall and Laythe, and a 2nd refinery at Laythe. You can probably get about 60% efficiency delivered to Laythe that way. But this operation will require a decent flotilla itself, on top of the flotilla of stations, colonies, and spaceplanes going to Laythe. The main question, therefore, is whether you combine them into a single flotilla of a dozen or more ships, or do them separately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnother thing, I have some minor disagreements about the necessary mod list.\u003Cp\u003ERCS Build Aid - not required\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done enough docking that I can place RCS pretty well.
