I just made a new youtube channel with tutorial videos. As of now, I\u0027m uploading a spaceplane tutorial and uploaded an orbiting tutorial. I would really appreciate help. I need to know where to get good music from, what editing program should I use (I\u0027m using Windows Live Movie Maker, I need a better one) and tips like what can I do with my vids on youtube. if you are just starting out, take a look at my channel and give some feedback \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWish you success!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
