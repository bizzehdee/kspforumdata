I\u0027ve picked up a lot of knowledge and formed some definite opinions about KSP ever since I started playing back in 0.23.5. I thought it was time to give back to the community and let others profit from my experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EWhat is Cheap and Cheerful?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheap and Cheerful (hereinafter abbreviated C\u0026amp;C) is what I\u0027ve come to call my philosophy for cost-effective rocket design in KSP. It\u0027s based on a British idiom for \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Csomething that is costing little money but is attractive, pleasant, or enjoyable\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. Another definition is \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cnot of bad quality, or otherwise enjoyable, despite being cheap\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen looking at payload fraction and cost per ton to orbit in KSP, the smart crowd tends to gravitate toward SSTO space planes. They make a lot of sense, if your temperament is compatible with their design and operation. But it takes longer to get to orbit, your ascent profile needs to be closely managed, and designing a craft which is stable and controllable throughout the flight profile (ascent, descent, with cargo, without cargo, full tanks, empty tanks) can be an exercise in frustration for those not well-versed in KSP aerodynamics. The best space plane parts aren\u0027t available until relatively late in the tech tree, and the funds investment per craft can be quite high. The cargo bay dimensions limit the size of what you can lift with a single craft. Recovery economics dictate that you have to land fairly close to KSC and in one piece. There has to be another way - dare I say it, an easier way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnter Cheap and Cheerful. C\u0026amp;C is about rockets - practical rockets that exist at the intersection of cost, capability, part count, ease of operation, and tech requirements. Building a rocket that has almost as much capability as an optimized design, while having a lower part count and costing a fraction of the funds \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 this is the C\u0026amp;C way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the entries to follow, I\u0027m going to set forth what I\u0027ve learned in a number of \u0022Rules of Thumb\u0022 for doing things the C\u0026amp;C way. Those wanting pretty graphs and detailed analysis may be disappointed. Healthy debate and alternate viewpoints are welcome. Snarky comments and trolling are not. While the majority of the discussion will be about lifters, we\u0027ll also talk about other types of craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo demonstrate what I\u0027m talking about, I\u0027ve inserted below the namesake Cheap and Cheerful lifter which was the inspiration for this thread. It was a 1.0.2 entry in Red Iron Crown\u0027s payload mass fraction challenge, and got 20.9 tons of inert payload into LKO. The entire rocket, including payload, was 36,775 funds, while still getting over 20% payload mass fraction to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/gNoAN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

SRBs\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny discussion of Cheap and Cheerful design has to start with SRBs. They\u0027re one of the cornerstones of C\u0026amp;C design. Here are my Rules of Thumb (RoT) for SRBs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERoT 1.1 - Use SRBs in your designs, but generally only as part of the first stage. \u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESRBs are cheap for the thrust that you get. They\u0027re also heavy, and their vacuum Isp stinks. Use them where these disadvantages are minimized, which is the first stage. Sure, you can use them as a second stage, particularly early in career mode or when cheaply lofting a satellite into orbit; but generally, keep them on the first stage where they belong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERoT 1.2 - Use fewer, larger SRBs whenever possible.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESRBs are more useful as they get larger. The Flea isn\u0027t good for anything, IMHO, other than providing a \u0022holy crap what is happening\u0022 moment for new players the first time they launch a rocket in career. Hammer starts to get useful, BACC is definitely useful, and the Kickback is awesome. Not only does the cost go down on a unit of thrust per unit of time basis with the larger rockets, but mounting hardware costs stay the same - i.e., both the Hammer and the Kickback can be attached with a single radial decoupler, and possibly a nose cone. But one provides 227 kN of thrust for 24 seconds, and the other provides 670 kN of thrust for over a minute. Radial decouplers and nose cones are always justified for Kickbacks, sometimes for BACCs, and rarely for Hammers and Fleas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERoT 1.3 - Keep SRB costs low by taking advantage of surface attachment.\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESRBs are awesome in that they combine an engine and a fuel tank into a single surface attachable part. While it may take a little experimentation, it\u0027s entirely possible to create bottom stages made entirely out of SRBs radially attached to a center SRB or LFO tank, with the whole mess connected to the next stage via a single stack decoupler. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERoT 1.4 - It\u0027s generally a good idea to tweak SRB thrust levels in the VAB. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a rare occasion when it\u0027s appropriate to use an SRB full throttle. Generally you should tweak the thrust levels so that you have an appropriate initial SLT TWR (generally somewhere between 1.2 and 1.5, depending on a variety of factors). This may be difficult if you don\u0027t use MechJeb or Kerbal Engineer Redux to have accurate TWR info in the VAB. Another benefit of tweaking thrust is that it reduces the chance of overheating, which can happen when you\u0027re surface attaching SRBs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERot 1.5 - Put a larger payload on top of an SRB-only first stage if you\u0027re having problems.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany players have tried using an SRB-only first stage. It can work well in early career, but things can be difficult once the BACC and Kickback are tried. One of the problems is the huge difference in TWR levels between a full SRB and an empty one. The solution is easy, but not entirely intuitive - put more payload on the SRB. If you don\u0027t have enough, you\u0027ll accelerate really quickly in the lower atmosphere, potentially with overheating and control problems. But if you give it a larger payload, TWR swings are minimized.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2. Non-Part Mods\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I get any further, I think it\u0027s a good idea to talk about mods. I don\u0027t think anyone should hesitate to use mods which give you information which is critical to designing and constructing your rockets, or give you more flexibility in rocket design. With that in mind, consider the following mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERoT 2.1 - MechJeb or KER give you useful TWR and Delta V readouts when designing rockets.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis may seem obvious to most, but I\u0027ll come out and say it anyway - use \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/18230-1-0-4-Kerbal-Engineer-Redux-v1-0-18-0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/a\u003E or \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124336\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMechJeb\u003C/a\u003E for TWR and Delta V readouts when designing rockets.

LFO Engines\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiquid Fuel and Oxidizer engines (LFO for short) have a crucial role in C\u0026amp;C design, although they may be used slightly differently than in more traditional applications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERoT 3.1 - Almost always use gimbaling LFO engines.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the major strengths of LFO engines compared to stock SRBs is their ability to gimbal, i.e. steer the rocket using off-axis thrust. Gimbaling engines provide strong positive control authority in both atmosphere and vacuum. The exceptions to this rule are for very small engines (such as the Ant) where the probe core or capsule provides enough attitude control, and the LVT-30 in the early game when you don\u0027t have anything better. Once you have gimbaling engines unlocked, they should be just about the only LFO engines you use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERoT 3.2 - Match tank and engine diameters for lifters.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhenever you change diameters in a rocket stack, you end up using extra parts (adapters, fairings) which drive up the price, along with additional aerodynamic considerations. In general, keep all your tanks and lifters the same diameter (i.e., 1.25m engines under 1.25m tanks, 2.5m engines under 2.5m tanks, etc.) for each stack. Minimizing the extra \u0022bits and bobs\u0022 which add cost and weight is a key part of C\u0026amp;C design. Once you\u0027re out of the atmosphere, this rule is much less important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERoT 3.3 - Run your LFO engines for at least two minutes in your lifters.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELFO engines are more expensive than SRBs for the same thrust. To maximize the return on your engine investment, it\u0027s important to fire those LFO engines for as long as you reasonably can. The RoT is to put enough fuel tanks on top of each engine so that it will run for at least two minutes, possibly longer. If this reduces your TWR to a level which is too low, then it\u0027s time to bring in the SRBs. Also note that this RoT can be averaged in the case of asparagus lifters (which are not the first choice for C\u0026amp;C design, BTW) where the center stack ends up firing for a very long time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERoT 3.4 - LFO transfer stages should have a TWR between 0.3 and 1.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your TWR is too low, you\u0027re going to have trouble making an accurate transfer in a single burn and will start incurring major steering losses. If your TWR is too high, then you either brought too much engine (and made your rocket too expensive) or aren\u0027t pushing enough fuel for the thrust you have (and aren\u0027t maximizing the return on your LFO engine).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERoT 3.5 - Most LFO landers should have an initial TWR between 2 and 5 for the body that they\u0027re landing on.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s always exciting when landing on the Mun or Minmus for the first time. Those new to the game or not well versed in design will frequently overbuild their landers, hauling around way more engine mass than they need. Slapping a Terrier on the bottom of a Rockomax 16 works great as the power section for a Mun lander, while a Minmus lander can get away with just a Spark under a Rockomax 8. Keep those initial TWRs low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERoT 3.6 - For serial staged LFO rockets, the upper stage should have thrust between 1/3 and 1/6 of the lower stage.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to get maximum return from your first stage LFO engine, you need to stack a lot of fuel on it - at least two orange tanks for a Mainsail, and at least 3/4 of an orange tank for a Skipper. When you do stage, the next engine should be substantially less powerful. In addition, the need for higher thrust levels goes down towards the end of a burn to LKO. So long as the first part of the launch has a healthy TWR, the last 500 to 700 m/s to reach orbit can be at a TWR which is significantly below 1. The lowest I\u0027ve gone is 0.42, but 0.5 or 0.6 should be workable in most situations. This can actually be a bit of a problem with 3.75 meter rockets, since one engine is half the thrust of the other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERoT 3.7 - 2.5m engines are in the sweet spot.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany C\u0026amp;C lifters will use 2.5m LFO engines, since they tend to occupy the happy middle ground between cost, performance, and tech requirements. There is nothing wrong with a rocket which uses only Mainsails, Skippers, and Poodles. They can also be augmented with a small number of SRBs, (such as two Kickbacks with a Skipper) which keeps the decoupler and nose cone costs down.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-11T04:28:13Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2015 04:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Norcalplanner\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"silent_prtoagonist","CreatedById":1927,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-08T22:09:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis reminds me a bit of the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_dumb_booster\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ebig dumb booster\u003C/a\u003E concept, I like it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Looking forward to reading more.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Norcalplanner","CreatedById":112223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T15:09:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022silent_prtoagonist\u0022 data-cite=\u0022silent_prtoagonist\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis reminds me a bit of the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_dumb_booster\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ebig dumb booster\u003C/a\u003E concept, I like it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Looking forward to reading more.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s more than a little overlap between BDB and C\u0026amp;C.

Fuel cells are heavier, more expensive, and slowly use up your craft\u0027s fuel supply. RTGs are horrendously expensive, heavier, and not available until the end of the tech tree.

Aerodynamics\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerodynamics is one of the areas where Cheap and Cheerful can depart a bit further from standard design. When discussing aerodynamics, I\u0027m specifically talking about nosecones, fairings, fins, and conical rocket parts. From a C\u0026amp;C perspective, aerodynamic features can add significant cost and weight, and must be considered not only on their merits, but holistically as part of the entire rocket system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERoT 6.1 - Put your best nosecone on the center stack.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust as it\u0027s a good idea to run your LFO engines as long as possible to extract maximum value from them, it\u0027s also a good idea to put your best aerodynamic nosecone on the center stack, where it will be used for the longest. Depending on how long a radial stage is burning, it may make sense to have the same nosecone as the center stack. It\u0027s generally worthwhile to put an advanced nosecone on a Kickback, and a basic nosecone on a BACC. Hammers may or may not be worthy of a nosecone. Fleas are... well, I\u0027ll just repeat my earlier statement that Fleas are useless, IMHO. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERoT 6.2 - Rarely use fairings; but if you do, don\u0027t skimp.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFairings are fairly (ba-dum) expensive in KSP, and should generally be avoided. If you have just a few things attached radially on your payload (science experiments, small solar panels) then a fairing isn\u0027t justified. When you start having larger items (Gigantor solar panels, docking ports, landing legs) on the side of your payload, it may be time for a fairing. This is especially true if you\u0027re also having problems with the rocket flipping. Once you do decide to use a fairing, go ahead and cover everything you reasonably can, and make it fairly pointy - the vast majority of the cost is in the fairing base, not the fairing itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERot 6.3 - Rarely use fins. If you do need them, try the cheapest ones first.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany rockets need no fins whatsoever. If you have a reasonably aerodynamic front end of the rocket, and some workable level of control authority (gimbaling engine or substantial reaction wheels) then there shouldn\u0027t be any need for fins. If you do have trouble with your rocket flipping over, despite using a proper flight profile (staying close to the prograde marker), then try adding four of the smallest fixed fins to the very bottom of the rocket. Only if that doesn\u0027t work should you go for the larger and more expensive fins. Keep in mind that the cost of fins (particularly controllable fins) can quickly add up, and should be weighed against the cost of other solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERoT 6.4 - Fins should generally be used in groups of four.

Not only does it track straighter, but the computer seems to be able to predict what the craft will do better. If you do decide to go down to three fins, place the first fin (the one you\u0027re controlling with the mouse) on the E or W side of the rocket. If you place it on the N or S side, then things will get a little weird when you start your gravity turn. Also note that you can vary the amount of authority the fins have by altering the height they\u0027re mounted on the rocket. If you\u0027re finding it too hard to turn with fixed fins, move them up higher on the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERoT 6.5 - Use the C7 conical tank as much as you can.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe C7 conical tank, which smoothly transitions your rocket from 1.25m to 2.5m, has the same fuel capacity \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eand cost\u003C/span\u003E as an FLT-800 or a Rockomax-8.

Unless you\u0027re using a mod that has 2.5m SRBs, all of your 2.5m radial stacks should have a C7 conical tank and a 1.25m nosecone on top. In my testing, the combination of the C7 tank plus an advanced nose cone was the best performer for 2.5m stacks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERoT 6.6 - Look at aerodynamics as part of a larger system. Not every aerodynamic problem is worthy of attention, and some solutions don\u0027t involve aerodynamic parts.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause the cost of aerodynamic parts is relatively high for something that produces no thrust, you have to consider what makes the most sense. For example, an advanced nosecone costs 320 funds, while a Hammer costs 400.

You may be able to live with suboptimal aero on your ejected stages, particularly if they\u0027re being ejected before you go supersonic. If you have an ascent that is too vertical because you don\u0027t have any fins and are relying on reaction wheels for an SRB-only first stage, you have to weigh the cost of the fins against the cost of increasing the fuel in a subsequent stage to compensate for the steering and aero losses. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERoT 6.7 - Look at Fuel Tanks Plus for aerodynamic fuel tanks, including nosecones.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know I already plugged it once, but I would be remiss in not mentioning the aero components of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108238\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFuel Tanks Plus\u003C/a\u003E.

If you\u0027re using MechJeb, then SmartASS provides all the capability (holding prograde/retrograde, etc.) of the more expensive probe cores. The only time you shouldn\u0027t use the OKTO is when you really need the 1.25m form factor, such as on the front of a manned capsule and/or beneath a docking port. In those cases, use the RC-001S. The only other probe core you should even consider is the RC-L01, and then only when the craft needs the 2.5m form factor (such as being inline close to the center of a space station).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERoT 7.2 - Use only a single 1.25m or 2.5m reaction wheel.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe smallest (0.625m) reaction wheel has a strength of 5. The 1.25m reaction wheel has twice the mass and cost, but triple the strength (15). The 2.5m reaction wheel has twice the mass and strength of the 1.25m wheel, but less than twice the cost. Avoid using the tiny reaction wheel, and stick with the medium and large diameter versions, assuming that you need one at all. Try to use only one whenever possible. Yes, you can break this rule for something big that you\u0027re going to be interacting with a lot, such as a Jool mothership weighing several hundred tons.

Only put on a second group of thrusters if you\u0027re having trouble with a lot of wobble, or will be docking with vastly different fuel states.

Essentially, you would need to look at how much it would cost to achieve the same science objectives using one or more chemical rockets and whether or not you can recover the instrumentation anywhere near KSC after the end of its flight. The initial cost difference in lifting a 1 ton ion probe vs. an 8 ton multi-stage LFO probe isn\u0027t all that great, but the chemical one would require more engines and decouplers, which drives up the price a little bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENuclear really comes into its own when there\u0027s a large payload involved. Without a payload, an FLT-800 with a Terrier has approximately the same delta V as an LF-only tank of the same size being pushed by an an LV-N, and the Terrier setup is 1/8 the cost and 2.5 tons less to orbit. Once you start adding larger payloads though, so that the greater weight of the LV-N ceases to be such a disadvantage, then it makes more sense to go nuclear. This is especially true if it\u0027s a station or mothership that is going to be used for many missions. I just did a quick test - five LV-Ns pushing an 81-ton payload required a 40-ton LF tank to have over 2,000 m/s of delta V. The same solution using LFO and a Rhino required over a hundred tons of LFO tankage for the same Delta V. The nuclear solution was 27,000 funds more, but it would cost more than 27,000 funds to loft the additional 60 tons of LFO tanks, so a nuclear solution is superior in this scenario. One thing I would add is that the nuclear TWR was only 0.23, and would need to use multiple periapsis kicks if it was doing a transfer to Jool, whereas the Rhino could do it in a single burn. Of course, if you have a good mining and refining setup and can refuel things in orbit cheaply, then things change again, and not in entirely predictable ways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn RLA, I\u0027ve only ever used that mod as part of RSS/RO, so I don\u0027t know its strengths and weaknesses in the standard Kerbal universe. Give me a few days to play with it and I should be able to form an opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding balance issues, I agree that using and abusing docking ports is gamey, and I wouldn\u0027t do it in a RP situation (such as my Apollo Applications Program save for that particular challenge). In terms of balance, it seems to me that the easiest thing would be change things so that that docking ports can only connect to a decoupler, stack separator, or another docking port. I\u0027d also look at increasing the price of the 1.25m docking port so that it\u0027s not significantly cheaper than a 1.25m stack decoupler. Are there any other hacky tricks you\u0027re thinking of?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again for all the great questions. I\u0027ll see if I can get you an answer on the RLA issue sometime soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAddendum -\u003C/strong\u003E After doing some testing with LFO probes and ion probes, including the cost of their respective launchers, I\u0027ve been able to refine things a bit. If you\u0027ve unlocked the entire tech tree, then it makes financial sense to use an ion-powered probe if your flight plan needs more than 9,000\u002B/- m/s of delta V and you can make the whole thing work with only solar panels and batteries (no fuel cells). Otherwise, it\u0027s better to use a multi-stage 8- to 10-ton LFO probe. I would also note that the parts for the LFO probe are available earlier in the tech tree, that it has better TWR than the ion probe, and has better burn capabilities out past Dres. In terms of lifter cost, the LFO probe\u0027s lifter costs $15K, while the ion probe\u0027s lifter costs $4K. The entire ion probe rocket (including lifter) is $3K more expensive than the LFO probe rocket, but the ion version had 500 m/s more delta v.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAddendum No. 2 - \u003C/strong\u003EAfter playing around with RLA a bit, I\u0027ve come to some conclusions: 1) whoever made the mod really loves probes and monoprop; 2) there\u0027s some overlap with SpaceY in terms of 0.625 meter fuel tanks, RCS thruster blocks, and SRBs; 3) there are some nice probe cores that fill out the range a bit; and 4) several of the monoprop engines seem OP compared to stock. Because of the lower empty tank mass fraction of monoprop compared to xenon, and the much lower price of monoprop, several configurations I tested with hybrid electric/monoprop engines were superior to xenon at a lower price. However, even the straight monoprop engines had a very high vacuum Isp (340) compared to stock. On the whole, I\u0027d say that the straight monoprop engines are slightly OP, and the hybrid monoprop engines are much closer to Near Future Propulsion than they are to stock.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-15T05:13:42Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2015 05:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Norcalplanner\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Emore ion info, clarified a few things, added RLA info\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"passinglurker","CreatedById":103157,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-17T03:05:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn RLA I believe the higher vacuum isp of the monoprop engines was an effort to find a niche for the engine type since the real world advantages of this type of engine can\u0027t be simulated in KSP (reliability and no boil off) as a result compared to LFO a monoprop system with equivalent DV would have less mass but also less TWR (classic thrust for isp trade off that bridges the gap between chemical and nuclear) I hadn\u0027t considered the xenon angle before its high cost because they tried to emulate a real world element instead of an abstract resource like the rest throws a lot of wrenches in the works in terms of game balance (for example you can\u0027t ISRU xenon because you could fund your space program just drilling ore on kerbin.) though as you\u0027ve shown you can make LFO probes on par with xenon cost wise already, but without the inconveniently low twr so one could argue they are already essentially obsolete especially for a late game career with maxed buildings, ISRU, and a healthy budget so knowing the engines leave xenon in the dust I\u0027m curious how they stack against nuclear and chemical.

Love your chart app, BTW.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, I\u0027ve only used linear ports once, and that was a long time ago. But now that I\u0027m looking at the stats and thinking about the geometry, I think there could be a scenario where they would work. If you had sufficient rotational control authority via reaction wheels, then four ports placed around the CoM should give adequate translation ability. You could use the main engine on the craft to thrust forward, and would need two symmetrical ports on the front of the craft, on either side of the docking port, to slow down and reverse. The six ports would give the same translation authority as four of the multi-directional ports (one port at 2 kN vs. two ports at 1kN each) at a slight savings in cost (1680 funds vs. 2480 funds) and weight (0.18 tons vs. 0.20 tons) but with two more parts. My gut tells me that wobble will be a bigger problem if the ports aren\u0027t right over the CoM. I\u0027ll need to test this in game before deciding if it\u0027s a good or bad idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI may have to also try my other oddball RCS idea - that it\u0027s possible to dock a craft using only two multi-way RCS blocks. Since you\u0027d only get translation in one axis, you\u0027d have to rotate the craft around its long axis to align the thrusters with the needed translation vector for every correction. Sounds a bit crazy, but I bet that Jeb would be up for it. If he can get it to work, it would be the cheapest, lowest weight, and lowest part count solution for RCS-assisted docking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
