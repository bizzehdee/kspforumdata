But it should be noted that the settings file has three sections for terrain. Each preset (low, default, and high) has it\u0027s own section in the settings file.

My point of reference was starting a new sandbox game and looking at KSC without moving, with normal shadow settings, best rendering quality and high textures at 1280x800 on a Radeon 6850 1GB Barts Pro. Doing this increased my frame rate from 30, to 34 or 35 in default (increase of about 15%). Regular low detail is higher at about 39 fps in the same reference point, but default land terrain definitely looks better than low, and I couldn\u0027t tell a difference with whatever ocean terrain might be because I guess this only changes what\u0027s underwater. I use a lot of mods though also, which has me confused as to why this helps me since my GPU is newer and faster technology-wise than my CPU.
