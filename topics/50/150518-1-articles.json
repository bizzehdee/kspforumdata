Decided to convert the spreadsheet to google docs and make it available to the public here.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SJcB8x4P4t25jtWR-0TS-06R8Dq5OSslS5R964H32UM/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SJcB8x4P4t25jtWR-0TS-06R8Dq5OSslS5R964H32UM/edit?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sheet is only lightly protected in that you\u0027ll get a warning if you attempt to modify a field that I didn\u0027t intend on having modified. The cells that are intended on being modified have yellow backgrounds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, the sheet displays the synchronous orbital altitudes for each planet and moon (background goes red if the orbit is beyond the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E of the planet or moon) and additionally, gives a \u0022holding altitude\u0022 if you wish to precisely position a synchronous satellite over a specific location on the planet. For instance, let\u0027s assume you wish to have a synchronous satellite directly over the launch pad at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. The longitude for that launchpad is at\u00A0 \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial, sans, sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:pre-wrap;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);float:none;\u0022\u003E74\u00B033\u002727\u0022\u003C/span\u003E W. \u00A0Using the spreadsheet, you can see the \u0022Target Underneath\u0022 row and get your satellite into a circular orbit with an altitude of 10,343,473 meters. Then wait until you\u0027re directly over \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Once that happens, perform a retrograde burn to drop your periapsis to\u00A0\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:13px;font-family:arial, sans, sans-serif;text-align:right;\u0022\u003E2,862,940.708\u003C/span\u003E meters\u00A0and when you reach periapsis, circularize your orbit and you should be positioned directly over \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. If 10,343 kilometers is inconveniently high (after all, it\u0027s high enough to be captured by the Mun), you can put a non-zero integer value into the extra orbits cell and instead of circularizing the first time you reach periapsis after your retrograde burn, you add in the number of extra orbits you specified. For instance changing extra orbits from 0 to 1 changes the holding orbit altitude from 10,343 kilometers to 5,673 kilometers. The bottom of the sheet has the calculations for the resonate orbit required to deposit satellites at a desired altitude. It performs the calculations for performing an insertion at the apoapsis of the resonate orbit or the periapsis of the resonate orbit. Just get your bus into the proper orbit and then release and circularize each satellite when the bus reaches the desired apoapsis or periapsis.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn any case, suggestions and improvements are welcome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
