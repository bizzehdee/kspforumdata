wondering if it\u0027s actually possible to collect science results while landed in Kerbin\u0027s water or splashed down in the deserts.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe answer is yes for Vanilla KSP as of 1.4.5.\u00A0 You can \u0022land\u0022 in the water by getting a craft to the ocean floor out beyond the limit of the shore biomes, and there are lakes or rivers for each of the major biomes\u00A0that you can splash down in, and I\u0027m going to list the coordinates for the latter below.\u00A0 For an added challenge, in addition to getting the raw science by running and recovering the standard experiments, you can run the experiments, transport them back to KSP by any means of transport you like, and instead of recovering the experiments, launch them into orbit where they can be processed in a mobile sci lab for more sweet science.\u00A0 (Or converted to reputation or funds via strategy, since science from the Mun or Minmus yields more science points for the same effort.)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nGetting landed in water is just a matter of getting a craft to the ocean floor by making a submarine or a craft that\u0027s too heavy to float.\u00A0 Ore tanks full of ore do the job nicely, and you can adjust the amount of ore a craft has at launch to greater than zero the same way you can adjust the fuel, oxidizer or mp in a tank.\u00A0 You can also map the \u0022jettison tank contents\u0022 action to an action group to dump the ore and regain buoyancy and return your sub to the surface.\u00A0 Note air breathing jet engines can get oxygen from underwater... somehow...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI used a modified version of kantokris\u0027 Mini Submarine Mk 3.\u00A0 I replaced the claw at the front of the craft with a materials bay studded with experiments, and added some detachable landing gear as a launching frame.\u00A0 I\u0027m not sure kantokris knew you could just start with full tanks of of ore, so you can possibly dispense with the drills and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E as well.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca

one...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs noted above, splashing down in land biomes is just a matter of finding a lake or river that isn\u0027t a water or shore biome.\u00A0 I find a supersonic science \u0022dive bomber\u0022 works well here.\u00A0 Create a custom waypoint with the Waypoint Manager mod using the coordinates below and fly towards your target.\u00A0 Decelerate down to subsonic speeds and drop into the lower atmosphere once you get near your target, then kill the engines and go into a dive straight towards your target body of water.\u00A0 Once you\u0027re under the 1000 m limit (ALL lakes and rivers are at a 0m altitude), deploy a buttload of chutes and fall gently down for a nice splash down.\u00A0 Stall to get to a safe velocity before doing so if you need to.\u00A0 (Doing the same with landing gear is handy for soft landings with planes is rough terrain as well, FYI.)\u00A0 In two cases, there are several biomes available in the same body of water a short distance away from each other.\u00A0 You can also deploy landing gear in the water and use some low power jet thrust to get your plane up safely onto the shoreline, but make sure you aim for a gentle slope before trying this.\u00A0 If your plane has a probe for flight control and only one seat, you\u0027ll have to choose whether you want to send a scientist (cleans experiments for more than one result), or an engineer (repacks chutes for multiple landings).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBelow are the coordinates for each biome\u0027s splash down location, thanks to \u003Ca

them.\u00A0 Note that you can customize MechJeb\u0027s surface info window to add the surface biome your craft is in or over.\u00A0 If you have the ScanSat mod and want to try and find some locations yourself, look for locations with the target biome that have an altitude of less than 0m.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nShores: You really should be able to work this out for yourself...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nGrasslands: 3\u00B056\u002745\u0022 S 83\u00B040\u002753\u0022 W\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEasily reached by going S/SE along the coast from \u003Cabbr

only splash down locations for their respective biomes.\u00A0 This is in the river system on the large area of grasslands and highlands north of Baikanur and the great desert.\u00A0 Splash down in the river near the target coordinates and cozy up to the cliffside on the western edge.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMountains: 47\u00B028\u002717\u0022 N 140\u00B04\u002724\u0022 W\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nJust north of the above highlands splash down point in the same river.\u00A0 Cozy up the west edge of the cliff again.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBadlands: 17\u00B050\u002727\u0022 S 30\u00B019\u002723\u0022 E\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is probably the nearest Badlands lake to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, but it\u0027s a bit of a pain to taxi back out of owing to the steep banks, if that\u0027s what you want to do.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTundra:

W\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs you get close enough to the near vertical ice cap wall on the eastern edge of the lake, you transition from splashed down in the ice caps to splashed down in the northern ice shelf.\u00A0 This is arguably buggy, and you can get this splashed down biome \u0022fairly\u0022 by splashing down in the ocean just south of the edge of the ice shelf and then taxiing up to the vertical shelf.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSouthern Ice Shelf: 74\u00B039\u002743\u0022 S 57\u00B031\u00279\u0022 W\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPretty much head south from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E over the sea, and splash down near this point in front of the southern ice shelf.\u00A0 There are other places in a more direct line from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E where the ice shelf biome juts out into the sea, but this one is conveniently located near a beach if you want to get
