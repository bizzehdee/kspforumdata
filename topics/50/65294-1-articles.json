Place a maneuver node on your Kerbin orbit and try both tugging on the adjusters, and moving the whole node around in your orbit. It may take some doing, but you should eventually get close enough to see the \u0022closest approach\u0022 icons, and then you can see how you need to adjust from there. If it\u0027s still not coming together, fine-tune by plotting a mid-course correction.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor831","CreatedById":68286,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-09T17:29:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could get MechJeb and see how it plots the Hohmann transfers.

Ejection Burn - Burn to escape your source SOI and head in the general direction of your destination. Best if done at the optimal window (e.g. Kerbin -\u0026gt; Duna with a phase angle of 44.38 degrees).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. MCC at SOI change - When you leave Kerbin SOI, a mid-coarse correction is a good idea to correct residual errors from the first burn. Once out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI - it gets much easier to be precise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. MCC at Ascending / Descending node - Used to change your orbital plane to match the target\u0027s. This is often the first time you will actually see encounter details for the target SOI encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Encounter - As soon as you enter the target\u0027s SOI, a burn is planned to adjust your approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo answer your question, \u0022What\u0027s going on?\u0022 I bet you have the X, Z, and T coordinates correct - but are missing the Y. Intercepting another planet requires correct positioning in four dimensions - X,Y,Z, and T(time). Too far to the Left or Right, and you miss. Too far Out or In, and you miss, Too far Up or Down (which is likely what is being missed in your case...) and you miss. Too Early or Late, and you miss.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
