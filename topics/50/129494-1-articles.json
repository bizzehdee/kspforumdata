Thank you for tuning in. Today on the show, we are discussing methods to detect imminent death, and possibly some ways to avoid it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ci\u003EAre your rockets exploding often? Do you not enjoy dying a cold and miserable death in interplanetary space? Than this guide is for you!\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026gt;Spotting potential disaster at LKO:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLow Kerbin Orbit, or LKO, is a common first chapter to any good space mission. But it\u0027s also a place where many things can go wrong. Here\u0027s a short list of possibilities:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1: Used stages coming back uninvited.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImagine this: You\u0027re in a massive interstellar tug, with 10000 m/s of Delta-V that you just launched with a huge, asparagus staged rocket. Out of the corner of your eye, you see a flash of orange. No, it\u0027s not a meteorite. It\u0027s a 4.5 ton empty fuel tank traveling at a relative velocity of 60 m/s, tumbling at you. And it\u0027s all over. Here\u0027s why it happens: When you jettison a empty stage after you\u0027ve reached a stable orbit, do not forget that it\u0027s still there. And the decoupling force will have changed its orbit slightly. So, when you begin your transfer burn with low TWR engines, your changing orbit might intersect with the debris\u0027 one. And\u00A0unlike previously orbiting debris, the relative velocity is low enough to render the collision.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMethod 1: To guarantee a much safer orbit, raise your apoapsis 40 meters or so (assuming you were in a circular orbit) and then circularize. Always works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMethod 2: Jettison the second stage before you stablize your orbit, and finish the burn with your second stage one. A bit of a waste of dV, but probably worth it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2: Accidental reentry:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRCS is like a fine cheese: It causes garlic breath and makes you sick. Jokes aside, if\u00A0your RCS placement is not perfectly balanced, using it will cause orbital fluctuations. Sometimes, when you\u0027re using it for a prograde/retrograde hole\u00A0in conjunction with a engine gimbal, it might end up never stabilizing due to the momentum from the engine gimbal. If the RCS blocks are thrusting toward each other, you\u0027ve probably got this problem. Check your orbits once in a while.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMethod 1: Get some reaction wheels. Thank me for this tip. Profit!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMethod 2: Use the RCS balancer mod.

And it may be your last if you aren\u0027t careful. Here\u0027s some things to watch out for:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1:\u00A0Staging errors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA novice mistake, but a debilitating one nonetheless. One easy trick: make sure your first stage (the biggest number on the left) has no decouplers or parachutes on it. Also make sure your launch clamps, if you have any, are on the stage with the engines. Or bad things will happen. Very bad things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2: Air-assisted decoupling\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNotice your asparagus staging sagging a little? That\u0027s natural. Notice your fuel tanks ressemble gelatin dessert? That\u0027s not good. What tends to happen is that the radial mounted engines, when not aquedately strutted, can decide to go to space without the rest of your spacecraft. This in itself is a reasonably bad thing, but what\u0027s worse is that they seem to be attracted to the central part of your ship. And they\u0027ll crash into it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMethod 1: Struts. Attach them to the radial tanks and link the other end to the central shaft. Need proof that it works?
