In this tutorial I will be showing you how to get to Munar orbit, Munar surface and return Jeb safely home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMatireals\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nmamoth engines (x3)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe thinnest decopler you can find\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nlargest Mk3 fuel tanks\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nrhino engine\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMk2 command pod\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMk2 orange parachute\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nlarge landing legs\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nmedium Mk2 fuel tank\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\npoodle liquid fuel engine\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nstruts\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMk3 to Mk2 adapter\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nassemble\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0take the Mk2 command pod and\u00A0attach it with the parachute. Next throw a brand decopler under the command module. \u00A0Add the medium fuel tank, poodle and landing legs\u00A0( with symmetry on 4) to the under side of the decopler. This is our lander. Add another brand decopler followed by the adapter, 1 large Mk3 fuel tank and rhino engine. This is our upper stage. Add the small decopler under the rhino and add 3 large Mk3 tanks. Turn symmetry to two and add 2 Mk3 fuel tanks on top of each other. Add a Mk3 adapter on both sides, followed by a Mk2 adapter and then an advance nosecone type b. Add struts on each side to stabilize the rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nlaunch\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfirst get into an orbit of about 80km. If you don\u2019t know how, you can look at making and executing maneuver nodes. You should have burned all the first stage and half of the second stage. This is fine for our next step doesn\u2019t need a lot of delta v ( fuel, or change in velocity).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeting to Mun\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfirst set Mun as your target by clicking it and clicking \u201Cset target\u201D. Next\u00A0add a maneuver node at your Periapsis and drag it to Mach Muns orbit. If a lot of lines don\u2019t appear, drag the node on your orbit until they do. The yellow line with the circle on it means when you get your encounter. Execute the maneuver and time warp by pressing . and when you get to the circle press , and a line that has pe on it should appear. Add a maneuver node at the Periapsis and turn it until you get an apalaps. Execute your maneuver and congratulations, you are in orbit around Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nlanding\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDitch the transfer stage and make a maneuver node that turns down on to the light side of Mun. Execute, extend landing legs by pressing G and burn your fuel until your velocity ( on top of the nav ball) is at or under 10 m/s. Congratulations you have landed on the Mun. You can EVA Jebediah and have him walk on the Mun. That\u2019s one small step for Jeb, one giant leap for Kerman. Near the lander you can right click on Jeb and click plant flag. He\u2019ll plant a flag and you can write the name of your landing site.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nComing home\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ncoming home is the same as going to Mun. Get an encounter, orbit and land. Deploy your chutes and you have complete your long journey\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
