If you have \u003Cstrong\u003Ebad FPS while looking at Kerbin while in orbit\u003C/strong\u003E or while launching even small spacecraft, this should fix this issue (not if you are trying to launch a ship with 1000\u002B parts - this is not aimed to improve on that but should still improve FPS overall).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, in your root KSP folder, replace the \u003Cem\u003Esettings.cfg\u003C/em\u003E with the one I made:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/fps-fix-performance-tweak-guide/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/fps-fix-performance-tweak-guide/\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made 2 custom Terrain presets: \u003Cem\u003EPerformance\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003EOptimal\u003C/em\u003E - I suggest you try the \u003Cem\u003EOptimal\u003C/em\u003E first. All 3 Terrain settings should perform better than ever thanks to a low \u003Cem\u003EminDistance\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003EmaxSubdivision\u003C/em\u003E values on all water in the game.

I use my native 1920x1080 \u003Cem\u003E(I changed it to 1280x720 in the .cfg so it\u0027s not larger than anyone\u0027s native res. because that may cause KSP to crash or whatnot)\u003C/em\u003E, I suggest you start from the highest your display can support (your monitor\u0027s native resolution) - you may be pleasantly surprised by the performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have your highest optimal resolution set, feel free to change any settings you think your hardware can handle.

To decrease your loading time when starting-up KSP, use lower-resolution textures for your mods, or simply use less mods.
