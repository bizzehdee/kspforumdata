boosters to connect to a single upper stage. \u00A0One booster means the lousy\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E that makes the old \u0022minimum tech\u0022 less fun to fly\u00A0and three would have bad ISPs that eat too much into the mass budget (and mean less precious FL-T100s). \u00A0Connect the \u0022no tech\u0022 modular girder segment to the TR-18A and put the RT-10s on with symmetry.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nOn my first try this managed getting into orbit with 313m/s of delta-v to spare (and 282 m/s after a deorbit burn). \u00A0That might be what the space shuttle had in its orbital maneuver\u00A0engines, but it seems pretty low without Houston computing all your moves for you. \u00A0I\u0027d recommend it for combining a \u0022tourist in space\u0022 with your first orbital flight, or possibly a scientist and pilot team (for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and experiment resets). \u00A0While it might have less delta-v according to Kerbal Engineer (didn\u0027t check, a previous test with three stages and a LV-30 engine had more delta-v but didn\u0027t make orbit: I suspect that the K.E. edition I have is sufficiently \u0022updated\u0022 to work with 1.2, the values need fixing), the high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E means less gravity losses and more than makes up for the missing \u0022official delta-v\u0022. \u00A0I suspect that reducing thrust would also help, but I won\u0027t play with that until I think K.E. is working (or feel like manually doing the calculation).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOddly enough, an earlier all-liquid fuel try that used a LV-30 first stage only had 281 m/s after orbit, and a three-stage attempt (that K.E. said had more delta-v) didn\u0027t make it into orbit at all. \u00A0I didn\u0027t expect SRBs to help (they don\u0027t appear to help as a third stage) until I noticed that LV-30s and T200s require more tech than you had used.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium
