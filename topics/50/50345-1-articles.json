Needless to say, that poor little laptop\u0027s 1.6 GHz single-core i5 couldn\u0027t handle the game. Great for web-browsing, but definitely not KSP. So, just recently, I got a new 3.6 GHz dual-core i7 MacBook Pro. The performance increase was amazing. So, good hardware is essential. No matter what, if you\u0027re going to play KSP, don\u0027t get a quad-core. Quad-cores are very fast, but KSP isn\u0027t 64-bit and doesn\u0027t support multiple cores at the moment because it runs on Unity, so make sure to get a computer with high individual core speed. For example: a 3.2 GHz dual-core i7 would be better for KSP than a 2.6 GHz quad-core i7.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2: Settings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELag at launch is an issue.

In general quad-core CPUs are all-around faster than dual-cores, especially on the desktop where dual-core is limited mostly to low end options. Pretty much every modern CPU has some kind of turboboost; when you\u0027re playing KSP it usually runs at the dual-core speed unless you have heat issues. So even in laptops there is little to gain by sticking with dual-core only (high end quad-core mobile CPUs can get quite expensive, and aren\u0027t generally available in ultrabooks, but those are different issues).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe graphics setting you want to turn down during launch, or really all of the time, is the terrain settings value. The best option is to use the ocean terrain setting tweak found here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43253-Default-Terrain-Quality-Without-most-of-The-Lag%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43253-Default-Terrain-Quality-Without-most-of-The-Lag%21\u003C/a\u003E.

You might be able to get away with 0.02 or 0.01, but this can cause issues, and in any case will make the launches of big crafts excruciatingly long. This setting defines the amount of in-game time that can pass between each frame (or really it\u0027s the max amount of time between physics steps). So at the lowest setting, 0.03 sec/frame, only 30 milliseconds of time can pass for each frame displayed on screen. Anything below 33 frames / second will result in in-game time running slower than real-world time. At the extreme ends, below 5 FPS, this can really slow things down; only 150 milliseconds of game-time for each second of real-time, making your 5 min launch more like 40 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dangerous_Beans","CreatedById":78059,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T04:16:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E#1 isn\u0027t really accurate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efirstly you need to consider performance per clock, a modern processor is going to outperform a 5 year old one even at the same clock speeds, because the modern one is more efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esecondly, you need to consider turbo and or overclocking. a core i3-4340 is a dual core at 3.6ghz, while a core 4670k is a quad core at 3.4ghz, so by your logic the 4340 is better (dual core, and faster base clock speed). however, when you consider that the 4340 can run at 3.8ghz with turbo, and 4.2\u002Bghz with overclocking, the 4670k becomes a better choice (assuming you are willing to spend the extra cash).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou want the fastest cpu (within buget limitations). dual or quad core is irrelevant, the unused cores will just shut off. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso, there are multi-threaded applications that are 32bit. 64/32 bit relates to the memory address size, so limits the usable ram, while single/multi-threads is the number of cpu cores it uses (in my dreams KSP is a 64bit multithreded application, along with dwarf fortress. and i have a ducati panigale superleggera. and more kittens (i\u0027m dreaming, so i may as well run with it)).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe rest is good advice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fernandodlc","CreatedById":101689,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T19:56:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rdude71\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rdude71\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#3: Part Count\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep your part count down.
