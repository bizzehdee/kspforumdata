I commend you for your testing. It\u0027s a very informative article that has expanded my understanding of fuel flow. I have bookmarked it. I do stand corrected on the CG of larger tanks shifting as they drain fuel. I had learned this from another poster and thought I had encountered it in a ship I built in 0.21, but some quick tests in 0.242 did not reveal any tanks in which the CG shifted with change in the fuel. So, I am uncertain whether this has changed or my understanding was incorrect. In any event, I agree that CG does not shift within a particular tank as it drains fuel--In other words, I agree that fuel tanks are modeled as single points of mass in the dimensional center of the tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the your comments regarding using metal plates, they are not crossfeed capable, so I\u0027m not sure what you are saying. In my experience, if you don\u0027t use them, then even if you run the fuel line, your engine will not draw from the tanks evenly. However, I will experiment further with this. Perhaps this has changed in 0.242 such that the plate is no longer necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI respectfully must correct your statement that my ship is not a balanced craft. I have built numerous VTOL ships using the techniques in this video and have flown them to fuel exhaustion--they have remained in perfect balance. I hold a degree in physics and am a semi-professional pilot who flies high performance turboprops in which a clear understanding of the change in COM wet to dry is important. The way you make sure that the COM of the vessel wet (i.e., full of fuel) and the COM of the vessel dry (i.e., out of fuel) are in the same place (i.e., the COM doesn\u0027t move), is to make sure the COM of the fuel by itself is exactly on top of the COM of the vessel as a whole (whether wet or dry). It is impossible to have a stationary COM from wet to dry if the starting COM of the fuel alone is fore or aft of the COM of the vessel as a whole. If you need me to provide you the mathematical proof of this fact, I would be glad to do so. So, while what you say is true--namely that the COM wet and dry must be in the same place--what I say is also true and is the practical way in which you accomplish a matching wet and dry COM. The COM of the fuel alone must be centered on the COM of the craft (wet or dry), or else the overall COM will move as fuel is burned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, thanks for your comments and for your research on fuel burn!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"O-Doc","CreatedById":95453,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-08T14:09:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice tutorial.

Otherwise, the plane would begin to either nose up or nose down. That said, traditional (i.e. non-canard) airplanes put the center of lift of the main wings behind the center of mass to induce static stability. By doing so, a traditional airplane\u0027s horizontal stabilizer (the horizontal tail) actually has to generate negative lift (downward lift) in order to maintain level flight. It is this downward lift of the tail (which is just a small wing that can generate lift in either direction) that, when combined with the upward lift of the main wings moves the total center of lift forward to match the center of mass. The reason why this set up promotes stability has to do with the relationship between lift and airspeed. Imagine a plane in level flight with the autopilot off (i.e., the plane is trimmed for level flight with no control input). The pilot now momentarily pushes the yoke forward to induce a nose down pitch and lets go. As the airplane accelerates, the tail produces an increased amount of downward lift due to the increased airspeed. As it does so, it pivots the nose upward back toward level flight. If the airplane starts to overshoot to a nose high position, the reverse happens--less airspeed over the tail means less downward force on the tail, which means the nose pitches down. I\u0027ve flown lots of airplanes, from small Cessna\u0027s to corporate aircraft. They all exhibit this behavior (by design)--otherwise, the plane would be dangerous. In a canard airplane, it is just the opposite--you have the center of lift of the main wings forward of the center of mass and then the canard out front provides additional lift. for analogous reasons, this configuration promotes the same type of stability in a canard airplane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow to KSP. As to Kasuha\u0027s comment: I agree that a center of lift exactly on top of a center of mass (i.e., in all three axes) makes an unstable plane. You\u0027re correct that it is the putting of the center of lift in line (fore/aft) with the center of mass, but ABOVE IT (higher) that makes the plane stable. I find when I do this that I can fly my planes level completely hands off. In other words, without ASAS engaged or constantly having to use WASD. In my experience, when the COL is aft of the COM, that\u0027s not the case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to Doc\u0027s comment: Yes, in the real world, the center of thrust being below the COL will tend to ever so slightly drive the nose up (this is not necessarily a bad thing). I\u0027m not sure that is accurately modeled in KSP--it may be that rotation on any axis due to thrust may only relate to the COM, not the COL. I\u0027m finding no problem with having the COL higher (vertically) than the COT.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to both of you for the dialogue.

Only sports planes and fighter jets have this type of configuration to increase turning performance. The further away from the CoL the CoM(CoG) is the more force is required(lift, hence drag you create) to pull that CoM through a turn. Then, the rest of your understanding about how aerodynamic stability works seems a bit muddled. So, I won\u0027t quote the rest of it. Let\u0027s instead, have a look at a classic design configuration, widely regarded as one of the most aerodynamically stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.free-online-private-pilot-ground-school.com/images/longitudinal_stability.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022longitudinal_stability.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can immediately notice the relationship between the CoT to the CoM and the CoL to the CoM. Why is this relationship so obvious? Because the more thrust you put into the prop the more speed you will generate and hence more lift to counteract the thrust. When thrust is high and lift is low a nose up moment is induced providing obvious safety benefits. This and the natural keel effect, is part of the reason why this configuration is a classic. The other being that, the prop wash provides lift so, as long as the prop is powered you never get a complete stall condition on the craft. This is also why it can STOL and is used almost exclusively in hard to access terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of aerodynamic stability, this like all aerodynamically stable aircraft will nose down during stall. An aircraft that noses down during stall will pick up speed and start generating lift again by doing so. Once you lose power in an aerodynamically unstable craft you will eventually lose enough speed to induce a stall. At which point the craft will tumble and crash. It\u0027s always best to bail out prior to the stall once you lose power. Of course, fighter pilots already know this. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a really badly shot videa but, you can see at the end when the guy loses power on his RC Piper Cub the plane slows, stalls, noses down and unstalls a number of times before he safely lands it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/l4ACUGduqaI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETailplanes and nose planes work during Y-axis sideslip. During Y-axis sideslip tailplanes will sit in a condition of negative AoA as you rightly pointed out. This AoA generates lift well behind the CoM towards to direction of travel. Fighters jets have stabilaters instead of the tail plane and elevon combination so there is no lifting surface in a negative AoA generating aerodynamic stability. Foreplanes perform the opposite function. In Y-axis sideslip they produce a positive AoA thereby decreasing aerodynamic stability. If they are not balanced by other lift or control surfaces they will rotate the airframe away from the direction of travel to an angle at which they stall. Aircraft with foreplanes must have enough lift to maintain a turn to the angle of the foreplane stall or it will tumble. The exceptions being, computer controlled aircraft like the Eurofighter which uses canards that have controllable AoA. Canards are to foreplanes as stabilators are to tailplanes and the principles are the same. Canards can provide even more positive AoA than foreplanes, or less. They are usually forward swept because forward swept wings can achieve higher AoA before stall condition is produced. It\u0027s usually between 60-75 degrees AoA before complete stall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost civilian aircraft you see with canards have their main wings well behind the CoM which act like tailplanes. The reason why you would choose this configuration in a civilian craft is to do with payload considerations. In all aircraft the wing root is the primary structure of the plane and takes up alot of space. To make room for larger payloads you need to move the wing root away from the CoM. This can be achieved with foreplanes and forward swept wngs, or a combination of the two.
