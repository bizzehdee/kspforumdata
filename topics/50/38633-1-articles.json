Maximum engine thrust can now be controlled separately for each engine. In the VAB you can monitor the center of thrust during such adjustments to account for mass imbalances on a non-symmetrical craft.

The first, and most visually obvious change is the SAS indicator above the Nav Ball. When SAS is activated with \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CF\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 or \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CT\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 the light turns on as normal, but when the system is in damping mode the indicator changes to two spinning arrows. Any manual input will switch the system to damping mode; it will stay in this mode for a brief moment after releasing manual input (how long it stays in damping mode depends on how much the craft is changing direction). Once the system is in locking mode the light will change back to the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CSAS\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 indicator. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe system still works off of your true orientation in the Kerbal universe. This means that while SAS is activated you will stay oriented in the same direction with respect to the universe, regardless of your position with respect to the planet/moon you are orbiting. This is effectively the same thing that happens when you activate timewarp. If you point at the prograde vector, wait half an orbit and you will be pointed retrograde; if you point at the surface, wait half an orbit and you will be pointed directly up from the planet. If you create a maneuver node and point at the blue vector you will follow it throughout the orbit (though you will slowly drift away from the vector, I assume this is due to the orbit of an object around its parent body; this doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t happen in Kerbol orbit). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the whole, the SAS system seems more aggressive. It uses more available control authority to try to maintain heading. This can cause more oscillations if you aren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t careful. By using manual corrections and toggling off/on SAS with \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CF\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 it is usually possible to avoid these large oscillations. This isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t always easy though, and very long, or otherwise unstable crafts will probably have this problem regardless of what you do; that is more of a problem of bad craft design than a faulty SAS system (that some of these designs may have worked in previous versions doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t mean they aren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t problematic).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERoll control has been greatly improved. In many cases SAS will stop roll almost immediately after control is released; with relatively small crafts it works almost as well as using RCS to stop rolls. You can still overload its ability to prevent roll (SRBs are great for doing this, which might cause some issues early in career mode), but it is better overall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E# - Unbalanced crafts should work better in 0.22; this is best demonstrated with a test case. These crafts are identical, but were built from scratch on new saves in both 0.22 and 0.21. Click on the pictures for bigger versions. The craft has one command pod, one large reaction wheel and one gimbaling engine. During launch it is easily able to handle the imbalance in both versions, though 0.22 does feel more stable overall. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/SAS%20test/SAStester.jpg~original\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/SAS%20test/SAStestersmall.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022SAStestersmall.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/SAS%20test/SAStester2.jpg~original\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/SAS%20test/SAStestersmall2.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022SAStestersmall2.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the upper stage is separated the behavior of SAS differs between the two versions. In 0.21 SAS can hold the craft steady at up to about 50-60% throttle, after that the craft will begin spinning out of control; in 0.22 it is stable at a slightly higher throttle. In both cases SAS is using full control authority on the pitch and yaw axes to maintain heading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are two important points here, and one big difference. In 0.21, even when the craft is held steady it won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t maintain its original heading. It drifts a few degrees in the direction of the imbalance, then holds its heading there, even when there is excess control authority available. In 0.22 this drift is greatly reduced; SAS mostly holds the original heading until it loses the ability to maintain heading at all (this is greatly helped by slowing increasing throttle, instead of going straight to the max).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/SAS%20test/v21drift.jpg~original\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/SAS%20test/v21driftsmall.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022v21driftsmall.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/SAS%20test/v22drift.jpg~original\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/SAS%20test/v22driftsmall.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022v22driftsmall.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne important point that can be observed here is that it is possible to get stuck in damping mode. If you start rotating or go beyond the system\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s ability to maintain heading the indicator will switch to the damping icon and will stay there. This doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t seem to affect the amount of control authority used, it simply means that the system has no heading to lock onto. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026amp; - The other point is that damping mode doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t work the way you might think. At around 50% throttle the controls on the pitch and yaw axes are almost maxed out and the system is in locking mode. If you then rotate, the system switches into damping mode. Right away, you will notice that all control on the pitch and yaw axes drop to zero. This will cause the craft to start spinning out of control despite the fact that there is enough control authority to hold it steady. The system will resume controlling the pitch and yaw axes (even if you continue to hold the rotate controls), but that brief interval where the controls drop to zero is enough throw off the system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ERCS:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* - Using the translation controls for RCS in \u0027staging mode\u0027 (the H J K L I N keys) \u003Cstrong\u003Ewill not\u003C/strong\u003E cause damping mode to be activated. Using the translation controls in \u0027docking mode\u0027 (the WASD keys) \u003Cstrong\u003Ewill\u003C/strong\u003E cause damping mode to activate. This remains the case with \u0027fine controls\u0027 (activated with the CAPS lock key) on or off, and this also occurs even with RCS turned off. This behavior is not entirely predictable, activation of damping mode seems to be at least somewhat dependent on whether or not the RCS thrust is imbalanced. And excessive input, or very imbalanced thrust can cause damping mode to activate in \u0027staging mode\u0027, but I believe this is because the craft is momentarily unable to hold its heading (similar to the situation described above), and is not the same as what happens in \u0027docking mode\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0027staging mode\u0027 case seems to be more useful, docking usually requires careful control over your heading, and damping mode is not as effective as locking mode for providing this. I would recommend staying in \u0027staging mode\u0027 and using the translation controls instead of using \u0027docking mode\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill update as more info becomes available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E0.21 Information\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the information below should still apply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ESee \u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entries/740-Updated-Information-on-SAS-in-0-21-1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EC7\u0027s latest blog post\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E on the new SAS system\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 0.21 update brought with it many changes to the SAS functionality and a whole host of complaints to go along with them.

You can produce torque regardless of whether or not the SAS light is on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll parts with reaction wheel functionality use electrical power when you turn, they all have an option to toggle torque if you right-click on them, and they all have the line \u0022name = ModuleReactionWheel\u0022 in the .cfg file, which is followed by the specific torque values in each axis and the electrical power consumption rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll command pods, cockpits, probe cores, and the three reaction wheel parts mentioned in the section above provide this function. The chair, however, does not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ESAS Functionality:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new implementation of SAS is probably the more confusing change. This is what tries to maintain your heading (true orientation actually, which will change as you orbit a planet), controls reaction wheels, activates control surfaces, gimbaling engines, and RCS thrusters. Any and every control system is controlled by any part with the SAS function. You do not need to add an Inline Advanced Stabilizer or Inline Reaction Wheel to control RCS, gimbals, or control surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESAS is not nearly as aggressive as the old ASAS functionality. This reduces wobbling and over corrections a lot, but in many cases your rocket might drift away from its current heading. The 0.21.1 update addresses this and seems to reduce or eliminate drift in most cases. Adding more Reaction Wheel parts can help eliminate drift or accommodate an unbalanced rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs detailed in C7\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s blog post linked above, there are two modes for the SAS system. In damping mode, SAS will not try to maintain a heading, it will only provide stability and should allow for smoother control over your craft. In locking mode SAS will try to maintain a heading. There is, however, a delay in switching between damping and locking modes. Constant manual input (or joystick signal noise) will prevent locking mode from activating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is not an autopilot, so don\u0027t expect it to be one. It also does not lock out the controls, you can activate SAS and still control your craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs mentioned above, it is present in all of the manned command pods, cockpits, all of the probe cores, the Inline Reaction Wheel, the Avionics Package, the 2.5m grey ASAS module, and the Inline Advanced Stabilizer. The chair, again, does not have SAS functionality or provide torque.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny part with SAS functionality will have the line \u0022name = ModuleSAS\u0022 in the .cfg file. This function does not use any electrical power, it has no right-click toggle value, and it does not provide any rotational torque by itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you push \u0022T\u0022 (or hold \u0022F\u0022) to turn on SAS, you are now activating the new SAS functionality. There is only one effect of activating SAS now, not like before where you had the somewhat conflicting SAS/ASAS functionality activated with \u0022T\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ERCS Changes\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile not strictly related to the new SAS system, there has been an important change to the way RCS functions.

Sometimes they fly perfectly and respond to inputs I give, other times they decide to put some other directions into mix for fun. For example during a gravity turn it should just be a matter of a few pushes of D to make the turn right on the 90 degree line and all other axes are to remain locked, but they are not...sometimes it drifts up and down at random, with the simplest of ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther problems include the inability to hold to a maneuver node marker during a warp. I don\u0027t mean how sometime you would hit warp and the blue mark would jump a half inch or so, but it will drift during the warp when things are not even supposed to be subject to physics, its just a nice slow drift while at 50x warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I set the ship to face Normal to watch where it would drift and how fast it won\u0027t do it.
