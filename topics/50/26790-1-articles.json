Yes, it is a cheat in a way but it DOES help you to balance your final capsule without flying it up into orbit. It\u0027s a bit like a simulation system for your design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EBuild your final payload but don\u0027t add on the boosters just yet. You want just the parts you will have in orbit and want to dock. Bit like the Command and Service module of the Apollo era.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAdd on your RCS... Add a ring of \u0022Place Anywhere\u0022 RCS pods around the Centre of Mass (you can find the CoM by pressing the little weight icon at the bottom left of your VAB screen). These will be used for translating... ie up,down,left and right. Use 4 for small ships, 6 for medium ships and 8 for large ships.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENow add a ring of RCS Quad pods around the ship, a third of the way from the top. 4 is fine for a small to large ship as all they are used for is turning the ship.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENow here is the trick... Go into Action Groups and select one of the Custom slots. For this example we are going to use Custom10. Select one of the RCS Quads on your payload and then you should see it appear in the action group menu as \u0022Toggle RCS Thrust\u0022 Click on this and it will now be allocated to Custom10.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENOW SAVE YOUR SHIP. So many times I have got to launch and the game crashes so I always save before testing a new ship.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENow that you have saved, add a couple of launch clamps to support your ship. These are just so it doesn\u0027t go boom if it falls over.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENow go to the launch pad. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHere is the trick. Hit ALT-F12 and a menu will appear. Hit the \u0022Hack Gravity\u0022 button.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ELaunch your ship... You will now be able to test your RCS without going into orbit. Turn on the RCS by hitting R and you can turn the ship with the WASD buttons and rotate with the Q and E buttons. For translating we need to do a little trick.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ETo enter our translation mode hit the custom10 button (which is usually 0). This will turn our quad pods off and on.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWith the quad pods off you can now use the JKLI buttons to move left, down, right and up.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ETo move forward and back hit the custom10 button again to turn the quad pods back on and use H and N.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ETesting the ship will probably show you some problems. If the ship turns when you are translating you may have to move the ring or place anywhere pods up and down the body of the payload. If the ship isn\u0027t turning fast enough when you are using the WASD buttons you can move quad pods closer to the end of the payload which will speed up the rotation.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHere ends the balancing RCS tutorial.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis technique was given to me by others on this board. It works well and I\u0027ve just added the fine tuning ideas myself because I either had extra twitchy small craft going crazy or big craft that just wouldn\u0027t turn. You don\u0027t need two lots of RCS rings like a lot of people use (just look at the Apollo CSM if you don\u0027t believe me). I used to use way too many quad pods before I realised this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T07:10:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice writeup.

It\u0027s the one thing that REALLY used to bug the hell out of me. Having to launch to orbit just to test the balance of your ship RCS was a timewasting pain, especially as the parallax view in the VAB makes it soooo hard to figure out if you really do have your translation ring in the right place. Then someone mentioned the debug hack and I was like WHOA... Then I looked at the Apollo setup and the light bulb went DING in my head. Hence what I use now and I haven\u0027t had a bad docking since.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadweasel","CreatedById":23123,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-27T07:53:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome write-up!
