Well, you can and it turns out that it isn\u0027t too difficult. This tutorial should get you streaming in under an hour, easily. So, how do you get started? First, you need to select a streaming program to use. There are three mainstream programs for you to choose from:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EXSplit\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EXSplit is a popular choice amongst people who can spend the cash for a license. It offers a lot of options and uses the fast x264 video encoder. A free version is available but it will watermark your stream. A personal license will cost $60, though discounts may apply (at this time there is a 33% discount, meaning a license for personal use will cost you $40). \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.xsplit.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWebsite\u003C/a\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOBS\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOpen Broadcaster Software is free and open source software for recording and live streaming. It\u0027s open source and both 32 and 64 bit versions are available. The software is very basic and completely free. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://obsproject.com/index\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWebsite\u003C/a\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFFSplit\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn my opinion this is the best of both worlds. FFSplit offers you a good interface with advanced options, the same quick video encoder as XSplit and is completely free. It does take some tinkering to get everything to work properly, but once it does you won\u0027t look back. For the remainder if this tutorial I\u0027ll be using this program. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.ffsplit.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWebsite\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYour computer and internet connection\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you get into streaming it\u0027s important to realise that your computer has to capture, encode and broadcast the video real-time, while you are playing your game. For this reason it\u0027s important that your computer and especially your internet connection are up to the task. If you\u0027re struggling with lag regularly during KSP, even on smaller rockets, then streaming probably isn\u0027t for you until you upgrade your computer. To give an indication as far as processors go, FFSplit advices quad core CPU (Intel i7 or AMD Phenom II 1055\u002B) for streaming in 720p. You\u0027ll generally want a 50Mb internet connection or better, though it really depends on your upload speed. The higher the resolution you stream in, the more internet bandwidth you\u0027ll need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYour other equipment\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you want to achieve with streaming? I\u0027ve streamed regularly in the past and I chose to do so without a facecam or even a microphone. I\u0027d play to enjoy the game and see if anyone was interested in chatting with me during that time. However, you may have different preferences and maybe you do want a facecam and/or microphone. If you do, make sure you have a good webcam and/or microphone, headset or any other equipment you require. Some people also have green screens, which they use to insert a custom background behind them, or even blend their facecam into the game. I have no experience with these techniques, so I\u0027d advise you to ask a streamer who has. Good quality equipment can make or break a stream.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDownloading and installing FFSplit\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can download FFSplit on \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.ffsplit.com/download/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis page\u003C/a\u003E. You can either choose the latest build (which I recommend) or the latest stable build. If one doesn\u0027t work, try the other. To run FFSplit you require three libraries to be installed: VC\u002B\u002B Runtime 2012 (x86) \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=30679\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E(download)\u003C/a\u003E, .NET Framework 4.5 \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=30653\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E(download)\u003C/a\u003E and the latest version of DirectX \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E(download)\u003C/a\u003E. Once you have installed the libraries, open the installer for FFSplit and follow the instructions on screen. At the time of writing this tutorial, the latest build is FFSplit 0.7.0 test build 23 so this is the version I\u0027ll be using.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGetting a Twitch account and setting up your stream\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwitch is the biggest streaming website out there, though perhaps Youtube is catching up. In any case, Twitch is our platform of choice. If you haven\u0027t registered an account with Twitch yet you can do so \u003Ca href=\u0022http://twitch.tv/login\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eon this page\u003C/a\u003E. Once you\u0027ve registered an account and logged in you need to find your \u0027dashboard\u0027. The link is available in the left hand menu if you click on the small arrow underneath your username, messages and profile. Note that it is worthwhile to explore the options your profile offers you first. If you can\u0027t find the link or if you\u0027re a bit lazy \u003Ca href=\u0022http://twitch.tv/dashboard\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eclick here instead\u003C/a\u003E. Your dashboard is the central piece of your stream. From here you can watch the chat, set your stream title and define which game you\u0027re playing. In fact, we can define that game right now. It\u0027s Kerbal Space Program right? Indicate to Twitch that you\u0027re playing Kerbal Space Program and think of a nice title for your stream. This will ensure that your stream ends up in the list of people who are currently playing KSP, which will in turn attract new viewers. Click the update button when you\u0027re done. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESetting up KSP\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere we have to stop and think. How are we going to put all those programs on your screen? Well, if you have multiple screens this may not be an issue. You can have KSP on one screen and the broadcasting software and stream chat on the other, but what if you have just the one screen like me? To get around this I simply put KSP in windowed mode, at the same resolution as my streaming resolution (1280x720p). Going any lower than your streaming resolution will negatively affect the stream quality and going higher will use up resources your computer may need for streaming. Once KSP is in windowed mode it leaves me more than enough room to put the chat besides it (through a popout chat) and the streaming software window fits in such a position that I can read all the relevant information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EConfiguring FFSplit\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will be the trickiest part, because with a lot of functions comes a lot of options. We\u0027ll take this one screen at a time. First off: the bottom of the main screen. Notice that you have a window for canvasses and a window for layers. A canvas is composed of a set of layers and is basically what people will see. You can have one or multiple canvasses, each with one or multiple layers. So, given the basic canvas that FFSplit provides us with, how do we set it up to show KSP? Make sure KSP is running and click \u0027new\u0027 under the layer window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VpYNEpr.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VpYNEpr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[table=width: 100%]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]You\u0027ll notice a number of different options here: layer types, regions.. it can be quite daunting at first but fear not, it\u0027s simpler than you think. First, lets name our layer so we can keep track of it. Something like \u0022KSP Layer\u0022 will do, so use that as your layer name. Under the name you\u0027ll find a selection menu for the layer type. Screen will do for now, and the others speak for themselves: you can add text, text (now playing), image, videorecordingdevice and screen. Screen is already selected and it\u0027s the one we need. Note the three options below it: capture monitor, capture region, capture window. Select capture window. In the dropdown box directly next to it, select Kerbal Space Program. We want only the client area, or else you\u0027ll also get the ugly borders of window (presuming KSP is in windowed mode). Click \u0027add layer\u0027 below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, you can add many things this way: generally it\u0027s a good idea to add an image or video on the beginning of your stream so your subscribers get a chance to enter the channel before you start streaming. You can also add layers that show what music is playing and you can add your webcam and such to the screen. It\u0027s worth while to play around with your settings for a bit and get familiar with adding new layers. If you don\u0027t plan on using more than one layer in the end, do make another one now. It can be a simple text layer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may notice that KSP does not fit well in the stream window (top left part of the main FFSplit screen). To fix this, rightclick your \u0022KSP Layer\u0022 in the layer window and select fit to canvas. Now, take a look at your second layer. Rightclick it and try moving it up and down in the list of layers. The way layers work is by stacking them. You can stack one layer on top of another, so be careful that you\u0027re not blocking a layer you want people to see. Specifying a good order is therefore really important. Notice that you have two icons next to each layer in the layer window: a padlock and an eye. Clicking the eye logo will toggle the layer visible or invisible, clicking the padlock logo will \u0027lock\u0027 the layer, preventing certain actions. I always have a layer on top that is a screen filling image, for when I have technical difficulties or if I need to step away for a while. As long as such a layer is set to invisible it will not interfere with your regular stream, but it will be available in one click.[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UuPCKZt.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022UuPCKZt.jpg\u0022\u003E[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/table]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EConnecting FFSplit to Twitch \u0026amp; encoding settings\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid I say configuring FFSplit would be the trickiest part? Well, I tricked you! Hah! All kidding aside, this next part is pretty technical but I will try to guide you through it. To begin, find the \u0027options\u0027 button in the bottom right of your FFSplit window. The options menu will pop up. The first tab (Session) can be ignored for the most part, the only interesting options there is the delay option, which you want to use when you don\u0027t want the people who watch your stream to see what you\u0027re doing. In a strategy game for example. I cannot think of a good reason to enable this for KSP, so lets leave it at zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/y0N53dD.png\u0022 alt=\u0022y0N53dD.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SIzJ8pJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SIzJ8pJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe \u0027service\u0027 tab\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is where you go to configure your connection to Twitch, so lets do that. Our streaming service is Twitch, so select that from the top dropdown. To select the server, hit the \u0027Find Best Server\u0027 button and let FFSplit do the work for you. Make sure it doesn\u0027t select a server halfway across the world though. Remember the Twitch Dashboard we covered earlier? Well, time to head back to that page. On top, find the tab that says \u0027stream key\u0027 and open it, then click on the \u0027show key\u0027 button. Copy the stream key and enter it in the stream key box, then press Verify. Once the service is verified make sure the other settings are set to the same values as the example above. You can rename the service profile by clicking on the current name. This one is called Personal Channel, but you can name it anything you wish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ENever share your Twitch streaming key, it allows anyone to broadcast anything on your channel, and you\u0027ll be the one facing the consequences!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe \u0027encoder\u0027 tab\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwitch has specific demands when it comes to the encoding of your videos. Not being compliant with these standards can lead to all sorts of problems, such as your streams not being available on mobile devices. The most important thing is to keep your bitrate mode on Constant Bitrate (CBR). The option below it is the stream resolution. I would recommend a minimum of 853x480. Any lower and your stream will be very pixely and low-res and people will not watch it. Most people stream at 1280x720 or 1920x1080, which are high definition resolutions. Remember that the higher you set your resolution the more resources it takes from your computer and internet connection. Streaming at 1280x720 pixels means streaming a total of 921.600 pixels each frame, which increases to 2.073.600 pixels for 1920x1080.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrame rate: minimum 30FPS, maximum 60FPS (Frames Per Second). Video Bitrate: Twitch advises 2000kbps for 720p broadcasts and 3000kbps for 1080p broadcasts. Going much lower than that will severely affect the quality of your stream, and you\u0027d be better of decreasing the resolution instead. Next, tick advanced options and look at the encode preset: setting this to a faster speed will require less resources from your computer but more resources from your internet connection. My internet connection is solid, so I put this to ultrafast, but you need to see which works best for you. I haven\u0027t messed around with the other advanced settings yet, but OpenCL offloads some work to your GPU instead of your processor - it may cause crashes though. If you really need to save bandwidth you can set the audio format to mp3 and the bitrate to 64 or even 32. Twitch does have a maximum bitrate: 160kbit for AAC and 128kbit for MP3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EnJZuVt.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EnJZuVt.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8UbQafX.png\u0022 alt=\u00228UbQafX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe \u0027capture\u0027 tab\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s not too much to say about this tab, the default settings work just fine. That is, unless (like me) you have a laptop or computer with both an integrated graphics card and a dedicated graphics card. In this case you\u0027ll always, always, always want to select the dedicated graphics card as your video adapter. Not doing so will result in a huge performance loss. If you have a microphone recording device, or multiple, you can select which one to use here as well. And you can boost the volume and set a time delay if needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBack to the \u0027session\u0027 tab\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmost done now! Go back to the \u0027sessions\u0027 tab and make sure that FFSplit tells you that your encoding settings are Twitch compliant. Hit apply or OK and return to the main FFSplit screen. You can test your upload speed from here as well, to see if your internet connection can take the strain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStreaming\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re ready to stream!

Alright, hit the \u0027start\u0027 button on the bottom of your FFSplit screen and you\u0027ll be live before you know it. Once you\u0027ve hit start notice that the small window next to the layers will start telling you a lot of information such as how long you\u0027ve been going and how much bandwidth you\u0027ve used in that time. Keep an eye on the average frame rate (should not fall below 25) and your dropped frames (should remain below about 2%-5%). If you\u0027re having issues with either, try streaming at a lower resolution or lower some other settings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-09T19:59:04Z\u0022 title=\u002201/09/2014 07:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by KasperVld\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seth","CreatedById":101095,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-20T13:24:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI do think this is quite OK but i\u0027d like to add something about the internet connection speed and why that 50 Mbps figure might be a bit misleading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt varies by region and that figure is usually only your download.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t know the numbers have a look at your contract, it should be there somewhere.
