You need to have your boosters set up with symmetry. So, the first step is put your boosters (without engines, only fuel) on your rocket. Now, the second step is to put your SAS/ASAS module in your fuel tank (With symmetry turned off), like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/t6m8h1T.png\u0022 alt=\u0022t6m8h1T.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd there you go!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What! How do I put on engines! You scandalous gibbon, you tricked me!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, Ok, I\u0027ll show you the rest. Now, since you have fuel tanks with symmetry and one has an SAS module on it, turn symmetry back on and put your engine under one of the fuel tanks that doesn\u0027t have the SAS module, like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OUlHFE5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022OUlHFE5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(The engine in the middle is unrelated)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then you will have this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MZ0VeWY.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MZ0VeWY.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow is the important step. Take off the engine \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eunder the SAS module\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E. That\u0027s the one with the stripe on the bottom. You should be back to where you started. Now, turn symmetry back off and put SAS modules under all of the fuel tanks, so it looks like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8tPGYg0.png\u0022 alt=\u00228tPGYg0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd pick up your engine, and put it on the under your first SAS module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere you have it! Fuel tanks with SAS units and engines under them!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
