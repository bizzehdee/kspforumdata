Sometimes you just have to keep an eye on the memory you\u0027re using, because of the limits of 32-bit code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a lot of Mk2 Spaceplane mods available, with different features that can make the whole job easier. So I shall first list a few parts Mods which are worth thinking about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/515/B9%20Aerospace%20Procedural%20Parts\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EB9 Aerospace Procedural Wings\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese can replace most of the wings and control surfaces in the stock range, maybe replacing several components with one.

Kerbalstuff warns that it is outdated, being for v1.0.2, but I have never had any problems with v1.0.4 I\u0027s not all that important, but the adjustment of gear height can give you a nose-up pitch that makes a take-off rather less frightening.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/718/Interstellar%20Fuel%20Switch\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EInterstellar Fuel Switch\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s also a fuel switch in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/777/Firespitter%20-%20Plugin%20Only\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFirespitter plugin\u003C/a\u003E. They both allow you to fill tanks with different combinations of fuel. Most spaceplanes need a bit more fuel than the standard fuel/oxidiser mix. This principle also applies to Monopropellant. Instead of an extra part, you can tweak the fuel-tank contents.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, and rather trivial, I fit my spaceplanes with the flat antenna from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/615/Blackleg%20Industries\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBlackleg Industries\u003C/a\u003E.

It amounts to your instrument panel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the essential Mod for so much. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/222685-kerbal-engineer-redux\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EModule Manager\u003C/a\u003E There are many things which are a list of changes, applied by Module Manager, when the part is loaded into memory. A call to the fuel switch has to be added to a part\u0027s config file, and this is what does it. But the changes are only made if the fuelswitch plugin is there. It\u0027s often provided with Mods that need it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not recommending a Mod-free game, and while you can manage quite well without any of these, they are generally useful. Let\u0027s now look at some of the classes of part which can be replaced by stock parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMk2 batteries and reaction wheels\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are parts which fit into a Mk2 fuselage, in the same way as their equivalents for the 1.25m (and larger) rocket stacks. This is one of the trivial things to change, and partly why they\u0027re a bit obscure. You can put the stock 1.25m equivalents between an air-intake and its mounting point. The only Mk2 battery I have seen has the same capacity as the 1.25m diameter Z-1k battery, though it has half the mass of the stock battery. This isn\u0027t such a bad thing, as it\u0027s easy to make a spaceplane a bit tail-heavy. You could also mount it just in front of the engine component to counter a nose heaviness. Spaceplanes need lots of engines and intakes so there\u0027s no problem here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMk2 cockpits\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a lot. The basic 2 are enough choice, but I know you\u0027re going to ask about the cockpits with air intakes. The main useful answer is to use the inline cockpit and a Mk2 to 1.25m adaptor or bicoupler, set to put the 1.25m node at the front. If you attach a control-surface to a reversed part, remember to reverse the control-surface action.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother solution may be to use a Mk1 cockpit at the front of the adaptor. It can get canard control surfaces well forward while not using such a heavy structure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3rd-party intakes\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome older designs appear to have an excess of air-intake capacity, either multiple intakes or part-mod intakes that supply more air. The basic model for air-breathing engines has changed and getting extra air to the engine doesn\u0027t make a difference any more. The \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120899-HOWTO-Airbreathing-Engines-in-KSP-1-0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edetails here\u003C/a\u003E can seem a bit geeky, but the stock 1.25m intakes suit the stock engines. There are some good graphs, and the one on the second page compares the three stock engines. I have had a plane flying at Mach 5.22 on Rapier engines. That\u0027s about 1560 m/s. There are no real advantages to excess intake capacity. The differences are not that big. But the Shockcone has the edge at the upper end of the speed range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have seen a 3rd-party intake that is essentially a double-capacity Ram Air intake by Intake Air capacity, but no better for intake area. and I am wondering if it is really an improvement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngines\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a few 2.5m engines, such as the bigger version of the Sabre in the B9 set, but none in stock other than rockets. There are also some shrouded adaptors which can mount a single 1.25m engine in a prettier form. Shifting to a stock adaptor isn\u0027t a big change, though fuel capacity may matter. The 1.25m version of the Sabre engine is heavier than the Rapier, and has more thrust. 4 Sabres mass the same as 5 Rapiers, but the Rapiers will have more thrust. On the other hand, engine mass is a relatively small part of the whole. And pre-coolers, stock or otherwise, are just fuel tanks with neat textures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne important difference is that the Rapier doesn\u0027t generate electricity. Does that matter? For a spaceplane, maybe not, but in-atmosphere range may be limited by batteries rather than fuel. A fuel-cell in the cargo-hold would be one answer. There is just room on the bulkhead beside a docking port or similar 1.25m part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few spaceplanes use recently designed Scramjet engines, which give useful air-breathing thrust at higher altitude and speed than a Rapier. These are so different that you might as well give up on trying to copy the plane with stock parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExploits\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of the pre-v1.0.0 spaceplanes depend on exploiting bugs and design flaws. Extra air intakes are almost useless. I have seen spaceplanes with one node carrying four different engines. It didn\u0027t work in v1.0.4 and staging-by-explosion is not all that effective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther implications of stock and non-stock\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re using stock, you are going to be using the Clamp-o-Tron docking port anyway. And almost all the added space-plane parts which provide a docking port use the Clamp-o-Tron. That counts against all the alternatives. But now there are multi-size docking ports, and plugins that, with Module Manager, let you dock with different styles of port. So it\u0027s not a huge problem. For 1.25m stick to the standard Clamp-o-Tron.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a few non-stock Mk2 parts which can give you something useful. For instance, the QuizTech pack includes a short Service Bay with doors top and bottom. That\u0027s similar to the 1.25m and 2.5m stock service bays, but they can be stacked to give something of cargo-bay size with the double doors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, keeping a Spaceplane in orbit to do science seems a bit wasted. There is a mod with a Science Lab, which can thus generate a lot of science, but that\u0027s more a feature of a permanent station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeveral part mods have multi-engine pods, which give a radial mount. For a Rapier, you\u0027d need the CrossFeed Enabler mod, which is a plug-in included with some mods. In airbreathing mode, the Rapier draws fuel from all tanks. Switch to rocket mode, and you need fuel pipes at least. These multi-engine mounts can be replaced with multiple stock nacelles, but each needs its own fuel pipe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stock RCS thrusters look a bit sticky-out but you will need some. Way up there I mentioned the Blackbird Industries pack, because of the neat streamlined communication antenna. It also has a few thrusters and parts for small probes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConclusion\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConverting a spaceplane into a stock lookalike is possible, but there will be differences. You may use payload capacity, and don\u0027t expect to match the original\u0027s ascent profile. You\u0027ll need to do a lot of testing, and a key point is that you need to get a good acceleration between 300 and 400 m/s. Once you reach that speed the Rapier really gets going, but that seems to apply to all the dual-mode engines. Some of the jet-and-rocket designs may still work out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERather than converting a big and complicated design, start with something small. A single-Rapier spaceplane can work, but it is a little bit slow at the critical speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis pic shows some of my recent work. That was at 20,000 m with a speed of 1550 m/s, pretty much the ideal altitude for an air-breathing Rapier. I might have got some more speed but I chose to start climbing. I was seeing the thermometers. Since the Mk2 fuselage does generate lift it didn\u0027t need huge wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8WCqaWg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00228WCqaWg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
