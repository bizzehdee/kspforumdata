This is what I did a few times, my advice to you is to NOT do this, don\u0027t even restart when there is an update. Progressing through career mode is fun, but it only stays fun until you get stuck at the beginning with no motivation to go further.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMethod 2: Get lots and lots of content-adding mods.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo me atleast, the stock game is quite boring. Usually I am tired of the small amount of planets or lack of parts, etc. Look for mods, and find a mod setup that you both like and is as crash-free as possible. I\u0027d recommend choosing only one single planet mod, one that contains a lot of planets. Having multiple at once may cause other issues, such as occasionally two planets way to close to eachother, or just more frequent crashing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are a Steam user, make sure that you try not to update your game, cause that\u0027s going to screw up most if not all of your mods. It may suck that you can\u0027t play the update with everyone else, but most would probably prefer a ton of mods. If you really want to check out the update, you can copy your modded KSP folder and take it out of the Steam folder so you can update.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh yeah, GET MECHJEB! This seems to have helped me enjoy the game more, it would probably do the same for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImportant: Do NOT overwhelm yourself with mods. Not having enough parts is just as bad as having too many. If you have 3 different parts from 3 different mods that do the exact same things, that\u0027s probably a bad sign. Instead of adding mods that do things like adding new kinds of fuel tanks, etc, I\u0027d recommend mods that add in new ways of playing the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMethod 3: Get visual mods.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0KSP is a lot more enjoyable when you have amazing visual features.
