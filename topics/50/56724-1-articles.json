PURPOSE\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe purpose of this tutorial is to plan missions and design ships so that you only have to go to the same place (zone, biome within a zone--see below) once. That is, each mission should get somewhere between 85-100% of the points available in a given zone/biome, with the instruments available with your current technology. Note that you will at some point probably have to make multiple trips to the same body, but you shouldn\u0027t ever have to land in the same place twice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1. TARGET INFORMATION\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst thing, you need to know how the game works. See \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/62657-Understanding-Science-Points\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETrigger_Au\u0027s post on \u0022Understanding Science Points\u0022\u003C/a\u003E for an excellent and highly detailed rundown of all the variables that go into determining how many points you get for doing what. But if you can\u0027t find it or it\u0027s too detailed for you, here\u0027s a VERY basic summary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach body in the Kerbol system has several \u0022zones\u0022 where science is available. The list below goes in order from furthest away to the surface. Not all bodies have all zones. Many don\u0027t have atmospheres, some don\u0027t even have surfaces you can reach. Anyway, the zone:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHigh orbit (\u0022in space high above\u0022), from edge of its SOI down to some arbitrary but low orbital level. Everything has this zone.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ELow orbit (\u0022in space near\u0022), from where high orbit stops to some arbitrary point closer to the surface where you still have orbital velocity. Everything has this zone. If the planet has no atmosphere, this zone extends nearly to ground level.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFlying high (\u0022upper atmosphere\u0022). When high in the atmosphere (if present) and moving at less than orbital velocity. Aerobraking passes that will carry you back into space do NOT qualify as \u0022upper atmosphere\u0022 because you\u0027re going too fast.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFlying low (\u0022flying above\u0022). From just above the ground to the arbitrary change to upper atmosphere, at less than orbital velocity.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u0022In space just above\u0022 is the same as flying low for bodies without atmospheres. Can be reached by a Kerbal simply hanging onto a lander\u0027s ladder without touching the ground. Also possible by jumping and jetpacking.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESurface. The ship or EVA Kerbal is on the ground or in the water.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome bodies have multiple biomes. All biomes do is subdivide the surface and flying zones up into multiple zones. Bodies with biomes thus have more science available because each biome has its own supply of points. The various biomes on the same parent zone typically have about the same point value. This means that if you can make a ship to get to 1 biome, you can just repeat the same mission to different biomes, thereby getting beaucoup points before having to develop a more complex mission to a different destination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that even without official biomes (yet), some bodies effectively have multiple biomes already. For instance, Eve has surface and ocean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2. CHOOSE YOUR WEAPONS\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.23 puts a premium on returning experiments due to 1) only allowing an experiment to be transmitted once per ship per mission from the same zone/biome, and 2) limiting the total of transmitted data to about 40% of the total points available for that experiment a given zone/biome. Thus, this tutorial will focus on returning, not transmitting. The goal here is to equip your ship so you only have to make 1 trip to each zone (or biome within a zone).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour available tools are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECapsule: Allows crew reports, EVA reports, and surface samples. Also holds a Kerbal who can move data between capsules, science parts, and other Kerbals, which is very useful for getting info home. Capsule can only hold 1 copy of each type of data PER zone/biome combination, but can have multiple copies of the same type of report from different zones/biomes. As such, NEVER use anything except 1-man pods/cans because multiple Kerbals cannot each store their own data from the same zone/biome. Crew reports and EVA reports transmit at 100% efficiency so we can transmit these no problem if desired. Until we get the Mobile Lab, these are the only things we\u0027ll be transmitting and that\u0027s not even required.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMystery Goo: In 0.23, whether transmitted or returned, it can only be used once per mission unless cleaned out by the Mobile Lab. Because of this, we\u0027ll always return the Goo. It takes 4x returned Goos to get 99.9% of the Goo points for a given zone/biome, so we\u0027ll need 4 Goos per ship per zone/biome we want to visit on the mission.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EScience Jr. Material Bay: Same as Goo but gives more points. Also need 4 of them per zone/biome.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOther Instruments: Thermometer, seismic, barometer, gravity sensor. Returning 1 of these per zone/biome gets like 80-85% of its points so you need 1 per zone/biome you\u0027ll visit. NOTE: It\u0027s never worth the time and expense to make a return trip to a zone/biome just to use a new instrument you unlocked since you 1st went there.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAntennae: The starter antenna uses the least power but has the slowest speed. Because speed isn\u0027t an issue until we get the Mobile Lab, but electricity is always an issue until we get solar panels, the only antenna you should use to start with is the 1st one. And as mentioned above, transmitting is not necessary at all until we have the Mobile Lab, so you don\u0027t even need this. Once we get the Mobile Lab, then put the 3rd antenna on it. This uses the same low level of power as the starter antenna but is much faster.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMobile Lab: This adds 15% to the efficiency of transmitted data, although it\u0027s transmissions are still limited to 40% of the total available points for that experiment in that zone/biome. It also allows transmitting the same experiment in the same zone/biome multiple times, and allows Goos and Materials to be reused after transmitting. This all cuts down on the number of Goos and Bays you have to take somewhere to get all their points.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3. STRATEGY\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe value of science increases with distance from Kerbin. Kerbin is chump change so while it has all these biomes, it\u0027s a real grind going to them all because they don\u0027t pay very much. The real points in the Kerbin system are on Mun and especially Minmus (now that it also has multiple biomes): you can unlock all or most of the tech tree just by grinding out all their biomes. So the goal is to ignore Kerbin as much as possible and get to Mun and Minmus ASAP. But I don\u0027t like grinding so the idea here is to finish off the tech tree with \u0022simple\u0022 missions to Duna and Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs such, when cashing in your science points, you want to stay along the top (rocket parts) and bottom (science/lander parts). Ignore the middle (airplanes and probes). Airplanes are only good for milking Kerbin which doesn\u0027t pay enough to justify the trouble, and probes short you on science because they don\u0027t carry Kerbals for EVA, crew reports, and surface samples. The only reason to use probes in career mode is to land on Eve (if you\u0027re remorseful about stranding Kerbals there) or to fly crewless modules for multi-part, crewed interplanetary ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to start with, do what you have to do on Kerbin until you unlock both the Goo and the Material experiments. You\u0027ll also have some better rocket parts by now, too. From this point is where the planning and ship design tutorial really starts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETO BE CONTINUED:\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-20T04:04:05Z\u0022 title=\u002212/20/2013 04:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Geschosskopf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EInclude link to Triger_Au\u0026#039;s tutorial\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T18:06:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EMISSION PLANNING AND SHIP DESIGN FOR SCIENCE!

SHIP DESIGN\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, so what we want is to return ships with all the points our currently available experiments allow. As noted above, this requires 1 capsule to which we attach 4x Goo, 4x Material, and 1 each of any other instruments we have (and that will work where we\u0027re going), PER ZONE/BIOME visited. This cluster of parts will be our basic payload for all future missions. I call this assembly the \u0022Science Pack\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ultimate goal of every mission is to return a Science Pack to the surface of Kerbin for each zone/biome visited. Therefore, the Science Pack must also include sufficient parachutes for a safe landing on Kerbin. So that\u0027s how we\u0027ll build it, just enough chutes for the capsule and science parts. Everything else will be held on by separators and jettisoned during re-entry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause the Science Pack will be used in everything from sub-orbital hoppers to Eeloo landers, during which time technology will improve, the basic design must be capable of upgrading without having to rebuild it totally. It\u0027s also a good idea to save the core module of it as a subassembly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are of course as many ways to arrange these parts as there are KSPers. But this is post needs some pics so here\u0027s a step-by-step guide on how I build the Science Pack. Feel free to do things totally different, or modify my design to suit your tastes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2868/11436241463_2bb7eebe5c.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002211436241463_2bb7eebe5c.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT: Text in above pic is WRONG.

The box girder is the backbone of the whole Science Pack, and is what you should grab to save a subassembly. Note the rotation of the girder and the 3 chutes on the capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3711/11436147226_a79d56731f_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002211436147226_a79d56731f_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext step is to add 4x Materials to the box girder. It\u0027s vital to put them as far up as you can to leave the bottom of the box girder sticking out below so you can attach the rest of the rocket to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5499/11436146876_14bc9de90d.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002211436146876_14bc9de90d.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext add a small chute atop each Material and add 4x Goo around outside. You want the Goos on the cardinal directions because when we eventually turn this into a lander, the engines will go on the diagonals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3676/11436146796_e970554c4c.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002211436146796_e970554c4c.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComplete the Science Pack by adding whatever electric power and other science instruments you have available, and put the 1.25m Reaction Wheel to the bottom. Add an antenna, too, just in case. Now save everything below the capsule as the Science Pack subassembly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis entire assembly will be what returns from every mission. The chutes will set this whole thing down unharmed at about 4.3m/s. As she stands now, this contraption is an orbiter and fly-by ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3670/11436076465_6c1621e416_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002211436076465_6c1621e416_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can easily turn the Science Pack into a lander for Mun, Minmus, and beyond. Just put the small radial separators on the diagonals of the Materials, and hang fuel, engines, and legs on them. The size of the tanks and engines will depend on where you plan on landing, and other aspects of the overall rocket design and flight profile. But this version here can start from low Minmus orbit, land, and return to Kerbin with plenty of fuel to spare. Mun\u0027s a bit harder so to be safe, either use bigger side tanks or put a Soviet-style \u0022crasher\u0022 stage for the descent underneath. In any case, once you de-orbit at Kerbin, fire the radial separators to ditch the tanks/engines/legs because the Science Pack doesn\u0027t have enough chutes for them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see how this basic system is upgradable. Swap the batteries for solar panels. Swap the capsule for a 1-man lander can to save a bit of weight. Engines and tanks of different sizes to land on different planets. Add a docking port and RCS for the interplanetary mothership that will lug it to these other planets. Put a docking port between the capsule and Science Pack, and a probe core on the Science Pack, so 1 capsule can take multiple Science Packs to different zones, with each pack returning independently. All sorts of things you can do with this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote there is no ladder. This is because jetpacks suffice for Mun, Minmus, Duna, Ike, and Gilly. And by the time you get to all of those, and probably before, you\u0027ll have the whole tree unlocked, at which point there\u0027s no more need for such little landers. Go built permanent colonies and monstrous bases \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. In any case, don\u0027t bother unlocking ladders unless you\u0027ve got nothing better to spend your points on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: FORGOT STEP 5:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E5. MISSION PLANNING: KERBIN SYSTEM\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, so we\u0027ve done a few mindless hops around on Kerbin with the primary objective of unlocking the Material part. Now we have it so it\u0027s time to go to space. The goal is to land on Mun and Minmus but there are 6 zones we can conquer on the way, namely high and low orbits at Kerbin, Mun, and Minmus. So we\u0027ll do those first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake the basic orbiter version of the Science Pack and shoot it out of the atmosphere twice, once to about 100km, then to about 400km. At apoapsis, run all the experiments and reports. So much for that. Don\u0027t bother slowing down en route to anywhere else again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow we can do the same for Mun. Here you have a choice. You can send 1 ship and do 2 each Goo and Material at Ap and Pe (thus leaving some points on the table but not enough to worry about). Or you can send 2 ships and fire their full broadsides one high and 1 low, with the option of doing them both at once or separately. I really recommend doing both at once because everybody needs to learn how to control flotillas and this is a good place to start if you haven\u0027t already. You\u0027ll definitely need a rather large flotilla to do Eve in 1 launch window so might as well get used to it now. Once you\u0027ve done Mun, you should have no problem (with better rocket parts) doing the same for Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow it\u0027s time to for landers, so slap some radially mounted engines on the Science Pack and go for it. I recommend Minmus first because 1) it takes less of a lander due to its lower gravity, and 2) it pays more than Mun. Land there a few times. Each big flat area is a separate biome, and there are also midlands, highlands, and slopes. The points earned from a couple of Minmus landings will unlock bigger rockets to make a Mun landing easier. Once you think you have the hardware, do the same thing there. I recommend getting into somewhat inclined orbits when you arrive at Mun and Minmus so you\u0027ll fly over multiple biomes. Also, plant flags at every landing and put the biome\u0027s name in their title so you can easily avoid going to the same biome twice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETO BE CONTINUED\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-20T02:23:57Z\u0022 title=\u002212/20/2013 02:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Geschosskopf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Enoted error in 1 of the pics\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T19:14:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EMISSION PLANNING AND SHIP DESIGN FOR SCIENCE!

So, this means you have 6 zones you can hit on this expedition: high and low orbits and Duna and Ike, \u0022in space just above Ike\u0022, and Ike\u0027s surface. You of course always have the option of saving some for a later trip, but if you want to land on Ike, you have to go through all 5 other zones to get there, so you might as well grab their data as you go by.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing through all the zones lends itself to doing Duna with 1 ship. A big mothership, probably assembled by docking, with onboard science for all 4 of the orbital zones and a lander or 2 Ike\u0027s surface and just above it. The lander (or 2) is the easy part; just upgrade your Mun/Minmus workhorse as needed. The real question is how to handle the science for the orbital zones. Here you have several choices:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EA flotilla of 4 Science Pack ships, 1 for each orbital zone, which go out and come home individually. So no need for a mothership and the lander(s) are also individual things. So that\u0027s 6 ships in the flotilla, but only 2 designs.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EA mothership with 4 Science Packs for the orbital zones. Assuming the mothership can\u0027t land in 1 piece, these packs must have a way to get back on the ground at Kerbin by other means, and will probably need probe cores.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EA mothership with the Mobile Lab. This doesn\u0027t need any Science Packs because it can use and reuse the instruments on the lander(s). It does need a crew of 2, however (not included by default), the big, fast antenna, and some big solar panels to power the antenna.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing about transmitting with the Mobile Lab is that it won\u0027t get all the available points, due to the transmission cap at about 40% of returned value. That means to get the rest of the points, you have to go there again and return what\u0027s left, which is something you want to avoid in general. HOWEVER, by this point in the game, you\u0027ve probably only got a few more boxes to unlock and probably don\u0027t care too much about all of them anyway. Besides, you can always get them next time when you land on Duna itself, in the unlikely event you haven\u0027t finished off the tree before then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo of these options, the least complex is using the Mobile Lab. And while it DOES leave points on the table, just transmitting the 4 orbital zones at Duna and Ike (with the ML\u0027s buff) will still get you about 1400 points. A lander for Ike\u0027s surface will do about 1200. So that\u0027s 2600 points for this mission using essentially 1 ship. Of course, you\u0027ll have to be able to dock at least to get the lander back on the Mothership, if not to assemble the whole contraption in orbit to start with. But docking\u0027s a breeze with Navyfish\u0027s instrument so don\u0027t let that stop you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut however you do Duna, you\u0027ll probably finish all your experiments within a few days at most. Then you\u0027ll have to wait about 150 days for a window to come home. You COULD just fast-forward to that point, but why do that when there are other places you can go? Which brings us to Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E7. PLANNING FOR EVE\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a new game, the 1st Eve window comes up about Y1D145, while your Duna expedition is twiddling its thumbs. Might as well take advantage and go to Eve. This is because the way things work out, both the Eve and Duna expeditions will return to Kerbin at nearly the same time. Since you won\u0027t get any more (non-transmitted) points until that day comes, you might as well get 2 batches of points \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Eve system has 12 zones at present: high and low orbits at Eve and Gilly, Eve dirt and ocean surfaces, Eve high and low flying over both dirt and ocean, Gilly\u0027s surface, and just above it. Problem is, returning any science parts from Eve\u0027s surface is pretty much out of the question for most folks. So rather than even try that, we\u0027ll send expendable probes down to Eve and transmit their data, while a manned, returning ship will do the orbital and Gilly zones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Eve probes are simple things. They only need 1 experiment of each type you have because of the transmission limits, which makes them to need only a couple of radial chutes in Eve\u0027s thick air. The main question is, how many of them do you want to send? There are 6 non-returning zones and to get even up to the transmission cap, you probably need 2 probes per zone. So that\u0027s 12 probes for all the points they can get this way, which ain\u0027t enough (about 100 points each for the 1st probe in each zone, way less for the 2nd) to justify a flotilla that big. Even 6 probes is pushing it (remember, you\u0027ll have at least 1 other ship for the orbital zones and Gilly). 3 will work because after the Duna mothership\u0027s transmission, we don\u0027t have much of the tech tree left. 1 on the dirt, 1 in the ocean, and 1 in the air (while parachuting).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting these probes to Eve again presents options. You can do them as individuals or carry them out on a mothership. Your call. The more probes you want to use, the better the mothership option becomes. Large flotillas are trickier at Eve than anywhere else because it\u0027s so close to Kerbin that the ships don\u0027t spread out much during the trip and tend to arrive all at once, which makes for some tense aerocapturing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. If you use a probe mothership, it\u0027s probably best to have it manned and return it with Eve\u0027s orbital zones. That way, you can keep the Gilly ship totally separate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason to keep the Gilly ship separate is because of the delta-V required to get from Eve to Gilly and far enough back to Eve to have a reasonably easy shot back to Kerbin. Big inclination changes, plus huge orbit size differences. If you try to include all this delta-V in the same ship that carries the probes, you\u0027ll ended up with a real monstrosity. Which is cool but....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, doing Eve pretty much requires a flotilla of at least 2 ships. That would be a mothership with however many probes and 2 Science Packs (probably droppable) of its own for high and low Eve orbit, plus a capsule for EVA and crew reports there. The other would have 4 Science Packs and a capsule for all the Gilly zones. Gilly\u0027s got such low gravity that you can land the mothership itself there without too much trouble, so no real need of a separate lander. Just remember, though, that you still need to get all that data back down on Kerbin. Of course, if you love flotillas, you can break this up into a massive invasion fleet \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. However you do it, though, you\u0027ll get over 2000 points for this, too, and that should finish off the tech tree for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: I mentioned above that the Duna and Eve expeditions would arrive at nearly the same time. Usually, they\u0027re a few days to a week apart, but sometimes at least 1 Eve ship will come back the same day as the Duna ship. This is pretty cool--a race to the base \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.

Land on 1 biome, grab the data, return to the mothership, stuff the data in the ML, use the ML to rearm the experiments, and repeat on the next biome.
