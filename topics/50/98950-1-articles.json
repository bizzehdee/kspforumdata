I discovered that this torque display can be very helpful in conquering one of KSP\u0027s greatest challenge: creating a NASA-style Space Shuttle. The biggest challenge with the Shuttle is that it can be hard to line up the center of thrust with the center of mass and keep them aligned throughout the flight. With the stock tools, you can get some idea of how it will fly by trying to line up the CoM and CoT overlays, but it\u0027s really imprecise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve created a mini-tutorial showing how to use this torque display to your advantage to get your shuttle to fly correctly!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/kDkZu\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

In my example shuttle, the torque right before booster separation gets pretty high, but can be overcome with the use of RCS and vernors until the boosters drop and torque returns to a manageable level. Torque also increases later when you\u0027re flying just with the external tank but you can just throttle down to keep that under control.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LABHOUSE","CreatedById":107761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-07T16:13:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETime to update it I guess! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow to wait for .90 so the wings are bigger...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-07T16:33:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI found that RCS Build Aid also has similar functionality that works pretty much the same.
