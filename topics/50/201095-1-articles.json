This is a serious problem if your on the dark side of an orbit. However, there are many easy ways to fix this problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.RTGS:They\u0027re heavy and reduce acceleration, as well as expensive and can irradiate the crew in life support mods, but this is one solution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.Fuel cell powered ions. This reduced the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E to a mere 1200, but its nice to add 1 or two dumplings and a single fuel cell for backup power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.This is the easiest. Just start from a higher orbit. Not only will you have more time to do the burn, but the time in shadow relative to the orbital period is low.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4.Perapisis kicking. For the ones who are really stingy about fuel, perapisis kicking is helpful, but when you have 50,000 delta-v, would simply spending 1000dv to enter a higher orbit be way easier?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5.Batteries. Not very practical, for a ship entirely made of batteries and irgnoring xenon, you can get a max of 3000dv. Still, helpful for emergency manoeuvres or in Kerbalism where fuel cells can fail any moment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. Staged batteries. Good for Vall landers, not much else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope this helped you!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-03-31T08:00:10Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2021 08:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Single stage to ocean\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
