Don\u0027t just close their window with the \u0022X\u0022 button! That saves much less memory than ending its task. Chrome will say that it did \u0022not shutdown correctly,\u0022 and if you end the chrome.exe instance used by/for Hangouts, it will say that Hangouts has crashed, but ignore that. It\u0027s all good. And finally, if KSP crashes and KSP.exe is still visible in the Task Manager, end the task, especially before starting KSP again. Remember, this is just a \u0022dead\u0022 instance of the program that crashed funny.

RAM is always cheapest when it works with current architectures, and when it is replaced by the next type, it starts getting steadily more expensive. Expensive enough that it\u0027s cheaper for me to replace old computers with new ones than it is to upgrade them from 2GB to even 8GB now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it\u0027s not only about how much RAM the games take, you want to have a healthy amount left over for things like disk cache and SuperFetch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Naten\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Naten\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI did not know at the time that the Microsoft Store assumed that you wanted 32-bit if you used a 32-bit computer to buy the OS.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep, that\u0027s a bummer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Naten\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Naten\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDo I get internets for building my own system without parental guidance?
