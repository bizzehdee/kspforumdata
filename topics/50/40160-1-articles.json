The bad part is that we still have the limitation that one new element in the editor can only be connected to one existing element and not multiple ones, which means that a coupler placed below a cluster (kind of a \u0022re-coupler\u0022) to have it connected to the stage below will only connect to one of the engines, making the overall connection totally unstable. However, there is a solution that was brought up by allmhuran in this post, which I thought deserves to be made into a tutorial (with nice colorful pictures, yay \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E).

Just make sure to disable fuel crossfeed if they are no decouplers around in the way to stop fuel flow. If you do that you need to either create an action group or manually stage the decouple node on the docking port.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep, usually it is possible to attach a docking port to any construction node, but it will only be able to undock from there, while we need the docking abilities that only 2 docking ports facing each other can give us. That\u0027s because the normal construction logic will let us attach a part via one node only, but for attaching a lower stage to an engine cluster we need more than that (just read the complete tutorial for a bit more detail on that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-17T08:09:19Z\u0022 title=\u002209/17/2013 08:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by thox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jake9039","CreatedById":122602,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T19:29:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll do this, but my worry that the docking port may attach to the docking port in editor,instead of the tricoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T19:37:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you aware you\u0027re replying to a thread that has been dead since September \u003Cstrong\u003E2013\u003C/strong\u003E. 15 months!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phunk","CreatedById":77377,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T19:44:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jake9039\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jake9039\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ll do this, but my worry that the docking port may attach to the docking port in editor,instead of the tricoupler.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter you attach the coupler to the first docking port, detach the docking port and decoupler, and rotate it so the other two spots are sticking out from the side of the rocket, add the last two ports, then rotate it back into place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EETA: Needed an excuse to figure out imgur albums, so here\u0027s one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/ATy4m\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
