As for editing, I just use Windows Life Movie Maker. It\u0027s not as powerful as Adobe After Effects or Sony Vegas, but I can put together a video on WLMM in a fraction of the time, and the restrictions force me to be creative and careful in my design choices. Give those a try, and I\u0027ll be happy to help you learn some of the ins and outs of the tools.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the recording tips.

Moho caught me out big time using the delta V maps as they don\u0027t account for inclination and eccentricity and my probe came screaming in much faster than I expected taking more fuel to capture and ran out of fuel before I could circularize.
