Started my Kerbal Space Program experience with the demo, and the jump to 1.0.0 was a quite big one. Of course I went straight into career mode to learn everything about the game step-by-step.\n\nThen I had to figure out that the first thing the Kerbals would do is going straight into a rocket and start their first manned mission. Without having a clue about anything, that involves too much courage and stupidity for my Kerbals. As I am not into using mods but want to experience everything with the original game, i.e. stock, the idea of this thread was born.\n\n**Goal**\n\nThe first vessel that is ever started is unmanned (definition of a vessel: It has any sort of engine). No Kerbal is put at risk, except if the vessel crash lands in the space center later on. \n\n**Requirements**\n\nIn order to start an unmanned vessel, we need an unmanned pod. I chose the Stayputnik Mk.1 as it has the lowest requirements.\n\nTechnology requirements for Stayputnik Mk. 1:\n\n- Engineering 101 (5 science)\n- Survivability (15 science)\n- Basic Science (45 science)\n\nThis means that we have to achieve **65 science** points without lifting off the ground. Quite a challenge, but manageable!\n\n**Execution**\n\n1. Accept the mission \u0022Gather scientific data from Kerbin.\u0022 We will gain 6 science for completing it\n2. Build a simple manned vessel consisting of just 1 pod and 3 goo canisters\n3. Get it on the Launch Pad and Runway, perform science activities there (Crew Report, 2 EVAs [flight, ground], 3 Mystery Goo Containment Units)\n\n![xWQmtS6.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/xWQmtS6.jpg)\n\nBy now, we have acquired 8 \u002B 6 \u002B 4.7 = **18.7 science** points. It\u0027s no rocket science so far (pun intended).\n\n1. Unlock Engineering 101 in Research and Development\n2. Unlock item SC-9001 Science Jr.\n\nWe could repeat the previous steps with the Science Jr. device, but we would be still too far away from our required 65 science points. It would be possible if we could reach the other biomes in the space center. Each one can give us **10.35 science** points by now, which means that we have to visit 6 biomes. Keep in mind that 2 are already reachable, namely Launch Pad and Runway. So 4 are missing. As we don\u0027t want to start any engines, I present you the *Science Roller*:\n\n![8dRh6Tp.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/8dRh6Tp.jpg)\n\nIt consists of:\n\n- 6 x Mk1 Command Pod\n- 1 x SC-9001 Science Jr.\n- 1 x Mystery Goo Containment Unit\n\nRemove all the Mono Propellant from the Command Pods to reduce weight. We run only with electric charge, and use the other pods for stability and batteries. Later on, we even store duplicate science experiments in them to reduce required time and starts. With this design, it\u0027s possible to reach a few biomes of the space center to repeat the science experiments, gaining enough points to unlock Stayputnik Mk. 1.\n\n![OllCG9L.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/OllCG9L.jpg)\n\n1. Get Bob (the scientist) into the vessel\n2. Start the Science Roller on Launch Pad\n3. Collect science data 3 times in a row and store them in 3 Command Pods so this step doesn\u0027t have to be repeated, which is why we need Bob. And that is why we need only one Mystery Goo Containment Unit and only one SC-9001 Science Jr.\n4. Roll from Launch Pad to KSC biome and repeat the science gathering\n5. Repeat with Launch Pad to Vehicle Assembly Building\n6. Repeat with Launch Pad to Mission Control\n7. Repeat with Launch Pad to Tracking Station\n8. Start Science Roller on Runway and gather remaining science points\n\n![6zEJqOT.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/6zEJqOT.jpg)\n\nTips:\n\n- Already lay down the vessel so you don\u0027t waste precious electric charge to flip it over\n- Already rotate it in VAB so it directs to the proper biome\n- The vessel will turn to the left when you roll, make short brakes and adjust direction through help with your navball\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe have successfully gained enough science points (and even in reasonable time and \u0022starts\u0022) to unlock the Stayputnik Mk. 1. This means that our actual flights can be done unmanned right from the start, possibly saving many Kerbals from... early retirements! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n![kXB4VEl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/kXB4VEl.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T22:31:28Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 10:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Paldium**"}]}
