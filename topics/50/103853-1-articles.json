Target docking port faces North (red line on nav ball) (make sure you click on \u0022control from here\u0022 on the docking port to line it up correctly)\n\n2. Controlled port faces South (180 degrees) (make sure you \u0022control from here\u0022 on the docking port again)\n\n3. Kill relative velocity to target.\n\n4. Burn towards target\n\n5. Activate chase cam, position vantage point directly behind controlled port (so you can see the engines)\n\n6. Use RCS keys H, N, I, J, K, L to reposition as needed.\n\n7. GO SLOW!\n\n8. ???\n\n9. Profit!\n\nI also did a sort of \u0022tutorial\u0022 kind of on Docking during my last KSP stream that I did. Check my signature for the link if you wish.\n\n----EDIT----\n\nThe reason you want the ports facing north and south (on a 90 degree orbit) is because as the two crafts orbit the planet, the locations of the docking ports will \u0022drift\u0022 otherwise. Having the ports aligned North and South means they wont \u0022drift\u0022 and will be in the same location no matter where at in the orbit they are.\n\nNot having the ports aligned this way makes docking about 300 times harder because you\u0027re constantly making not only course corrections, but alignment corrections too. On two crafts. At the same time.\n\nSo do yourself a favor and line those puppies up!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-10T22:12:44Z\u0022 title=\u002204/10/2015 10:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Greenfire32**"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T17:33:58Z","Content":"Stickied at the top of this forum section is \u0022The Drawing Board\u0022, which lists all (the best) tutorials available.\n\nLink is also in my signature."},{"CreatedByName":"DDay2021","CreatedById":136105,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T17:41:41Z","Content":"What helped me the most was realizing that the prograde marker when in target mode could more accurately be described as a velocity indicator.\n\n1) After getting and executing an intercept of a few Km\u0027s you should kill any velocity differential - thrust retrograde on the navball.\n\n2) Align to the target marker and thrust until you have a closure of 10-15 m/s\n\n3) Repeat 1 and 2 as necessary until you get within 500m or so then kill the closing velocity and close using RCS.\n\n4) Use Greenfire\u0027s description above.\n\n[NavyFish\u0027s Docking Port Alignment Indicator](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43901-0-90-Docking-Port-Alignment-Indicator-%28Version-6-1-Updated-03-07-2015%29) is a handy mod to use also.\n\nI rarely look at the two ships while docking just the Navball and the alignment indicator."},{"CreatedByName":"rudi1291","CreatedById":138990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T18:00:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 1) After getting and executing an intercept of a few Km\u0027s you should kill any velocity differential - thrust retrograde on the navball.\n\nMake sure to switch your navball to target mode (click on it) before this ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Greenfire32","CreatedById":36705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T22:09:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Make sure to switch your navball to target mode (click on it) before this ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nOnly if it doesn\u0027t automagically switch for you ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"}]}
