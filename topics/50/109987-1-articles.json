My rocket won\u0027t stop flipping!\u0022 or \u0022KSP is impossible now!\u0022, I thought I\u0027d put up a few Crazy Things I\u0027ve Gotten to Orbit with some comments on how I did it. I bet the rest of the community has ships bigger, uglier, prettier and crazier than mine.\n\n1) \u0022Ore Piggy\u0022 Delivery vehicle \n\nThis one carried a pair of ore transporters to my Minmus mining operation.\n\nProblems: Large mass, uneven internal payload\n\nSolution: Thrust vectoring of the LFBs helped a lot. Aero shape and minimal fins were enough for the core stage.\n\n![GF7jxZs.png](http://i.imgur.com/GF7jxZs.png)\n\n2) Payload in a big fairing\n\nI\u0027ve used a design like this to deliver several space stations and surface labs.\n\nProblems: Large mass. Wide front means lots of front-end drag even with fairings \n\nSolution: No fin was big enough. I put four delta wings with elevons on the end of the core stage. You can see them sticking out between the strap-on boosters.\n\n![WA7QzG4.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/WA7QzG4.jpg)\n\n3) Big-S Space Station\n\nThis is my main fueling station around Minmus. The \u0027ore piggies\u0027 from craft #1 cycle to it from the surface.\n\nProblems: Huge mass, not streamlined. Docking ports and fuel pods everywhere.\n\nSolution: Forget about efficient ascent. Fins and SAS to hold course straight up to 30km, then turn east. Lots of struts connecting stages--typically running between two sets of four radially placed cubic octagonal anchor points (one set on each of the two mating stages). \n\n![FcPb5oV.png](http://i.imgur.com/FcPb5oV.png)\n\n4) Not-SSTO Interplanetary Explorer\n\nThis is my Duna ship: VTOL capable with full surface mining/processing facilities. I did not want to carry the mass of jets to Duna, so this is a rocket plane only. \n\nProblems: At first I tried carrying jet pods on the wings and ejecting them at altitude, but the highly variable thrust of V1.0.2 turboramjets made that impractical--center of thrust moved faster than I could react, flipping me out.\n\nSolution: Drag can lift as well as balance--horizontal launch with \u0022White Knight\u0022 style expendable first stage rocket plane. There is a Skipper engine mounted dorsally to the LFB (and behind the orbital vehicle, not connected to it) to bring the center of thrust closer to center of mass. Constant adjustment of LFB thrust required to keep thrust offset angle near zero.\n\n![Jb4YCuf.png](http://i.imgur.com/Jb4YCuf.png)\n\nEverything can still be done, you might just have to do it a different way. Possibly by taking a solution from real life, possibly by doing something #lolsokerbal, but there is ALWAYS a way.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T23:37:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 11:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kuzzter**"},{"CreatedByName":"Chewy","CreatedById":115853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T20:27:19Z","Content":"That\u0027s why I love this game.

My sustainer engine outputs 2650kN of thrust (150 more than a Rhino) and peaks out at a vac Isp of 405. Heck, my upper stage maxes out at 455. Also, these burn LH2/Ox (InterstellarFuelSwitch).

From some documents from Boeing (at least I think it was Boeing; it pertained to the Delta IV Heavy at least), we found that realistically, a fairing can be up to 167% the diameter of its stack and behave just fine. For the largest stock fairing, that will enclose a 6.2m payload. We also found that in the real world, you can go as large as 190% before aerodynamic forces become difficult to counter. Thats up to a 7.1 meter payload.\n\nALso, stock aero is pretty easy to fly under if you keep the forces balanced.

After many test flights fiery crashes, I think I\u0027ve figured out how to stabilize these beasts all the way to orbit.\n\nFirst and most important, [Throttle Controlled Avionics](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107802-Throttle-Controlled-Avionics-2-2-1-1-0-2-Continued?highlight=avionics) is required. This is a very useful mod, especially for VTOLs that may not be perfectly balanced. TCA adds a button to the right-click tweakable menu that cycles between \u0027Main Engine,\u0027 \u0027Maneuver Engine,\u0027 and \u0027Manual Control,\u0027 and will throttle engines as necessary to maintain balanced thrust.\n\nThe first thing I tried to launch was this LFO-moving rover, to move LFO around my Minmus operations. \n\n![ov3XWlg.png](http://i.imgur.com/ov3XWlg.png)\n\nFairings didn\u0027t help, as I guess it was too far off balance. I tried different things, like fins on the 2nd stage, but still no go. Even going nuts with vernors wasn\u0027t enough. I already had TCA for landing the rover, and with a bit of tweaking, I was able to make orbit. \n\nAll of the main lifter engines were set to \u0027Manual Control\u0027 . The \u0027Twitch\u0027 engines on the rover were left as \u0027Main Engine\u0027 and assigned to a hotkey. Some big control fins (delta wings and elevons) on the bottom got it through the first stage burn. When I staged, I also activated TCA (press \u0027y\u0027), RCS, and the Twitch engines. This was enough to keep the flame side rearward the rest of the way to orbit.\n\n![B1MYHQH.png](http://i.imgur.com/B1MYHQH.png)\n\nMy next difficult launch was sending a science package of probes to the Eve system. Each long cargo bay holds a lander and a scanning satellite, and I wanted to launch a set for both Eve and Gilly in one launch. The result was this tall skinny thing, which was totally flip-happy. The lifting-body cargo bays probably didn\u0027t help. \n\n![pgAEJq8.png](http://i.imgur.com/pgAEJq8.png)\n\nSo I did the same thing. I put some Twitch engines at the top of each cargo bay, and set up the engines like I did previously. I lit the Twitches and activated TCA at the first sign of an impending flip. It was stable all the way to orbit and is currently on the way to Eve.\n\nI hope this helps somebody.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-02T02:12:27Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2015 02:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by StrandedonEarth**"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T09:43:59Z","Content":"These are all career examples, which force some interesting compromises.\n\nThe craziest things for me tend to be stations. Below is the first example, where I launched the lab module, habitat module, and tug all at once. This one is notable just because its a very long and draggy fairing with relatively light weight components inside, which is why I wanted to launch all three components together. The key here is mostly 20 AV-R8 control fins placed as low and outside as possible (along with the 5 mainsail gimbles in the rocket SSTO launcher). Also note that all struts are as aligned with the airflow as possible.\n\n![YiGI27x.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/YiGI27x.jpg)\n\n![Qax1Wbm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Qax1Wbm.jpg)\n\nHere is another station, and the hardest thing I\u0027ve had to launch. First of all, I didn\u0027t have low tech like no fairing that could hold it and only modular girders for structure. Secondly, most of the connections use docking port juniors, which are all that I had but are VERY wobbly. Here aligning the struts with the airflow was key. When the struts were in an X configuration they wobbled until it all exploded, but switching to the vertical airflow aligned configuration below eliminated the wobble. I also using 20 low and outside control fins here. Notably I tried wings here, but they did not help nearly as much as just adding more control fins.\n\n![tzjJ4OF.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/tzjJ4OF.jpg)\n\n![k9cWrSc.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/k9cWrSc.jpg)\n\nFinally, a different class of problems comes when hauling things with their own lift to orbit. Here I am lifting my standard nuclear tug. I like this configuration with 2 wide nukes, because they are stackable (need more TWR, just add more tugs), \\*limited by wobble. However, the wide arrangement doesn\u0027t fit in a fairing, so I had to overcome the lift generated by the radiators fins. Here I used 4 delta wings generated enough lift below the CoM to offset the lift in the upper stage. The launcher is my medium 3 mainsail rcoket SSTO. \n\n![mQuRvIN.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/mQuRvIN.jpg)\n\nCheers,\n\nCyberSoul"},{"CreatedByName":"Cirrus","CreatedById":145623,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T12:58:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thanks, this is an important point that hasn\u0027t been raised before on the thread--sometimes turning a control surface off is better than keeping it on, because they like to fight each other!
