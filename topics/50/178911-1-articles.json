RAPIER engines,\u00A0 however\u00A0 you are unlikely to see those till the very end of career mode,\u00A0 being Tier 9 \u00A0(1000 Science points).\u00A0 \u00A0While not as popular as RAPIER designs,\u00A0 Whiplash Space Planes aren\u0027t uncommon,\u00A0 but as Tier 8 engines, they have a Science cost of 550,\u00A0 which means you aren\u0027t getting them without a\u00A0 max level R\u0026amp;D\u00A0 building.\u00A0 And that\u0027s a hugely expensive upgrade,\u00A0 given that funds tend to be harder to acquire than science

a fine engine, but it\u0027s thrust output peaks at mach 2.5 and goes to zero by mach 3.\u00A0 \u00A0 Realistically, your space plane is not getting much above mach 2.5 on jet power,\u00A0 \u00A0and that means your rockets need to add another 4.5 mach\u0027s worth of velocity to reach orbit.\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 On chemical engines,\u00A0 this requires a very large fuel fraction that leaves little room for payload, and that payload fraction soon disappears altogether if you attempt to\u00A0 go beyond low orbit.\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever,\u00A0 you

\u00A0 However ,\u00A0 you have to remember that your spaceplane is an airplane and it does not need a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E over 1 to fly.\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0The engines will be thrusting horizontally to accelerate you to orbital velocity,\u00A0 \u00A0the wings take care of gravity, to stop you plummeting to the ground.\u00A0 \u00A0

-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nIn supersonic flight,\u00A0 best lift to drag ratio happens at about 5 degrees ApA.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUnlike real airplanes in KSP,\u00A0 the wing generates less than 20% of the drag your craft is producing.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSome parts are very draggy.\u00A0 \u00A0 Solar panels, even deployable ones, need to be in a service bay.\u00A0 1.25m bicouplers are meant for use on rocket stacks,\u00A0 and are very draggy on an airplane. \u00A0 Mk2 fuselage parts should be avoided, they make\u00A0 250% of the drag of a mk1 part of the same length and fuel capacity.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMismatched attach nodes create massive drag.\u00A0 \u00A0A 1.25m attach node \u00A0should only ever join to another 1.25m\u00A0 node.\u00A0 If your fuselage is tapering down to 0.625m,\u00A0 use an NCS adapter to smooth the transition.\u00A0 If it\u0027s flaring out to a mk2 cargo bay, use a mk1 to mk2 adapter short.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0That second point is counterintuitive - people often reduce wing area thinking it will reduce drag,\u00A0 but you end up needing a higher angle of attack to get the same lift, or\u00A0 flying at a lower altitude where the air is thicker.\u00A0 \u00A0 When on jet power, a smaller wing can \u00A0improve performance, because at lower altitudes your engine can make more power.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv

delay your airplane climbing to higher altitudes, where drag is less.\u00A0 Over the course of the entire ascent, the lowest total drag is obtained by remaining pitched at optimal ;L/D - 5 degrees - even if that produces surplus lift at times, and insufficient at others.\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0The only time you pitch away from optimal L/D is when you are on jet power, because the Panther has
