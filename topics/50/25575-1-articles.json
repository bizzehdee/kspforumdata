I figured we\u0027ll give it a go here. The idea is to post neat things that help you play the game that may not be obvious from the outset. I\u0027m not talking about mods, I\u0027m talking about basic stock parts to the game that players, maybe even experienced players, may not know about or take advantage of.

A lower stage of 2 orange tanks and one gray \u0022trashcan\u0022 tank, plus a trashcan/poodle upper AND a wide/funky payload (my Mun base) or a long payload (MOSS core) are able to make a gravity turn and exit the atmosphere without the usual oscillations that accompany long rockets in KSP.

The best way, I\u0027ve found, is to test everything on Kerbin. It\u0027s best to use the subassembly loader, but even if you\u0027re pathologically averse to non-parts mods you can do testing without it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELining up docking ports can be tough, and to make sure your base is really stable you have to be very accurate with their positioning. You can test all of your components on the launch pad, or near it if you aren\u0027t using subassembly loader. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere I\u0027ve connected 2 parts of my Minmus base using subassembly loader and put them on the launch pad. Sometimes your landing legs will break if you try to deploy them on the ground. You can use your landing engines to take some of the strain off of them, but that can be a little tricky. The other way is to attach a few launch clamps, then drop the whole thing to the ground once the legs are already deployed, you might still need to use the engines a bit though, to slow down the descent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Kerbal%20MinMus/2013-05-06_00006.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-06_00006.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere it is on the ground. The wheels are on detachable radial structural points, which is nice for getting them out of the way, and for keeping your final part-count down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Kerbal%20MinMus/2013-05-06_00008.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-06_00008.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo check if everything really fits well together try activating and deactivating time-warp. If your components mostly stay in place then your docking ports and landing struts should be aligned fairly well. Another way to check is to decouple the docking ports and see if they line up. The ports have been decoupled here, but they still line up almost perfectly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Kerbal%20MinMus/2013-05-06_00009.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-06_00009.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis part demonstrates a few other things. First, having a wide, detachable wheel base lets you drive around and dock to your base and get rid of unnecessary parts (the final component has just 12 parts, but the whole landing apparatus has 100). Also, those fuel tanks hanging on the sides help to keep the center of mass balanced, which is something that caused problems with the truss segment above. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Kerbal%20MinMus/2013-05-06_00010.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-06_00010.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with this is that those full fuel tanks make the whole thing way too heavy to test on Kerbin, the wheels will be destroyed almost regardless of how you deploy the thing. Which brings up the other thing that launch clamps are useful for, draining fuel on the launch pad. Just attach an engine if you need one and burn most of your fuel before you drop it to the ground, you might still need to use the landing engines for a gentle drop though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Kerbal%20MinMus/2013-05-06_00016.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-06_00016.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that you have the thing on wheels, you can just drive it off the launch pad. Take it all the way past the little drop off and you can put something else on the launch pad without clearing it first. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Kerbal%20MinMus/2013-05-06_00019.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-06_00019.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoing this, you can put together as many segments as you want without using the subassembly loader. It\u0027s also useful to see, not only if your docking ports line up, but if you can actually put things in position and dock them properly.

I was having trouble controlling the final long rocket stage (it would not turn around the long axis to, literally, save itself). I eventually stuck 4 radial engines on long struts sticking out from the side. Trying to keep the thing pointed along my orbital route while at 50km up ended up whipping the Mainsail and lower orange fuel tank off the end of the rocket. Luckily, the radial engines were suspended off the side of the upper orange tank and got me the rest of the way into orbit. (And the payload was a lander with a couple LV-N\u0027s on the back for Kerbin to Minmas transport.)
