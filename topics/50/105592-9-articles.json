Maybe that part is covered by Squad license though (as I believe my tool can be considered a game mod).\n\nAnyone with more knowledge could tell wether this redistribution is allowed or not (with explained citations)?

But I\u0027d be more comfortable knowing that it\u0027s not illegal (even if near the border).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-28T13:42:34Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2015 01:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Youen**"},{"CreatedByName":"Schpulke","CreatedById":146447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T10:15:36Z","Content":"Got problem when switching the ships.
