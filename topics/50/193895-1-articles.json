You can use the previewer in KVV and watch as you manipulate whatever part you need to manipulate to move the rotors about: the preview and build scene will update the axial lines as the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E moves \u003Cem\u003Elive as you move the part/s\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eas well. Orthographic view in KVV squashes everything in the previewer into a 2D plane perpendicular to the viewpoint, which greatly assists in getting things lined up.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease note that the lines will only draw through the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E, despite \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E Build Aid being able to track the ACOM and DCOM.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor quadcopters/tandem birotor craft, the crossmarks through the axes can be used to gauge distance from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E to balance things out without using differential thrust.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am not sure if having Hangar Grid is essential in getting the lines to draw (as can be seen in my mod toolbar), as it draws its own guide lines for part rotational assistance.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
