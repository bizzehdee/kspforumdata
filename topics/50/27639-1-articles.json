Intro\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHello, today I will be showing you how to make an absolutely perfect space plane! I would really suggest this guide for beginners trying to get into the world of planes in Kerbal Space Program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2. Getting Started\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, make sure you are using the newest version of Kerbal Space Program, and it is NOT pirated, when you buy it, the devs get helped out. As crazy as this sounds, it\u0027s true, they really get helped out, and it\u0027s a really nice thing to do. Also, make sure you read this slowly, some of this stuff may be confusing, but, if you read carefully, I will help you out with what everything means.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3. Begin Building (Alread!?!?)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, you will want to start building. Go ahead and make a new save file or use an old one, it doesn\u0027t matter! To start off with, use ANY cockpit you want, this tutorial is going to teach you how to make anything using anything, as long as you follow these directions. First off, make whatever you want, just, start off making sense. It can be as crazy or as normal as you want, just remember these basic tips\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The Center of Gravity is ALWAYS above Center of Lift. The buttons show you CoM (Center of Mass, The anvil button), CoL (Center of \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Lift, the canard button), and finally CoT (Center of Thrust, the thruster button) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Always look at your aircraft from a 90* angle on the side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Remember the, fuel flows from the front in KSP, so you might want to start off with the CoM in front of the CoL. If the fuel flows from the \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E front, then it automatically disbalances the weight moving the weight to the back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. If the CoM is in the back, then it will ALWAYS not be able to get out of a stall, flatspin all the time, and will be an all around horrible plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Paint a picture in that little head of yours, imagine that the Mass was in the back, when you stall it, it will ALWAYS fall backwards and \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E NEVER go forwards, causing the aircraft to crash itself. Now, imagine it forward, it will stall like a REAL plane and will go forward, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E correcting itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This is how your Aircraft should look if \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E CoM = Orange\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E CoL = Blue\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Front is on the left, and back is on the right\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BKqaeGrCUAA5BjN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022BKqaeGrCUAA5BjN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really hope that this will help you, if you would like more tutorials, click these links:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-snip again-\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-25T03:07:16Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2013 03:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Aphox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdFly links are not allowed.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zombie2u","CreatedById":66824,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T20:25:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis needs to be seen...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rickenbacker","CreatedById":2349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T21:48:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe CoG shouldn\u0027t be TOO far in front of the CoL, though.
