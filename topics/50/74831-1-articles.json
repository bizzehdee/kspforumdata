But it\u0027s not whether you are ON LAND or ON WATER, it\u0027s whether you LANDED or SPLASHED (SrfLanded vs SrfSplashed). Which is why you can splashdown into a lake then walk to a mountain biome and get science from it even if you previously got science from that mountain biome during a previous landing (actually, a bit more since you get 0.4 for the splashdown instead of 0.3 for landing). I tested this earlier and verified that is the case. So again, what to do with the spreadsheet? I\u0027m thinking that since we\u0027re talking about new situations not new biomes, I will duplicate the SURFACE columns and rename them SURFACE (Landed) and SURFACE (Splashed).
