Gravity assists are useful because they allow you to gain or lose orbital energy or make expensive maneuvers such as plane changes for free; however, they are difficult to set up and require careful planning and lots of patience. That said, once you master them, you can manage feats you wouldn\u0027t have thought possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn orbit around Jool and low on fuel? \u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/nJYr0#17\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EA little help from Tylo\u003C/a\u003E can get you home for free.

When I say \u0022above\u0022 I mean further out from the primary; \u0022below\u0022 is closer in. \u0022In front\u0022 or \u0022ahead\u0022 and \u0022behind\u0022 are in terms of an object\u0027s orbit about the primary and correspond to east and west on the surface of the primary; north and south are with respect to the poles of the primary. \u0022Slower\u0022 and \u0022faster\u0022 refer to orbital speed about the primary. \u0022Closing speed\u0022 means the relative speed between your spacecraft and the secondary (planet or moon) \u003Cem\u003Eat the moment at which you transition into the secondary\u0027s SoI.\u003C/em\u003E A \u0022tangential (transfer) orbit\u0022 is an orbit which touches that of the secondary at exactly one point and which is heading in exactly the same direction at the point of contact; a \u0022crossing orbit\u0022 is one which touches the orbit of the secondary at either one or two points, but is not heading in the same direction at the point of contact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so now that the technical definitions are out of the way, on with the tutorial! In the following four parts, I\u0027m going to try to answer the following questions: 1) How does a gravity assist work? 2) When is it appropriate to use one? 3) How do you set one up? 4) What kinds of gravity assists are there and what can be done with them? Because these questions are difficult to answer using just words, I\u0027m going to intermittently link screen shots from in-game examples. So, on to business!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart One\u003C/strong\u003E How do gravity assists work?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first thing to understand about a gravity assist is that orbits about a single body are fixed; the only way to get an orbit to change is to either do something (expend fuel) or run into something (aerobrake, lithobrake, or change SoIs). This last option is the one we care about: \u003Cem\u003Eany time we change SoIs, we are performing a gravity assist maneuver.\u003C/em\u003E Furthermore, changing SoIs is the \u003Cem\u003Eonly way\u003C/em\u003E to perform such a maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs everyone who has experienced missions beyond LKO will recognize, when you encounter another object your post-encounter trajectory about your primary will be different than your pre-encounter trajectory (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EWBtJzg.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esometimes markedly so!\u003C/a\u003E). The reason for this is that while you are within the SoI of the secondary you are subject to its gravity rather than that of the primary. However, in order to be able to make use of this difference, we have to understand \u003Cem\u003Ehow\u003C/em\u003E this effect changes our post-encounter trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis first thing to understand is that, because we are approaching the secondary from outside it\u0027s SoI, after we enter the secondary\u0027s SoI \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6oEvBAD.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewe will be on an escape trajectory\u003C/a\u003E (typically a hyperbolic one, but not always so). \u003Cem\u003ERule One\u003C/em\u003E is \u0022what goes down must come up\u0022 (unless we slow down by burning or hitting something); we have too much velocity to remain within the secondary\u0027s SoI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second thing to understand is that gravity is a conservative force; our kinetic energy at any point in our orbit is equal to the kinetic energy we had when we entered the SoI plus the energy we have gained by falling (which is linear with respect to our altitude). While it\u0027s not really necessary to understand the physics here, the up shot is that because the SoI is a sphere centered on the secondary, our altitude at the point where we leave the SoI is exactly the same as the altitude with which we entered, so our kinetic energy (and hence our speed) will be the same. \u003Cem\u003ERule Two\u003C/em\u003E is \u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eE7wEyy.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eyou leave an SoI\u003C/a\u003E with the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AqKvC2x.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esame speed with which you entered\u003C/a\u003E.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this is the case - if our speed is the same before and after - how has the encounter changed our orbit about the primary? \u003Cem\u003ERule One\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003ERule Two\u003C/em\u003E apply to our trajectory \u003Cem\u003Ewhile we\u0027re within the SoI of the secondary,\u003C/em\u003E and thus are given from the point of view of the secondary body. While all of this is occurring within the SoI of the secondary, that SoI itself is moving with respect to the primary; thus, our velocity with respect to the primary is the sum of our closing speed with respect to the secondary and the secondary\u0027s own velocity about the primary. Furthermore, while our speed with respect to the secondary doesn\u0027t change as a result of the encounter, our direction of travel \u003Cem\u003Edoes.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuppose we enter the SoI of the secondary from directly ahead, and then we use the gravity of that body to alter the direction of our trajectory by 180 degrees. This means that we will be leaving from the front of the SoI at exactly the same speed (with respect to the secondary) with which we entered. However, from the point of view of the primary, we started off traveling \u003Cem\u003Emore slowly\u003C/em\u003E than the secondary by an amount equal to the closing speed, and we ended the encounter traveling \u003Cem\u003Emore quickly\u003C/em\u003E by that same amount. Thus, we have added exactly twice our original closing speed from our velocity about the primary, and in the process turned what used to be the apoapsis of our orbit into the periapsis. This change, and it\u0027s reverse, mark the most basic (and often the most useful) type of gravity assist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the Mun example above, we were traveling at a (Kerbin relative) speed of \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6oEvBAD.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E251 m/s\u003C/a\u003E prior to the encounter and a speed of \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LoUty8e.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E608 m/s\u003C/a\u003E after. Not quite a gain of double our closing speed, but the Mun\u0027s not heavy enough to bend our trajectory the full 180 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart Two\u003C/strong\u003E When is it appropriate to use a gravity assist?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that we understand the mechanism underlying gravity assists - using the gravity of the secondary to deflect our orbit - we need to understand when they should and should not be used. The answer to this question depends on two factors: closing speed, and the mass of the secondary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we have seen above, the most extreme change which can be made is to add or subtract twice our closing speed from our velocity with respect to the primary. This lets us change \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5OMa9Ry.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ea periapsis into an apoapsis\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EWBtJzg.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ean apoapsis into a periapsis\u003C/a\u003E, and reach a variety of orbits in between - but it is contingent on a number of factors. If the secondary body already marks the apoapsis of our orbit, we cannot go any lower than that: to slow down we need to exit the secondary\u0027s SoI from the rear, but our pre-encounter trajectory is already crossing the secondary\u0027s SoI from front to back; any deflection will move us off of this trajectory, increasing our speed relative to the primary and widening our orbit. Likewise, if the secondary marks our periapsis we cannot go any higher. (There are some caveats to this that have to do with inclination which I\u0027ll get into in Part Four.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, the primary use for a gravity assist is to use an encounter with an object intermediate between us and our target to help boost us to where we want to go. For instance, if we wanted to get to Minmus, we could plot a course for the Mun and \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wMQr0kF.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Euse the Mun encounter to boost us into a higher orbit\u003C/a\u003E. Likewise, if we wanted to get to Moho, we could \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RNxRQnf.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Euse an encounter with Eve\u003C/a\u003E to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NKeBbiL.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elower our orbit\u003C/a\u003E. However, we could not use an encounter with Duna to get to Moho if we were starting from Kerbin; the reason for this is that Duna marks the apoapsis of our Hohmann transfer orbit so we\u0027re already as low as we can reach from that encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second caveat has to do with closing speed. Since we are limited by a change of twice our closing velocity, if our closing speed is too slow the gravity assist won\u0027t help us much. This is why the Mun is typically a bad choice of gravity assist; a minimum energy Hohmann trajectory to the Mun gives you a closing speed of around 250 m/s, meaning a Munar gravity assist can theoretically provide a maximum of 500 m/s delta-v - however, this isn\u0027t enough to actually \u003Cem\u003Eget\u003C/em\u003E anywhere (except Minmus). Post encounter, you\u0027ll wind up in \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0dhf4lR.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edeep space\u003C/a\u003E with no place you can reach except Kerbin, and if you try to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZD9wvs0.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eburn in deep space\u003C/a\u003E you\u0027ll lose more getting anywhere than you gained with the assist (due to the loss of the Oberth effect). A possible way around this is to hit the Mun \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8rtyxVq.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Efaster than a Hohmann trajectory would allow\u003C/a\u003E, but this means that you\u0027re no longer entering the Mun\u0027s SoI from dead in front, so you aren\u0027t getting the full effect of the assist. With careful timing and planning you\u0027ll still save a little, but only a couple of hundred m/s at best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third caveat has to do with the size of the body you are encountering. You are using the gravity of the secondary to deflect your orbit, but you want large closing speeds to maximize your gains. This means that you need a massive secondary; if the secondary is too light it won\u0027t be able to deflect your trajectory enough to accomplish your goal. This is another reason why the Mun makes a bad assist target except in certain situations. It also means that you typically shouldn\u0027t use Gilly, Minmus, Ike, Dres, Pol, Bop, or Eeloo. Moho is not optimal, but there\u0027s nothing else near it so if you are that far down in the Sun\u0027s gravity well you have no other choice. Duna is marginal; I\u0027ve used it with success when getting to Dres, but that\u0027s about it. The optimal targets are (of course) Eve and Jool. Within the Joolian system Tylo, Laythe, and (to a lesser extent) Vall make good candidates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart Three\u003C/strong\u003E How do you set up a gravity assist?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the tricky part; it involves much patience and planning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first thing you have to realize is that there\u0027s no hard and fast rule for how close you should approach the planet or in which direction you should pass. These depend on where you are coming from, how fast you are going, where you are trying to go, and the mass of the planet. The only good way to do this is to plot a maneuver node some distance away from the planet as you approach (typically well before you enter the SoI; the further away the cheaper any course correction will be) and play with it. Watch how your post-encounter trajectory changes depending on how you make your flyby, and try to get as close as possible to your intended post-encounter orbit. With practice you should get an intuitive feel for how to set things up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, when you are trying to get somewhere, you need to do two things: you\u0027ve got to put yourself into a transfer orbit, and you\u0027ve got to \u003Cem\u003Etime\u003C/em\u003E your transfer orbit so that the target you are trying to reach is in the right location when you get there. This is where understanding phase angles and launch windows come into play. If you don\u0027t understand how to transfer to and from different planets, you\u0027ll need to practice that until it\u0027s intuitive and then come back; trying to make sense of gravity assists before then is wasted effort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming that you do have a good grasp on transfers, what you are trying to do with gravity assists is to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JkpTHZa.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Estring multiple transfers together\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/a\u003E. You want to leave planet A on a trajectory which intersects planet B, and then use a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GhJqLok.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Egravity assist\u003C/a\u003E around planet B to put yourself into a trajectory which encounters planet C. This is a lot harder than it sounds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key to managing this is to start at the end and work your way backwards. Suppose you are trying to get to Eeloo by way of Jool. The first thing you do is look for a transfer window between Jool and Eeloo (I recommend heavy use of alexmoon\u0027s Launch Window Planner for this step). You\u0027ll want to find one a bit in the future, since you\u0027ll need time to get to Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027ve found that window, mark down the date of departure. At the same time, make note of the required ejection delta-v (starting from an orbit of a given altitude; say 500 km). That\u0027s the date on which you will need to \u003Cem\u003Earrive\u003C/em\u003E at Jool in order to make the assist. So, your second step is to search for a trajectory which will arrive at Jool on that date. This will typically not be during an optimal launch window, but you want to try to get as close as possible (try to minimize your ejection delta-v for the outbound leg to Jool). If there are no good trajectories, then you\u0027ll have to wait until the next Jool-to-Eeloo window and hope for better luck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA third thing to keep in mind is the listed insertion delta-v when you arrive at Jool (make sure the altitude is the same as the altitude you used when you recorded the ejection delta-v above). While you will not actually be inserting into Joolian orbit, this does give you a measure of how fast you will be going when you arrive. Remember that you cannot change speeds during a gravity assist, so you want to try to get the listed insertion delta-v as close to the ejection delta-v as possible. If they are too far off you\u0027ll have to make an \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BnCQXeI.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eadditional burn\u003C/a\u003E during the encounter in order to put yourself into the right trajectory, and this could potentially wipe out the savings from the gravity assist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fourth thing to keep in mind is whether or not your intermediate target has enough gravity to actually make the required course change using one encounter. For Jool, this typically isn\u0027t a problem, but for \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kQrny97.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eother planets\u003C/a\u003E it \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sZcpu4Y.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecan be\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, although planning makes everything easier, it is possible to some extent to wing it if you are willing to circle the sun a bunch of times - and if you are trying to accomplish something really complicated you\u0027ll probably have no choice. The idea here is to try to put yourself into a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/hCitr#21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecrossing orbit\u003C/a\u003E as cheaply as possible (without regard for the timing), and then wait for a close approach. Use small deep space maneuvers to alter the period of your orbit so that you get an encounter, then use the gravity assist to send you towards your next target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the trip to Eeloo in the examples above, I started off by finding windows from Eeloo to Jool that minimized the insertion delta-v at Eeloo. Unfortunately, most of the early windows were not useful; the required departure date could not be reached cheaply from Kerbin. However, after a bit of searching, I found a window trajectory that left Jool on Year 3, Day 265 and arrived at Eeloo on Year 4, Day 281. Likewise, there was a trajectory from Kerbin \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GhJqLok.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Etimed to arrive\u003C/a\u003E during this window with an ejection delta-v of 2100 m/s - not optimal, but not too inefficient. Unfortunately, I arrived with slightly too much speed, and had to kill \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BnCQXeI.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E213 m/s\u003C/a\u003E while passing Jool. I should also note that it took me more than an hour to set up this burn correctly: in order to do this right, there\u0027s a very narrow keyhole that you have to hit (in this case, only a few hundred km wide), and the only way to get it right is through trial and error. However, patience (and practice) \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BHcF07x.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emakes perfect\u003C/a\u003E, and I arrived at Eeloo needing only a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rxSvwX5.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E352 m/s burn\u003C/a\u003E to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zSTsNXM.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Einsert into orbit\u003C/a\u003E.

However, this is not terribly useful when planning a gravity assist; we won\u0027t have much speed to work with when we arrive at the Mun. Instead, I\u0027ve burned into a slightly aggressive transfer, so I\u0027m still \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Oyd8uVI.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecarrying quite a bit of speed\u003C/a\u003E at the SoI change.

I don\u0027t have the patience for that, so for now we\u0027re stuck.

The trick here is no different than using assists to boost or lower your orbit, except that rather than passing in front or behind the planet you pass over one of the poles. I made a small plane change when I used Eve\u0027s inclination to boost my orbit, and a larger one in the example in part three where I went from Jool to Eeloo. The technique is easy; play around with maneuver nodes and it should come naturally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s it for the tutorial.

Unfortunately, this is where the Mun\u0027s lack of gravity comes into play; if you could bend your orbit fully around the Mun so that you were leaving along the prograde vector, you\u0027d be exitting the Mun\u0027s SoI with a Kerbin-relative speed of around 1,250 m/s - certainly enough to get to somewhere interesting. Sadly, as your picture demonstrates, you can\u0027t bend your trajectory nearly enough, so you wind up on an orbit that only barely exits Kerbin\u0027s SoI; in fact, were Kerbin\u0027s SoI not finite in size, your post encounter orbit would be bound.

Good to know; I\u0027ll need to check that for future missions to Eeloo. I\u0027m a little concerned about efficiency; though. You can\u0027t use a direct gravity assist from Duna to reach Jool if you are starting at Kerbin. A Hohmann trajectory will not have enough speed to get all the way to Jool, and Duna doesn\u0027t have sufficient gravity in any case to alter your trajectory enough. About the only way I can think of to make that transfer is to aerocapture into Duna orbit and then burn for trans-Jool injection, but that\u0027s costly. In the long run it might still be cheaper than a direct transfer from Kerbin to Jool (there are tricks you can use to prevent the need for a complete capture), so it could be useful.

The period of your post flyby orbit is then the difference between the time until periapsis of your flyby and the time until the post flyby node.
