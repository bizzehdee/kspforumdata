However, I thought I\u0027d give it [the workaround] a go as I was starting to explore some of the awesome mods around...and of course, started to experience KSP being brought to it\u0027s knees and crashing regularly, and in some cases not even managing to load! \n\nAt first I found this quite surprising as it isn\u0027t a ma-hoosive amount of mods I\u0027m toying with, and, I\u0027d consider the rig I\u0027ve got to be somewhat of a beast so I was slightly perplexed...but then I did some research...\n\nAnyhow, I\u0027m happy to report that in this particular case the workaround has been a resounding success! KSP (x64) is running like a dream, it hasn\u0027t crashed AT ALL since making the switch, is taken everything I can throw at it thus far, and, I\u0027ll even go as far as to say that it\u0027s given quite the performance boost in general, even over vanilla/modless KSP...It certainly feels like the smoothest KSP experience I\u0027ve had since I started playing.\n\nThere were a few teething issues - Either \u0027Hotrockets\u0027 or the associated \u0027smokescreen FX\u0027 mod kept causing KSP to reset all it\u0027s settings. I did experience the left/right mouse button bug, but only once and it was fixed in a jiffy. And I do encounter the \u0027fully upgraded KSC buildings\u0027 bug every now and then, but it\u0027s purely cosmetic and easily fixed by entering/exiting the VAC building - All of these things I\u0027m more than happy to live with for the benefits gained!\n\nFor those that are curious, here\u0027s the list of mods that I\u0027m using so far and the relevant specs of my rig:\n\n*Astronomers Visual Pack - Interstellar V2*...all of it, high clouds and the 4K options for the other stuff (KSP wouldn\u0027t even boot up for me with this previously)\n\n*Kerbal Engineer Redux*\n\n*Kerbal Alarm Clock*\n\n*Collision FX*\n\n*Chatterer*\n\n*Enhanced Navball*\n\n*NavballUpDefault*\n\n*Navball Docking Alignment Indicator*\n\n*Planetshine*\n\n*Contracts Window \u002B*\n\n*Capcom*\n\n*EVA Enhancements*\n\n*Engine Lighting*\n\n*ScienceAlarm \u0026 NoMoreScienceGrinding* - (this is the only one I feel a bit \u0027cheaty\u0027 about...but at least it\u0027s not ForScience, that would take the biscuit! I may well take them off)\n\nI\u0027ve been keeping an eye on HWiNFO while playing and the VM\u0027s never gone over 10gb (peaked at just over 9gb) and normally floats mid way between 6-7gb\n\nRelevant bits of my Rig: *i7 4790K,Samsung 840pro 256gb SSD, 8gb ram, MSI GTX 980ti, 1440p monitor.*\n\nAnyhow, that\u0027s it really - just thought I\u0027d report in on my findings. Hopefully it\u0027ll inspire others to a least give the workaround a go if they\u0027re running into similar stability issues...it\u0027s super easy thanks to the instructions provided in the initial post and only took 5mins after downloading the relevant Unity version. Completely safe too if you test it on a 2nd copy of KSP. I literally copied it from my Steam directory and used the copy as a guinea pig.\n\nThere\u0027s nothing to lose by trying...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-25T20:28:01Z\u0022 title=\u002210/25/2015 08:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fubarbrickdust**"},{"CreatedByName":"MrMeeb","CreatedById":84238,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-26T09:44:20Z","Content":"Overall, my upgrade has been a success (and a well worthwhile one at that).

Things got particularly problematic when I tried to add Astronomer\u0027s Visual Pack Interstellar V2 along with it\u0027s 48MB texture *detail1.png* (that file seemed to be the straw the broke the camel\u0027s back). I tried a number of workarounds:\n\n- replacing detail1.png with the original 494kb version from EVE (helped)\n\n- a converted dds alternative\n\n- running under DirectX 11 instead of 9 (via \u0022-force-d3d11\u0022)\n\n- using OpenGL (via \u0022-force-opengl\u0022)\n\n- using Active Texture Management with combinations of the previous two\n\nInterestingly, I noticed framerates actually sped up when ATM was in use (although some of textures didn\u0027t look quite as sharp?). OpenGL \u002B ATM seemed to give the best experience in terms of stability, although I sense DirectX 11 may have been marginally faster in some circumstances. But either way, I still had some occasional crashing problems.\n\nSo I found this thread and tried out 64 bit (using KSP 1.0.4). My first impressions were magical! No more game-load crashes, and the whole game got a little bit perkier. Switching between scenes got slightly faster (e.g. jumping from Space Center to Research / Mission Control buildings). Everything to do with high part count ships improved - i.e. less chopiness in the VAB during editing (e.g. faster response when you click a complex subtree, hit CTRL\u002BZ and then move the transparent part around). More responsive camera panning on the launch pad and during launch. Slightly better framerates taking ships through the volumetric cloud layer. I very quickly knew I wanted to get this to work for my regular Kerbal-playing, even if it meant some time and care up front to achieve that.\n\nI tested various scenarios (launches, flying around a spaceplane, high part count space stations, etc). I did notice an occasional issue similar to one which two users reported here:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E My game keeps freezing after sometime, no crash like with the 32 bit version, just either it freezes during a flight and then I have to click a few times and KSP stops responding or when im launching a vessel the game freezes and says it stopped responding.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Just wanted to note I had the same problem. There are a few others earlier in the thread who noted the same. For me it seemed to happen around 6GB RAM use (I have 16GB). Has anyone found any cause or resolution for this issue?\n\nI was able to semi-consistently reproduce the game freeze by exploding complex rockets during takeoff. When the game froze the last line in my KSP.log would look something like this:\n\n**RPMVesselComputer: Awake for vessel (no name)** *blah blah blah*\n\nRemoving all of RasterPropMonitor (JSI directory) seemed to help. In any case I will keep monitoring. I\u0027m curious if anyone else is using 64-bit KSP on Windows successfully with Raster Prop Monitor v0.23.2. Most of the posted mod lists in this thread don\u0027t include that one (although one does, and another includes \u0022Raster Prop Monitor core\u0022). Of course it\u0027s entirely I\u0027m on the wrong track with this. ***EDIT:*** *That log line was a red herring and I\u0027m pretty sure this issue ended up being caused by a combination of two mods, described here:* [*http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24786-1-0-x-Kerbal-Alarm-Clock-v3-4-0-0-%28June-27%29?p=2317397\u0026viewfull=1#post2317397*](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24786-1-0-x-Kerbal-Alarm-Clock-v3-4-0-0-%28June-27%29?p=2317397\u0026viewfull=1#post2317397)\n\nThe mod list I\u0027m currently using is below, and I\u0027m going to keep running with 64-bit and see how things go. While I\u0027m sure running under Linux is a dream, I have no interest in setting up dual-boot just for one game. I like being able to flip back and forth between my hundreds of other primary applications and KSP at will.\n\nI recognize this is unsupported, use-at-my-own-risk ground that I\u0027m trodding on. And yes, before filing any bug reports with mod developers I will try to narrow down to see if they\u0027re reproducible under 32-bit, first. I understand why 64-bit has gotten a \u0022bad rep\u0022 in particular by a couple of the modders, but I really wish there wasn\u0027t so much unilateral backlash against it. It really does seem to be a promising option for people who run lots of mods and need a performance and (hopefully) stability pick-me-up.\n\nI\u0027m running Windows 7, and have a powerful computer (specs below, from my xtremesystems signature). I\u0027ve even managed to get a debug version of Unity / KSP going where I can interactively debug and step through mod code using Visual Studio while the game is running (I was working on some personal adjustments in the Advanced Fly By Wire mod to make better use of my Saitek X52 joystick). So, basically, I\u0027m competent and I\u0027d like to be the one who makes the choices on what I run. It\u0027s fine if modders and Squad don\u0027t want to support me, and I appreciate the rainbow kitten reminders - but in the end, please **leave the choice to me, the user**, rather than making it difficult for me to recklessly explore these bitness frontiers in true Kerbal-like fashion!\n\n-Fwiffo\n\n* * *\n\nMy mods:\n\n    000_ToolbarBoulderCoChattererChuteSafetyIndicatorContractsWindowCrowd Sourced ScienceDistantObjectEnhancedNavBallEnvironmentalVisualEnhancementsJSIKASKerbalEngineerKerbalScienceFoundationKISKSPTweaksLightsOutMechJeb2MyFlagNavyFishPlanetShinePortraitStatsPreciseNodeProceduralFairingsQuickGoToQuickStartRCSBuildAidRcsSoundsSCANsatShipEffectsShipManifestSquadStageRecoveryStockBugFixModulesTextureReplacerTriggerTechUbioWeldingLtdVesselViewWaterSoundsWheelSounds\n\nMy specs:\n\nPrimary workstation (circa 2010 \u002B upgrades):\n\n- Hex-core Xeon [E5645](https://goo.gl/lJfMG), 2.4GHz stock, @3.6GHz / 1.336V\n- Noctua [NH-D14](https://goo.gl/bn1cF)\n- Asus [P6T6](https://goo.gl/g1XRj) WS Revolution\n- 48GB ECC RAM @1443MHz / CAS8 (3x Kingston [KVR13E9/8I](http://www.kingston.com/dataSheets/KVR13E9_8I.pdf), 3x Kingston/Hynix [KVR13E9/8HM](http://www.kingston.com/dataSheets/KVR13E9_8HM.pdf))\n- Areca [ARC-1882ix-24](https://goo.gl/UVf2x) w/ 4GB BBU cache\n- 4x 256GB Samsung [840 Pro](https://goo.gl/YFmrM), 25% spare, RAID0 boot\n- 8x 4TB Hitachi [Deskstar 7K4000](https://goo.gl/Sg9Ih)\n- EVGA [GTX 690](http://www.evga.com/articles/00679/#GTX690) 4GB GDDR5\n- Mellanox [MHGH28-XTC](http://search.ebay.com/MHGH28-XTC) 4X DDR Infiniband\n- Adaptec AVA-2903B (for Epson Perfection 1200S) via [PEX 8111](http://www.beaglesoft.com/pcie2pci.htm) PCIe x1 to PCI adapter\n- Syba [SD-PEX50023](http://www.sybausa.com/productInfo.php?iid=713) PCIe x1 to parallel / serial (for legacy h/w programmer)\n- Matrix Orbital [BLK202A-GW](https://goo.gl/9xLCE) LCD w/ 3x [DS18S20](http://www.maximintegrated.com/datasheet/index.mvp/ver/F/id/2815/t/qv?ver=F\u0026utm_expid=50713806-2\u0026utm_referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.maximintegrated.com%2Fdatasheet%2Findex.mvp%2Fid%2F2815%3Fver%3DF) temp probes (linked to [OHM](http://openhardwaremonitor.org/))\n- Rosewill [RCR-FD400](http://www.rosewill.com/products/1374/productDetail.htm) media reader, stock 3.5\u0022 floppy replaced w/ slim [USB](http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=YD-8U10-2\u0026cat=RDM) model\n- Silverstone [ST1500](http://www.jonnyguru.com/modules.php?name=NDReviews\u0026op=Story\u0026reid=175) PSU\n- Coolermaster [ATCS 840](https://goo.gl/pKg1X) case (top fans flipped upside down, beneath custom dust filter)\n- Assorted [NF-P12](https://goo.gl/coVML) and [NF-S12B](https://goo.gl/KmFW8) chassis fans\n- 3x LOGISYS [ML12WT](http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16812551004) LED sticks on [5V-to-12V](http://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/CC6-0512SF-E/445-2482-ND/920442) up-converter [tapped](http://octopart.com/k-218-molex-4053189) into 5V ATX stanby power, triggered by [magnetic reed switch](http://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/MITI-3V1%206-12.5/HE516-ND/656539)  \n(internal case lighting comes on when you open the case, even when powered off!)\n- 2x SuperMicro [M14T](http://www.supermicro.com/products/accessories/mobilerack/cse-m14.cfm) drive cage (fan removed)\n- 2x TrippLite [S510-18N](http://www.tripplite.com/en/products/model.cfm?txtModelID=3861) SFF-8087 to 4-in-1 SFF-8484\n- Dell UltraSharp [U3011](http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us\u0026cs=04\u0026l=en\u0026sku=224-9949)\n- 2x Samsung SyncMaster [213T](http://www.anandtech.com/print/1246)\n- Acer [H5360](http://www.projectorcentral.com/Acer-H5360.htm) 3D Projector\n- Kinesis [Contoured](http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/contoured.htm) Keyboard\n- Saitek [X52 Pro](http://www.saitek.com/uk/prod/x52.html) Flight Controls\n- 24x7 Prime95 stable, several Memtest86 passes\n\n\u002B Dell M6600 laptop / 2x PM830 RAID0 / 32GB RAM\n\n\u002B 24-Bay whitebox SAN / Norco RPC-4224 / Asus P6T6 / Intel i7-920 / 24GB ECC RAM (for eventual Xeon)\n\n\u002B Toshiba M7 Tablet PC / 120GB Intel 320 G3 SSD\n\n\u002B various iPhone \u0026 Android gizmos\n\n\u002B [TRS-80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80_Color_Computer#Color_Computer_2_.281983.E2.80.931986.29)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-27T08:04:14Z\u0022 title=\u002211/27/2015 08:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fwiffo**"},{"CreatedByName":"antilochus","CreatedById":144588,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-30T23:23:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Removing all of RasterPropMonitor (JSI directory) seemed to help.\n\nInteresting.

I had to download this [64 bit TrackIRUnity.DLL](https://github.com/medsouz/Unity-TrackIR-Plugin-DLL/releases/tag/untagged-a9953f3e403e1e0ff1db) and replace the corresponding file in \u0022[KSP Folder]\\KSP\\_Data\\Managed\\\u0022. All hail GitHub!\n\n- Advanced Fly-By-Wire mod do not work. Special case of .DLL located in the main directory of KSP. I managed to make it work by downloading alternate 64 bit .DLL files: ([Simple DirectMedia Layer 2](https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL2-2.0.3-win32-x64.zip) and [XInputDotNet](https://github.com/speps/XInputDotNet/releases/download/v2015.03-1/XInputDotNet-x64-v2015.03-1.zip)).\n\n- Lower right kerbal portrait is in \u0022skip motion\u0022.\n\n- Frame rate is way faster. This could be related to using Direct X instead of OpenGL.\n\n- Hiccups and stuttering are still present. Including sound \u0022distortion\u0022 when this happens.\n\n- Right-clicking on a part while controlling a vessel seems to get increasingly unresponsive the more time you spend in game: You have to click several times until the part window appear. Not a big issue if you use \u0022Part Commander\u0022 mod.\n\n- The game suddenly closed without warning right to the desktop. This happened twice so far in several hours of gameplay.\n\n- Menu and Space Center \u0022clickable area\u0022 became unusable right after accepting a contract. I could not click anywhere except on the exit button which showed a blank window. This happened only once too.\n\nSo far, my conclusion is that, while being highly playable and far more \u0022endurant\u0022 than the 32 bit version, it is far from perfect.\n\nI used to play KSP with over 93 mods (!) in 32-bit. Most are \u0022functional\u0022 mods but I have a few \u0022heavier ones\u0022 with parts and some textures upgrades as well. In 32 bit mode, the game would not even reach the main menu unless forcing it to run with the \u0022-force-opengl\u0022 and, of course, using the Active Texture Compression mod by rbray89. Memory usage was around 2.2 GB after reaching the main menu. Once loaded and in control of a vessel, it was around 2.8 GB. And it would crash at around 3.3 GB! Not much room left. Needless to say, I had to play for maybe one or two sortie then it was time to restart...\n\nBut now, 64 bit here I come! I followed the original post to the letter and I also used [KSP x64 Total Unfixer utility](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113069-WIN-1-0-X-KSP-x64-Total-Unfixer-v2-2-04-08-2015/page14) to force mod to behave in a 64 bit environment. To my amazement, the game started without any problem! I decided to remove the Active Texture Management mod (since I have plenty of VRAM available) and disabled texture compression and textures unloading from Texture Replacer. I also decided to launch the game in its default render mode, DirectX 9. All 92 mods are detected and load correctly. I have not tested every single parts and situation in details but I ran a quick game to verify FAR \u002B DRE \u002B Real Chute behaviors as those are the few mods I do not want to play without. No problem found so far. Memory usage while controlling a vessel in game was around 5.5 GB.\n\nFor those interested, here is the list of mod I use. This is on Windows 10 :\n\n[![xvsp821ub5gz3w27g.jpg](https://www./convkey/27a3/xvsp821ub5gz3w27g.jpg)](https://www./view/?xvsp821ub5gz3w2)\n\nSo yes, latest MechJeb, FAR, DRE, Realchute, etc. all load and work as expected. Some version used are from the latest developer build.\n\nSpeaking of 64 bit support for KSP: I know some modders do not take it kindly to forcing 64 operation... Since this is, after all, \u0022The Internet\u0022, allow me to had my opinion on this matter. By the way, no one forces you to read it so... ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)\n\nWho we are: Kerbal Space Program addicts/junkies, either \u0022Player\u0022, \u0022Developer\u0022 or \u0022Modder\u0022 or a mix of those.\n\nWhat game we have: KSP 1.04 officially only in 32 bit. An \u0022OK Programmed\u0022 game by the perspective of a common gamer. Has issues but still playable for the most part unless moded to the extreme. The game is available on steam for 39.99 USD but we could get it in discount for around half that price either about a year ago or during sales.\n\nWhat computers we have: As gamer, you need a fairly decent machine so I would say most of us use a PC that is less than 3 years old. Price: around 1000$ for a standard gaming rig but this could go much higher for a custom made machine.\n\nWhat we want as game: Perfection! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) Haha. This mean a rock stable, unrestricted memory access (i.e, 64 bit) fully optimized KSP build that use multiple cores for rendering/computing and/or GPU based physics/computation. We live in an era where a person can get and use, at home, a computer that can do more than 13 TFlops! If, and only if, we have proper software.\n\nThe Reality: Like a well known cyborg cop from the late 80\u0027s would say \u0022We are only human\u0022. For the good parts and for the bad parts. I can say without uncertainties that we are ready to pay a lot more for \u0022hardware\u0022 as we are for \u0022software\u0022. Which might explain the current state of computer programming: powerful computing machines that are underutilized in pretty much every applications and aspect.\n\nWe should all agree that going 64 bit is the way to go. Unless you are perfectly satisfied with playing a non-moded KSP... But if you are reading this, chances are you like to mod it... a lot! Oh, by the way, we need modders! Yes, we need them. All of them! They are truly genius people. I say thank you to every single one of them for expanding the KSP universe. Now, there is some animosity concerning this topic. While I understand perfectly that you have the right to be respected as a modder, this is a totally open and customizable game. If someone wants to change a mod and have access to the source, it can be done as long as this stay a personal endeavor. Some common sense is required here. I suppose it is okay to get angry after someone who do not respect your work... for we are only human.\n\nSo, looking forward, I expect to see Squad officially re-supporting a 64 bit built. I also expect to see modders do their thing: create awesome expansion and modification for this game! But i do not expect to play a perfect game: Unity 5 might help with certain caveats of Unity 4 but it certainly won\u0027t bring ultimate performance and a bug free experience!\n\nFinal words: We should at least agree on one thing: A supported 64 bit build is going to be beneficial for everyone.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-09T03:36:23Z\u0022 title=\u002211/09/2015 03:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Galenmacil**"},{"CreatedByName":"MadEwok","CreatedById":153295,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-09T15:02:55Z","Content":"Hey guys, I\u0027ve just tried installing the GEMFX pack but it crashed before the game was finished loading, so i tried to use this 64 bit workaround.

Also, the error you\u0027re getting looks like your exe file is called \u0022KSP.exe.exe\u0022. Make sure you can see file endings, there is a windows option to turn that on. Google it if you need help finding it. (Alternatively just call the file \u0022KSP\u0022 without the .exe, and it should apply the .exe ending the file already has, if you have the file endings hidden.)
