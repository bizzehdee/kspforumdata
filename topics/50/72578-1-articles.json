A lot of videos out there (including tutorials) tend to be too long to suit me, and some of the creators seem more interested in gaining and entertaining a following rather than producing concise tutorials limited to 5 (or sometimes 10) minutes, depending on a topic\u0027s complexity. It is a challenge to produce short videos, and it requires more editing, which many \u0022You Tubers\u0022 can\u0027t (or don\u0027t want to) do, usually due to time constraints.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are some You Tubers that I used to watch, but I stopped due to the ever expanding bloat of 20 and 30 minute episodes out there. I think a good niche would be to target the 5 to 10 minute range tutorial (even if it means a short series sometimes), without pumping for likes or obtusely building a following. Those who are into that sort of thing will find no shortage of videos out there, and many are entertaining. Don\u0027t get me wrong; there\u0027s no reason why a short, well done tutorial can\u0027t be entertaining as well.
