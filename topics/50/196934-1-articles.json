you\u0027re going to stay at least for a while, and you have to worry about life support. \u00A0If you then make the mission larger, you can start building a self-sufficient colony that can produce its own rockets. \u00A0Other mods that can be of significant help whilst playing with MKS are Kerbal Inventory System, Kerbal Attachment System, MechJeb and Kerbal Alarm Clock (some of the Near-Future stuff can also help, mainly providing variety in terms of engines and suchlike).\u003Cbr\u003E\nMKS adds a significant level of challenge and complexity to KSP, and isn\u0027t recommended for the starting player - if you\u0027re comfortable being able to send 40 ton payloads to other planets though, this may be ideal for you, as this opens up a whole new game. \u00A0In this tutorial I will not cover which precise parts to use -

crews can starve for a week, and cope with cramped conditions for a week. \u00A0This also applies to transferring of crews - so if a Kerbal has spent the journey in a nice roomy spacecraft, they can climb into a cramped capsule for a week or so before going on strike.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImproving the length of time that a Kerbal can spend in a craft is relatively straightforward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nIncrease the number of crew cabins\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAdd special habitat parts -

but these can be transported uninflated (i.e. not heavy) and inflated using Material Kits when they reach their destination (when they become significantly heavier). \u00A0Some of the habitat parts add additional days to the habitability of the craft, others add a multiplier, so a combination of these two is best.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWithin the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E (or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E), clicking on the green toolbar icon will tell you how long the crew can survive in a particular vessel based on the parts that you\u0027ve added and the crew that you\u0027ve assigned. \u00A0Be slightly cautious of the numbers it gives you if you are planning on having different numbers of crew aboard -

if you have recycling capabilities and calculations based on four crew members, and then add a fifth one for some reason, the reality may be markedly different.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe easiest way to extend the duration of your supplies is to add Life Support systems. \u00A0These either come as parts themselves, or are built into the crewed parts (e.g. Science Lab, Salamander Pod). \u00A0These recycle a percentage of your used supplies, meaning that supplies last longer. \u00A0All life support parts can support only a limited number of crew - adding a life support system for a single Kerbal, and then cramming a crew of seven in is going to mean your life support will basically be redundant. \u00A0Water purification also counts as life support. \u00A0All life support uses electricity.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe next way to extend the duration of your supplies is to use Agroponics (farming). \u00A0This means taking Mulch and Fertiliser to create more supplies. \u00A0Mulch is produced by your Kerbals when they consume supplies in a 1:1 ratio, and Agroponics will take Mulch and Fertiliser in a 10:1 ratio and convert it back into Supplies. \u00A0This chain can use a small amount of machinery depending on the parts used - more on machinery later. \u00A0 If you\u0027re sending crew to another planet, it\u0027s very worthwhile to use the Agroponics route for both the transit vessel and the final base, as the weight of fertiliser that you take is equivalent to 10 times the amount of supplies. \u00A0For multi-year long trips, add an empty mulch container and pack some spare machinery if using a greenhouse that requires it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe final way is to generate supplies directly, normally in combination with the methods above, as raw supplies generation is very slow. \u00A0Essentially, Substrate or Dirt, plus Water will give you supplies, when using an Agriculture module and the Cultivate method on it. \u00A0This chain also involves using a small amount of machinery.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt is possible to produce more fertiliser - this normally takes place when landed using an Agricultural Support Module or material processing unit, converting either Gypsum or Minerals into Fertiliser. \u00A0Again, this requires a small amount of machinery.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022AboNnvO.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002281.40\u0022 height=\u0022652\u0022 width=\u0022801\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/AboNnvO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003EFirst steps with MKS\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInitially, play the early game as you would normally, except that trips to Minmus will need more crew cabins and a small amount of supplies - around 200 supplies per Kerbal to leave a good margin for errors.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBeyond this, the first major goal should be to establish a colony on either the Mun or Minmus and play with the setup there. \u00A0If you\u0027re playing in Career mode, I would recommended that you set rewards from contracts to be higher than normal - as testing and establishing colonies is generally expensive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake plenty of supplies (2000\u002B) for your first colony. \u00A0You need to learn the following:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nBase building. \u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u00A0Often this is being able to land vessels on wheels next to each other, and then move them together on the surface (items from the Konstruction tab can be useful, particularly the weldable docking ports). \u00A0Accurate landings are essential -

so if you have four cores in your CPU, and four landed vessels, your computer will be far less stressed than if you joined them all together into a single craft where it would run on a single core.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAgroponics -

a very slow slide down the hill. \u00A0The flatter the terrain, the better. \u00A0Also to be noted is trying to park it on a slope that is even. \u00A0That is, don\u0027t park it across a bit of slope that\u0027s at 5 degrees and another bit that\u0027s at 8 degrees - this is an invitation for the Kraken to attack because certain bits of the ship may load below ground.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAll resources. \u00A0Whilst it\u0027s unusual to find a biome that has everything that you need, it\u0027s often possible to find two areas (e.g. Highlands and Midlands) that are next to each other and between them have all the required resources. \u00A0An initial exploratory rover to pinpoint a landing site here is almost required, and it helps hugely if base vehicles are on wheels for fine tuning. \u00A0A \u0022remote miner\u0022 is extremely helpful in this instance as well - which features kontainers, a drill, electricity generation and not much else to sit in that foreign biome less than 150 metres away whilst the main base pulls resources to itself. \u00A0Very generally, the most important resources are Substrate, Minerals, MetallicOre and Water. \u00A0If your base is advanced enough to have machinery generation, then you\u0027ll effectively want all raw materials available. \u00A0If you have a vessel that can mine remotely and then fly back - that\u0027s fine, but these should be for the less common or less used resources (exotic minerals, rare metals, uraninite). \u00A0If you do not have all resources anywhere, in a pinch you can mine dirt and use a sifter to produce all other materials, though the output is very slow.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEquatorial. \u00A0Assuming that you have return ships waiting in orbit to be refuelled or simply to be rendezvoused with, having your base near the equator can simplify this hugely as take offs can be done at any time.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA nice view. \u00A0As examples -- my Ike base is at the south pole with Duna on the horizon ; My Vall base is equatorial with Jool on the horizon ; My Dres base is right by the big canyon;\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first step in finding a base site is to perform an orbital survey using the M700 scanner. \u00A0This allows you to find likely landing spots for your exploration rovers and show where resources might be found. \u00A0The most important resources are substrate, minerals, metallic ore and water, with water being the rarest (and hydrates will substitute for water if you can refine hydrates to water).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00224bu2Gat.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022110.14\u0022 height=\u0022847\u0022 width=\u0022769\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/4bu2Gat.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next step is to use an exploration rover to choose a base site using the criteria above - use the surface scanning science experiment to discover the composition of the surface to get precise amounts of each type of resource at that location. \u00A0There are of course many designs for exploration rovers, and I include three types of various sizes here as examples - and as it\u0027s a very light experiment, you can use these rovers for other purposes as well such as science gathering. \u00A0Landing a rover near the boundary between two or even three biomes allows you to collect data for those biomes with a single rover.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ERmhJNQ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002286.41\u0022 height=\u0022731\u0022 width=\u0022846\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ERmhJNQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022MNZEIxr.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002281.32\u0022 height=\u0022949\u0022 width=\u00221167\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/MNZEIxr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022MtcYw8W.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002293.12\u0022 height=\u00221070\u0022 width=\u00221149\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/MtcYw8W.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003ESo what parts do I need for a base?\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt depends on how long you want to stay and how self-sufficient you want the base to be. \u00A0Note that it is perfectly possible to have separate parts as separate vessels landed within 150 metres of each other -
