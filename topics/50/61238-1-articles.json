Well, do something about it! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike most others, I wasn\u0027t exactly sure how KSP was deciding that percentage and what to do about it. Now, anyone who has played around with DMagic Orbital Science (fantastic mod) knows that those instruments transmit at 100% science value. But how? What parameter controls this? That\u0027s what I\u0027m here to answer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, let\u0027s look at a stock Gravmax Negative Gravioli Detector. When you look into the config, the MODULE section appears as this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003EMODULE\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\tname = ModuleScienceExperiment\t\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\texperimentID = gravityScan\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\texperimentActionName = Log Gravity Data\u003Cbr\u003E\tresetActionName = Delete Data\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\tuseStaging = False\u003Cbr\u003E\tuseActionGroups = True\u003Cbr\u003E\thideUIwhenUnavailable = False\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\txmitDataScalar = 0.4\u003Cbr\u003E\tdataIsCollectable = True\u003Cbr\u003E\tcollectActionName = Take Data\u003Cbr\u003E\tinteractionRange = 1.2\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\trerunnable = True\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay . . . So let\u0027s break this down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst line opens the module. The second line states that the module is a science experiment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the third line says \u003Cem\u003EexperimentID = gravityScan\u003C/em\u003E. That is what links the experiment to it\u0027s appropriate segment in your scienceDefs.cfg, the file with contains all the possible results of experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next two lines are your execute and delete buttons that you see on your right-click context menu. This is simply setting the display text for that action.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe section below that is the display options. It is saying this part should not appear in staging, should be action group bindable, and should always display a UI, even when unusable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow we get into the good part\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003ExmitDataScalar = 0.4\u003Cbr\u003E\tdataIsCollectable = True\u003Cbr\u003E\tcollectActionName = Take Data\u003Cbr\u003E\tinteractionRange = 1.2\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst up is the data scale factor. THIS is the magic number which dictates what percent of the earned science is transmittable. Next is the ability to collect the data and below that is the UI text binding for it. The last parameter determines how close you have to be to get the \u0022take data\u0022 button while on EVA. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking back to the top, the last line says \u003Cem\u003Ererunnable = True\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis simply means the experiment is repeatable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow let\u0027s compare this to the Radio Plasma Wave Scan Antenna from DMagic Orbital Science:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003EMODULE\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\tname = RPWSModule\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E    animationName = rpwsAnimation\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\texperimentID = rpwsScan\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\texperimentActionName = Log Radio Plasma Wave Data\u003Cbr\u003E\tresetActionName = Discard Data\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\tuseStaging = False\t\u003Cbr\u003E\tuseActionGroups = True\u003Cbr\u003E\thideUIwhenUnavailable = False\u003Cbr\u003E\trerunnable = True\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\txmitDataScalar = 1.0\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis looks a bit different since this mod runs on it\u0027s own plugin, but you notice some of the terms are the same. You notice that this data does not have collection parameters, as the DMagic.dll does not contain support for that. This sensor data cannot be collected (as it should realistically should be).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow notice that \u003Cem\u003ExmitDataScalar\u003C/em\u003E is set to a value of 1. The data transmits for full value. By changing this value between 0 and 1, you can change the percent of science earned by transmitting the data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo how do you make your sensors realistic and your probes practical? Let\u0027s open up the gravioli detector again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003EMODULE\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\tname = ModuleScienceExperiment\t\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\texperimentID = gravityScan\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\texperimentActionName = Log Gravity Data\u003Cbr\u003E\tresetActionName = Delete Data\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\tuseStaging = False\u003Cbr\u003E\tuseActionGroups = True\u003Cbr\u003E\thideUIwhenUnavailable = False\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\txmitDataScalar = 1.0\u003Cbr\u003E\tdataIsCollectable = False\u003Cbr\u003E\tcollectActionName = Take Data\u003Cbr\u003E\tinteractionRange = 1.2\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\trerunnable = True\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, notice carefully as I changes \u003Cem\u003ExmitDataScalar\u003C/em\u003E to \u003Cem\u003E1.0\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003EdataIsCollectable\u003C/em\u003E to \u003Cem\u003EFalse\u003C/em\u003E. These two changes make the sensor data noncollectable and transmit for 100% science, forcing you to transmit the sensor data, since there is no longer any punishment for not doing so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope at least one person can learn something from this and that my time writing this is not a complete waste.

Sensors should only have data that\u0027s transmitted and not brought home, full stop. That is usually how real space probes behave, they don\u0027t return. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever I\u0027m not quite ready to alter my config files yet, since the game balance is probably very heavily dependent on those scalars being less than one. I like to imagine scenarios that explain why Squad set things up the way they did:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It is possible to imagine a pen and paper plot having more and better data that somehow can\u0027t be transmitted. Maybe that\u0027s what\u0027s up with these sensor scalars; they\u0027re trying to tell you that while your science tree isn\u0027t filled up, your technology level is years behind where it could be and hence transmitting a small subset of the data is all you\u0027re able to do. That if you actually managed to run a probe or manned mission where you could return the instrumentation, you\u0027d get more science value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Meanwhile, it totally makes sense for materials studies and surface samples to be something you return home. I\u0027m not sure what \u0022transmit\u0022 represents in the case of these physical samples... regardless, whatever you transmit should pale in comparison with having access to the real samples.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-27T06:53:07Z\u0022 title=\u002201/27/2014 06:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MajorThomas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seawolf","CreatedById":89655,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-26T10:17:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs there a similar way to change the value of surface samples or eva reports? since they aren\u0027t done using a part but with a kerbal instead, i can\u0027t find a xmitDataScalar to modify.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedCowboy","CreatedById":92106,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-28T03:27:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sorry but, isn\u0027t that cheating?
