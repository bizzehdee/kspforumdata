It\u0027s a little bit harder to get to, and you will need some basic manoeuvre node skills (so you don\u0027t encounter\u00A0Minmus and then get sent flying off on an orbit of the Sun!). Once again, set a trajectory to go around it,\u00A0burn your engines to circularise, and then return (if you want to). Minmus can often be seen in the early morning, as a green-blue dot in the sky.

Since it is so close to the\u00A0Sun, it can\u00A0take a little while for the sunlight to catch up with your spacecraft, so\u00A0try to avoid arriving\u00A0in darkness. It is very hilly, and\u00A0has lots of craters. A strategy that I use to reach\u00A0Moho is to first go to\u00A0Minmus, refuel from my fuel\u00A0station, and then dock extra tanks along, and then go to Moho. At the north pole of Moho is a bug/easter egg, the Mohole. It is small, but very, very deep. Many people\u00A0have tried establishing bases inside the Mohole, so try it if\u00A0you \u003Cs\u003Edare to spend your entire Friday night hunched over the computer screen, going insane every time you fail\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0want to have a nice, totally easy, relaxing challenge.

It\u0027s a little bit far out, isn\u0027t really close to anything, and is basically a larger version of the Mun. An easter egg of Dres was that Carl Sagan\u0027s face would appear on the surface, but this has now (sadly) been removed. Asteroids, or \u0027Dresderoids\u0027 as they are nicknamed, spawn in rings around the planet, which can make Dres a handy refuelling area for ships heading to other planets.

It offers the second-highest amount of science, it\u0027s gravity is higher than Kerbin\u0027s, and it looks cool because it\u0027s purple. Getting an Eve encounter is a little bit difficult, requiring lots of fuel, knowledge of manoeuvre nodes, and bypassing other planets. Landing there is tough, as the high gravity can easily rip off parts of your craft. The good thing is that airbrakes are very effective at Eve, so you should probably design more of a plane than a rocket, as the high gravity will pull you down anyway (meaning that firing rockets at the ground to slow down won\u0027t be very effective). If you want to get back out of Eve, then I will say this: bring some SRBs. A couple of SRBs, or a massive quad of powerful engines. Otherwise, the gravity means that you are probably stuck forever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGilly (Skill:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:rep:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/rep.png\u0022 title=\u0022:rep:\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E)\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGilly is the only moon (or asteroid, as a matter of fact), of Eve, and is very easy to encounter and land on. Unlike Eve, which has extremely high gravity, Gilly has extremely low gravity. .Landing there is extremely easy, and once you get out of your spacecraft, walking around sends you 200\u002B meters into the air! You may want to have a heavy weight on your spacecraft down the bottom so it can\u0027t float away once you\u0027ve landed, because things can start rotating and flying around with tiny movements. They can be so small that the game lets you timewarp, so you should always firmly plant yourself on the ground before doing so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EThe Jool System (Skill: \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:rep:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/rep.png\u0022 title=\u0022:rep:\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:rep:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/rep.png\u0022 title=\u0022:rep:\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:rep:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/rep.png\u0022 title=\u0022:rep:\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:rep:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/rep.png\u0022 title=\u0022:rep:\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:rep:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/rep.png\u0022 title=\u0022:rep:\u0022\u003E)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince Jool is home to five different planets and moons, this will cover the whole system. Jool is big, green, and fun. It is very far from the Sun, can take days (or even months) to get there, has a thick atmosphere, and no surface. Flying through the atmosphere is fun, but\u00A0be warned, as\u00A0once you get below a certain height, your craft will be completely destroyed (even if you have unbreakable joints and no crash damage cheats on). There isn\u0027t really much to use Jool for, but the space around it provides good science. It is home to the Jool system, which consists of Laythe, Vall, Bop, Tylo, and Pol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaythe isn\u0027t really that different from Kerbin. Both have water (at least from a basic perspective), both have land, and both have atmospheres and oxygen (meaning that jet engines work). Laythe is made up of islands and peninsulas, meaning that you can make little tourist areas and send Kerbals there, but it is also home to massive oceans. If you are experienced enough, you can send science boats into the ocean, to explore and gather data. You could even make submarines to descend below the surface! At night, you are greeted to a beautiful sunset with all the other planets and moons of Jool, and can reflect that you are here, and that Kerbin is so far away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVall is icy and blue, but a really rich source of science. It seems to have weird ramp-mountains on it, and is home to the Vallhenge, which is an easter egg of the Stonehenge. It is sometimes used as a rover testing area, due to the hills and uneven terrain, which is good for all-purpose ground vehicles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBop is a very hilly place, and is home to the Kraken. Bop\u0027s gravity is not too strong, and not too weak, but Bop is also a bit glitchy. A common glitch is where a spacecraft is orbiting it, and the player switches to the map view. Once going back, they find that their spacecraft has disappeared, apparently colliding with Bop. On the north pole, a small green speck can be seen in a crater. This is where the Kraken resides, after being destroyed by the Sword Of 0.17, where a bugfix update removed the Kraken glitch from happening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTylo is the largest moon in the game, and is even larger than Kerbin. Its gravity is high, which makes it hard to get away from, meaning that you should bring some really powerful engines, or SRBs, if you want to escape from the moon. Tylo is sometimes used as a communications array to provide connections to craft far out of Kerbin\u0027s communication range. I like to use Tylo as a test area for Eve craft. If it can\u0027t get off Tylo, then I know that it can\u0027t get off of Eve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPol is a tiny, outlying moon of Vall, featuring some hilly but also flat terrain. It is a good source of science, but that\u0027s about all it is worth going to. A glitch that can happen is when you are landing on Pol, and there is an invisible wall. If your craft touches it, then it is destroyed. Due to this, a good safeguard is to extend a ladder while landing (because ladders aren\u0027t physical). If it \u0027sinks\u0027 into the surface, then you are going to hit the invisible wall, and should abort the landing and land somewhere else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDuna (Skill: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:rep:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/rep.png\u0022 title=\u0022:rep:\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:rep:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/rep.png\u0022 title=\u0022:rep:\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:rep:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/rep.png\u0022 title=\u0022:rep:\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:rep:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/rep.png\u0022 title=\u0022:rep:\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E)\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuna is an orange, Kerbin-sized, planet, and is the game\u0027s version of Mars. Duna consists of hilly and flat areas, canyons, and cliffs. A good thing to do to land on Duna is to aerobrake, which involves going into the atmosphere for a short amount of time, letting the friction slow your craft down, before you then start landing. Duna\u0027s atmosphere is a little bit weaker than Kerbins, and so parachutes are not as effective on Duna, so you should also bring some airbrakes along.

It\u0027s slow orbital speed means that you may spend hours timewarping to get a launch window from Kerbin. It is the only planet to not have a circular orbit, as it has an orbit that intersects Jool\u0027s, and is only close to the Sun for roughly a quarter of it\u0027s orbit time. To get to Eeloo, you should try to get a launch window where Kerbin and Eeloo are closest to eachother (to save fuel). You will have to do large burns (and maybe some gravity assists) to get an encounter, and it WILL take a long time to get there, so either timewarp, or go do something else for a few hours/days. Once there, the planet is pretty much a flat, white-brown area, and not many easter eggs exist (yet). One good thing about Eeloo is that it currently offers the most science, which can be worth the trip if you want to advance your space program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd with that, hope this long summary of planets and moons helps new players!
