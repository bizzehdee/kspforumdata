The Juno and Wheezley altitudes are\u00A0at their\u00A0maximum loads but while the \u0022flameout\u0022 sound effect did not play, the fact that these engines did not use all the jet fuel means that they became sufficiently oxygen starved. \u00A0Unused fuel became part of the payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor engines not exceeding an altitude of 150 meters (launch altitude in this case), the total mass is the approximate minimum mass of parts and propellant required for a particular engine to operate in space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou will notice that some engines are listed more than once, tested in various ways or modes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope to use this methodology when testing the stock engines in KSP version 1.1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease comment suggestions or concerns or questions below. \u00A0This is a work in progress and the intent of the graph was to compare the diverse set of KSP stock engines for practical applications, on a single graph.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002225032245753_aaeff345e4_o.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1499/25032245753_aaeff345e4_o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow is the same graph without the Mammoth engine results, which gives us a somewhat zoomed in view. \u00A0The averages for all are retained.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002225032251143_869d719b8b_o.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1628/25032251143_869d719b8b_o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-12T15:13:47Z\u0022 title=\u002203/12/2016 03:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 12, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Dispatcher\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
