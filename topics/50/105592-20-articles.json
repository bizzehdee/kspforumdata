Very promising for  what\u0027s coming up with KSP on unity 5 for windows.\n\nAnyways I do have a question, I have noticed my solar panels and radiators suddenly missing their textures sometimes. They do reappear if I toggle them. I am very unsure if it is due to the 64b client, since I did change a few mods since I played on the 32 bit official client.... But it wasn\u0027t happening then.

And yes, it is wonderful, could charge loads of mods and graphic enhancements, that\u0027s great. But instead of CTDs, I\u0027ve got freezes (the game just don\u0027t respond anymore, I don\u0027t have any repot created in the game folder).\n\nAt first, it was in career mode. Game freezes when KAC slowing time warp. Then the game freezes when my vessel touch the ground, 8 times on 10. I thought for a time it was Contract Configurator, who is incompatible with this workaround, so I remove it. But the game kept freezing. So I tried a new, fresh install and remove most of my mods, only keeping graphical and utility ones. I went to sandbox for testing, so didn\u0027t install any career mod. It works fine for almost a week, and today, freezes again.\n\nI really don\u0027t understand what could possibly go wrong. I know this workaround isn\u0027t perfect and some mods don\u0027t like at all, and I don\u0027t blame mods, but I haven\u0027t found any information on that type of freezing. Does anybody have experienced the same ? For the time warp freezing I presume I could uninstall KAC (don\u0027t use it so much now, I prefer the MechJeb Warp Helper module), but for the freezing when touching ground, I have absolutly no idea what mod could do that."},{"CreatedByName":"MrMeeb","CreatedById":84238,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-09T19:25:18Z","Content":"I\u0027m having an odd 64bit problem.
