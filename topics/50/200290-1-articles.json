I feel like there is room for a whole series of tutorials on this topic. For example, I find the transition to and from horizontal to vertical flight to cause all sorts of stability issues with my helicopter designs. For me, they either fly well going forward, or fly well going up and down, but never both.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like your matter-of-fact presentation style, and look forward to browsing your channel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Echo__3","CreatedById":204997,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-13T16:21:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223924915\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022200290\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221613103533\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022146104\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HvP\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 2/11/2021 at 11:18 PM, HvP said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel like there is room for a whole series of tutorials on this topic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have been working on making a variety of Breaking Ground propeller and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E tutorials.
