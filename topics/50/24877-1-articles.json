So I thought I\u0027d write a tutorial in case anyone else out there was having the same problem. That problem being - how do I set up an intercept with a planet (or moon) so that I end up in a consistent prograde or retrograde orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mun isn\u0027t a problem. It\u0027s big enough to have a significant effect on your spacecraft\u0027s trajectory and I could set up a recognisably similar trajectory for everything I sent to the Mun by eyeballing it. For Minmus though it wasn\u0027t so easy. It\u0027s a smaller target, it\u0027s a lot further away and setting up a consistent trajectory was proving difficult. As a result, my early Minmus missions ended up in prograde or retrograde orbits more or less at random. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is fine for \u0027footprint and flag\u0027 missions but not so helpful for building space stations or for docking larger craft in orbit. And if Minmus wasn\u0027t working, then what chance Duna, or anywhere further afield? It was time to figure this out properly, so without further ado.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EA guide to consistent orbiting\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. To figure out your eventual orbit, you need to know your velocity relative to the planet as you approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tUaV94R.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022tUaV94R.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a rough diagram to illustrate the point. In each case we burn retrograde at periapsis (Pe) to drop into orbit around Minmus. If our velocity relative to Minmus is pointing in one direction, we get a clockwise (retrograde) orbit. If it points in the other we get a counterclockwise (prograde) orbit. The trick is working out the relative velocity ahead of time, so lets look at that next.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. We can do this the complicated way...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lPo6MI5.png?2\u0022 alt=\u0022lPo6MI5.png?2\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a simple example. To a reasonable approximation we\u0027re on course to cut straight across Minmus\u0027s orbit. We can therefore estimate our relative velocity by considering motion along Minmus\u0027s orbit and normal to it. Our velocity along Minmus\u0027s orbit is essentially zero, so our relative velocity becomes 0-x where x is whatever Minmus\u0027s orbital speed is. The exact numbers don\u0027t matter, the point is that relative to Minmus we are travelling back along its orbital path. In contrast, we have a small velocity normal to Minmus\u0027s orbital direction and at any given time Minmus has zero velocity in that direction. So our relative velocity becomes y-0 or in other words nothing changes. Add the two up and we get our relative velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a whole lot easier to see on the diagram. Red lines are our relative velocities along Minmus\u0027s orbit and normal to it. Green line is the resultant velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Or we can do this the easy way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lq0H1ON.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022lq0H1ON.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA much easier way of doing this is simply to mouse over the \u0027Minmus encounter\u0027 point on the Map to display the Minmus\u0027 location at that encounter point. We can then estimate our direction of travel relative to Minmus by drawing an imaginary line between the encounter point and Minmus. As you\u0027ll see, that works out to be fairly similar to the direction we estimated in Step 2 by fiddling around with adding vectors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. But does that work in practice?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lq0H1ON.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022lq0H1ON.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets try. Minmus is way over there at the encounter point, so draw that imaginary line. Looks like our relative velocity is angled back along Minmus\u0027s orbit at about 20 degrees to its direction of travel. Remembering back to that first diagram, we can predict that our eventual orbit will be clockwise (or retrograde) around Minmus. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce we cross into Minmus\u0027s sphere of influence, the Map will show the correct relative velocity and we can see if that prediction is correct.

That\u0027s a nice check. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Q6s20pi.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022Q6s20pi.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd there we have it. I\u0027ve added a maneuver node to highlight our orbital direction. As predicted - a nice retrograde orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this all made some sense.
