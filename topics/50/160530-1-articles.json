At the moment I can\u0027t get it to orbit (in career mode), so I tried using a parachute and at around 5000m trying the Kerbnet. I got the info screens and I had a link to the centre, but how do you record the data? Also once the probe had landed, I received no science. I was hoping to try and use it to view some of the other close areas - such as poles etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeith\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-12T14:46:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2017 02:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Silverwood\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
