What that means is that your back wheels are very spread apart. This means that the plane will be much less prone to tipping over when you land.\n\n[![awjAUTb.png](http://i.imgur.com/awjAUTb.png)](http://imgur.com/awjAUTb)\n\nSecondly, you need to have your plane be able to fly at 110 m/s or lower, it does not necessarily have to fly well, just be able to reasonably hold itself up in the air, the best way to do this is to have large wings relative to your fuselage. If your plane takes off at 130-140m/s it should be fine. \n\n[![jvvVVXR.png](http://i.imgur.com/jvvVVXR.png)](http://imgur.com/jvvVVXR)\n\nThe last design element that you\u0027ll need is airbrakes. It really helps slow you down faster once you\u0027re on the ground, and is also useful for your approach.\n\nI recommend placing 4 airbrakes, 2 in front of the COM and 2 behind it. Doing this mostly cancels out any pitch effects from slowing down.\n\n[![5v0oSyG.png](http://i.imgur.com/5v0oSyG.png)](http://imgur.com/5v0oSyG)\n\n**Part 2: Landing**\n\nStep 1: setting up\n\nThe best place to practice is probably the hills west of KSC. To speed things up don\u0027t bother with turning around mid air, instead just taxi off the runway until you\u0027re pointing west, and take off from there. Once you get up in the air, be sure to quicksave so you can quickly come back if you crash. make sure you have steering enabled on the front wheel, and reverse it if necessary.\n\n[![8bdxTP2.png](http://i.imgur.com/8bdxTP2.png)](http://imgur.com/8bdxTP2)\n\nStep 2. Picking a landing site.\n\nFor your landing site you want to find an area that is not that steep. However more important that slope is consistency, a very bumpy site that is flat overall is going to be harder to land on than something with a slope, but is consistent. Also never touch down going directly up a hill, the ground sloping up has the same effect as increasing your sink rate, making touchdowns invariably harder.\n\n![tluP1Xb.png](http://i.imgur.com/tluP1Xb.png)\n\nI picked the area just to the left of the group of hills that was directly in front of me. I did not choose a very good time to land, ideally you want the sun lower in the sky so that the terrain forms shadows with which you can judge the size of hills more easily.\n\nStep 3. Approach\n\nOnce you get aligned with your landing zone, you should start your descent. Be sure to carefully watch your speed when as you come down. when you are 500 m above the surface you should be going at around 170 m/s, by the time you get down to 100m you should be going at 140 m/s. When you get to 100m turn on the airbrakes permanently (click the brake light) quicksave at 400m up in case you mess up the landing\n\nStep 4. Pre touchdown.\n\nThis is the most critical step. As you get closer and closer to the ground, make sure you are steadily decreasing your speed. When you are 60m up start watching your vertical speed in kerbal engineer, it needs to be lower than 10m/s when you touch down. Watch the slope of the ground, if it is too steep, don\u0027t be afraid to light up your engines and keep going until you get to a flatter area. Right before your wheels hit the ground, if necessary, roll so that you match the sideways slope. When you are 10m above the ground you should be going around 100 m/s (preferably lower). maintain your vertical speed until your wheels hit the ground. If you have drouge chutes, now is the time to deploy them\n\n[![NqXKuj1.png](http://i.imgur.com/NqXKuj1.png)](http://imgur.com/NqXKuj1)\n\nStep 5. Slowing down\n\nThe brakes should already be on from the previous step. As you are rolling over the ground, the most important thing to watch is your side slip, or how far to the side you are from prograde. If this increases too much you will flip over. Remember when I told you to enable steering? this is where that will come in. The wheels in Adjustable landing gear adjust their steering coefficients with speed, so the faster you are going the less they will steer. This means it is safe to have steering on during landing. As you slow down keep pointing towards prograde. If you come over the crest of a hill, try to land on your back wheels, especially at higher speeds, at lower speeds it does not really matter if you land on your front wheel as long as you point prograde.\n\n[![YC5izdc.png](http://i.imgur.com/YC5izdc.png)](http://imgur.com/YC5izdc)\n\nStep 6: Profit!\n\n[![RkpAqeQ.png](http://i.imgur.com/RkpAqeQ.png)](http://imgur.com/RkpAqeQ)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/zHGZFiK6XsM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nPlease post feedback below, this is my first tutorial so tell me how I did.![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-22T08:45:11Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2015 08:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by peachoftree**\n  \nAdded RealChute"},{"CreatedByName":"damerell","CreatedById":123074,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T22:35:49Z","Content":"This was not very surprising, but an interesting read."},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T21:04:15Z","Content":"Sticky!

I suspect any sideslip on landing is because they are acting as a pivot. In fact, having the gear far forwards may even act as a stabilising force on account of their distance from the CM for the same reason that tailplanes are more effective the farther back you put them. I could be wrong though."},{"CreatedByName":"Spark Plug","CreatedById":111693,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-05T17:02:04Z","Content":"Do you have any tips for the descent?

Well, I never was very good at sticking my landings back then either, runway or not.\n\nyour problem sounds like a lack of control. your center of lift and center of mass need to be very close in order for you to have the control authority to land. The thing to remember that as long as you are below around 170 m/s, your horizontal velocity does not matter, only your vertical. when you are just about to touch down flare the nose up as much as you can. This kills your vertical and horizontal velocity so you can land. I recommend having a quicksave on your descent to landing so that you can try a bunch of different profiles and see what works. Also airbrakes are the greatest, they negate the need to do s-turns on you descent allowing you to be lined up from a very long distance."},{"CreatedByName":"arise257","CreatedById":104506,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T19:36:29Z","Content":"Pro tip: If you don\u0027t have airbrakes unlocked yet, you can still get your air-brake on. \n\n**In SPH:**\n\nOn the tops and bottoms of your main wing, on the leading edge, place control surfaces. You have to offset them so that half their height is exposed on the top and bottom of the wing. Also, point them rearward, like they would face were they on the back edge of the wing. \n\nDisable all control authority (yaw, pitch,roll) and map them to toggle on the brake button in the action controls. \n\nBe sure to check that they deploy upward on the top side and downward on the bottom.\n\n**In flight:**\n\nHit the brake button and be amazed as your control surfaces open up, increase drag, and slow your plane down.
