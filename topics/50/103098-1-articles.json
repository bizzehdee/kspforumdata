I just recently formalized the technique by producing some useful charts and equations. I figured I might as well share it with the rest of the KSP community. Perhaps somebody else here might find it useful.\n\nWhen a spacecraft is returning from deep space (i.e. interplanetary space) and on course for a direct entry into the Kerbin atmosphere, we have only limited control over where the spacecraft will land. It is nice to have some idea of where we\u0027re going to land while still a considerable distance from Kerbin. Being able to predict the landing site lets us know in advance whether we\u0027ll be descending into a safe area or a hazardous area. If we know the spacecraft will be descending onto the ocean or a flat plain, then we can relax and not have much to worry about. However, if the prediction shows that we\u0027re likely to descend onto the steep slopes of a mountain, then we likely need to alter our trajectory the best we can to avoid potential disaster.\n\nThe method presented here allows us to deduce and, to some degree, control the location of the landing site while near the edge of Kerbin space and still days or hours away from entry. The method also works for predicting the landing site for returns from Mun and Minmus.\n\nThe numbers that follow were generated by performing computer simulations outside of the game environment. In the instances where I\u0027ve been able to put the technique to use in actual game conditions, the results have matched the theory pretty closely. The simulations are based on stock aerodynamics. Although the basic concept and procedural steps should be valid with any aerodynamic model, the specific numbers presented are valid only with stock aero.\n\n**Step 1 - Compute hyperbolic excess velocity.**\n\nTo determine the landing site we must know at what speed we\u0027re approaching Kerbin. We do this by computing the hyperbolic excess velocity, *v*\u003Csub\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00BE\u003C/sub\u003E, of our trajectory within Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence. Shortly after entering Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s sphere of influence, briefly phase the game and note the spacecraft\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s altitude, *h*, and velocity, *v*. This can be done at any point along the trajectory, and any pair of *h-v* values will do, as long as they are taken at the same time. The hyperbolic excess velocity is computed using the following equation:\n\nv\u003Csub\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00BE\u003C/sub\u003E = [ v^2^ \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 (2\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00BC/r) ]^1/2^\n\nwhere \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00BC is Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s gravitational parameter, equal to 3.5316\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D10^12^ m^3^/s^2^, and *r* is the radius distance, equal to *h* \u002B 600,000 meters.\n\nSkip this step for returns from Mun and Minmus (or any elliptical orbit within Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s SOI).\n\n**Step 2 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Determine target periapsis and alter trajectory.**\n\nThe next step is to establish a trajectory that allows us to predict the flight path of the spacecraft through Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s atmosphere. The trajectory we choose is that in which the spacecraft\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s landing site is directly beneath the periapsis of the orbit. This condition can be achieved by carefully selecting and controlling the periapsis altitude of the trajectory. Periapsis altitude, *Pe*, as a function of *v*\u003Csub\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00BE\u003C/sub\u003E is obtained using the following graph:\n\n![chart01.gif](http://www.braeunig.us/pics/KSP/chart01.gif)\n\nThe periapsis altitude can also be calculated using one of the following equations:\n\nFor v\u003Csub\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00BE\u003C/sub\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2\u00A4 2000 m/s,\n\nPe = 0.0000001416 v\u003Csub\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00BE\u003C/sub\u003E^3^ \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 0.0007332 v\u003Csub\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00BE\u003C/sub\u003E^2^ \u002B 0.02001 v\u003Csub\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00BE\u003C/sub\u003E \u002B 21970\n\nFor v\u003Csub\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00BE\u003C/sub\u003E \u003E 2000 m/s,\n\nPe = 0.00011174 v\u003Csub\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00BE\u003C/sub\u003E^2^ \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 1.7053 v\u003Csub\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00BE\u003C/sub\u003E \u002B 23174\n\nFor a return from Mun, use Pe = 22,380 m, and for a return from Minmus, use Pe = 22,090 m.\n\nNow perform a burn to set the periapsis of the trajectory to the altitude determined above (as closely as can be reasonably done). In general, to raise the periapsis burn radially outward, and to lower the periapsis burn radially inward. You can also use this opportunity to adjust the inclination if necessary. I typically like to make sure my trajectory\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s swing around Kerbin is as close to the equatorial plane as possible.\n\nCompleting this step means that the spacecraft is now on a trajectory to land on the surface of Kerbin at a point that is directly beneath the periapsis. You may note that the periapsis moves once the spacecraft enters the atmosphere and starts to experience drag forces. Ignore this; the landing site will be beneath the original periapsis before it was altered by reentry.\n\n**Step 3 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Determine landing site location.**\n\nGo to the map view and note the Kerbin terrain that is located directly beneath the periapsis. Since Kerbin rotates, this is not the terrain that will be beneath the periapsis at the time the spacecraft arrives. To determine this we must also note the time to periapsis.\n\nIn the time to periapsis we can ignore the days, because for every integer day that passes, Kerbin will return to the exact same position. Simply note the hours and minutes. Since Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s rotational period is six hours, the planet\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s surface rotates eastward 60^o^ every hour and 1^o^ every minute. This means that the landing site will be west of the periapsis by the amount that Kerbin will rotate in the time between the present and the arrival of the spacecraft.\n\nTo visually identify the landing site, use the following map. Each white vertical line on the scale is separated by a distance of 15^o^, or 15 minutes of time. The distance between the slightly longer lines is 60^o^, or 1 hour.\n\n![kerbinmap1.gif](http://www.braeunig.us/pics/KSP/kerbinmap1.gif)\n\nIdentify on the map the current location of the periapsis. From that position, count off to the west (left) the distance represented by the hours and minutes to periapsis. If you reach the left edge of the map, move all the way to the right and count off the remaining distance starting from the right hand edge. The new position found after counting off the appropriate distance will be where the spacecraft will land.\n\n**Step 4 (optional) \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Hazard avoidance and trajectory alteration.**\n\nIf Step 3 reveals the spacecraft is likely to land in a hazardous location, there is only so much that can be done. The landing location can be altered to some degree by raising or lowering the periapsis altitude. Raising the periapsis (decreasing the entry angle) will cause the spacecraft to land long (farther east, assuming a prograde entry). Lowering the periapsis (increasing the entry angle) will cause the spacecraft to land short (farther west). There are limitations, however. If the periapsis is raised too much, the spacecraft will pass through the atmosphere and back into space. If lowered too much, the craft will experience suicidal g-forces (if that even matters to a Kerbal).\n\nBy simulation I have determined how much the periapsis altitude must be adjusted to land \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u015315^o^, \u002B15^o^ and \u002B30^o^ from the landing position found in Step 3. The following table gives the vertical distances that the periapsis should be lowered to land 15^o^ short, and raised to land 15^o^ or 30^o^ long. These distances are a function of *v*\u003Csub\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00BE\u003C/sub\u003E.

Furthermore, unpredictability due to variations in the drag coefficient is magnified when the spacecraft follows a longer path through the atmosphere. We should, therefore, expect greater error in the predicted landing position when attempting to land long. Also note that for the -15^o^ scenario, *Pe* becomes negative for *v*\u003Csub\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00BE\u003C/sub\u003E greater than about 1,135 m/s. In this case the periapsis is below ground level and will not be visible in the map view.\n\nGiven the above, we have what amounts to a 45^o^ long landing footprint (about 500 km). It should be possible to find a suitable landing site within the available footprint.\n\nFor returns from Mun and Minmus we have much greater control over the landing site. This is because we can always delay our departure until Kerbin has rotated into a suitable position, thereby allowing us to place our periapsis over whatever terrain we desire. In this way it is possible to obtain landings very close to Kerbal Space Center.\n\n**Acceleration Loads**\n\nIn the stock game, g-forces are not a concern because there are no detrimental effects from high acceleration loads (or heating). Nonetheless, below I provide the peak acceleration loads that will occur in each scenario. Note that for very high values of *v*\u003Csub\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00BE\u003C/sub\u003E the g-forces are extreme. If you are playing a modded form of the game in which acceleration loads matter, then please take notice and use the necessary caution. \n\nIn the \u002B30^o^scenario we have a simple form of a \u0022skip\u0022 reentry. That is, the spacecraft descends into the atmosphere and then, for a brief period, begins to rise in altitude before making its final descent. This results in two peaks in the acceleration curve (the larger is given).\n\n[TABLE=class: outer\\_border, width: 500]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD=align: center]**v**\u003Csub\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00BE\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/sub\u003E\n\n**(m/s)**[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]**Short**\n\n**-15**^**o**^\n\n**(g)**[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]**Norm**\n\n**0**^**o**^\n\n**(g)**[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]**Long**\n\n**\u002B15**^**o**^\n\n**(g)**[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]**Long**\n\n **\u002B30**^**o**^\n\n**(g)**[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD=align: center]0[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]8.1[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]4.2[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]2.2[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]2.4[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD=align: center]500[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]8.4[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]4.4[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]2.2[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]2.4[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD=align: center]1,000[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]9.3[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]4.8[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]2.4[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]2.4[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD=align: center]1,500[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]10.9[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]5.5[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]2.8[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]2.4[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD=align: center]2,000[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]13.0[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]6.6[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]3.5[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]2.8[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD=align: center]2,500[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]15.8[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]7.9[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]4.3[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]3.5[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD=align: center]3,000[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]19.1[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]9.6[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]5.4[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]4.5[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD=align: center]3,500[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]23.1[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]11.6[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]6.7[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]5.7[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD=align: center]4,000[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]27.7[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]13.9[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]8.3[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]7.2[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD=align: center]4,500[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]33.0[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]16.5[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]10.1[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]8.8[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD=align: center]5,000[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]38.7[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]19.5[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]12.2[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]10.8[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]\n\n***EXAMPLE***\n\nLet\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s say we are on a return from Duna.

I already have the computer simulations to figure it out, it\u0027s just a matter of putting in the time. Personally, I\u0027ve never done a direct entry from deep space on any planet other than Kerbin. Every time I\u0027ve landed elsewhere, I\u0027ve always entered orbit first. For precise landings from orbit, [somebody else has already figured that out](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37327-Atmospheric-Landing-Charts-Pinpoint-landings!-NEW-UPDATE-No-Protractor-Required!).
