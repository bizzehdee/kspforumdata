For one thing \u0027cheap\u0027 begs the question of whether that\u0027s after recovery - a cheap rocket might be disposable but a more expensive rocket to build might be more cost-effective once it\u0027s landed and recovered. Until now my own designs (and the tools above) have concentrated on payload-ratio and part-count. Tech-level is new to me, as cost is to everyone, so I\u0027m still getting to grips with those. Ultimately spaceplanes are the way to go for cost but I am concentrating on recoverable SSTO rockets as being easier and quicker to build and fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally; it took a month to decide how I wanted to structure this campaign and another month to design the ships for it. Actually writing and publishing it took another two months, even knowing what I wanted to say ^^.

First, obviously, you can do whatever you want to without worrying about what someone else says you \u0022should\u0022 be doing. Secondly, if you want to develop in a structured manner you can order projects and missions in a much more logical way - as I hope this campaign does - than starting with big, heavy, manned ships as you must with the tech-tree in science or career mode. Thirdly, I think having to deal with tech-requirements, contract demands and money is more complicated than it needs to be when you just want to find out how to put a rocket together and get it into space. The Mk1 rocket here is 3 parts to orbit - what\u0027s the tech-0 equivalent in science/career?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s if you know what you want to do, of course. If you have no idea then \u0022winning\u0022 KSP by completing the tech-tree in science mode will at least give you a direction, a \u0027score\u0027 and a sense of achievement. The chances are though that you\u0027ll rush-through using more or less the same design(s) and adding moar boosters when needed, rather than trying different things and thinking about what works better and why. The \u0027tech tree\u0027 also becomes the whole point of KSP for some people as well - we have had lots of forum posts asking \u0022what tech should I get next?\u0022 instead of \u0022what\u0027s most fun/interesting?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027re comfortable with the way that KSP and spaceflight works it\u0027s a matter for you to decide whether you want the complexity of money and contracts.

I think I should try to scrape up some time to finish your tutorial campaign, there is a whole lot of things to learn. But one thing your tutorial taught me (and it taught me a lot of things) which I consider the most important is the understanding of the TWR and \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0V and with this, building cost-efficient and rockets with a failure rate of 100% less than before. The only failure is my steering... Even if I made it to Minmus and Mun.. but only the SOI. Wasn\u0027t supposed to land, I was just wondering how far my rocket would get.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got a question. What are these \u0022transfer windows\u0022 to planets that are not in the Kerbin system? Does it mean that when you want to fly to planets in the Kerbol system which are not orbiting around Kerbin you have to wait some time until that \u0022transfer window\u0022 opens and you\u0027ve only got a bit of distance to the other planet?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVolcanix\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-08T19:49:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Volcanix\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Volcanix\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...Does it mean that when you want to fly to planets in the Kerbol system which are not orbiting around Kerbin you have to wait some time until that \u0022transfer window\u0022 opens and you\u0027ve only got a bit of distance to the other planet?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssentially, yes, but it\u0027s not so much the distance you have to cover as that you need to arrive at the target\u0027s orbital altitude AND when the planet\u0027s there!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom Kerbin you can go to Mun/Minmus any time you like just by making your burn at the appropriate point around your orbit. Similarly, starting from a solar (Kerbol) orbit, you can go to any planet just by burning at the right place. Getting into a circular solar orbit in the first place takes a lot of deltaV though, if you make it low enough that your ship\u0027s \u0027year\u0027 is practical. Then you might have to wait a local year to get to the right part of the orbit, then you need to burn a lot more deltaV to get back \u0027up\u0027 to the target planet\u0027s orbit. So, all in all, not usually a great plan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts on the steps to interplanetary ... (you might find it useful to sketch these out or make dummy manoeuvre nodes to see how the orbits look)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHohmann transfer from 75km LKO to 100km LKO - nice and easy you burn prograde (go faster) any time you want to. Going faster raises the opposite point on your orbit and you burn until it forms a new apoapsis at 100km then cut engines. Drift around to this new apoapsis then circularise by burning prograde again, raising what was your 75km periapsis, until it too is roughly 100km. Similar retrograde burns to lower periapsis/apoapsis.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHohmann transfer from 100km LKO to Mun\u0027s altitude. Burn prograde whenever you feel like it until your apoapsis is 12Mm (according to the wiki, I thought it was 11.4 for some reason). Drift around to apoapsis and circularise. You\u0027re at \u0022Mun orbital altitude\u0022, sharing the same orbit, but unless you did your burn in the appropriate, small, segment of your LKO the Mun won\u0027t be in the same place as you once you circularise. For the moment I\u0027m assuming we stopped at this altitude to enjoy the view or something but didn\u0027t get an encounter with Mun.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHohmann transfer from Mun altitude to Minmus altitude (ignoring the plane-change but the point\u0027s the same). Burn prograde as before until your apoapsis reaches 47Mm, drift around then circularise. What are the chances that Minmus will just happen to be in the same part of its orbit as you are, so you get an encounter? Pretty slim ^^. Let\u0027s try this again ...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHohmann transfer from Mun altitude to Minmus encounter (still ignoring the plane-change - you know you need it but let\u0027s pretend we don\u0027t for now). Set up a manoeuvre node to increase your apoapsis as above. Now drag it around your orbit (shared with Mun) until it gives you a Minmus encounter. You may have to wait a number of orbits before you can GET an encounter - You\u0027re on a lower orbit around Kerbin than Minmus so going faster but if you start \u0027ahead\u0027 of Minmus you\u0027ll have to wait until you\u0027ve both orbitted several times and you\u0027ve caught-up with it again. The time it\u0027ll take to drift across to Minmus altitude is (more or less) a constant because you\u0027re just transferring from 12Mm to 47Mm but it won\u0027t do you any good if you go at the wrong time. \u003Cstrong\u003EThis is exactly the same as performing an orbital rendezvous\u003C/strong\u003E for docking, using a phasing orbit; it\u0027s just on a bigger, slower, scale.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHohmann transfer from Mun \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eorbit\u003C/span\u003E to Minmus encounter - when you\u0027re orbitting Mun you are also still orbiting Kerbin at 12Mm, on average. In fact, from the wider perspective you could say you\u0027re \u003Cem\u003Ejust\u003C/em\u003E orbiting Kerbin at 12Mm with some odd fluctations -the relatively tiny diameter of you Mun orbit - caused by the dirty great big rock you\u0027re next to. To get to Minmus altitude you still need to do a burn prograde to your \u003Cem\u003EKerbin\u003C/em\u003E orbit, as in 3 and 4 above. There\u0027ll only be one segment of your Mun orbit where you\u0027re heading in that direction so you know the manoeuvre node will go there. You also still need to wait until you - and Mun - are in the right part of your Kerbin orbit relative to Minmus, as in 4. That could be LOTS of orbits around Mun! The situation is pretty much the same as 4, it\u0027s just that you can\u0027t move the manoeuvre node around your Kerbin orbit the way you could before, you can only move it around your Mun orbit. It\u0027s a pain, to say the least. That\u0027s why you need to calculate the \u003Cstrong\u003Etransfer window\u003C/strong\u003E (being the beginning and end of the \u0027right\u0027 segment your Kerbin orbit) or look it up. In 3 we didn\u0027t care about an encounter and in 4 we could just play directly with the Kerbin orbit so it wasn\u0027t so hard to find the window.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EInterplanetary transfers are similar except that instead of going between Mun and Minmus, orbiting Kerbin, you\u0027re going between (say) Kerbin and Duna, orbiting Kerbol. In Kerbin orbit you\u0027re orbiting Kerbol at roughly 13.5Gm, with some insignificant little fluctuations (the diameter of your orbit around Kerbin). You need to burn prograde to your \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EKerbol\u003C/span\u003E orbit to raise your apoapsis to 20.7Gm and there\u0027ll only be one point on your Kerbin orbit when you\u0027re heading that way. Nevertheless you have to make that burn when Kerbin and Duna are in the right relative positions so that in the time it takes for you to drift up to Duna\u0027s altitude (more than half a year!) Duna itself will also arrive in the same part of its orbit, so you get an encounter. Get it wrong and you could get to the right altitude but Duna could be half a year around its orbit - as in 3 above.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the transfer window is about getting to the same \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Epart\u003C/span\u003E of the target\u0027s orbit as it \u003Cem\u003Ewill be\u003C/em\u003E in, rather than making it a short distance to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis tutorial may help more \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/27236-Tutorial-Step-by-step-Interplanetary-Hohmann-transfer-guide-and-tips\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/27236-Tutorial-Step-by-step-Interplanetary-Hohmann-transfer-guide-and-tips\u003C/a\u003E but essentially it\u0027s all about much bigger phasing orbits for rendezvous.

Added to all that, you\u0027re having to work in a foreign language AND get through my typographical errors - how could I refuse to respond to the best of my abilities. Google gives me this: \u0022Ich war vier Jahre lang Deutsch im Gymnasium unterrichtet.

I might try a challenge every now and again but otherwise sandbox is \u0022messing around\u0022. In as much as there\u0027s any direction there it\u0027s different types of spaceplane that don\u0027t meet my (career) SSTO rocket intentions. Understanding the tech-tree (and trying not to laugh or spit at it) is what I\u0027m doing in KSP at the moment. Plus, almost all the time, I\u0027m juggling mods to see what I like and what my aged computer can cope with. EVE keeps coming and going - clouds are nice but hardly important (city lights just don\u0027t work for me when there\u0027s no \u0027city\u0027 there!). New to me are KerbinSide (launch from other places - decided I wanted the memory more while I\u0027m designing but very nice for playing around), Distant Object Enhancement (DOE - recently patched for 0.24.2, looks like a keeper), NavUtils (HSI and ILS - more instruments, what\u0027s not to like?), Probe Control Room (\u0022IVA\u0022 for unmanned vehicles - works brilliantly with RPM, SCANSat, MJ, et all. Part of the core mods from now on, I think) and GlowStips (haven\u0027t actually tried them yet, testing as an alternative to illuminators and/or Aviation Lights).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh - and I\u0027m still playing with Bargain Rockets because it\u0027s funny.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease do write some stories, mission reports and/or tutorials of your own - too many people make and watch bad videos, I think (there are some very good ones as well, of course), but \u003Cem\u003Ewriting\u003C/em\u003E then \u003Cem\u003Ereading\u003C/em\u003E take a lot more time and effort. For some people that means a lot more is passed on, but it depends on learning style of course. Sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words but sometimes (the lesson of) a thousand words will be remembered longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the pictures of your station. What\u0027s that huge monopropellant tank for? We all tend to think that since we\u0027ll be docking a lot we\u0027ll need lots of RCS fuel but once you practice a bit you find it\u0027s ROCKET fuel you need. The good thing is you can easily add that, of course, because you have all those open docking ports at the moment. My space-station design should be familiar - pretty much everything in Chapters 7 and 8 is what I\u0027m using to go anywhere/everywhere. There are some differences in my current \u0027standard\u0027 station - it has even more docking ports; 2 landers, 2 lander drones, 2 scooters, 2 \u0027visitor\u0027 (usually Crew Shuttles) and 4 fuel/others - but the basics are the same. The purpose is still to be a centre of operations for a planet or moon, providing refuelling capability, \u0027home\u0027 for station, tractor and lander crew, transit accommodation for other mission crews. Given that I\u0027m working in careeer mode now the lab and scientific equipment also has (or will have) a purpose, so they tend to be 2 more (lab) people around than I had before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECareer mode hasn\u0027t got as far as stations yet - no docking ports so not much point - so it only exists in sandbox and I don\u0027t have any pictures at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and thanks for the recommendation in your signature :-) Whimsically, I keep thinking of doing \u0027Basic Rocket Design - Explained simply with pictures\u0027 to match it. That might be next, to be honest, before the career stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-09T17:56:06Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2014 05:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Pecan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
