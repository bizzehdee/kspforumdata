If you\u0027ve never played with either of those mods, then hopefully this tutorial will demystify the whole communications network thing. \u00A0It\u0027s really not that complicated. \u00A0If you\u0027re used to playing with AR, then you\u0027ll find stock pretty much the same except for the new antennae and the different performances of the old ones. \u00A0If you\u0027re used to playing with RT, then you\u0027ll probably welcome the vast reduction (to nearly zero) of the micromanagement, but might have to learn new habits depending on how you did RT.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGENERAL STOCK NETWORK FACTOIDS:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nStuff to understand before you get

uninterrupted coverage to every square inch of every planetary surface. \u00A0So don\u0027t lose any sleep over that. \u00A0No matter what you do, something will always get in the way periodically. \u00A0The best you can do is make something that works everywhere most of the time, and then time your activities to happen when you\u0027ve got a link, waiting the minutes to hours when you sometimes don\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E2. \u00A0You Don\u0027t Need Perfection\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou really only need the network in 2 situations: \u00A01) when you\u0027re trying to control a ship/probe without a Kerbal pilot aboard (assuming you selected that option); and 2) when you\u0027re transmitting science. \u00A0The rest of the time, the network doesn\u0027t matter. \u00A0Thus, you only need to design the network to handle these situations. \u00A0This means\u00A0you need a network\u00A0to allow landing on the far side of Mun/Minmus, to cover the mid-course tweaks of interplanetary trips, and to land on other planets. \u00A0Once you\u0027re on the ground, you can wait a bit if necessary to transmit your science and take off again. \u00A0That\u0027s all you really need, so don\u0027t sweat trying to do more unless you just want to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\nAlso keep in mind the duration of the mission. \u00A0Are you ever going back to this planet again, or is your main focus elsewhere and you\u0027re just here for some quick science? \u00A0There\u0027s no point in getting too elaborate for a 1-and-done mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E3. \u00A0Getting Acceptable Coverage\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo do this, you have to minimize the impact of the 2 things that break links: \u00A01) celestial bodies in the way; and 2) distance in excess of antenna range. \u00A0You can pretty much eliminate the 1st problem with the network design described below. \u00A0The distance thing is another matter. \u00A0Right now, the biggest stock relay antennae barely work between Kerbin and Jool when they\u0027re on the same side of the sun, and only hit Eeloo when it\u0027s at or inside Jool\u0027s orbit. \u00A0You can reduce this problem somewhat by using intermediate relays at Eve, Duna and/or Dres, although certain planetary alignments over time will still be problematic. \u00A0And that\u0027s just with the stock solar system. \u00A0If you use something like the Outer Planets Mod, where the\u00A0closest new planet is twice as far from the sun as Jool (as in, you get just as bad a link from Jool to Sarnus as from Kerbin to Jool\u00A0and the distances between the rest\u00A0get worse from there on out,, the stock communications system just flat won\u0027t work much if at all\u00A0 (EDIT without jacking up the DSN range a LOT). \u00A0So for that you\u0027ll need a mod. \u00A0Surely somebody will make a bigger mod relay antenna to work with OPM, or you can use a ModuleManager patch to change the stats of the stock antennae for longer range. \u00A0Thus, this tutorial will just worry about the stock solar system, where distance isn\u0027t THAT much of a problem (except for Eeloo) most of the time. \u00A0Then it\u0027s just a matter of avoiding blocking by celestial bodies, which is relatively easy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E4. \u00A0Forget Geostationary Networks\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nKerbin now has a number of communications centers scattered all around its surface and your network can link back to any one of them, not just \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. \u00A0IOW, as in AR, your distant ships essentially talk to Kerbin as a whole, not just 1 spot on its surface. \u00A0This also means that Kerbin by itself covers the near sides of both Mun and Minmus, plus anything within Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E not blocked by Mun or Minmus. \u00A0The only reason anybody ever built a geostationary network before was because in RT, you could only talk to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E itself, so you needed the geostationary constellation to handle the 50% of the time when \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E was facing away from your ship, which happened even in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E. \u00A0Because in the stock system you can talk to Kerbin regardless of which way\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E is facing, you don\u0027t need a geostationary network. \u00A0You can build one if you want, but it\u0027s really just a waste of time and money. \u00A0And FWIW, you can\u0027t build a geostationary network at most other planets and moons anyway because the required altitude is beyond their SOIs. \u00A0So just ignore geostationary networks as the archaic \u0022back in the day\u0022 things they are and move on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E5. \u00A0Redundancy is Good\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s a good idea to provide multiple possible link paths between any 2 points. \u00A0That way, if one path is blocked, hopefully another will be open. \u00A0It\u0027s easy to go overboard with this, but it can be done with a fairly minimalist approach. \u00A0This tutorial will show how to do that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAVOIDING BLOCKING BY CELESTIAL BODIES:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere are 3 types of blocking by celestial bodies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E1. \u00A0Blocking by the Planet/Moon You\u0027re At\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis happens\u00A0whether you\u0027re in orbit or landed. \u00A0This is the most troublesome type of blocking because it will happen the most often (like 30-50% of the time), and you can\u0027t do much about it without going to a lot of trouble and expense. \u00A0Often, this is more trouble than it\u0027s worth because, as mentioned above, it\u0027s actually pretty easy to make a simple network that provides coverage when you actually need it. \u00A0Normally, there will be some time (minutes to hours, perhaps a few days even at very tiny moonlets) when you have to wait for a satellite to pass over before you have a link, but the wait shouldn\u0027t ever be long \u00A0so long as to cause a real problem. \u00A0Just warp through it. \u00A0Going beyond a\u00A0minimalist approach doesn\u0027t really gain you anything\u00A0that\u0027s actually useful in real game terms, although you might want to for purely role-playing purposes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E2. \u00A0Blocking by an Intervening Planet/Moon\u003C/u\u003E:\u003Cbr\u003E\nStatistically, this happens quite infrequently. \u00A0It\u0027s also the easiest type of blocking to overcome, to the point where it\u0027ll never be a factor. \u00A0Just put your relays in highly eccentric polar orbits so they talk across interplanetary distances well above or below Kerbin\u0027s ecliptic and you\u0027re golden. \u00A0That\u0027s the method recommended here (detailed below).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E3. \u00A0Blocking by the Sun\u003C/u\u003E:\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is only a problem on interplanetary missions, but it is certain to happen during them at some point, usually between arrival and waiting for the return window. \u00A0In purely game terms (ignoring \u00A0the role-playing aspect of needing to phone\u00A0home every day), this is only a problem if you\u0027re still wandering around in the system doing science when the sun gets in the way. \u00A0And that\u0027s usually only an issue at Jool because the system is so large it takes months to explore it all. \u00A0Problem is, the sun is too big to talk over/under with your highly elliptical relays, so you have to talk around it. \u00A0You do that by creating relays at all\u00A0planets except Moho.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\nEve is especially important because it\u0027s far enough from the sun usually to have an LOS from Kerbin to Eve to wherever, and it move faster than Kerbin so will provide these links more often. \u00A0When Kerbin is opposite the sun from wherever your ship is, Eve is often placed to bounce a signal around the sun. \u00A0This is especially important for communications with Jool\u00A0. \u00A0Anyway, as\u00A0mentioned above, you need redundancy and multiple possible paths, and Eve is often a key step in that alternate path. \u00A0Moho, not so much because it\u0027s so close to the sun that most of the time it can\u0027t provide a bank shot around it. \u00A0Also, it\u0027s way expensive to get to Moho compared to Eve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENETWORK DESIGN:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOK, so that\u0027s the underlying principles and realistic objectives. \u00A0Now, how do you accomplish all this? \u00A0Finally, we get into the nuts and bolts of the network.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E1. \u00A0Relay\u00A0System:\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe basic unit of the system is a set of 2 long-range relay satellites in highly elliptical polar orbits around the central planet. \u00A0One goes up, the other goes down, and they\u0027re 180^ out of phase with each other, so that when one of them is at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E, the other is at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E. \u00A0Because their orbits are highly elliptical (like 2000m/s worth above low orbit), the relay satellites will spend the bulk of their time high enough above or below the ecliptic to be able to talk over or under any intervening body except the sun. \u00A0Putting a pair like this at each planet (except Moho) will then provide a path around the sun to any other planet ALMOST all the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\nThese relays also cover nearly all the surface of the central planet most of the time. \u00A0One will get most of the northern hemisphere, the other most of the southern. \u00A0There will be a blind spot centered on the equator on the opposite side from where the satellites are (both orbit in the same direction so will both be on the same side of the polar axis most of the time), but central planets all rotate fast enough that a ship on the ground in the blind area\u00A0will rotate into coverage soon\u00A0enough. \u00A0Every week or 2, there will be a few minutes when both satellites are over the same pole, one at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E and the other at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe, so that the whole opposite hemisphere is blind\u003C/abbr\u003E, but this won\u0027t last long because the one at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E will be moving so fast, so don\u0027t sweat it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\nFor most of the time, these relays will also cover much of any moons of the central planet. \u00A0 There will be a gap on the far side, however, wider than on the central planet, which you fill with other component of the network, the moonsat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\nThe relay satellites should always have the biggest relay antennae you have. \u00A0This is so they can provide alternate paths around the sun in as many ways as possible. \u00A0As you unlock the bigger\u00A0antennae, you might have to replace some of your early relays. \u00A0Kerbin should definitely always have the biggest available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E2. \u00A0Moonsats\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor each moon of the central planet, you\u0027ll need something in equatorial orbit. \u00A0The purpose of a moonsat is to cover the gap on the far side of the moon left by the relay sats. \u00A0The \u0022moonsat\u0022\u00A0MAY be a dedicated commsat if you\u0027re doing something long-term on the far side, but for a 1-and-done mission, you can do things Apollo-style so that the ship left in orbit serves fills this role.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\nThe moonsat should orbit at a conveniently low orbit so that it passes over a ship landed on the far side often enough that blackouts aren\u0027t a bother, and for long enough that it can land while still in contact. \u00A0But it also must be high enough that the relays can see over/under the moon to it most of the time. \u00A0If being high enough for this makes the moonsat\u0027s orbital period (and thus blackouts for farside landers) longer than desired, you can use multiple moonsats spaced more or less evenly around the moon\u0027s equator. \u00A0But most of the time you\u0027ll only need 1 for gameplay purposes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\nMunsats need an antenna big enough to reach the local

you have 2 relays satellites in highly elliptical polar orbits and for each moon you care about, you have (at least) 1 satellite in a relatively low equatorial orbit. \u00A0It looks like

sort of network is pretty simple. \u00A0At Kerbin, you can\u00A0launch each relay on a separate rocket but everywhere else, it\u0027s best to send them both out on the same carrier vehicle. \u00A0If you want multiple moonsats somewhere, they should always go out on 1 ship. \u00A0Using 1 ship to carry multiple satellites facilitates spacing them out evenly. \u00A0Thus, this description will always use single ships even at Kerbin. \u00A0The mechanics go\u00A0like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E1. \u00A0The Kerbin Relays\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThese have to be set up first because they\u0027re the essential link from other planets and the farside of Mun/Minus. \u00A0Design a probe with the biggest relay antenna you have, enough juice to run it, and about 2000m/s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E in its own little tank. \u00A0Save this as a subassembly. \u00A0Then start the carrier vehicle. \u00A0Make it so you can mount 2 of these relay probes under the same fairing and then add the subassembly probes. \u00A0Launch into a polar orbit of\u00A0about 150km. \u00A0This will be the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E altitude of the relays, high enough to avoid stuff in 80-100km parking orbits but low enough to whip by \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E in no time. \u00A0Detach one of the probes and switch to it. \u00A0Plot a maneuver node for when the probe is directly over one of Kerbin\u0027s poles, burning all or most of the probe\u0027s fuel to reach an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E out near the edge of Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, then do this burn. \u00A0You should have a few hundred m/s left in the tank to tweak the orbit later if needed and to deorbit the relay when it needs replacing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\nThen you wait about a week for the 1st relay to reach its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E. \u00A0When it\u0027s starting to get close, switch back tot the carrier vehicle, detach the 2nd relay, and switch to it. \u00A0Plot a similar burn for it, but located above the other pole so this relay will go in the opposite direction as the 1st. \u00A0Adjust the number of orbits into the future when you actually do this burn as needed until it\u0027s as close as possible to when the 1st relay reaches \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E. \u00A0It doesn\u0027t have to be exact, just close enough. \u00A0Do this burn, then switch back to the carrier vehicle and de-orbit it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\nNOTE: \u00A0It could be that the 1st relay won\u0027t have its own link back to Kerbin\u0027s surface when it\u0027s time for it to burn. \u00A0This could require putting a \u00220th\u0022 relay in equatorial orbit first, if nothing you already have in Kerbin orbit\u00A0can do this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp

\u003Cem\u003Eunevenly\u003C/em\u003E spaced (or 3 evenly spaced)\u00A0commsats \u00A0in Munar orbit to talk to the farside. \u00A0Minmus isn\u0027t tidelocked but rotates slowly, and orbital velocity is pretty slow, too, so you might want the same there to avoid long blackouts. \u00A0By unevenly spaced, I mean 120^ apart, like a formation of 3 with a missing satellite. \u00A0Having 2 spaced like this will give farside coverage 2/3 of the time---3 will give full-time coverage. \u00A0But remember, you\u0027ll be putting relays up, at which point you only need 1 moonsat to give farside coverage 50% of the time, so don\u0027t spend money you don\u0027t need to. \u00A0The basic technique is the same whether you drop 2 or 3 moonsats off the same carrier vehicle. \u00A0The basic method for spacing multiple moonsats is as follows:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\nFirst, decide on the altitude you want the moonsat to be so it can usually talk over/under the moon to one of the relays. \u00A0Use math to determine what the orbital period\u00A0is for a circular orbit at that altitude at that moon. \u00A0Send the carrier vehicle to the moon and capture into an elliptical orbit with this altitude for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E. \u00A0As for its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E, again use the math to determine what altitude would give the carrier vehicle in an elliptical orbit an orbital period 1.33 (or some whole multiple of that\u00A0number) times as long as for the circular orbit at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E altitude. \u00A0The idea is, every time the carrier vehicle reaches \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E, it will be 1/3 of a circular orbit behind any moonsat previously released. \u00A0The carrier vehicle thus makes 1 elliptical orbit for every moonsat carried. \u00A0Each time it reaches \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E, it releases a\u00A0probe. \u00A0You switch to the probe and plot a burn to circularize its orbit at its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E. \u00A0Tweak the probe\u0027s orbit as needed with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E to fine-tune its orbital period to be within 1 second on the calculated circular period. \u00A0Once all the moonsats are in position, de-orbit the carrier vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\nNOTE: \u00A0Generally, you\u0027ll need a mod like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E that will give you a display of your orbital period. \u00A0As mentioned, using a tiny amount of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E prograde or retrograde as required will allow for very fine control of your orbital

other planet. \u00A0Send at least 1 moonsat to every moon you expect to visit regularly, but those can wait until you actually send out such expeditions. \u00A0The relays are the important thing, to be able to talk around the sun and to give a better connection out to Jool, and should be set up as soon as you have the antenna to make them worthwhile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\nNOTE: \u00A0Relays require a lot of EC/sec, but only when you\u0027re actually using them. \u00A0Solar power is practically useless at Jool for any purpose other than slowly recharging batteries between widely separated uses. \u00A0RTGs aren\u0027t any more powerful and are quite expensive, while fuel cells run out of fuel. \u00A0Thus, relays for Jool, Eeloo, and even Dres should have rather huge battery capacity to cover their periods of infrequent activity. \u00A0It might also be a good idea to have a fuel cell for emergency instances of prolonged or frequent use, remembering to turn them off as soon as possible afterwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022

In that single case,\u00A0periapsis insertion would result in the carrier vehicle going outside the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E so it couldn\u0027t perform its job, so apoapsis insertion is the only feasible choice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChacun\u00A0\u00E0 son go\u00FBt. \u00A0Me, I figure that it costs more money to have the carrier circularize than the probes, because the carrier has so much more mass when it enters the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E of the target planet. \u00A0It\u0027s got all the probes and their fuel, plus its own fuel aboard. \u00A0The lower the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E the carrier captures into, the more fuel it needs for that burn, which means the initial lifter has to be bigger and pricier. \u00A0At the same time, simple probes usually have way more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E than you need and are still cheap. \u00A0So I\u0027d rather skimp on the carrier\u0027s fuel, giving it just enough to capture into an elliptical orbit without bringing its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E way down, then use the cheap fuel of the probes to circularize them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-20T04:49:24Z\u0022 title=\u002210/20/2016 04:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Geschosskopf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Spaceanator123","CreatedById":170969,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-29T23:38:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey could you help me?
