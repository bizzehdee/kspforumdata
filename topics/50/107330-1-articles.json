Here, members of KMC will offer their help- tips, experiences and also help new young kerbal players to become master engineers and pilots!\n\nWe teach everything! We can teach all the following:\n\n**Construction Basics 101**- Teaching you how to build your crafts to they can be simple, effective and also not need thousands of struts to fly. *(Advanced courses also cover how to create larger rockets and also how to achieve more key tasks for specific requirements)*\n\n-***Rocket construction***\n\n-***Aircraft construction***\n\n**Rocket launching and ascent**- Teaching you how to launch your rockets into a safe stable orbit and also how to protect your rocket from aerodynamic issues. *(Advanced courses will cover entering specific orbits for specific tasks (such as docking and rendezvous) as well as eccentric orbits)*\n\n**Aircraft Piloting Basics**- Teaching you how to fly your aircrafts well, safely and effectively to get to where you need to be and also land safely after your flight. *(Advanced courses will cover landing of hypersonic crafts as well as landing faulty/crippled aircrafts)(Cadets can request one-on-one flight training with a KMC member for more in-depth training)*\n\n**Space Operations Training**- Teaching you how to change your orbits effectively, as well as rendezvous and docking. This will also cover how to get to moons and planets effectively. *(Advanced courses will help teach rendezvous with inclined stations or celestial bodies as well as docking with complex stations or low altitude objects)*\n\n-***Landing of spacecraft***- We will teach you how to safely land your spacecraft down on various planets and moons and return to orbit (as part of Rocket launching and ascent training) *(Advanced courses will manage landing on bodies with atmosphere and returning to orbit with them. Advanced courses will also cover returning to a craft after landing)*\n\n**Career Management Training**- We will teach you how to manage your space center effectively so you can achieve as much as you can and still save your money and explore the Kerbol solar system. *(Advanced courses will cover how to manage your space center on harder difficulties)*\n\n***(We can provide specifically pre-built crafts at cadets request for each course (\\*Senior Cadets however do not have access to pre-built crafts for advanced courses)***\n\n\\*Only Senior Cadets may take advanced courses (to apply to become a Senior Cadet- simply link a series of screenshots or a persistence file showing that you\u0027ve landing on the Mun, have a 3 module space station in orbit around Kerbin and have landed on the Mun in (Moderate difficulty or higher) career mode)\n\nWe also teach for mods- however you must request help in such a case.
