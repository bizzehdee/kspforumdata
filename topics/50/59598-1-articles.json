This is an advantage of moving parts as the collision model moves with them. Unfortunately, all part positions are in relation to the root part, not their parent part (or the specific mesh of the parent part if it has multiple) which is the technical reason for why this works but surface mounting to movable parts does not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe careful with this trick as solar panels are fragile and it\u0027s super easy to break them doing this in higher gravity.
