But where to begin? If you want a small, first-time rocket, then you should start out with the Mk1 Command Pod. Then, add a decoupler, and a fuel tank. Pick an engine, and don\u0027t forget parachutes. You may want to add fins to the sides (to help you go up, down, left or right), or some SRBs (Solid Rocket Boosters. These provide massive amounts of thrust,\u00A0but \u003Cstrong\u003Ecannot\u003C/strong\u003E be shut down). This is your beginner rocket. It may be a bit basic, but it will help you understand how to create and fly other rocket designs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, if planes are more your thing, then you would go to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E. I would start with the Mk1 cockpit, and a fuel tank. Next, add wings. Don\u0027t forget to add elevons to the wings (or else you won\u0027t be able to go up or down), and a tail fin (go side to side). Then, add a JX-3 \u0027Weasley\u0027 jet engine to the back, and you have a plane. But it doesn\u0027t stop there. You will need landing gear (or else you will just hit the surface, causing a massive explosion), and air intakes (to provide intake air for the engine). You may want to add parachutes to save your craft in an emergency, or airbrakes to slow you down (useful while you are coming in to land).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart 2: First Flight\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter you are happy with your craft, press the \u0027Launch\u0027 button (the green button, located where the \u0027save\u0027, \u0027load\u0027, and \u0027exit\u0027 buttons are) If you\u0027ve created a rocket, you will spawn on the launch pad, while for a plane, you will spawn on the runway. Throttle up by pressing \u0027Z\u0027, and then hit the spacebar (don\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Eactually \u003C/em\u003Ehit the spacebar!). If all goes well, your rocket will be propelled into the air. If it starts to turn one way or the other, press \u0027T\u0027, which will activate \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E. After a while, your rocket will run out of fuel, and you will begin falling back to Kerbin. If you remembered to add a decoupler, press space to activate it. The rest of the rocket will fall away, and \u003Cs\u003Esmash into the ground, killing thousands of innocent kerbals in the process \u003C/s\u003Ecollide into the surface. Don\u0027t activate your parachutes as soon as you\u0027ve decoupled, or else it\u0027ll be a very slow journey. Parachutes automatically activate at 500 meters, so don\u0027t worry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027ve created a plane, then follow the process of pressing \u0027Z\u0027, and then launching with the spacebar. The engine will take time to start up, but should produce enough thrust to lift your plane into the air on it\u0027s own. If not, then hold \u0027S\u0027 to pitch up. If it \u003Cem\u003Estill \u003C/em\u003Eisn\u0027t going up, then the end of the runway should help. If that doesn\u0027t help, and you see yourself going into the ocean, then activate parachutes. Remember: Failing helps. It gives an insight into what went wrong, and how to prevent that from happening again).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart 3: Basic Controls\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe basic keyboard controls of Kerbal Space Program are these: S/W - up, down.

It\u0027s best to retract solar panels, communication gear, and landing gear before this, to avoid them getting destroyed. A heat shield is an extremely useful piece of equipment, as it can protect your command pod (or probe core), science bays, and other things from the heat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVelocity: How fast your craft is going.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVector: The six things that you can use to go certain ways. Prograde is forwards, Retrograde is backwards, Radial is up, Anti-Radial is down, and Normal and Anti-Normal are left and right (unless you\u0027re in orbit, which is when they are forwards and backwards according to your camera view).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEVA: When your Kerbal exits the craft, and where you can control them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Missing in action\u0022\u003EMIA\u003C/abbr\u003E: Missing In Action, when your Kerbal is missing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Killed in action\u0022\u003EKIA\u003C/abbr\u003E: Killed in Action, when your Kerbal is dead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E,\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECOL\u003C/abbr\u003E,\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Thrust\u0022\u003ECOT\u003C/abbr\u003E: Centers of Mass, Lift, and Thrust. If you have a plane and it\u0027s mass is at the back, then it will take off quickly, but then spin out of control. An easy way to solve this is either by dumping fuel at the heavy end, or adding parts to the light end (adding more weight, which balances it out). The center of lift is where the most lift is. This should be in the middle, to give your craft maximum lift. The center of thrust shows which way your engine is going, and should be at the back (unless you are using the \u0027reverse thrust\u0027 feature).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this guide has helped you, TCIS.
