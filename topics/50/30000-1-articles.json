I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve flown enough flight sims to know my way around, but I am far from a good or intuitive pilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I am getting there as far as KSP is concerned with a great little plane. The stock Aeris 3A!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis plane is fantastic as it almost flies itself and you have to screw up pretty badly to crash it. It is essentially a powered glider.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if you stink as badly as I do, here\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s how to get started with this plane. On the runway, press ALT\u002BS three times (that gives you three steps of fine \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cup\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 trim) and press CAPS LOCK for finer control. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s it! Now, apply full power and take off. You\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll begin to overheat at this setting so back off the throttle about 2.5 to 3 marks after taking off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo play!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet the plane do the work! Play around with simple banking turns to start. See how fast you can bring her around with only banking turns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is also great for practicing landing approaches because of its gliding characteristics. You can X to cut power quite a ways out, depending on altitude, and glide your way in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually landing on the runway is purely aesthetic at this point. If you miss and land on the grass instead you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be fine. Just don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t hit a building.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPractice turns and banks and how you might affect them by pressing S. Understand that trim helps you maintain a flight profile. And don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be scared, you can flip this thing on its back and still recover!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave fun! Once you \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cget\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 this plane, flying bigger ones is much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou probably won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t glide like that in a bigger plane, but you will understand that landing does not mean pointing your nose at the runway. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s about maintaining a flight profile while decreasing power after aligning with the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is more advice than a tutorial.
