A new player - or any player for that matter - starting in career mode has a number of objectives for which delta-v is largely irrelevant. At the same time (for obvious reasons) a delta-v readout at this stage is most likely to be 100% accurate... barring unorthodox build strategies (such as explosive staging without using decouplers). So sure, it could be a plus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor point (b) about it never being accurate (or more precisely, almost never being accurate and often being completely wrong, especially at the build stage), I don\u0027t see where there is any controversy in that observation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understand your comparison with burn time, but burn time is only ever an instantaneous measurement. I haven\u0027t looked at the code for Snark\u0027s better burn time mod to see how it does it (and therefore why the stock calculation is wrong), but I would assume that burn time is merely taking the last known value for acceleration and dividing the node\u0027s total by that value. That\u0027s what I mean by instantaneous: it doesn\u0027t pretend to measure anything about the ship as a whole, future TWR or anything like that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, if you look into it more, burn time also indicates potential problems with a stock dv measurement. If you have KER\u0027s vessel window open, it gives current TWR and max acceleration at any given point in time. Divide your node\u0027s total by acceleration and you have a measurement of burn time, and KER usefully gives you \u0022time to node burn\u0022 using those same figures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, that value can be completely wrong.

It also thinks I have a dv of 3800 m/s. It\u0027s obviously wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe stock burn time, however, is more-or-less correct to think it\u0027ll require 5 minutes to execute the node, because it uses the last known value of actual acceleration. It therefore doesn\u0027t matter how oddly built the craft is: it indicates the real situation, right now, not a hypothetical value which assumes standard ship construction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo while the stock burn timer obviously has its flaws, it doesn\u0027t fall for the logical flaw that KER (and I assume MechJeb) does.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that same logical failing is bound to affect a potential stock dv readout.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be really meaningful and helpful a dv readout has to indicate a value for each stage, but I suppose it could also just be a total.

While I fully agree that the stock burn time indicator could be a lot better, as I said it is a self-correcting thing. It isn\u0027t a perfect science but IMHO it does correspond to the basic KSP approach: you fire your engines, see that it pushes you with a given force in a given direction then extrapolate from that to work out your burn time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP is, of course, a lot more accurate than that behind the scenes, but it seems to me that the whole point in stock game is to \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ekeep all of that behind the scenes\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E. The huge and major concession to this principle is maneuvre nodes and intercept markers: when you plot a node it shows an exact orbit and not a fuzzy probability cone; if you have two orbits intersecting and 0.1km distance to target in 2 hours, then you \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E be 0.1km from your target in 2 hours (as long as you stay on rails).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy point about a stock dv readout being guaranteed to be wrong (except in very simple cases) was originally meant with reference to the big areas where KER (probably also MJ, but I think I\u0027ve already been very clear about not having tried it) gets it \u003Cu\u003Every\u003C/u\u003E wrong. Staging with docking ports is the most glaring example. Drop-tanks was another glaring example in 1.0.5 but I haven\u0027t yet built anything which recreates the error in 1.1, so maybe it\u0027s been fixed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, as you rightly pointed out, there are things that are shown as being precise numbers even when they aren\u0027t, such as nodes and burn time. My point is not that anything like that should not be in stock, but that \u003Cu\u003EI see no need for stock to include any more of these \u0022given as accurate but not really\u0022 elements than the absolute minimum\u003C/u\u003E. Maneuvre node predictions are absolutely necessary to make the game playable for going any further than the Mun. I don\u0027t think I need to spell out exactly why an estimated burn time is needed to play the game properly. Therefore I\u0027m most definitely not arguing that they should be removed from stock. However, a dv readout is a list of numbers given as accurate, but which for a number of reasons will not be exactly accurate or even wholly wrong, and is \u003Cu\u003Enot a necessary addition to be able to play the game\u003C/u\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow obviously a dv readout becomes massively useful in the later game, but you need to use workarounds to get the right numbers in complex craft - adding temporary decouplers or fuel lines, or hiving off parts of the build while you manually switch Rapier mode, or whatever. And again, I really see no need for stock to add yet another element which needs workarounds to give the right result.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd - to come back to the burn time analogy - when KER or Snark\u0027s better burn time mod does give the right result, it\u0027s because they\u0027re running a relatively complex simulation of your craft. You\u0027re in a sim, running a sim on top of it. This is another point that I made several posts ago: it\u0027s either simple and probably wrong, or complex which means more CPU overhead. And therefore, again, I think that that qualifies it as being something for mods rather than stock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222597839\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002270330\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221464039293\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022126740\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gaarst\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 hours ago, Gaarst said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is just wrong, and somewhat insulting to the makers of these mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKER and BBT calculate burn time by taking into account the mass loss and acceleration of the craft.

As for the second part, I never made the slightest inference about Snark\u0027s BBT because I hadn\u0027t looked at it (and I said as much); having now read the blurb on the tin, it sounds like BBT does exactly as you say, which is great but means making assumptions and (like I said in the paragraph just before your post) means effectively tacking a sim on top of a sim. Regarding KER, it isn\u0027t very clear to me what it\u0027s doing. Enabling the thust vector simulation option certainly seems to force a more complicated sim that does what you describe, but with the option disabled (which I think is default and, in any event, has always been the case for me since I never build craft with engines facing in different directions) I got some odd results that I\u0027ve only just had time to check again.

What it does is to get the maximum acceleration you got in your current map session since your last staging event and use that for the burn time calculation. So the value the stock burn time is only right if you\u0027re at your max thurst all the time and will only self correct if your thrust is increasing ( if you don\u0027t believe me , just boot the game and\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Edecrease\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0your thrust after creating a manouver node \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u00A0).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn other words, the current stock burn time, unlike you state, assumes stuff about your ship in the future: it assumes that you\u0027ll not stage during the burn and it assumes that you\u0027ll never decrease your thrust in between staging events. Those are quite heavy assumptions and the reason I brought it to this discussion. It was SQUAD that defined the level of what is to be expected in terms of gauge quality by doing the quite hacky burn time meter we have since manouver nodes exist and it is somewhat intelectually dishonest to pretend we have some kind of high quality bar for a dV meter when both devs and players have been OK with a low quality gauge elsewhere.that shares pretty much all the same potential issues a stock dV meter could have :/\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m aware that stock burn time doesn\u0027t work too well at less than full thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever you too are half-right (or should I say half-wrong? \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E ). In that extremely simplistic example that I gave of a ship with opposing engines, disabling one engine and running at full thrust for a second gave a result very similar to what KER\u0027s estimate would have been if it had recognised the deactivated engine. Activating the engine and reduing thrust to 95% and giving another second\u0027s max thust bumped up the stock burn time estimate to several minutes. All this was without going back to KSC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore, a reduction in the \u0022real\u0022 max thust of the ship does indeed cause the stock estimate to revise upwards. Therefore you\u0027re wrong saying that it \u0022will only self correct if your thrust is increasing\u0022. However, I\u0027m perfectly prepared to accept that odd results happen if you start throttling down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not trying to say stock burn time is great. That would be pointless and a bit daft. I was saying that it doesn\u0027t fall into the logical trap of making assumptions about how the ship is built, which can be wholly wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think it is fair to say that stock \u0022assumes stuff about your ship in the future\u0022. There is a big logical difference between making no assumption and assuming things will not change. Do we \u0022assume\u0022 that the sun will rise tomorrow or simply make no assumption whatsoever about the possible disappearance of the sun or halting of the earth\u0027s rotation? I\u0027d go for the latter, personally. So for me stock makes no assumption whatsoever about your craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for whether it might be \u0022somewhat intelectually dishonest to pretend we have some kind of high quality bar for a dV meter\u0022, I couldn\u0027t disagree more. I have been extremely clear here that I have nothing at all against a dv readout, even a buggy and occasionally wrong one. I also have nothing against a better burn time indicator. The big difference is that the stock burn time indicator \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edoesn\u0027t ever pretend to be wholly accurate\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E. The fact that it always indicates nothing before you start up the engines when loading physics for a craft is a pretty huge signal to the player that it\u0027s an \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eestimate\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E. The fact that it then takes a while to settle for a number (with one of the in-game tutorials spelling out the fact that you need max thrust for a second for this purpose) is a further sign. I doubt that many new players really believe it to be precise, especially if they know they\u0027ll have to stage during the burn.\u00A0 \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003EThe limitations of the tool are self-evident\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I don\u0027t see how a dv readout would be useful without purporting to be accurate, unless it gave a single figure in km/s for the whole build. That last option would have advanced players sneering at it, while still requiring all of the detailed calculations underpinning KER or MJ to get to that fuzzy number - in other words a complete waste of coding time and sim calculations. To be useful, the readout has to be per-stage which brings us back to the whole question of where to put all that information, and how to deal with the fact that it can be much less accurate than it appears. To analogize: you can\u0027t produce a detailed quote for a job with each item accurate to the dollar, then give a total that\u0027s \u0022\u002B/- $500\u0022 without specifying where that \u0022\u002B/-\u0022 comes from.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo to close off this inordinately long post, I still vote no to a dv readout in stock, for the exact reasons I gave in my first post. Civil dicourse has led me to correct a few of my later developments on the subject but have also exposed a further area (deactivating engines) where the mods get it wrong. Some mod authors are upfront about the limitations, others aggressively defensive. Irrespective of the reasons why they are inaccurate, the fact is that they are and that it is far from obvious and intuitive to work around their limitations. Therefore adding it to stock would add bugs and confuse noobs. A mod comes with an implied \u003Cem\u003Ecaveat emptor\u003C/em\u003E which covers precisely this sort of issue, so a mod it should remain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-24T15:02:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222598847\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002270330\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221464099776\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022153264\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Plusck\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n31 minutes ago, Plusck said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nplus the odd aggressive \u0022learn how to use the tool\u0022 comments by one of its creators in here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou have a very strange definition of the word aggressive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKER usually calculates stages as they appear in the staging list.\u00A0 When the currently active engines are not consistent with the staging (i.e. you have enabled or disabled any engine) then it calculates an extra \u0022stage\u0022 using the currently active engines burning until they run out of fuel and then continues with the normal staging process.\u00A0 There does appear to be a bug with the burn time, possibly because it isn\u0027t\u00A0using this extra stage in its calculations or possibly because of something more involved.\u00A0 I play very little KSP compared to most of the users of KER,\u00A0I generally don\u0027t need to time burn starts\u00A0with the extra accuracy that KERs calculations are supposed to give and I generally don\u0027t use vessels whose staging is set up in any way that is likely to cause problems for KER.\u00A0 Now that I am aware of the issue it will be investigated (in the fullness of time) and probably fixed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-24T15:13:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222598847\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002270330\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221464099776\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022153264\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Plusck\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 minutes ago, Plusck said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut still, this is all beside the point.

\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edoes\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E is complex, unlike BBT.\u00A0 If you wanted to try to document KER to the same degree that I\u0027ve done BBT, you\u0027d have a freakin\u0027 \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Etome\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Given the huge amount of effort to produce KER, I really don\u0027t expect that level of documentation from anybody.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurthermore, KER not just a more complicated critter... it has an enormously huger player base.\u00A0 I\u0027ve been surprised and gratified at how popular BBT has turned out to be (it\u0027s by far my most popular mod)... but KER is vastly more so.\u00A0 By a conservative estimate, it has roughly 1.37 bazillion times the user base that BBT does.\u00A0 Look at the length of its forum thread.\u00A0 BBT may be kinda popular these days, but it\u0027s still small enough that its forum thread can go weeks without anyone posting there, and I can personally and individually answer every single fan\u0027s every question, at length.\u00A0 That\u0027s simply not possible with KER.\u00A0 KER has a lot more users.\u00A0 And each individual user is a lot more \u0022expensive\u0022 to the authors, in terms of support requirements, simply because KER is so much more complex and it\u0027s therefore easier to run into confusion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s also been around a lot longer, and I\u0027m sure the authors have run into plenty of really irritating users who really are schmucks who can\u0027t be bothered to try to figure things out for themselves.\u00A0 I\u0027ve never been in the position of having written a mod that big or that stupendously popular, so I can\u0027t say first-hand, but I imagine that such an environment would be a trifle wearing after a time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I have no idea what tone the KER authors take with their \u0022public\u0022... but whatever
