I think, the reason for why \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E writes on their site that it\u0027s not working was an old version of KJR Next that was out for only about a week (months ago) and is no longer available (I even deleted it from the servers). It had a compatibility problem with some mods of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E. But after the next update of KSP (I think it was 1.7.1 or 1.7.2) there was a new interface and the problem with robotic parts of the DLC could have been solved differently and much easier.

I think that only 2-3 types of mods might cause such issues. As already mentioned, some kind of life support mod (I\u0027m most suspisious on those), but it could also be some mod for colonization, that use some resorce other than stock game. Also some part mod that depend on firespitter plugin or B9 part switch that deals with resources could cause this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhenever you go on EVA, behind the scene, game engine actually create new object in game that shares some object properties as any other craft in game. Similar thing happens when you undock two parts of same craft, game create new ship object using some info what kind of parts and resources new ship should have (fuel, oxygen, electricity, etc.). For that fresh created ship object some mod that you have installed attempts to add some resources. But in case of EVA, it could not add any becasue Kerbal on EVA can\u0027t carry such resource.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost probably such mod have handled resource creation properly, but created warning message in log that something was not happened fully as expected.
