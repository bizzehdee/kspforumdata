It had one flight which almost ended in disaster. Fortunately, Valentina Kerman survived and I started putting \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s on manned ships (about half the time - yes, I know). Mu III was my workhorse for a long time but suffered from low capacity and relatively high part count. After several upgrades it wasn\u0027t even the same rocket and eventually I moved on to Mu IV, which was better but had serious spaghetti problems. If you didn\u0027t fly straight up until 20km, it would flip and explode. Mu V is my new medium workhorse and so far it has only failed once in about 8 flights. It can take 20 tons to LEO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002224DF4zY.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022720\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/24DF4zY.png\u0022 width=\u0022960\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Neutron series is used when I need small and tiny payloads lifted into orbit. Neutron I was a failure on all three launches for various reasons and I didn\u0027t like the look so I redesigned it into the Neutron II which was mostly successful. Some re-proportioning later, we have the more efficient Neutron III which can take about 3 tons into LEO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeutrino is for when I need 500kg payloads, which is not very often.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ClKBhnv.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022720\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ClKBhnv.png\u0022 width=\u0022960\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Gravity series are for when I need big things in orbit. Gravity I, IA, and IB are all basically the same with upgrades and can take 63T to LEO max. Gravity II is functionally retired as it is pretty much useless. It only had 2 flights and can only take 10t to LEO. Gravity III is my super heavy moon rocket but it is outdated and only has one more flight scheduled. It can take 30t into LLO. It will be replaced by Gravity V which I haven\u0027t designed yet. Gravity IV is a large version of Gravity I with a hydrolox core designed to launch massive interplanetary probes. It has currently flown four times with a fifth one under construction to launch a probe to either Uranus or Neptune.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022AppnItA.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022720\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/AppnItA.png\u0022 width=\u0022960\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the left we have the first vehicles to put people in space. Yes, I just strapped a cockpit and parachutes to a V-2 rocket... Spoicey Joe was designed to test the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E for the Spoice program (my manned lunar program). Kappa only flew once and did not work. Its purpose was to deliver tiny 200kg resupply packages to Avalon station and be ready to do so at a day\u0027s notice. No need arose for it to ever be used. Melody is my LEO crew ship similar to Soyuz. It can take 3 people into LEO, although it will be quite cramped. Sigma was launched 4 times, IIRC, twice to Sapphire station (for no good reason except to prove I could dock), one failure, and one artificial gravity tether experiment (which got to 0.008 or so g before the tether snapped). Illectro was a good idea but it proved to be too expensive to use regularly. It was designed to be a 3 man crew transfer vessel which could also carry \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E cargo. However, the spacecraft ended up at about 30 tons and needed a huge rocket. While it was useful for removing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports, it has most likely seen its last launch as it is pretty expensive for what it does.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022cHq7K0U.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022720\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/cHq7K0U.png\u0022 width=\u0022960\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese aren\u0027t really important, although SMALL-2 can theoretically reach orbit and only weighs about a ton.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA sense of scale:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ji3Pcvc.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022478\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ji3Pcvc.png\u0022 width=\u0022837\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003EFuture plans:\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as the near term goes, I\u0027m going to finish Eclipse station and do a few more manned moon landings.

Eclipse station was only supposed to be crewed after it was completed, but due to a bug I needed to crew one of the modules in order to be able to control it (RT did not want to work that day). However, because I had Yonder 1 docked, I could send them and have a way to get them home. Unfortunately, Yonder 1 was meant to be a test flight. However, the logic was that it was a repurposed Melody spacecraft that had flown several times already, what could go wrong?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, the fact that I had crew on the station meant that I could now land people on the moon for the first time in 4-5 years or so. Again, the lander was only a test, so I was jumping the gun here, but my IRL time is valuable, so why not?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately the lander had a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of about 1.1 on the moon, so landing was difficult.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/GON0QDu.png\u0022 style=\u0022min-height:396px;\u0022 alt=\u0022GON0QDu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFortunately, I made it, although I landed at 30m/s and blew up the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E containers (there was nothing in them anyway and I didn\u0027t have an engineer).
