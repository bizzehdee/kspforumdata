I have quite a decent save in 0.22, and I am most of the way down the tech tree. I now want to install some mods, like KW, and SDHI, which have both been updated to fit into the tree. However, I don\u0027t know whether or not I will be able to access parts that are in nodes that I have already unlocked before instalment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs anyone able to enlighten me in this situation?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greys","CreatedById":57109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T06:05:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust delt with this myself; parts that exist in unlocked nodes are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot Immediately Unlocked\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill Available to You\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027re added in a locked state to the unlocked nodes, and you just have to go to the nodes, which should feature a number in a circle on their icon to indicate locked parts; look to the left side the screen at the list of parts, find the parts, and click on them.
