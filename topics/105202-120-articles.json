That timer should be counting up, shouldn\u0027t it? Was the start screenshot really taken before the other two?\n\nAs for why the catch up mechanics work the way they do, I don\u0027t know. I assume it\u0027s to stop the game from running into ridiculously high numbers in the event that you have a huge amount of production of some kind of resource over a long timewarp period. Basically, like mcortez said, you need enough storage for about 6 hours of output, and this includes for all intermediary resources (like mulch).
