I\u00A0dislike to put just 4 x 88-88 on every vessel to max all out.\u00A0Thats boring. Actually i only can use an user made google sheet to calculate from kerbin to other planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould be nice to have a mod tool, that show me the real range of the vessel depending on Antenna Rating and actual DNS in addition\u00A0to my game difficulty setting, what i changed. (DSN, range modifier). Best with a window, where i can switch the planet, where the probe would be.
