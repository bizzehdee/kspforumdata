No matter how many people came to Gene Kerman to ask to be sent to the mun, he kept saying no each time. \u0022In these early days of the program, it is just too expensive.\u0022\n\nEveryone knows that to get to the mun would require 5 burns. One to take off and get into space, a second to get into orbit around Kerbin, a third to do the transfer between kerbin and the mun, a fourth to orbit around the mun, and a fifth to actually land on the moon. The fuel required to do all those burns just costs the program too much money.\n\nHowever, one kerbal named Jebudiah was very persistant, and was constantly arguing with Gene. One day, Jeb came in and said that he thinks that the mun can be reached with only two burns. Gene first initial gut reaction was \u0022Impossible!\u0022. After arguing about it for several hours, Gene gave in and (after arranging for Jebudiah to take an extended vacation in kerbol orbit) sent out a challenge to all the engineers in the program.\n\nRules: Build the smallest, cheapest, and lightest rocket that can get to the Mun in only two burns; one burn to take off from Kerbin, and one burn to land on the Mun. The rocket must include a probe computer and an empty Mk 1 Command Capsule. It must also land safely on the Mun (no crash landings). Then fly it to the mun unmanned to prove it to Gene that it can be done.\n\nSmallest:\n\nCheapest:\n\nLightest:\n\nLeast amount of fuel burned:\n\nFinal Score: (your combined score for the smallest, cheapest, lightest - the amount of fuel burned.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-05T23:36:32Z\u0022 title=\u002207/05/2015 11:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OpenWorldAddict**\n  \nedits"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T22:43:48Z","Content":"One, it\u0027s Jebediah.\n\nTwo, does this \u0022two burns\u0022 criteria allow for simultaneous staging (ie. boosters that burn at the same time as the first stage and are dropped before actually finishing the first burn)?"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T22:49:05Z","Content":"This definitely seems possible. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI\u0027m also wondering if staging counts.

This includes boosters, secondary engines, whatever is used to get the rocket into space. The only requirement is that when you do the \u0027main engine cutoff\u0027, your orbital trajectory has Mun encounter.\n\nAlso to note, the only other burns allowed other than the \u0027lift-off to MEC\u0027 burn and the \u0027suicide burn to land on the moon\u0027 are course corrections.

I am first going to try going to the mun with the one burn with a small probe. In that try my only requirement is that I get to the Mun, which means as far as I am concerned, the probe can crash into the mun and as long as got there on one main burn. Next attempt will be to try to land a probe on the mun with only two main burns. (I haven\u0027t landed anything on the Mun since 1.0 came out, so this will take quite some time for me to figure out) If I accomplish that, then I do my first test run of the unmanned command pod landing on the Mun with only two main burns as required for the challenge.
