This time, I landed a miner for a fuel platform in orbit around Minmus, and it got a horrific return. I went so far as to send another orbital scanner out to see the spots I should land, I tried in monochrome light spots, no change, tried in dark spots, no change. Literally 5 different spots, no change. Even the last one, I landed within 700m of my other miner that\u0027s getting like 20x the ore return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only difference between the miners (mining wise) is the # of small ore tanks. The one that works better has 6 ore tanks. The one that sucks balls has 1 ore tank. None of them get filled up though, because the ISRU is using all the ore without problem just as fast as it comes in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there some kind of bug where the first spot you mine with, the drill stays stuck mining at that rate or something?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Just saw the engineer level is a 5x multiplier... the engineer on board is a level 0.
