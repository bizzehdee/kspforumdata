I later tried installing another mod called VesselMover and it worked perfectly. I did some more research about why BDArmory wasn\u0027t working and i found out i needed ModuleManager and PhysicsRangeExtender. When i load up KSP now i don\u0027t see any difference in the building mode but when i try and fly a plane or spacecraft i see the BDArmory and\u00A0PhysicsRangeExtender icons in the right corner and i can click on them and\u00A0PhysicsRangeExtender works but when i click on the BDArmory button it says no weapons found. What could be the problem?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JLmoeBm250fkSxaijQ1WpYw32Ca3gr0I/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGameData Folder\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cochise","CreatedById":151667,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-18T00:53:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour craft needs to have a part called a \u0022weapon manager\u0022 on it in order for BDAc to work.

I\u0027m not even sure if BDAc is. There used to be so many awesome naval mods, a ton of awesome missiles/weapons/radar mods, so much to play with and totally expanded the game. The reason I came back to write this / was on this site to begin with was because today I am at the point where even though I keep all my mods up to date, I can\u0027t get my game to start.. it freezes after \u0022loading asset bundle definitions\u0022, just before the main screen opens up. so incredibly frustrating and I think the reason is because of these old, used to be amazing, unsupported mods that were fore BDAc. You missed the golden age of BDA by like three years. Anyways, there\u0027s still a ton to enjoy and I\u0027m not even sure if that\u0027s actually my issue, but happy playing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-03-18T02:10:21Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2021 02:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Cochise\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded some stuff\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qweky","CreatedById":210564,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-23T15:09:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223941810\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022200895\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221616028808\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022151667\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cochise\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/18/2021 at 1:53 AM, Cochise said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour craft needs to have a part called a \u0022weapon manager\u0022 on it in order for BDAc to work.
