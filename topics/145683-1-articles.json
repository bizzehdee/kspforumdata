Now, for the Funding mode, you will get more funds the more precise you are on following the bold line and a bonus if in the administration building, you set it so that the line is thinner.\u00A0(you can also set it thicker\u00A0for less money on each plan) The building will be totally seperate from the tracking station. The amount you get will always be less than or equal to what you had on hand before the Plan! If you fail a plan, you can have a possibility of going bankrupt! There further the distance you plan, the more it costs to \u0022research\u0022, meaning your money is the limit! There should be a set-up fee too...\u00A0Hope you consider soon! Thanks to NightHog for saying we should be able to set up waypoints before launch!
