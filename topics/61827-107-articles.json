Problem is that both will be changing over time, thrust due to atmosphere pressure change and mass due to fuel loss over time.

It\u0027s sometimes quite expensive, and sometimes negligibly small, but it\u0027s never quite zero. (Due to the way suffix calls are built at the moment, the more suffixes a term has the more expensive it is to create it. One of the more expensive calls is VESSEL(\u0022vessel name here\u0022), because any creation of a vessel object needs to build up about 30 suffixes to attach to it, and also getting the vessel from KSP in the first place means doing a sequential walk of all the vessels in your saved game and checking each name. In a new saved game that\u0027s quick, but by the time you have hundreds of \u0022flights\u0022 in progress (Flags and debris laying on the ground aren\u0027t \u0022flights\u0022, dammit SQUAD!) it gets more expensive to say Vessel(\u0022name\u0022) and you should really just do it once up front and then keep it in a variable from then on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s almost always more efficient to store a long suffix chain into a single variable, but often not by enough to matter. Most of our examples show the whole chain just because they make more legible examples that way. You can see in a glance where the thing we\u0027re talking about is found in the API that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut beware of premature optimization. Often the legibility you are sacrificing is worth more, in the long run, than the speed you get by doing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEspecially since KSP is doing an enormous amount of work 30 times a second or so anyway. The extra cost you\u0027re putting on it by your kOS script is often tiny. The only really expensive thing relative to the rest of KSP is the act of initially parsing and compiling the script. If you have a longer script you may have noticed KSP\u0027s animation hiccup a moment when you first type the RUN command for it. kOS is, literally, trying to perform an entire parse and compile within the span of one single animation frame. It doesn\u0027t have the sophistication to split that activity up into more than one animation frame to smooth it out. (That\u0027s a lot of work. You\u0027d have to retain the whole state of the parser and partly built ML code halfway through and resume it where it left off. It\u0027s unlikely that we\u0027ll ever fix that soon, as there\u0027s bigger fish to fry.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo give an example of why the expense of your kOS code probably doesn\u0027t matter too much, consider this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERoughly 10-15 times a second (*), kOS has to re-draw the *entire* screenful of characters in each open terminal. It\u0027s going through an entire 2D array of 50x36 chars (more after my terminal resizing stuff is released) and individually looking up each one for its matching subset of the font image file to find the right picture for that character, then tiling that part of the image to the right position for it on the terminal, even when it hasn\u0027t changed since last animation frame, its still re-doing that. This is how Unity requires that GUI\u0027s be made. They have to be re-drawn over and over or they disappear (in fact that\u0027s how you erase a button or a bit of text - just skip over the part of the code that\u0027s been drawing it.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompared to that, what your code is doing is going to probably be small potatoes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(*) - GUI windows are drawn less frequently than your framerate, but still quickly enough to be responsive to user actions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the problems with vectors, I admit I haven\u0027t looked at that part of the conversation too carefully over the last few days.
