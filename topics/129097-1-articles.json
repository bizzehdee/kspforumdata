I chose lasers because they may use lots of electricity, but would heat up the dry-ice very quickly, and vaporise it. and this is definitely not to be used on Venus, the gravity is way too high.\u00A0 and I would still need a bit of pressurization since otherwise the CO2 would not be sucked out. I will use dry ice pellets, not bricks, since they should be easier to pump.\u00A0and, if there will be a mod there should DEFINATELY be a carbon dioxide extractor and Dry ice maker.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
