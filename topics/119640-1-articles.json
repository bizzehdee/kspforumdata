Years later I came back to it, breezed through the Distortion World and beat the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf theres one thing I love in the games it\u0027s the music, there are some tracks that leave me in awe (N\u0027s castle, N\u0027s castle bridge, B/W credits music.) and some that I think are plain awesome! (Primal Groudon/Kyogre, Rayquaza, Zinnia battle, Lysandre battle, Frontier Brain battle music in Platinum, Red/Lance theme.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also like the Pokemon, obviously, my favourite being Clawitzer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t played Pokemon lately, because shiny hunting and continuous egg hatching got very boring in AS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T11:37:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI grew up with Red, and played Crystal into early teens.

After that, I never bought a more recent DS, so I stopped playing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, very good games, I spent maybe hundreds of hours (\u0026gt;300 on my Platinum save) over several years on these, and I do not regret it. Also, we had some quite intense battles with some friends at the time (tournaments and everything, often finishing with ties, as I used Destiny Bond a lot).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy favorite Pokemon must have been a battle trained Porygon-Z: completely overpowered if well placed, completely useless otherwise ^^. I also liked quite a few Pokemons of the 5th gen, although I can\u0022t remember their names now. Overall, I\u0027ve always liked playing with UU pokemons, instead of the OU ones that everyone had (looking at you Tyranitar, Garchomp and Heatran)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NFUN","CreatedById":78715,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T16:26:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI got bored over the summer, so when I got my new phone I installed \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=322110\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis hack\u003C/a\u003E for Pokemon Emerald.
