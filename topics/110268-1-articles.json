I have a very large rocket composed of one of my blender constructs. At the bottom are 12 @ (Rockomax decoupler, big orange tank, and skipper)s. There are 24 launch stabilizer and the rocket is well off the ground. The launch goes well, the stabilizers decouple \u0026amp; relax and the rocket is off the ground, but then . . . . . . .the launch pad explodes . . . . . .There is no evidence that any part fell off or broke off the rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket climbs, up, up, up . . . . . . . . and then\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe launch stabilizers reappear on the rocket, and then disappear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket climbs some more\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe stabilizers appear for a bit longer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket climbs to around 20,000 meters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe stabilizers appear again and the rocket spontaneous explodes leaving no trace. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have long suspected that when parts decouple the game is not actually removing all traces of part from the remaining portion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I suspect this is that when I add strut connectors to the lower stages of the rocket, they frequently increase the lag, but when\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethose stages are decoupled the lag continues, even after 4 or 5 stages have been decouple the rocket remains laggy as it behaves from launch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bigjoe","CreatedById":145233,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T02:12:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou are correct. If you can read even a little code, do a quicksave during launch after you\u0027ve dropped a few stages. make a copy and view it (do not use notepad, it will crash) If you ctrl\u002Bf, enter your vessel name, and scroll down you will see some parts still listed under the vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T06:32:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDecauplers and struts only gets completely removed when you leave the craft and return back to it. Other than that yes even if you don\u0027t see them they will still cause lag as they are there. I have had strange kraken behaviour with struts and decauplers too from time to time. Once i had a rockomax decoupler attached to the main body with 6 struts and when it decoupled the struts refused to let go and started stretching \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_sleep.png\u0022 alt=\u0022-_-\u0022\u003E They stretched over 2km distance and then the game refused to work anymore and crashed \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bigjoe","CreatedById":145233,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T07:19:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOddly enough, the day after I made my original response, I encountered the exact same bug. Only difference is it was a very small rocket, less than 15 parts. They didn\u0027t reappear and disappear though. They detached normally, and at about 12km suddenly reappeared and everything exploded.
