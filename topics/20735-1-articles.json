I am LocalGenius. I have been playing KSP for 2 months now, have become a regular guest on these forums, but until recently had no excuse to create an account here.

I know that my challenge will be very hard to accomplish, yet so simple that it will be addictive. I want to see what the community can come up with, so I don\u0027t want my challenge to be dismissed because it looks noob-ish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny advice helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, LocalGenius.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Awaras","CreatedById":15671,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-29T03:55:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, try to make sure the challenge hasn\u0027t been posted already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, make sure that it is actually possible to do the challenge - I have seen many people post challenges along the lines of \u0027make a ship that can land on every planet and moon TWICE in a single flight\u0027 which would require either cheat parts or a rocket the size of minmus...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, describe the challenge as clearly as possible and post your own best effort to complete it (with pics if possible).

Why? Because when you do your own challenge before posting it, you not only prove its possible, but you also have the opportunity to change the challenge into an even better one. Impossible challenges may as well be spam for all the good they do, so always test your challenge to just see if its possible beforehand. So go ahead and have some fun here, be nice, and I promise I won\u0027t bite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour Friendly Neighborhood Moderator (the Amazing Spider-Mod),\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadion\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LocalGenius","CreatedById":52638,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-29T20:25:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the advice.
