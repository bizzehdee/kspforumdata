To pull it off you\u0027ll probably end up building something that has a lot in common with the Lockheed U-2: really, really long high aspect ratio wings and a high-ish thrust engine. The only issue is that because this vehicle shares many design traits with the U-2 it will also fly like a U-2, which means that the range of speeds you can fly at at high altitude will be very small- if you go too slow you\u0027ll either stall or enter the \u0027second regime\u0027 where drag is greater than thrust and increasing angle of attack will cause you to descend. If you go too fast you\u0027ll encounter transonic effects and probably go out of control (the cold air at high altitude has a low speed of sound and your long thin wings will cause you to have a low critical mach number, so transonic effects will be significant at speeds not far above your stall/second regime speed).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TrainEngie","CreatedById":138031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T06:35:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a question regarding the cross section graph\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnybody, do you have any tips on making the yellow curvature-cross-section line on the cross section graph smoother?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, what does a smooth yellow curvature-cross-section line look like on the graph?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most successful design I have in 1.0.2 FAR is the E-2 Hawkeye with FantomWorks, KAX, BD landing gear, yatta yatta.

Conversely, the line can be misleadingly smooth on a big, draggy ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn either case, though, the way to smooth out the line is to avoid sudden changes in cross-sectional area as you move from the nose to the tail. But because the \u003Cem\u003Edistribution\u003C/em\u003E of that area in the cross-section is irrelevant, you can move from wide, skinny wings to tucked-in fuselage bumps without causing a lot of drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see a few tricks above:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) The nosespike on the Mk1 ship.

On the Mk1 ship, this is done with landing gear, intakes and wing sweep. On the Mk3 ship, the canards and intake nacelles do the job (and, again, wing sweep).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Smoothing the post-wing transition. On the Mk1, the landing gear serve this purpose. On the Mk3, fuselage bulges, airbrakes and the nuke smooth the way into the tail empennage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Vertical and horizontal stabilisers placed to jointly ease the stern drag. Small adjustments on these can have a large influence on drag; fiddle with your tail assembly until you\u0027ve got it minimised.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) To state the obvious, that many people seem to miss: you need to do all of this with your landing gear \u003Cem\u003Eup\u003C/em\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
