So today (1.0.5) I sent up a mining rig, transferred the ore to a launcher and put it in low Kerbin orbit (80x80 km). The contract has 4 requirements:\u003Cbr\u003E\n[LIST]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]Acquire 1,150 units of fresh ore form the Mun\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]Have 1,150 units of ore in your vessel\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]Have your ore near Kerbin\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]Maintain stability for 10 seconds\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[/LIST]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOnce I got down to the 80x80 km orbit 3 of the 4 requirements were met, all but \u0022Have your ore near Kerbin.\u0022 Because this requirement is so vague and hadn\u0026#39;t been met yet I assumed I would have to land the ore, so I transferred it again to an SSTO and landed it at KSC. The SSTO is currently sitting on the runway with the ore and the \u0022Have your ore near Kerbin\u0022 requirement still has not been met while the 3 others have. Does anyone know exactly where I have to put this ore to have this requirement fulfilled? I\u0026#39;ve got a quicksave from before re-entry before I can get it back in orbit if necessary.
