For instance I know of no modern concept of heat that would describe the following pic. Three identical boosters, filled with liquid, very very cold liquid, manage to heat at radically different rates. Then the metal decouplers melt, launching the still cool and intact boosters off like missiles. The only heat model that might predict such behaviour (caloric) still cannot explain why the decouplers get hotter than the things they touch. Even the 18th century knew that didn\u0027t make sense.

I can live with the bugs till they\u0027re fixed. I can tolerate the lack of memory crashes. I can enjoy the game on 32 bit. But the thing that\u0027s going to make me drop this game for good, sooner or later, is the fact that there\u0027s nothing to do. Once you build that base on the Mun, what purpose does it serve? Once you land a rover on Duna, where are you going to go with it? Once you get an aircraft to Laythe, why would you really need to fly it? \n\nIn one challenge I created I stressed over and over again the challenge was not about reaching the destination as fast as you could, it was about the journey getting there. The reason? Because once you reach any destination in KSP, there\u0027s no journey left and nothing to do when you arrive. Ok, so they added a resource. So now you can mine for fuel to refill the ships you create and go to further destinations and doooo... what?\n\nI\u0027ve said it before and I\u0027ll say it again, things you build and create in KSP have all the relevance and permanence of a sand mandala. You build them, admire them, abandon them, delete them, rinse, repeat. \n\nAnd in my situation, here\u0027s the real befuddling irony. Out of sheer lack of things to do in-game, about a month ago, I learned how to create mods.

I dislike the memory/graphics limits - I have a lot of RAM and graphics on this gaming PC so that I can do things like run a ton of addons, and high amounts of textures and details -- I find it irritating to crash with memory allocation errors and memory leaks when I do a lot of scene changes during a design and test session. Its 2015, come on over to the 64 bit world; I have 4 hyperthreaded cores, 32GB of ram, SLI graphics with a couple gigs each of Graphcis RAM, and a 64bit OS. I know you need the lower end to support a wider variety of machines, but please take advantage of the assets I and many other gamers provide.\n\nPet peeve: Squad\u0027s extremely poor software release engineering skills. X.Y.Z - Z is supposed to be a BUGFIX not a major systems change to the function of the program, especially one that isn\u0027t backwards compatible (broken saves!). \n\nHere\u0027s a clue: if you are doing things that change fundamental program functionality, especially if you are adding entire systems (aerodynamics for example) they you are NOT feature complete, so you are still in ALPHA. If you have to replace entire features because you have to do them a different way (heat for example), and they are neither fully regression \u0026 stress tested, nor are they backward compatible, then you are in BETA. And in either of those events, you should not be doing such large changes as a *bugfix* level release - those are typically major release increment items, especially if they break backward compatibility. Its misleading to the end-users, as well as bad software engineering practice to do so.\n\nDespite the fact that they versionined it to 1.0, KSP is still at best a Beta piece of software. The thing is, I enjoy it enough to put up with the crashes, inconsistencies and so on. Thats why I gripe - because I care (\u0022The opposite of love isn\u0027t hate, its indifference\u0022 -- Elie Wiesel). \n\n***Bottom line:*** *Its simply fun to fling a kerbal to a distant place on a craft of your own design.*"},{"CreatedByName":"SciMan","CreatedById":12748,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T03:32:25Z","Content":"\u0022Hate\u0022 is certainly too strong of a word for my feelings, but here\u0027s a list of things I very strongly dislike, ordered by priority (strongest dislike first):\n\n1. Unity 4.x bug that doesn\u0027t clear textures out of system ram after transferring them to video card ram.\n\nThis effectively doubles ram usage for NO BENEFIT AT ALL. \n\nOf course, this one\u0027s not exactly something I dislike about KSP or Squad, as it\u0027s a Unity bug and only the makers of Unity can fix those.\n\nSquad can only work around this kind of bug , tho that hasn\u0027t stopped them in the past (ex: Krakensbane).\n\n2. No On-Demand loading of textures. Instead, the game loads all textures on start.\n\nAgain, large RAM usage for no benefits.\n\nA mod was available at one point that fixed this (Load On Demand), so it\u0027s almost certainly \u0022easier\u0022 to implement than Win/Mac x64 support, because AFAIK x64 support requires updating to Unity 5 (not easy almost by definition).\n\n3. Memory leaks, AKA When the game is done using a section of memory, but doesn\u0027t deallocate it properly.\n\nGranted, this can be hard to catch when writing the code, but fixing them should be TOP PRIORITY, because they are GUARANTEED to cause a crash, eventually.\n\nGlad to see that 1.0.3/1.0.4 fixed the largest/most commonly reported one.\n\n4. Many examples of stock textures that are far too high resolution for what they do.\n\nI mean, 2048x2048 texture on a BUTTON?!? The resolution used is massively overkill, and firmly into \u0022Whiskey Tango Hotel\u0022 territory.\n\nNo small wonder the game can have RAM problems even when stock.\n\nThat\u0027s all of the software bugs that annoy me, now for the game-play and game-balance issues.\n\n5. Lack of challenge/too much \u0022grinding\u0022.\n\nOnce a player figures out piloting, there isn\u0027t much challenge in the game.\n\nThe only thing left is grinding science and/or funds to unlock and/or pay for parts to do what you want with the game.\n\nIn other words, it feels arbitrary and robotic.\n\nInstead of feeling like you\u0027re operating a space program, it feels like you\u0027re trying to convince the game to let you have fun playing.\n\nPerhaps I\u0027m just playing it \u0022wrong\u0022, but how is there a \u0022wrong\u0022 way to play a single-player sandbox game in the first place?\n\n6. Seeming willful resistance to providing the player with information that is vital to NORMAL game-play.\n\nDelta-V and other useful information (ship mass, etc) should be accessible.\n\nAnything else leaves the player flailing in the dark for no good reason.\n\nThis is ESPECIALLY true where relevant to game-play (ship delta-V next to maneuver node delta-V).\n\nThat\u0027s all the game-play/balance issues.\n\nNow for a really small one, but it\u0027s about SQUAD itself.\n\n7. Adding new features before working out bugs in previous things.\n\nI suppose it\u0027s okay to do this if the buggy system is going to be entirely replaced anyways (not fixing infiniglide in the 0.90 souposphere).\n\nIn most any other situation, it\u0027s not hard to see how this practice can result in a massive backlog of bugs, to the point that two bugs can interact to create a third bug (that might seem to be entirely unrelated).\n\nI have seen a rise in \u0022patch\u0022 releases recently, which I like because it means bugs are getting fixed before features are added. Hopefully this continues even when there aren\u0027t any \u0022game-breaking\u0022 bugs in a major release.\n\nIf all future development on this game was dedicated to improving game performance (increasing FPS, lowering RAM usage) and fixing bugs, I would be quite happy with that. After all, mods are taking care of the \u0022new content\u0022 side of this game quite handily, and have been doing so for quite some time now."},{"CreatedByName":"Jon144","CreatedById":80626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T04:03:17Z","Content":"I hate the low FPS"},{"CreatedByName":"RandomRyan","CreatedById":142844,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T04:08:10Z","Content":"what i like: explosions\n\nwhat i hate: explosions making lag"},{"CreatedByName":"stevehead","CreatedById":137745,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T04:27:04Z","Content":"I agree with other people that \u0022hate\u0022 is too strong of a word. I\u0027ve invested too many hours playing the game or programming tools/mods for it while having fun to truly hate anything about the game. Closest thing is when I rage over bugs that should have never slipped by Squad\u0027s QA and testing, but I could write one large wall of text regarding that subject. As for actual game play, I do have several major complaints:\n\n1) The payload fractions are way too large in stock since the new aerodynamics. I thought rocket sizes with the old stock aero were perfect for that balance between realism and game play, but now a puny little rocket is able to reach orbit. This is something that should have been anticipated knowing how FAR/NEAR affected the payload fraction pre-1.0. Squad really should have scaled the solar system by a factor of 2 for the new 1.0 aerodynamics; it ups the dV to low Kerbin orbit back to pre-1.0 amounts (about 4.5 to 4.8 km/s). It does increase dV for non-atmo maneuvers by about 50%, but after playing 2x scale for some time, it\u0027s hardly any more difficult (1210 m/s vs 860 m/s for a Mun transfer); it also makes the 2.5 and 3.75 meter parts less OP.\n\n2) The career mode still feels like I am a freelancer as opposed to running an actual space program. I was hoping to have the ability to plan missions instead of relying completely on randomly generated contracts. For example, I could propose a mission to Jool where I place an orbiter in Jool orbit while send a lander to Laythe; I would be awarded funding based on my reputation. I want to be able to control the direction of my program, not the contracts. The contracts should be there only for making some extra funds on the side. The majority of career mode should be me deciding what to do based on my funds and reputation.\n\n3) Science is still too boring and repetitious. There should be more to experiments than just right-clicking them: the impactor experiment from KSP Interstellar and experiments from Station Science (another thing lacking in stock is having an actual purpose for bases/stations other than fueling and ISRU) are both examples of how science should have been in stock. At least the current experiments should be differentiated in some way; there is no difference between a temperature scan and a mystery goo reading other than the message and amount of science. When science first came out in 0.22, I really thought it was a place holder and I am disappointed that it hadn\u0027t been improved on since.\n\n4) Stock fairings and their confetti explosions... \u0022No sir, I don\u0027t like it\u0022.

In a game where plenty of people rack up more than 1000 hours, and the game is set guess where, that\u0027s going to repetitive quick. I probably turned my music volume off before I played 30 hours. There should be a unique set of songs for each celestial body, landed and in orbit. Perhaps a few to play during reentry. Maybe something to listen to while flying planes. The list goes on.
