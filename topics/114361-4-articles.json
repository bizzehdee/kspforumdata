If you have to replace entire features because you have to do them a different way (heat for example), and they are neither fully regression \u0026amp; stress tested, nor are they backward compatible, then you are in BETA. And in either of those events, you should not be doing such large changes as a \u003Cem\u003Ebugfix\u003C/em\u003E level release - those are typically major release increment items, especially if they break backward compatibility.

I\u0027ve invested too many hours playing the game or programming tools/mods for it while having fun to truly hate anything about the game. Closest thing is when I rage over bugs that should have never slipped by Squad\u0027s QA and testing, but I could write one large wall of text regarding that subject. As for actual game play, I do have several major complaints:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) The payload fractions are way too large in stock since the new aerodynamics. I thought rocket sizes with the old stock aero were perfect for that balance between realism and game play, but now a puny little rocket is able to reach orbit. This is something that should have been anticipated knowing how FAR/NEAR affected the payload fraction pre-1.0. Squad really should have scaled the solar system by a factor of 2 for the new 1.0 aerodynamics; it ups the dV to low Kerbin orbit back to pre-1.0 amounts (about 4.5 to 4.8 km/s). It does increase dV for non-atmo maneuvers by about 50%, but after playing 2x scale for some time, it\u0027s hardly any more difficult (1210 m/s vs 860 m/s for a Mun transfer); it also makes the 2.5 and 3.75 meter parts less OP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The career mode still feels like I am a freelancer as opposed to running an actual space program. I was hoping to have the ability to plan missions instead of relying completely on randomly generated contracts. For example, I could propose a mission to Jool where I place an orbiter in Jool orbit while send a lander to Laythe; I would be awarded funding based on my reputation. I want to be able to control the direction of my program, not the contracts. The contracts should be there only for making some extra funds on the side. The majority of career mode should be me deciding what to do based on my funds and reputation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Science is still too boring and repetitious. There should be more to experiments than just right-clicking them: the impactor experiment from KSP Interstellar and experiments from Station Science (another thing lacking in stock is having an actual purpose for bases/stations other than fueling and ISRU) are both examples of how science should have been in stock. At least the current experiments should be differentiated in some way; there is no difference between a temperature scan and a mystery goo reading other than the message and amount of science. When science first came out in 0.22, I really thought it was a place holder and I am disappointed that it hadn\u0027t been improved on since.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Stock fairings and their confetti explosions... \u0022No sir, I don\u0027t like it\u0022.
