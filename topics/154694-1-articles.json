screenshot, the stranded ship\u0027s solar orbit isn\u0027t that much different from Kerbin\u0027s, which tells me that it didn\u0027t leave Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E with a really big Kerbin-relative velocity.\u00A0 That\u0027s good news, because it means you don\u0027t need super-high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to rendezvous with it, either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, once you get your rescue ship into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, you\u0027ll need ~1000ish m/s of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to be able to escape Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E, plus some amount to give it the desired intercept orbit, plus some amount to match velocities when you encounter the target, plus some amount to then put it on an intercept course back to Kerbin.\u00A0 So, your rescue ship is going to need the following:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nTo be on the safe side, let\u0027s say ~2000 m/s of

back).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSome way of docking to the stranded ship (since you can\u0027t EVA the tourists).\u00A0 If the stranded ship happens to have a docking port on it, you can dock that way.\u00A0 If it doesn\u0027t, then your only hope is for the rescue ship to mount the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Advanced_Grabbing_Unit\u0022 rel=\u0022external

handling the rescue.\u00A0 Both options require the ability to dock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nOne option is to send a rescue ship that has some empty seats for the stranded kerbals, and enough fuel to come home, and a heat shield and parachutes and such.\u00A0 You dock to the stranded ship, transfer the kerbals across, undock, and bring home the rescue ship.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBut there\u0027s also another option:\u00A0 A \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Erefueling\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E rescue ship.\u00A0 This can be a completely unmanned ship with no crew capacity at all, but extra fuel tankage.\u00A0 It docks to the rescue ship, then it transfers fuel to the stranded ship, then it undocks.\u00A0 Now you can bring the stranded ship home using its own engines, and you just abandon the rescue ship in solar orbit.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...Anyway, that\u0027s it for the engineering challenge of building the ship.\u00A0 Then there\u0027s the matter of getting a rendezvous with the stranded vessel.\u00A0 That\u0027s an exercise in interplanetary navigation:\u00A0 first, you need to set up an intercept so you can meet the target; then, after you\u0027ve done the rescue, you\u0027ll need to set up another intercept to get it back to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s perfectly doable, but if you\u0027ve never done it before, it can be a bit of a challenge.\u00A0 Do you have experience with rendezvous, docking, etc.?\u00A0 If not, I\u0027d suggest doing some practice in Kerbin orbit to get the hang of it, before you try something ambitious like a solar-orbit mission.\u00A0 For example:\u00A0 put a couple of satellites in different orbits around Kerbin, then try sending a ship to dock with satellite A, then leave that to go dock with satellite B, then back to A again, and so forth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou may find it tricky at first, but it gets a lot better with practice.\u00A0 There are some good tutorials out there for learning orbital rendezvous techniques, plus of course you can always ask questions about it here.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022
