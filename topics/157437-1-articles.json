So instead, to save me time when I get home, I\u0027m going to ask you: is there a part in KSP that can be easily stacked, has a uniform shape, and is exactly the length of a convenient-for-eyeballing-subdivisions amount of meters?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFailing that, what is the exact length of for example a FL-T800 fuel tank?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-07T10:56:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill works, see Stone Blues post.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/34260-20x-jebs-big-stick-for-all-your-large-measuring-needs-v10/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-07T11:06:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeat, this will work even better than just a random part for comparison \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-07T11:54:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe engineer\u0027s report also gives height/width measurements to tenths of meters.
