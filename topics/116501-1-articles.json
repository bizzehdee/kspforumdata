Running older, incompatible mods in 1.0.4 or running them in 1.0.2? Either way you will need to provide a mod list (with versions) and an output_log.txt of any crash for anyone to be able to give you any sort of decent advice.

The best bet is probably to try the -forceopengl command line option (or the similar DirectX 11 option) which should reduce memory usage considerably.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OhTheIronE","CreatedById":148458,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T21:33:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, found the problem, little bug w/ Firespitter parts.
