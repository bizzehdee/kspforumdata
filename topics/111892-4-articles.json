I\u0027ll think on that a little.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with telescoping ramps is that it would need to be physically collidable (so Kerbals and rovers can walk/drive on it), which means it can\u0027t extend into the ground like the ladders. So it would be a lot of guess-work to get them to extend to the right height for your landing legs. The ramps would have to have one extension length, and the player would have to take that into account when positioning it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose one possibility is to make it function as a landing leg itself, so that there could be some spring to it (telescoping would permit this somewhat).
