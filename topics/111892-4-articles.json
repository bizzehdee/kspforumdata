What I do is extend the piston collider (which is a capsule collider in Unity) down such that the ending \u0022sphere\u0022 has it\u0027s center on the foot\u0027s pivot, and set the radius to extend to the ground through the foot. That way the spherical part of the collider will always line up with the ground, whichever way the foot pivots.

I\u0027ll think on that a little.\n\nThe problem with telescoping ramps is that it would need to be physically collidable (so Kerbals and rovers can walk/drive on it), which means it can\u0027t extend into the ground like the ladders. So it would be a lot of guess-work to get them to extend to the right height for your landing legs. The ramps would have to have one extension length, and the player would have to take that into account when positioning it. \n\nI suppose one possibility is to make it function as a landing leg itself, so that there could be some spring to it (telescoping would permit this somewhat). I\u0027ll think on it, but I\u0027m not sure how practical it\u0027ll be with how KSP works currently.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Those service bays are looking awesome!
