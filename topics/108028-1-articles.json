I first want to make sure that the vanilla 32 bit version of KSP works as well as possible before using the 64 bit version with loads of mods. But as you can understand, it is paramount that my system work well in vanilla 32 bit before going down that avenue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T14:35:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suggest trying the proprietary Nvidia driver with the highest number from the Mint repository first, this is 331 on Ubuntu, if KSP runs then great.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T15:36:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECorrect, that\u0027s the easiest way if you\u0027re new to linux.
