If so, are you getting graphics problems too?\n\nFor me, the graphics seem to glitch when I return to the space centre. It either goes to black with only the exti and other icons visible or it goes funky, a bit like looking at a field in Cornwall using a tart\u0027s fishnet stockings as a blindfold.\n\nIs anyone else using mint and the same card but using proprietary drivers? if so what, if any, problems have you had?\n\nRegards,\n\nDaveroski.\n\nPS Dear Moderators, As I upgraded my system and installed Linux for the main reason of playing KSP this is the most logical place for this post. I first want to make sure that the vanilla 32 bit version of KSP works as well as possible before using the 64 bit version with loads of mods. But as you can understand, it is paramount that my system work well in vanilla 32 bit before going down that avenue."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T14:35:32Z","Content":"I suggest trying the proprietary Nvidia driver with the highest number from the Mint repository first, this is 331 on Ubuntu, if KSP runs then great."},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T15:36:53Z","Content":"Correct, that\u0027s the easiest way if you\u0027re new to linux.

Naturally I have tried both and have the same problem with both.\n\nI have completely uninstalled and reinstalled KSP over half a dozen times. Every time I tried something different I deleted the whole KSP directory and re-downloaded it again.\n\nI use Steam for KSP and even though there is an option to uninstall on Steam I always delete the KSP directory from the common directory.\n\nCould the Nouveau driver somehow be interfering with it? It is still in my Driver Manager though not selected. As is the 346 driver from edgers.\n\nBy the way, I thought a proprietary driver was one from the original hardware manufacturers site. I had no idea that there were repositories with proprietary drivers in them.\n\nMy Driver Manager says that \u0027No Proprietary Drivers Are In Use\u0027\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T18:45:19Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 06:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Daveroski**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T18:49:43Z","Content":"Nouveau will be off when using the proprietary driver, I really don\u0027t recommend removing it, and yeah you can get the proprietary driver in a few different ways.\n\nDriver Manager may just not be detecting it, it should be listed in Synaptic though, and you can try running glxgears in a terminal to see if it\u0027s working.\n\nCan you post pics of this issue please, someone might recognise it.\n\nAlso your logs please after the glitch occurs."},{"CreatedByName":"Daveroski","CreatedById":93896,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T19:15:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Nouveau will be off when using the proprietary driver, I really don\u0027t recommend removing it, and yeah you can get the proprietary driver in a few different ways.\n\u003E Driver Manager may just not be detecting it, it should be listed in Synaptic though, and you can try running glxgears in a terminal to see if it\u0027s working.\n\u003E \n\u003E Can you post pics of this issue please, someone might recognise it.\n\u003E \n\u003E Also your logs please after the glitch occurs.\n\ndone that. glxgears has a pretty animation of gears and a FPS report.\n\nThe Glitch, once it occurs, continues when I exit to the main menu.

I could enter, exit, but see nothing.\n\nI suppose now I will have to do a fresh install, and start over, and gradually add mods to see which is the culprit.\n\nInitially this was happening in vanilla. After a few installs,changing drivers back and fourth, and telling someone, it seemed to clear up. So I thought it safe to add mods.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T12:09:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 12:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Daveroski**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T12:52:52Z","Content":"Okay, the logs may show what\u0027s going on here, next time it happens don\u0027t close KSP, just get the player.log and post it to dropbox or pasetbin, the issue should show up at the very end of the file."}]}
