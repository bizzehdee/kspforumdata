You are stuck at the same tech level. This would kill most if not all servers. Next, your first Duna transfer. You have to wait a real life year to get that science back. KSP 2 will have gone through a major update by the time you finish one mission. And you are still literal real life decades away from being able to start a colony.

Real time planetary SOIs are a really really really bad idea. Have you tried running a Mun mission entirely in real time?

There is a big difference between having an island (even just one island) to yourself on Laythe and having a massive area of empty space where you put your station. Unique areas are in short supply in a large multiplayer environment, and just having 5000 players have small stations in deep space because all of the pristine space on planets and bodies are taken up is kind of dumb. What is there left to do? Make more supply runs? There\u2019s so many colonies and supply runs already that it doesn\u2019t matter. Explore? There\u2019s nothing left to see except vistas covered with hundreds of bases to the point that they are ruined. You will probably only have a small base on one or two celestial bodies, as every player having a base on every body just isn\u2019t feasible \u00A0for a lot of reasons. Even accounting for low and high orbits, which are not good value locations compared to being on the surface, you will still get significant crowding.

We do still want this game to run at 60FPS right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: About what I think KSP 2 Multiplayer will look like, I think there\u0027s an entire possibility for a player to be \u0022just a craft designer\u0022 and barely actually pilot any vehicles of any kind outside of testing purposes to make sure the stuff they build actually does what they want it to do.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt depends entirely on how much they integrate the ability to publish your designs to the Steam Workshop with the funding and/or incoming resource flow of your space agency (and trust me, there\u0027s a lot they could do there!).\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn fact, an extremely lucrative option (for your in-game \u0022space agency-acting-as-solely-an-engineering firm\u0022) would be to focus entirely on designing vessels, and not so much focus on actually piloting vehicles aside from that needed to confirm that they do in fact perform as you expect them to perform.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf the multiplayer is set up so you can buy and sell craft blueprints with in-game money and/or resources (tied in with the Steam Workshop craft sharing system from KSP 1, but likely with many under-the-hood improvements). the more popular your design becomes, the more you\u0027d be able to charge for it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis means that affording an interstellar voyage could be simply a matter of building the best and/or easiest to pilot cargo or crew transfer \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, or Mun rocket, or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E-planet-hopper, or whatever mission you want it to fulfill (but ships built to do supply runs would probably be a popular category to focus on, because not everyone has the time to fully optimize those designs).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat would enable MUCH MORE FREEDOM for experienced players who might be making a 2nd or 3rd or 40th new save file without bringing any of their craft files over from older saves (maybe because they want to try building differently, maybe because they installed a new mod and want to see how it impacts the game\u0027s progression, who knows?).\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis allows for more freedom because all the good designs from the previous save files could be contributing to the funding (or incoming resource stream) of the new save file (since they\u0027re all from the owner of the same license key for KSP 2, the game would be able to figure that out (and maybe give you an option to choose if you want to have access to the funding from \u0022sales\u0022 (aka downloads) of your designs or not), which would allow you to (for instance) skip the early-game \u0022tutorial-but-not-called-a-tutorial\u0022 phases of play, and go straight to playing in mid-game where the player is expected to roughly know what they should be doing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know that when I get a new game, I\u0027ll play thru it once with no mods, then a second time with mods, and then by the third time I\u0027ve tired of early-game enough that I\u0027ll probably install a cheat or \u0022quick-start\u0022 mod that can just give me the items I need to start playing the game right at the mid-game progression point, but it would be nice if I could do that without having the nagging feeling in the back of my mind that I\u0027m not doing it legitimately (not because my feelings are wrong, after all if I\u0027m using a cheat mod, I\u0027m NOT doing it legitimately). Of course, once I get myself established at a nice mid-game progression level, I\u0027ll disable and/or uninstall the cheat mod, and progress as normal (or at least as close to it as I can).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-04-07T18:55:25Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2022 06:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by SciMan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded speculation of what integrating craft sharing into the progression system could mean with respect to gameplay\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-07T19:24:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224112768\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221649356505\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002212748\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SciMan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n48 minutes ago, SciMan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think there\u0027s an entire possibility for a player to be \u0022just a craft designer\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell then you\u0027ve just destroyed what fun MP KSP would be.
