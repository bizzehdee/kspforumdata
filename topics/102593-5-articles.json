Many of my rocket, spacecraft, and mission designs are based on aerodynamic simulations that I perform outside of the game. I\u0027ll have to learn how the new aero model works, modify my simulations, and develop new design guidelines.\n\npretty much this. I\u0027ll launch a craft and see what I have to do to make it explode on re-entry. Then I\u0027ll go just a little slower than that...\n\nAfter that I will rebuild my Apollo replica and increase how stock it is.\n\nIn my mind, if you can\u0027t build an accurate looking Apollo 1-Apollo 17 in stock then the game is not ready for release. Fairings are a good step on the way to that being reality. Larger fuel tanks or procedural fuel tanks would be another step."},{"CreatedByName":"CG_Kerbin","CreatedById":117777,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T21:51:06Z","Content":"Find every thing they have added e.g Easter eggs"},{"CreatedByName":"WeirdCulture","CreatedById":76591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T22:48:13Z","Content":"wait... until the main mods are being updated too"},{"CreatedByName":"qromodynmc","CreatedById":87139,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T23:39:10Z","Content":"I\u0027ll make a rocket plane and test how realistic it will be."},{"CreatedByName":"Bev7787","CreatedById":136501,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T08:54:47Z","Content":"Art with fairing separation."},{"CreatedByName":"WWEdeadman","CreatedById":105591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T16:09:55Z","Content":"After the innitial first look at everything new, and testing how the new aerodynamics compare to FAR and old souposphere, by seeing what my shuttle handles like, I\u0027ll have a look at the Tutorials and Scenarios, just cause I haven\u0027t looked at them since I bought the game back in 0.22, and I wanna see what they did with it.
