They seem to be different from the original. During this process I attempted to land at the island runway, my plane impacted the ground a little too hard and it broke apart. And immediately the revert flight window pops up, stopping everything in its tracks, unlike the first game I don\u0027t get to follow the wreckage down the runway and see the subsequent explosions. I reloaded and tried again, and this time I did better but the game disagreed. This time I scraped my tail and my engine came off and WHAM! A revert flight window appeared and I watched as my helpless pilot in a plane with one working engine hurled down the runway\u00A0 out of control and then died. Why? I could have saved her? She didn\u0027t need to die. I have landed planes in KSP with far worse damage and was able to recover. I did this a few more times, but I couldn\u0027t get it and each time that window appeared with that little kerbal telling me \u201Cthat was ugly\u201D and I should go do some training.\u00A0 And I would watch that poor kerbal fly across the runway and explode. Eventually I couldn\u0027t do it anymore, the game beat me and now I\u0027m here.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022 style=\u0022line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\u0022\u003EI hope this can be fixed by someone telling me of a setting I can change or until it is fixed in an update.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022 style=\u0022line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\u0022\u003ETL;DR :\u00A0 The revert to flight window likes to taunt me with the lives of my pilots by appearing at the slightest hint of failure.
