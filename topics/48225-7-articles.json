It\u0027s considerably less grand when you don\u0027t get that message, because it was triggered days ago when you hyperedited your lander into orbit to test it. It would be nice if undoing a mission (by revert or by quickload) also undid all the achievements you gained from it. (Exceptions: The get-to-orbit-without-launching achievement, since it\u0027s designed to be done by cheating, and the Kerbal-killing achievements, since most people will undo after a major crash.) Alternately, just disable achievements after hyperedit is used; I don\u0027t mind getting achievements for something I do legitimately, even if I then undo it, but I don\u0027t like missing my chance because I cheated for testing purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFeature Request:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E Track achievements per save-file as well as overall\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s one thing to get to Jool in stock sandbox; it\u0027s quite another to do it in career with Remotetech, TAC Lifesupport, and Deadly Reentry.
