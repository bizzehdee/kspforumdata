A smart team might put together a functional space probe and send it to the Mun or another body to achieve their milestone, and possibly detect / see an anomaly if their orbit it low enough (assuming the MapSat mod is not allowed). While their probe might not be capable of landing to investigate, they could send an unmanned lander/rover (or manned!) to investigate for a nice bonus.

You can get the exact coordinates on the wiki and around here on the forums. Maybe release information about 1-2 of them each week, such as coordinates or rough local area on the given moon/planet. Give them a larger discovery incentive as a bonus milestone, like $100,000 or so for successfully landing on or within sight of an anomaly, possibly accomplishing this with another milestone for an extra kick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would be a great exercise during weeks 3/4 which would help your students familiarize themselves with timing their approach window and precision landing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pinbacker","CreatedById":60255,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-16T17:34:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ecould start introducing the easter eggs by suggesting there\u0027s a reward for finding the site of Apollo 11\u0027s landing.
