[@Nertea](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/83952-nertea/) recently updated CTT, if that make a difference.\n\u003E \n\nYep, for the vanilla KSPI-E experience it does need the CTT, but you can install the vanilla ETT to overwrite that dependence.\n\nBUT, if you would like to use my mod in addition to the ETT then you would actually need to delete the CTT.\n\nModded KSP would usually use the ModuleManager.TechTree file to load the tech tree, but the ETT uses a plugin called \u0022YongeTech\\_TechTreesPlugin\u0022 to load a different tree from a different file. But if you use my mod, I have to force the ETT to go back to using the ModuleManager.TechTree file. That\u0027s why you\u0027re seeing the spider-y tech tree, since the ETT actually includes every node from the CTT (but with very different values for cost, position, Parents, etc.), so you\u0027ll see a lot a duplicates. If you delete the CTT, the problem should disappear.\n\nIt\u0027s super confusing, but I haven\u0027t figured out the best way get duplicate nodes to work together besides informing the player to find and remove them![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif \u0022:confused:\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"doktorstick","CreatedById":173230,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-03T22:39:20Z","Content":"Howdy.
