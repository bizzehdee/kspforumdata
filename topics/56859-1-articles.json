In one of my earlier flights since .23, due to a staging issue I tried to deploy the chute by right-clicking, but I couldn\u0027t get the object\u0027s menu to open. Last night, I was flying a Rapier powered spaceplane, and after successfully transitioning from air-breathing to rocket and back. The staging showed I was out of fuel, but resources showed I still had a third of my fuel on-board and available for the stage. I couldn\u0027t right-click to open up my fuel tanks to diagnose where the fuel was, or even to transfer. I\u0027m careful not to move the mouse when right-clicking, as I read on a post yesterday that the program could be thinking you\u0027re changing the viewpoint.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-20T13:36:45Z\u0022 title=\u002212/20/2013 01:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Darkeldar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Smidge204","CreatedById":89677,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T14:07:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had some difficulties doing fuel transfers - had to right click two or three times to get things to respond.

As in not push it down and wait a moment and then release but just use a very rapid single tap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think its due to the new camera rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou see if you can get the popup open it will now remain open when you use the right button to rotate the camera.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI doubt it has anything to do with the speed of the click but more to do with moving the mouse after you have pressed it down and before you have let it go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is why i blame it on my laggy comp as i think my mouse must remain completely still for one full game frame and at times on my computer that can take a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be good to have a controllable deadzone in the settings so you could change the number of pixels the mouse needs to move to trigger rotation mode but iv no clue where we would have to write that to get someones attention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EId think its probably just a getting the hang of it thing and after a while you will be fine with it.

Before, when you right clicked on something and then hold down right click and move the mouse it would remove the right click context - which was annoying if you wanted to transfer fuel from one end of a large station to another - you would need both tanks in view in order to do this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the game has been designed so that if you right click and move the mouse to rotate your view it doesn\u0027t remove the context of anything that you right clicked on. So you can right click on a part, bring up the context menu, then right click and move the view round and then alt-right click on the next tank to show that tanks context menu in order to transfer fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also means that if you right click on a part and move the mouse (even just a single pixel) then it registers this as a view move and not a right click on a part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, if you have a large number of parts or a lagging computer don\u0027t hold the mouse in your hand but leave it on the desk and just lightly tap the right mouse button a couple of times while over the part - once you realise why its doing what its doing then you can eventually right click without any problems.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
