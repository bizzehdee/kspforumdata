You posted content with an expectation that as long as you didn\u0026#39;t break a rule no one would intentionally delete it. Maybe you or other users had some posts deleted by mods for RP or other violations; that\u0026#39;s fair. But now someone has decided to change the standard after the fact and delete EVERYTHING. As someone who spends a lot of time creating content for other users here, that gives me pause. Close Rocket Builders, come down hard on future roleplaying for the sake of harmony and give the poor mods a break, YES. But to delete posts that did NOT violate community guidelines or forum rules at the time they were posted--that\u0026#39;s unfair.

So you can write something in Markdown, like from a GitHub readme or wiki (or a [URL=\u0022http://markdownlivepreview.com/\u0022]Markdown preview site[/URL]), copy the final content (not the raw markdown text) and paste it into the editor window. It\u0026#39;s not always ideal, and a built in Markdown parser would be nice, but when you have complex content it can sometimes be much simpler to create it in something a bit more reliable than a forum text editor, then just copy it over.
