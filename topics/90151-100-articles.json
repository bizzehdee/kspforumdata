Now I have all my textures (no more black textures), and it actually freed up 1GB of RAM usage. Did the same thing with the spaces, and ATM did a hell of a job reducing these textures. So it wasn\u0027t a bad idea in my part, and in fact now allows me to enjoy the game, but I have a lot of experience editing every aspect of modding for this game that I\u0027ve probably spent 3x more time editing configs/creating custom textures than actually playing. Hell I\u0027ve been working on getting this install working for 4 days because my world was disappearing when entering the launchpad (turned out to be Romfarer causing it somehow).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Edit* I want to clarify that I understand why the switch was made. More data and compression is available via DDS, as well as a lower memory footprint. However, at this point, it is not nearly as optimized as it will be in future versions. It\u0027s a step in the right direction, but personally I can attest that older versions of the game could run with a lower memory footprint with many more parts/textures loaded than what is available now, and that\u0027s really all I care about in this game. If I could, I\u0027d retrofit all current features to 0.23.5, I could fit 4 GB of mods in there and only use 2.3 Gb RAM on startup (intense ATM\u0027ing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Edit 2* Now been trying to find out why KSC-Switcher that came with C-KAN didn\u0027t work, updated to latest, allows me to choose launch location, but slows framerate to a snails pace when either on the launchpad or in the tracking center. For now I\u0027m just going to be launching from Cape Canaveral, unless my latest change (set to launch from French Guiana site), not sure if it\u0027ll keep my launch location there or not but I know it\u0027s KSC-Switcher having a conflict with something because I had no framerate issues until I tried to update it. /sigh\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Edit 3* Removed HotRockets from the GameData folder, as I think that was the last mod I added (along with the updated KSC-Switcher) when I got the performance drops in tracking station and on a launch. I also had a handful of CIT mods (mod maker abandoned it in .90) from the get-go that worked, but removed those as well just in case, so it\u0027s one of those two I believe. That or updating KSC-Switcher after you have launched at least one rocket causes a permanent save bug. Either way, hopefully this helps someone in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-11T20:27:33Z\u0022 title=\u002209/11/2015 08:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by shoe7ess\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMaking edits to help others who may have the same issue in the future.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-11T22:20:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rabada\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rabada\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYeah Smoke FX causes stuttering for me and I\u0027m running an overclocked 5960X.\u003Cp\u003ESmoke Screen has button for the toolbar mod.
