Essentially, all objects are emitters and absorbers of this radiation. As we absorb this radiation our atoms speed up(Heat). As you emit it your atoms lose heat energy. Good absorbers are good emitters. The only way this type of radiation can give you cancer is if the object emitting it on you is VERY, VERY, VEEERRYY hot, hotter than the sun(Hotter objects emit higher frequency electromagnetic radiation, AKA x-rays and gamma rays, but this doesn\\\u0027t happen normally) This means two things in space:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. You don\\\u0027t need a medium to transfer heat, meaning the sun can heat you up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. You can cool down in space without anything to absorb the energy from you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. White is the best color to wear, because it is the worst absorber and emitter, meaning you cool down slowly and heat up slowly, staying at around the same temperature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe radiation you are thinking of is the particles emitted by radioactivity. These particles typically are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Alpha particles, which consist of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, and move at 50% the speed of light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Beta particles, which consist of something similar to electrons, and move at ~75% C\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Gamma rays, which are very high energy electromagnetic waves(not usually emitted by substances) traveling at C.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis can have adverse effects on DNA, especially gamma rays, giving you cancer if exposed to too much.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johno","CreatedById":1491,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-11T08:32:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis confusion is part of the reason people think mobile phones can give you cancer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECoincidentally, it MAY also be possible to get cancer from microwaves; but so far we are yet to turn up any clear evidence of a link.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"semininja","CreatedById":3837,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-11T08:41:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EErm, the radiation from cell phones could have the potential to cause cancer, from what I\\\u0027ve read.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Misterspork","CreatedById":9507,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-11T08:47:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022semininja\u0022 data-cite=\u0022semininja\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EErm, the radiation from cell phones could have the potential to cause cancer, from what I\\\u0027ve read.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\\\u0027t think radio waves would be able to give you cancer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mincespy","CreatedById":9003,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-11T08:48:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022semininja\u0022 data-cite=\u0022semininja\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EErm, the radiation from cell phones could have the potential to cause cancer, from what I\\\u0027ve read.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\\\u0027s only heavy mobile use.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"semininja","CreatedById":3837,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-11T08:48:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Misterspork\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Misterspork\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\\\u0027t think radio waves would be able to give you cancer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere have been studies that might disagree with you.

The first is as in \u0027Thermal Radiation\u0027. All bodies emit radiation in the form of photons of light at all times. The amount of radiation emitted, and the wavelength of the photons, varies based on the temperature of the body. The stephan boltzman law of blackbody radiation gives:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP/A = sigma * T^4 for a black body. A black body is simply a perfect emitter of radiation. Most objects are not black bodies, and so there is an extra constant in front called Emmisivity represented by Epsilon. Emissivity varies between 0, for a perfect reflector, and 1, for a perfect black body radiator. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe wavelength of light emitted is a continuum, however it has a peak at lambda = b/T where b is the constant 2.9*10^-3K m (Kelvin Meters). This gives a peak wavelength of around 10 micrometers for a body radiating at room temperature. This is in the infrared and not in the visible spectrum (~0.4-0.8 micrometers is visible) which explains why you do not consantly see light emitting from everyday objects. However, if you heat something up, the wavelength will drop into the visible. This is where the expressions \u0027Red hot\u0027 \u0027White hot\u0027 \u0027Blue hot\u0027 come from. Each of these simply means the peak of the radiation is at that portion of the visible spectrum. White hot implies the peak is right in the middle of the visible, so you see all the visible wavelengths combined into white. Blue is even hotter, as now most of the radiation is at the very low wavelengths.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, you might ask, if all materials are constantly emitting radiation, why don\\\u0027t they simply shed all of their energy and cool down to absolute zero? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood question. This is because \u003Cem\u003Eeverything else\u003C/em\u003E is also emitting radiation. For an environment in equilibrium, they are all emitting the same radiation. Each of the bodies then absorbs the radiation the others emit, keeping everything at a constant temperature. However, if there is a temperature differential between two radiating objects, there is a net energy transfer. To find the rate of energy transfer, you simply take the difference between the energy input, and the energy output.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPower/area in = epsilon * sigma * T\u003Csub\u003Esurroundings\u003C/sub\u003E\u003Csup\u003E4\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPower/area out = epsilon * sigma * T\u003Csub\u003Eobject\u003C/sub\u003E\u003Csup\u003E4\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENet power/area = epsilon * sigma * (T\u003Csub\u003Esurroundings\u003C/sub\u003E\u003Csup\u003E4\u003C/sup\u003E - T\u003Csub\u003Eobject\u003C/sub\u003E\u003Csup\u003E4\u003C/sup\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe temperature quoted for space, 3K = -270C, is given by the radiation temperature of the cosmic microwave background. It\\\u0027s a microwave background because the wavelength is rather large, owing to the low temperature. Wavelengths are simply a form of electromagnetic radiation that has a low energy and hence a relatively long wavelength, 1mm-1m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if you are currently being illuminated by a star, the local temperature will be much higher because the radiation from the star is clearly much more energetic then the microwave background. This is why keeping cool is often more of a problem then keeping warm; the energy in from the star is much more then the energy that you radiate out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving dealt with thermal radiation, let us move on to the other sense that the word is used. This is as in \u0027ionizing radiation\u0027. This is the sort of radiation that can cause cancer. The term \u0027Ionizing\u0027 simply means that the radiation has enough energy to ionize an atom, which means to knock an electron off the atom. Electrons are bound to atoms by electric fields from the opposite charge of the electron and the positive nucleus of an atom. The binding energy varies between atoms, depending on which electron you are looking at, and how big the nucleus is. Electrons in higher shells (further out) tend to be more weakly bound then those closer in, as would be expected. However, a good average value for the binding energy of the outermost electron in atoms is -10eV. This means you require 10eV of energy to knock that electron out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, 10eV (electron volts) of energy is not very much, that is 1.6*10^-18 Joules or 4.5 * 10^-25 kilowatt hours, to quote some units you may be familiar with. However, the important thing here comes from quantum mechanics. Electrons will only absorb energy in specific bits called quanta, and that quanta must be large enough on its own to knock the electron out. You cannot keep shooting less energy quanta of light (called photons) at the electron until you have given it enough energy to leave, they simply wont eb absorbed and the electron will carry on. You must fire a photon that has an energy greater then 10eV to knock that electron off. The energy of a photon of light is given by its wavelength through the relationship hc/lambda where h is plancks constant, 6.6 x 10^-34 m^2 kg/ s, c is the speed of light in a vacuum, 3 * 10^8 m/s, and lambda is the wavelength. This gives a wavelength of around 120nm to ionize atoms. This is called ultraviolet radiation, which is why it is recommended you do not use tanning beds, and wear sunscreen, as both the Sun and tanning beds emit UV radiation. Recall microwave radiation, such as used in cell phones, has a wavelength of above 1mm, and thus is far, far below the energy that can ionize atoms. However, it does heat water up as you see in a microwave, and since your brain is mostly water, shooting microwaves at it all day is likely not particularly great for it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, ultraviolet radiation only has enough energy to ionize a single atom, which isnt so bad. Higher energy forms of radiation, such as x-rays or gamma rays, can ionize many more atoms before their energy is used up, making them more dangerous. Fortunately, they also tend to be much rarer. While ultraviolet can be produced through black body radiation by objects at a few thousand degrees, it would take an object sitting at millions of degrees Kelvin to emit Xrays such as those seen in medical equipment. Fortunately, such objects are extremely rare, and backgrounds like these are not a problem. Practically, X-rays in diagonostic equipment are produced by another process. This is where an electron is accelerated very quickly at a target material. When the electron hits the target and slows down, the slowing down causes an emission of Bremstrahlung radiation, which simply means \u0027Braking radiation\u0027 in german. This radiation is high energy, and so is called X-rays. These are used as the higher energy radiation, the further it can penetrate through objects. Therefore, X-rays can penetrate through you, but less so through bones. This gives the contrast that you see on medical X-rays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGamma rays, some of the highest energy electromagnetic radiation, are produced by nuclear processes. They are emitted when the nuceleons (protons and neutrons) in the nucleus of an atom rearrange themselves following the emission of some other sort of radiation such as alpha or beta particles. This energy is very high energy because the energy differences inside the nucleus of the atom are very high. Therefore, gammas rays are very penetrating (can only be stopped by meters of lead), and have the potential to ionize many, many atoms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other two types of radiation I just mentioned, alpha and beta particles, are also emitted in nuclear processes. Alpha particles are a helium 4 nucleus, with 2 protons and 2 neutrons, emitted from an atom with an energy of around 5MeV (varies by decay). These particles are relatively large, and charges, so they interact readily with matter. This makes them easy to absorb, and they can be stopped by a thin absorber such as a thin sheet of plastic. Beta particles are electrons that are emitted in nuclear process with energies ranging from a few 100 keV to several MeV. They are intermediatly penetrating, to stop them you need a thick sheet of plastic or a thin sheet of aluminum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most important thing to realize about these sources of nuclear radiation is that they emit isotropically in all directions. That means that as you move away, the radiation intensity drops as 1/R^2. If you are 10m away, you get 100x less radiation then if you are 1m away. So, moral of the story, the best protection is distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe concern about ionizing radiation in generl is DNA mutation, and interference with other cellular process. If you knock an electron off of an atom in a DNA molecule, you will disrupt the bond, possibly causing one of the DNA bases to be removed, introducing a mutation. Other process can also be interfered with when certain key bonds are broken down, which is why in general ionization radiation is not a good thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I hope that none of you read this, as you probably will have gotten bored, fallen asleep at your desk, and then gotten brain damage as your head fell to impact your desk, and I would not want that on my conscience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technoguy33","CreatedById":8845,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-12T04:05:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf your statement is true, how do you explain cosmonauts staying aboard Mir for over a year at a time?
