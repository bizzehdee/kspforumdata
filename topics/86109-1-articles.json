You lose net thrust to cosine losses, but it is a way to tow an asteroid without fooling the fizzicks engine.

You also need to line up perfectly to the asteroid\u0027s center of mass, and use at least three tow lines spaced out relatively equally both on your ship and on the asteroid, so that you have a multi-point attachment. But after you\u0027ve got the setup right, you have to move \u003Cstrong\u003Eslow\u003C/strong\u003E. Slowly, very slowly, you have to pull the wires to get them taut. Then gently increase acceleration until you\u0027re going forward. If you start bouncing, your best bet is starting over - killing velocity, stopping rotation of the asteroid, and trying again. To turn, you need to remember that your ship and the asteroid are now one ship, in principle. The thrust of your engines - constant thrust, otherwise you start bouncing - is the \u0022gravity\u0022 that keeps the connection stable. Your ship is actually the \u0022nose\u0022 of the ship-asteroid contraption. So to turn the whole thing around, you need to \u003Cstrong\u003Estrafe\u003C/strong\u003E, with RCS, and then counter-strafe when you\u0027re at the needed angle. Slowly, again, because oscillations on KAS cables are near-impossible to stop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut ultimately, it\u0027s doable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GreatPlainsDrifter","CreatedById":124548,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-08T01:41:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help, I\u0027ll have to make my designs a little less compact.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
