So, here goes.\n\nStruts drag quite severely. Certainly, long, trusslike struts *would* drag quite severely. However, very short struts, acting more like spot-welds, still drag quite severely.\n\nBy \u0022severely\u0022, I mean that they can easily make-or-break whether something goes supersonic. Following is an imgur album with 3 images, each with the same test rocket except for how many struts are present. It\u0027s a simple demonstration with the kind of spot-weld-esque struts that one might use to stiffen a bendy joint (not necessary for strength here, but this is merely a test case.) Note the maximum speed reached by the time the SRB burns out.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Optimistically, I tried removing all the struts from one of my SSTO attempts which just couldn\u0027t break the sound barrier. Here\u0027s how it loads:\n\n![O4Iuu0M.gif](http://i.imgur.com/O4Iuu0M.gif)\n\nHere\u0027s how it looks when I fire up the engines:\n\n![nQ6gxBpl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/nQ6gxBpl.jpg)\n\n------------\n\nSo, how could this be fixed? After all, long struts probably *should* induce a lot of drag, especially if they\u0027re not parallel to the direction of motion.\n\n- Perhaps joints could be made globally stiff. This is pretty anti-Kerbal and renders struts totally obsolete.\n\n- Perhaps there could be an interface in the VAB/SPH to mark specific joints or specific parts to be extra-rigid at a penalty of weight and cost.\n\n- Perhaps there could be a new type of strut with very short maximum length and no drag. Name it a \u0022Spot-weld\u0022.\n\n- Perhaps it would be enough for struts to drag based on their length, although length \u0026 direction would be best. Maybe even there would be a minimum length below which struts would be dragless, acting under the assumption it\u0027s more for the purpose of \u0022fusing\u0022 two parts into one.\n\n- Perhaps struts, as well as other parts in general, could be detected for whether they\u0027re wholly inside some other part. I\u0027m guessing this is infeasible for performance reasons."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T09:21:29Z","Content":"Feel free to edit the strut drag values ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E {\n\u003E  url = Squad/Parts/CompoundParts/strutConnector/strutConnector/strutConnector\n\u003E \n\u003E  DRAG\\_CUBE\n\u003E \n\u003E  {\n\u003E \n\u003E  cube = Default, 0.05419693,0.532624,1.284088, 0.0529771,0.5661769,1.284088, 0.06662689,0.6387991,0.7649611, 0.06662689,0.5860444,0.8299828, 0.1433081,0.7462295,0.1586942, 0.1433081,0.7462369,0.1574544, -0.5322,0.3045477,0.0004060492, 1.295171,0.7753254,0.1161486\n\u003E \n\u003E  }\n\u003E \n\u003E }"}]}
