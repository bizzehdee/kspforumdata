So, here goes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStruts drag quite severely. Certainly, long, trusslike struts \u003Cem\u003Ewould\u003C/em\u003E drag quite severely. However, very short struts, acting more like spot-welds, still drag quite severely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy \u0022severely\u0022, I mean that they can easily make-or-break whether something goes supersonic. Following is an imgur album with 3 images, each with the same test rocket except for how many struts are present. It\u0027s a simple demonstration with the kind of spot-weld-esque struts that one might use to stiffen a bendy joint (not necessary for strength here, but this is merely a test case.) Note the maximum speed reached by the time the SRB burns out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/zqJ9G\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled. View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStrut drag is a real downer because for many of the larger or more aesthetically creative aircraft designs possible, struts are (presently) critical to make them hold their shape. Optimistically, I tried removing all the struts from one of my SSTO attempts which just couldn\u0027t break the sound barrier.

After all, long struts probably \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E induce a lot of drag, especially if they\u0027re not parallel to the direction of motion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Perhaps joints could be made globally stiff. This is pretty anti-Kerbal and renders struts totally obsolete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Perhaps there could be an interface in the VAB/SPH to mark specific joints or specific parts to be extra-rigid at a penalty of weight and cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Perhaps there could be a new type of strut with very short maximum length and no drag. Name it a \u0022Spot-weld\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Perhaps it would be enough for struts to drag based on their length, although length \u0026amp; direction would be best. Maybe even there would be a minimum length below which struts would be dragless, acting under the assumption it\u0027s more for the purpose of \u0022fusing\u0022 two parts into one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Perhaps struts, as well as other parts in general, could be detected for whether they\u0027re wholly inside some other part. I\u0027m guessing this is infeasible for performance reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T09:21:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to edit the strut drag values \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PartDatabase.cfg\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PartDatabase.cfg\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E{\u003Cp\u003E url = Squad/Parts/CompoundParts/strutConnector/strutConnector/strutConnector\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E DRAG_CUBE\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E {\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E cube = Default, 0.05419693,0.532624,1.284088, 0.0529771,0.5661769,1.284088, 0.06662689,0.6387991,0.7649611, 0.06662689,0.5860444,0.8299828, 0.1433081,0.7462295,0.1586942, 0.1433081,0.7462369,0.1574544, -0.5322,0.3045477,0.0004060492, 1.295171,0.7753254,0.1161486\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E }\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E}\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"}]}
