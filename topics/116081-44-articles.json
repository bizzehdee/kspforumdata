I missed this place. The thing is, I can\u0027t play KSP anymore because of RAM stuff. I\u0027m waiting for 1.1, for now I\u0027m obsessed with From The Depths.

I have seen badassery and tomfoolery, but never such awesomeness like this! I like the M7, I guess I\u0027ll partly copy your design for my Eve lander now, as I\u0027ve copied your design for my Mun science harvester thingy that crash-landed at 80 m/s multiple times, with Bob being nearly made to jam!
