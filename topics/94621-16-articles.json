I already provide tools that allow you to quickly match thickness (and other parameters) to those of a parent, making modular wing assembly pretty easy and fast. Doing things like forcing the upper thickness limit from the parent tip thickness, though, I feel, would be potentially problematic for many designs. It\u0027s logical when you attach your next wing to the tip cross section of another wing. But what if you\u0027re adding a perpendicular tail? Or small protrusion with an internal fuel tank, or an aerodynamic drop tank? The code has no way to know the difference, and forcing some changes to thickness setup would be pretty irritating to users in the latter cases.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll look into it. Initially edges were using a multiplier dependent on the thickness of the wing to make them proportional, but that approach was extremely inconvenient when you wanted to match multiple wing segments and control surfaces together, since edge length jumped all over the place with unsightly distortion and non-obvious origin. I feel that, just as with thickness, making the user set an absolute width like 0.48m makes things look nice and makes editing more simple. I\u0027d like to come up with a way to dynamically change field limits first, though - I don\u0027t want to allow two meter long trailing edge on a wing that is eight centimeters thick, just like I don\u0027t want to allow sixteen meter offset of the wing tip for a wing that is just fifty centimeters wide, and so on. Once that is in place, I can allow higher limits for bigger wings without enabling silly stuff with smaller wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not possible to keep edges nice-looking at an arbitrary width too far beyond 0.24-1m so I can\u0027t do that. The purpose of the flat section of a control surface is to allow the edge to keep vertical component of texture coords completely fixed by taking most width away from edge geometry. Edge texture coordinates are very complex and unique on most vertices, making it an extreme hassle to remap them procedurally anywhere but on the U axis. Also, take a look at the edge texture - it\u0027s never supposed to be tiled vertically, so surface-like tiling is out of the question even if I write some kilometer long algorithm that can remap hundreds of vertices on arbitrary edge models. So yeah, split between flat section and trailing sections on control surfaces is a necessary evil and there to stay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example from real life knowledge and experience I would always want my transport aircraft wing root chord at roughly 14% t/c, tip at 11%. If we have non-dimensional settings, no matter how I tweak the plan form geometries, my wing t/c is always on the desired values. But I guess we don\u0027t have such a need in the game yet as FAR don\u0027t really simulate the effect of t/c that much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame goes root install angle and wing twists, if that can be done it would be awesome but not likely necessary for now, from both modding difficulty and simulation accuracy point of view.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bac9","CreatedById":57757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-27T19:25:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EVersion 0.30\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rcdQOO2.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rcdQOO2l.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rcdQOO2l.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://bitbucket.org/bac9/b9_aerospace_plugins/downloads\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/r5ws7xH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022r5ws7xH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/515/B9%20Aerospace%20Procedural%20Parts\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/AXkQOlc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022AXkQOlc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EShape match now calculates tip width relative to proportions of parent wing part (credit for the solution goes to ferram4)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EShape match now calculates tip offset which in combination with automatic tip width option allows you to perfectly match sweep angles between wing pieces.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESplit the shape match button into three separately invoked options - sweep match, width match and edge match.
