But that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not the point I want to make). But then I got to thinking \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CHang on. Is it really bad? It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s completely and utterly unrealistic, certainly. But is it \u003Cem\u003Ebad\u003C/em\u003E? Those are two different things.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recently installed FAR and I must admit, it was nice to have a more realistic model to play around with. It also added new challenges and eased some old sores. But then two or so days ago I uninstalled it temporarily to make a craft for someone who plays stock and a realization occurred to me:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven though the stock aerodynamics model is completely and utterly unrealistic, it is FUN for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR is great, massive kudos to Ferram for making it, but it prohibits many things. One of the main things it stops you from doing is launching very wide space station modules in one go (the so-called pancake rockets). Now, seeing as building space stations on site is not a thing (yet? Wink wink nudge nudge Squad? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E ) pretty much the only thing to do to make a space station with big modules (like an asteroid station) is to build the modules in the VAB and launch them in one go. The stock dynamics model allows that, FAR (or any other realistic model) would not. Also, the stock model allows for awesome, realistically impossible and hilarious things to be done with spaceplanes and parachutes as I discovered yesterday. The \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Ctradeoff\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 you could say is the fact that stock requires more lift surfaces and dV to get through atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, I actually like both stock and FAR. One is realistic, the other presents its own unique problems and more importantly, can be totally hilarious at times. And to me KSP is still a game and a game is about having \u003Cem\u003Efun\u003C/em\u003E. I foresee myself switching between FAR and stock quite a bit in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn conclusion: How bad is the aerodynamics model in KSP?

One of the main things it stops you from doing is launching very wide space station modules in one go (the so-called pancake rockets). Now, seeing as building space stations on site is not a thing (yet?

The stock dynamics model allows that, FAR (or any other realistic model) would not. Also, the stock model allows for awesome, realistically impossible and hilarious things to be done with spaceplanes and parachutes as I discovered yesterday.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel those hilarious weird things might be best reserved for the dev menu, or possibly a mod that allows for these kinds of things.
