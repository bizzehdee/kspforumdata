First of all, there\u0027s two different antennae - the omnidirectional antennas, and the more powerful dish antennas. There isn\u0027t an omni that can reach from Kerbin to Duna, so if that is all you have when you\u0027re putting craft up there you\u0027re boned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe satellite dishes need to be opened, and you need to target them.

I don\u0027t recall if it can reach to Minmus, it definitely can\u0027t talk to Duna on its own. If you\u0027re avoiding effort, the simplest way to solve this is with a small relay craft with both an omni and a large dish that\u0027s parked near KSC. The omni talks to KSC, the satellite dish should be aimed at your craft, or the body it\u0027s orbiting around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing to remember with relaytech is that it works on line of sight. If you only have one craft on Duna then it will only work if it can see the craft on Kerbin. If you\u0027ve only got one satellite dish near KSC, then the window where they can both see each other is pretty small indeed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-07T16:33:39Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2013 04:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by stibbons\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"F1refly","CreatedById":67024,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-07T17:23:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, that\u0027s helped a lot\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
