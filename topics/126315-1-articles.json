They\u0026#39;re not structures, and they\u0026#39;re never in storms earthquakes or large waves. If they had no way to make rockets as rigid as they are, they would bend into an L as soon as the engines fired. Skyscrapers and other tall structures are made to bend because it\u0026#39;s easier and cheaper to take the path of least resistance and let it have a little bend, rather than just pour a foundation 3 times as big and add twice as much structural rigidity. Rockets are facing millions of pounds of force, and the path of least resistance has to be up, and straight. If they weren\u0026#39;t as rigid as possible, the slightest drift off course would bend it in half. Look at the footage from The Martian when the rocket failed. How far did it drift off course before it broke apart? The rocket has to withstand all of that force so that it goes into pushing the rocket [I]up[/I], not [I]sideways[/I]\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen you have that much force under a rocket, trying to lift so much weight, the path of least resistance, being that it bends over, really[I] is[/I] the least resistance.

It\u0026#39;s so much easier for the rocket to just bend over and break off than for it to fly lift all that weight straight up. When my rocket would bend, and finally break, the top would fall away and the rest of the rocket flew up further, [I]perfectly straight[/I]. It shed that weight, and was free to fly perfectly fine. As soon as the problem was solved by the bending section of the rocket breaking off, the path of least resistance became for the rocket to fly up, because the rest of the rocket was so rigid.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-25T16:27:49Z\u0022 title=\u002211/25/2015 04:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SlabGizor117\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"A_name","CreatedById":134040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T18:19:37Z","Content":"\nITT: A bunch of people saying OP is designing and/or flying his rocket wrong, but not bothering to explain WHY or what would be the \u0022CORRECT\u0022 way to do it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nJust install KJR.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-25T18:29:56Z\u0022 title=\u002211/25/2015 06:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by A_name\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
