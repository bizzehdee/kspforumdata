The timing of the launch had been nearly perfect, and so rendezvous with Kelgee took place after less than half an orbit. The Visiting Vehicle Officer, Maclie, radioed up to inform Tetris she would need to live up to her name if they were to dock at the station. (Whatever that meant.) The only other standard-sized docking port at Kelgee that provided enough space for the Ti-3 to dock just so happened to be malfunctioning, and had a useless science pod stuck to it. They could possibly dock to the Fluoride life support module, but they\u0027d need to go in at an angle if the nose of the ship was to clear the recently docked Oxygen 3.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEasy decision, really, as the only other options involved chains and tape and hoping the two craft would stick together.

Macfred decided enough was enough, and offered to fix the docking port issue before they took the Sulphur 3 and left for Jool. He had a wrench, and he was going to use it. First target was the docking port at the end of the port docking arm. Nothing appeared to be wrong with it from the inside, but it simply refused to unlatch. Same on the outside, it just refused to undock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo with spacewrench in hand he EVA\u0027d out to remove the science pod by force. He first attempted to wrench the docking ports apart, producing the expected result - nothing. He then set out to disassemble the science pod piece by piece. The smaller bits he stuck in his inventory or transferred to a nearby storage area. The small docking port was attached to the arm itself. The larger ones, such as the Science Jr itself, he gave a good shove. Sure, they\u0027d become space debris, but the odds of them ever hitting something were slim.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160528-ksp0293-ti3.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022590\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160528-ksp0293-ti3.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately things didn\u0027t go exactly according to plan. When Macfred pulled the \u0022broken\u0022 docking port free and attached it to another spot on the arm, it was behaving as though it was still attached. The magnetic docking forces were causing the docking arm, and the entire station, to collapse in upon themselves. Strange. Macfred was able to \u0022undock\u0022 the two ports successfully before they turned Kelgee Station into an unplanned black hole.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately the \u0022undocking\u0022 ripped the relocated port free from the arm and sent it speeding towards the solar arrays - which it narrowly\u00A0missed.

This one was a bit trickier, as he first had to transfer its contents to the adjacent docking node. He then had to remove the many pieces that were attached to it and store those as well. Once everything was stripped clear he was able to pull the large module free and shove it into the great unknown.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore space debris for somebody to clean up later.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfterwards he made his way to the Sulphur 3, where the next task was to transfer six of the RTGs collected from the M\u00FCn onto the shuttle.

Macfred brought the Sulphur 3 in to dock on one of the refueler docking ports, grabbed his space wrench and jumped out, eager to get this payload secured.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene, who had just been lectured by The Boss about excessive tampering with the timeline (which The Boss implied might lead to further destabilization of... something), instructed Macfred to remove the strut anchors from the cubic struts and attach them directly to the fuel tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160528-ksp0386-s3.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160528-ksp0386-s3.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160528-ksp0398-s3.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160528-ksp0398-s3.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWorked like a charm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mounting brackets for the K-3 itself were off-center from the payload, but as the anchor points were being reattached directly to the tanks, Macfred decided they didn\u0027t really need to redock the tug. He strutted it up, returned to the S-3, and then plotted up the course so they could move to the Potassium 2 stack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe strutting of the K-2 was mostly unremarkable, though they did have to wait in a higher orbit for almost half a day until it caught up to them. The only open docking port for the Sulphur 3 was the port at the very end of the tug, meaning Macfred had to navigate his way around the eight, somewhat radioactive engines to get to the actual payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160528-ksp0407-s3.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160528-ksp0407-s3.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160528-ksp0416-s3.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160528-ksp0416-s3.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce again the strut anchors were moved to the main fuel tank of the K-2, while the armatures built into the payload for holding the anchors were left as-is. This (seems to have) worked perfectly.Once the payloads were all safely strutted together and strutted to the K-2, they moved on to their home for the next several years: the K-1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe numbers were close, and the fuel margin tight, but a quick check confirmed what the ground team had suggested - The Potassium 1 had enough extra payload capacity to allow them to take the Sulphur 3 with them to Jool. Sure, it was just another shuttle, but having it along would not only allow them to move around the system before landing on Laythe, but also give them just that much more living space for the trip out.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the forward docking port was occupied by the docking adapter (to be used by the K-1 once the station and LDAV payload were detached), the S-3 would need to be inserted between the Silicon Station and the Sulphur LDAV. Macfred docked up to the Station first, so Gletrix and Thomlock could move into the LDAV and the station\u0027s cockpits. (No reason to do this remotely when they could do it with kerbals.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160528-ksp0435-k1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160528-ksp0435-k1.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160528-ksp0446-k1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022589\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160528-ksp0446-k1.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith that move done and the Sulphur 3 bedded down for the next three years, all that was left was strutting the whole mess together. The Sulphur 3 was strutted around, as it was lacking in anchors (though more were packed in the station\u0027s cargo trunks, should they actually need them).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160528-ksp0456-k1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022600\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160528-ksp0456-k1.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomlock and Gletrix had drifted off to opposite ends of the ship, each claiming one of the shuttle cabins as their own. Macfred decided to take a bunk in the Sulphur 3, and figured Agake would find a corner of the station\u0027s science lab to crawl into a sleep each night. She was already busy working on some random experiments anyway, no doubt hoping to eek out a few magic science points before the transfer windows arrived.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey kid.

Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E-shaped hole atop one of the shuttles, bringing it online once more. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160528-ksp0633-ti4.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022588\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160528-ksp0633-ti4.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey spent the next several days cleaning up the station and preparing it for use. Near as they could tell no crews had spent any considerable time at the station in the past. It was almost entirely devoid of food and other supplies, and whatever water they had left aboard had frozen solid and destroyed its containers. They thought it unlikely the station was intended to be a short stop-over, as it had housing and bunks for anywhere from 12 to 24 kerbals. More likely that whoever had built the station had simply never made a supply run.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven the bunks themselves were seemingly unused, the majority of them still sealed in what must have been their factory wrappings. One of the shuttles had seemingly spent some time away from the station, having used an unremarkable bit of fuel. The shuttles were also a bit of an enigma, each with enough \u2206v to reach Duna or Eve, or travel to and from the M\u00FCn without refueling. Almost as capable as their Sulphur shuttles, excluding the lack of a rear docking port.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheir tasks at Transfer One seemingly complete, Gene suggested they check out another Thing on their way to Kelgee. They were certain this Things was yet another transfer station. It had told them as much when they established a telemetry link, but as of yet no crews had visited it. If they left soon, this new Thing would be in the perfect position for them to drop in.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd so they did. Tetris was a bit confused by the shuttles, lacking entirely in direct pilot input. Instead all operations had to be dialed in the craft\u0027s flight computer. Everything aside from docking, of course, which most suggested was beyond the capabilities of the simple, pre-kOS onboard flight computers. Rondous helped her plot out their course for the new Thing and then opted to take a nap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160528-ksp0643-ti4.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160528-ksp0643-ti4.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey arrived nearly half an orbit later, with their target coming into view just as the sun slipped neared the limb of Kerbin. From what Rondous could see of the station it was similar in construction to both Kelgee and one of the stations orbiting the M\u00FCn, perhaps built by the same spacefarers. The sun slipped out of view just as they came in to dock, as was only fitting and proper, so their final approach was conducted using the shuttle\u0027s forward spotlights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe following morning (18 minutes later) they had a good, clear view of the exterior of the station. By then they had gone over as much of the inside as they could access, discovering the station was once called \u0022KTS 3.0.1 Station One\u0022, and was some 39 years old. The core of the station was to serve as a long docking bay, where up to four large shuttles and one very large spaceship could dock and freely transfer crews and cargo. Much like Transfer One the station appeared to have been mostly unused, though the docked shuttle was missing a good bit of fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160528-ksp0644-ti4.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160528-ksp0644-ti4.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160528-ksp0645-ti4.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160528-ksp0645-ti4.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA quick inspection of the docked shuttle also revealed something they probably should\u0027ve known better than to take, but did anyway: More RTGs. To make up for his \u0022lost\u0022 one, Rondous had Steve EVA to the business end of the docked shuttle to unlatch its two wonderfully warm power sources. These were transferred to the outer hull of their borrowed shuttle, for future attachment to whatever needed them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160528-ksp0647-ti4.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022588\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160528-ksp0647-ti4.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was when Steve noticed some odd struts attached to the rear of their shuttle. He was fairly certain they hadn\u0027t been there when they left Transfer One, and couldn\u0027t see much of a use in leaving them attached to the rear of the shuttle. So, without consulting with Rondous or anyone, he just trimmed them off and chucked them into space.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s a bit of space debris between friends?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160528-ksp0653-ti4.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160528-ksp0653-ti4.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160528-ksp0657-ti4.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022588\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160528-ksp0657-ti4.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith no other obviously interesting or useful things to be found at this old station, Rondous and crew set out for Kelgee. It was a simple transfer up to the station, tough it took them at least two orbits to rendezvous, and they had their fair share of open docking ports to chose from. (These small shuttles thankfully don\u0027t need to account for wing clearance when docking.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBarbara was eager to get to work on the handful of science experiments the interns had sent up with them (including some strange purple mixture they had called \u0022explodium exorem\u0022), and Rondous wanted to take a closer look at this docking port issue Macfred and others had been complaining about.
