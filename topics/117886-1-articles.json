Recommended recipes from NASA: lettuce wraps with chicken or chiken teriyaki.  \n  \nAnyone has a better recipe to use lettuce to use in space?  \n  \nEdit:  \nAlso, they are doing some final checks on Robonaut, and is going to have it doing its first IVA in a few weeks.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-07T19:47:41Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2015 07:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RainDreamer**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T18:47:01Z","Content":"Shouldn\u0027t they eat it solo?\n\nIt makes no sense to eat it combined with other rehydrated halffoods.

It makes the whole meal more interesting.\n\nThe space agencies really pull out all the stops when it comes to sending their astronauts and cosmonauts good food (partly because of the problem with taste), but there\u0027s serious limitations to bringing up stuff like fresh lettuce. Food must be packaged a month in advance and must be of minimum weight and volume. Any such food is a long way removed from \u0022fresh\u0022, even if it\u0027s preserved and prepared with exceptional care.\n\nFor that reason alone, you can bet the crew is excited. It\u0027s not about the taste - it\u0027s about having something immediately fresh in a way that some of them may not have had the opportunity to have in over 4 months straight."}]}
