While it is possible to fly a single-prop plane in KSP it\u0027s way more fun to have the torque countered by a second prop (or have multiple pairs of props). The propellers can be on the same axis, or you can have the symmetrically to the left and right of your plane, both methods work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne simple way to get counter-rotating props on a single axis is to have a single, un-powered servo or rotor (to act as a bearing) attached to the fuselage and a powered rotor attached to that un-powered one. Then attach the blades to the base (one direction) and the front (other direction) of the powered rotor. When the rotor is powered up, the two sets of blades will spin in opposite directions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pitching down is probably because you have designed your your plane to be aerodynamically stable (tending to fly nose forward), with the center of mass in front of the center of lift. Being pulled down (by gravity) at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E and pushed up (by the lift-forces) at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECOL\u003C/abbr\u003E, this means that there is a net torque that will pitch the nose of the plane down. AFAIK you\u0027ll just have to correct for that with control inputs. You can either have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E set this input, trim the plane with the manual trim, or correct it manually. (And, yes, this is also an effect that real life pilots need to deal with.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
