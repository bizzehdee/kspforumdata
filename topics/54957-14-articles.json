Similarly to Laythe, when it was first discovered, it didn\u0027t enter the records because the scientists in charge thought the astronomer was looking at Moho. Eventually, another astronomer was observing Moho and noticed a small dot at the Sun, which hinted towards the existance of Ablate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, Moho\u0027s status as closest planet to the Sun was revoked and given to Ablate. Several infuriated Kerbals who love planet Moho caused riots across Kerbin\u0027s cities, causing Ablate to be downgraded to a dwarf planet and for Moho to retrieve its status as closest planet to the Sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EInacessable\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is still controversy whether Inacessable is an actual planet in the sky or not. Its abnormally high rotation speed often makes Kerbals believe it is not a celestial object and is rather a spying device made by tall, biped creatures with five fingers from outer space, though astronomers guarantee us it\u0027s a real planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAcension\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAcension has long been an intriguing dwarf planet to Kerbality. Its incredibly eccentrical orbit with an apoapsis that gives Sentar\u0027s a run for it\u0027s money and a periapsis close enough to high-five the Sun often makes Kerbals mistake it for a comet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, now that I speak of it, Acension MAY be a comet wandering across the Sun...hmm...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESentar\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn unique planet due to its rings and sometimes considered as Jool\u0027s sister planet, Sentar has long been considered in mythology to be full of oceanic life.

In fact, it has been first discovered centuries before Duna and has since then been confused for the nearer red planet, until seven year old amateur astronomer Skelton Kerman noticed Sentar in the background, identifying that it is, in fact, not Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESkelton Kerman was then moved up to university and granted an one year long term of advanced astronomy for free.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EErin\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EErin has long been known for its high ammounts of puddles.

When it first was discovered, it was mistaken for a piece of gold stuck to the lens of the telescope, causing the bigmouthed astronomer to yell \u0022I\u0027M RICH!\u0022. A few seconds after, a fistfight ensued over who possessed the gold piece. After that, it was mistaken for an eared dwarf planet in the outer reaches of the Solar system, because all telescopes had been broken in the previous fight and they had to use the backup telescopes, which are ten years old and malfunctioning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd after the shipment of recent telescopes had arrived, it was mistaken for a protostar due to it\u0027s yellowish coloration and because the astronomer who observed Ringle forgot his glasses. It was only two months afterwards that it was discovered that Ringle is actually a moon of Sentar, because astronomers couldn\u0027t catch a picture of Ringle without Sentar in the background.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThud\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThud has long been the punching bag of the Solar system, and its heavy craters confirm that.

I used it to basically stop the lateral motion and then used the main lander engine to slow down, hover and land. It\u0027s difficult not to fall sideways, as you can see here.
