I know this IS possible, because real life spacecraft seem to do it all the time. However, I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s simple enough where it can be done by hand for this game, or if its complexity restricts its use to real rocket science. Ideally, I\u0027d like to be able to use gravity assists and powered slingshots to lessen the fuel costs of interplanetary travel, and be able to use the moon to help accelerate out to the outer and inner reaches of the solar system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m only proficient in pre-calc level math, so if it takes anything more than that I\u0027ll have to study up a bit first(calc is next semester), but I\u0027d love an explanation that\u0027d take me a semester to understand if that\u0027s what it takes \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you in advance for everyone\u0027s time and consideration:)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
