The problem is when I try docking using the landing module my orbital speed and my target speed keeps increasing by 0.1 m/s every second. I have no idea what might be causing this because even wit the throttle all the way down and the RCS off it still keeps increasing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T11:59:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo start out silly: Is your orbit still stable?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut: Your orbital will change if you are not on a -perfect- circle - it will always be somewhat elliptic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso no two orbits will be the same - at least not if the orbiting crafts are getting closer to each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough my spaceplane drifted quite a lot yesterday while my kerbonaut EVAed to get the fuel line from the station ...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T12:28:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re confused about \u003Cstrong\u003Eorbital velocity\u003C/strong\u003E changing - that is normal. It\u0027s quite hard to actually achieve a perfectly circular orbit, so a common orbit will always be elliptical. This in turn means that you will be going faster when nearer to the body, and slower when further away. This is usually not a problem for docking, though, since it\u0027s the \u003Cstrong\u003Erelative velocity\u003C/strong\u003E between vessels that matters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the confusion is about \u003Cstrong\u003Erelative velocity\u003C/strong\u003E increasing and most possibly preventing you from docking successfully - that\u0027s a whole different can. To come down to a relative velocity of zero between two vessels, switch your nav ball into \u0022Target\u0022 mode, then burn (or RCS thrust) towards the \u0022retrograde\u0022 marker, which in nav ball \u0022Target\u0022 mode changes its meaning to \u0022decrease relative velocity between vessels here.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-30T12:30:56Z\u0022 title=\u002208/30/2013 12:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by blizzy78\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"daffy","CreatedById":76045,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T17:32:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBest way is to continue \u0027closing\u0027 the target, and then matching target speed by burning retrograde until the two bodies are pretty well synced at a few hundred meters. I\u0027ve learned that if you simply burn at the target and close the distance, and then fail to burn off the speed retrograde, it\u0027s like chasing a mouse on a bungee cord. You\u0027ll never match up. The steps have to be done repeatedly until orbits are synced well enough to maintain a stationary distance before you begin the actual docking phase. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, once you have the target set and are fairly relative, you can work the pro grade aim point into the targets node. When you have that lined up correct, then you can just RCS thrust in reverse to control the closing velocity. Now, as I\u0027m writing this, I\u0027m thinking to myself that...ok, so that makes sense to ME! But, I could be sending you on a goose chase!
