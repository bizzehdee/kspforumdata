It seems we will have a real hunger for huge engines and parts with the RSS rescale mod.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea. I guess they will be...eventually... if I\u0027ll manage to clear this with BobCat. You have to understand that as a creator he holds all rights to them and so can put forth whatever terms and conditions he feels are appropriate for his ends.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and this \u0022pack\u0022 is going to contain not just \u0022huge engines\u0022 - some upper stage engines as well. They seem \u0022huge\u0022 because, unlike all other BobCat\u0027s mods, there are done with 1:1 scale (instead of usual 64%).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kimaera026","CreatedById":90375,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T02:29:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVisari, thank you for your help. I found the cause of the problem. It lies with a mod that edits the behavious of engines globally. Similar to KIDS. I exchanged the former with the latter. KIDS runs much better, has more options, and doesnt affect jet engines. Result: perfection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, in the end, wasnt even far related to the rescale mod, which is good to know as I cannot bare cons to add to the list of this mod - which are still only the few bugs.
