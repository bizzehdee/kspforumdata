Whether this byproduct should stored as some kind of secondary material or assumed to be ejected from the spacecraft, isn\u0027t particularly important to my point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if we were to consider imperfect yields, how imperfect should they be? Well, at this point, we come back to the fact that Kethane is essentially imaginary, so we can prioritize numbers that favor game balancing for each of the materials. I personally feel that the waste amounts should roughly reflect the ISP of the fuels in question. Monoprop is 290, so we\u0027ll round to 300. Xenon is 4200, and liquid fuel is the tricky one, since many engines get wildly different ISP\u0027s. Despite that the majority of them see high 300\u0027s, I\u0027m going to say that the vast majority of engines used in space are probably the LV-N Nuclear Engines at 800. The average, if we had access to any statistic, would probably be around 600.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point of those numbers I just came up with, is for a byproduct ratio. Based on the weight comparisons you will see shortly, we would want Xenon\u0027s byproduct to fall in the high 90%\u0027s. This actually makes sense anyway, since Xenon is a noble gas, and if anything in the real world were to convert a material to Xenon, I\u0027m willing to bet that the byproduct percentages would actually be extraordinarily high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA number that works well here is 7.5% per 300 ISp.

But the way I see it, that makes perfect sense! And it complies with the laws of physics. Imperfect Conversions would always lose mass if waste is ejected, so why not do it on the ground? What was the problem there? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I play, there\u0027s always some un-landable behemoth in orbit. I can\u0027t convert on the ground because the drilling rig and its 300K Kethane far exceeds its in-house fuel/mon/xenon capacity. So in that case, mass of the fuels would be irrelevant to whether I converted on the ground or in orbit. For me, it would always be in orbit no matter how the mass plays out. So, I realize that\u0027s pretty much a \u0022me\u0022 thing, but nonetheless, it turns your \u0022always\u0022 into \u0022usually\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd you know what else? While I respect Majiir and his immense contribution to our game, nobody is perfect. No you, not me, not Majiir. Even if nothing else were considered, and we assume that his numbers are otherwise flawless, why do Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer convert at rates different than a 9:11 proportion? If you run out of Kethane in conversion you now have significantly different Fuel VS Oxidizer. This has happened to me twice now, once in orbit, and once on the ground when the Kethane vein dried up. Where\u0027s the benefit in that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, Aedile, now you see what I\u0027m talking about. Either there were some major typos while entering these numbers, or they just don\u0027t make much sense.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-14T20:52:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2014 08:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Camaron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-14T20:56:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s intentional.
