Our engineers have worked overtime yet haven\u0027t made a single SSTO since Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere has drastically changed due to global warming of course... Any how your mission is to build a rocket that is an SSTO. Harder than it sounds ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif). Anyways, I know the community is going to try to search up designs and so if you use either this design or this one, expect to be DQed ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) (Because it has to be authentically yours).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![y8LxnAR.png](http://i.imgur.com/y8LxnAR.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![gb9BZ1J.png](http://i.imgur.com/gb9BZ1J.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nHeres the catch for all you people trying to jump to conclusions. You are NOT permitted to use the Turbojet, Basicjet, or the RAPIER Engine. Any submissions that have this will also be DQed.\n\nLeaderboards:\n\n1.

This craft can fly to orbit in a single stage, only needing to shed the extra mass once orbit has been achieved, for transfer efficiency and ease of cargo docking. This does make it a true ssto by definition. It was interesting actually documenting the flight of the Clarksen since it is a fairly hands on craft to fly and requires a less efficient flight profile. It\u0027s flight was not a fast one though so it will not top any of the speed run boards. But weighing in at 796.6tons at launch, you can\u0027t expect a lot of speed. ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\nThe only mods I have are Kerbal Engineer and Stage Recovery(which is broken at the moment...). Whether or not this disqualifies this craft is up to the host of this challenge. Note: though I use KER, I do not have any of the custom parts installed on the rocket. Ker is running in sandbox mode, so it does not need them.\n\n796.6tons, 12 Nerv engines, 2 Mommoths, and a Mainsail, all run in a single stage craft with the engines in different groups so they can be toggled.\n\n[The Bumbling Flight of the MS-03 Clarksen.](http://s1346.photobucket.com/user/Jakalth/MS-03%20Clarksen%20bumbles%20into%20orbit%20ssto/story)\n\n![jakmsclarksen2_zpsaezfsiky.jpg](http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/jakmsclarksen2_zpsaezfsiky.jpg)\n\nDownload if interested: [MS-03 Clarksen](http://www./download/idb76sjfd5707an/Jak_MS03_Clarksen.zip)\n\np.s: Does anyone know if you can link entire Photobucket albums directly to the forums, as pictures, like you can with IMGUR?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-23T16:10:47Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2015 04:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jakalth**"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T03:40:21Z","Content":"It doesn\u0027t actually take that much to make an SSTO in 1.0.2, honestly.
