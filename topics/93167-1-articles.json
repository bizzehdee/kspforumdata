Should you desire a return from Eve\u0027s SoI, make a sharp turn to the left (aka \u0027Jump\u0027), then slowly fiddle yourself into a Gilly encounter (a step to the right, probably). Descending to the surface of Gilly would be more of a docking maneuver than a landing, to the point where you might have to accelerate downwards in order to not having to wait for hours to get down there. This also menas a return will be rather easy. The only talent really needed for Gilly is being able to get an encounter with the potatoe moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: As \u0027left\u0027 and \u0027right\u0027 are realtive everywhere, my \u0027Time Warp\u0027 strategy is always working to get to Gilly, but you might need to rotate around a little bit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zarakon","CreatedById":5160,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T21:50:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEasiest to get to:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Eve or Minmus (tie) - Minmus is fairly easy due to low gravity and the big flat areas. It\u0027s kind of like landing on the Mun but in slow motion with much lower fuel and thrust requirements. Eve is dead simple to land on with parachutes, except for the problem where the parachutes can tear your vessel apart if they aren\u0027t placed correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Duna - First you have to deal with a high interplanetary speed. If you don\u0027t bleed that off, you\u0027ll punch through the atmosphere way too fast. The atmosphere is too thin to slow you down much without parachutes, but thick enough that the parachutes can still break your ship apart when they deploy. Also, the thickness of the air varies greatly with elevation, so landing in highlands requires more rocket power than landing in the canyons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEasiest to return from:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Minmus - Low gravity and low orbital speed around Kerbin. Even a Kerbal\u0027s EVA suit has enough thrust and delta-v to return from Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Duna - Not exactly easy, but getting home takes a lot less delta-v than getting there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Eve - Due to its high mass and thick atmosphere, it\u0027s extremely difficult to even get to orbit from the surface of Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, Minmus is the easiest one to deal with. Getting a Minmus intercept is a good stepping stone before attempting Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T21:56:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMinmus is fairly easy to get to, but it\u0027s 6-degree inclination does add a challenge that you don\u0027t have to worry about with Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think Duna is next easiest. It has an orbital inclination of only 0.06 degree, so it\u0027s pretty easy to set up a maneuver node. Eve, with an inclination of 2.1 degrees, is a bit trickier to get a good intercept. The delta-v needed to get to Duna and Eve is about the same. If you plan to make a propulsive orbit insertion, Duna has a much lower delta-v requirement. Eve, however, has a nice thick atmosphere that makes for easy aerocapture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you plan to land, Eve is easy with parachutes. Duna\u0027s atmosphere is really thin, so parachutes will slow you down but you\u0027ll likely need a small amount propulsion to perform the final breaking. Landing on Duna is more of a challenge than Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you plan to liftoff from the planet, then there is absolutely no comparison. Duna is easy while Eve is the most challenging launch in the system.

As for Duna and Eve.. It\u0027s a bit complicated. If you aerobrake, Eve is actually easier to get into orbit then Duna, since it requires a bit less delta V, and doesn\u0027t have a large moon in your way. If you have parachutes, Eve is also arguably easier to land on then Duna due to Eve\u0027s thick atmosphere. However, Eve is an extremely difficult body to get into orbit from, and requires more delta V than Duna to return to kerbin, so if you are planning a return mission, Duna is easier than Eve. If you are just doing a flyby or a one way trip, Eve is easier than Duna. Also, one thing to keep in mind is tha... wait, I\u0027m getting sidetracked.
