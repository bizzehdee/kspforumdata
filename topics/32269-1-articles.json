Iodine is a black solid element under standard conditions. Iodine goes from a solid straight to a purple gas, with no liquid stage that can easily be detected. Iodine, in the solar system is rare, and in Earth\u0027s crust its abundance ranks about 53rd at 0.450ppm to 0.500ppm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrigin of Iodine on Eve: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIodine has an atomic number of 53 placing it on the periodic table above Iron, Cobalt, and Nickel. Therefore its only produced in a supernova explosion. Large concentrations of iodine might be possible naturally in a region of the galaxy where supernova explosions happen frequently or from the remnants of a supernova of an exceptionally large star.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe heavier elements differentiate towards the core of a planet hence most of the iodine would be in the core, just as most of the iron, nickel, gold, uranium, thorium, etc. Perhaps Eve got torn up by something leaving only the core. Of course, it wouldn\u0027t just be iodine, it would also be iron, nickel, gold, uranium, thorium etc. Iodine is also produced by neutron bombardment of Xenon which in itself is a byproduct of Uranium decay so perhaps it\u0027s the leftover of a giant nuclear reactor, note a planetary core and mantle is a giant thorium/uranium fission reactor. There\u0027s also neutrons from cosmic ray spallation where cosmic rays hit something sending neutrons flying. It would take tens of billions of years for the thorium and uranium of a leftover planetary core to decay into xenon and get bombarded into iodine so such a planet could not be part of a star\u0027s planetary system, stars don\u0027t live that long, it would have to be the leftover core of a rogue planet, perhaps the leftover core of a brown dwarf star. Short of a passing neutron star or black hole, I can\u0027t imagine what could strip the rest of such a planet away. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA planet with an iodine atmosphere would have to have a very hot surface for pure iodine as a gas as iodine is a solid at standard temperature and pressure. Eve seems to meet the temperature criteria, since its surface temperature ranges from 40 to 150 degrees Celsius. The melting point of Iodine is 113.5 degrees Celsius.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIodine, being one of the halogens, is a fairly reactive substance. The issue is that absent any processes to maintain the environment out of equilibrium, everything that can react with iodine will have reacted with iodine. Life will maintain the environment in such a non-equilibrium state, but the prospects for lifemay be poor. Geological processes could also do it, by bringing up substances that the iodine will react with. As for specific reactions, it reacts violently with some metals including aluminium, but of course those metals are unlikely to occur naturally in their pure state. a possible reaction then might be that of hydroiodic acid and carbonate rocks. Carbonate rocks on Earth are mostly biological in origin, but some are igneous so could occur on Eve (does Eve has volcanoes?). Hydroiodic acid is made by dissolving hydrogen iodide in water. Hydrogen iodide can be made by reacting elemental iodine with hydrogen or hydrogen sulfide gas, either of which can come out of volcanoes. The iodine-hydrogen reaction is accelerated by exposure to yellow light, giving an interesting means to control the reaction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/IodoAtomico.JPG\u0022 alt=\u0022IodoAtomico.JPG\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooks like Eveian atmosphere to meh.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-13T13:43:24Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2013 01:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by AstronautGeologist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AstronautGeologist","CreatedById":66322,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T05:15:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E....................\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-12T16:22:18Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2013 04:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by AstronautGeologist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T05:18:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think an atmosphere that thick made of iodine gas would be a lot more opaque that it appears.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going with purple particulates, just because it\u0027s fun to say.

Iodine is a gray/black solid which, when heated, sublimates; that is, it goes directly to the gas/vapor phase without becoming a liquid in between. Iodine gas/vapor is purple and so is iodine when dissolved in a non-polar solvent like carbon tetrachloride or benzene. The purple color indicates the presence of iodine and starch is not required.
