That being said, there is a clear increase of 500MB in working memory (no clue about commit just yet) while in play mode with a complex craft from the previous version to this. I\u0027m definitely getting much better results than with v2.2 as each added part only increases memory by a few MB, allowing me to comfortably work on my ships without the constant fear of crashing, but I have concerns that in game crashes while in play mode are going to become more common... I\u0027ve already had one, just didn\u0027t think to grab the logs because I wanted to get back to where I was ASAP. That being said, would a non-crash log help at all in this situation, perhaps a before and after of going from VAB to pad?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the changes you\u0027ve made, I\u0027m not unhappy with them at all, I was just throwing out some ideas as well as voicing my personal opinion that I\u0027d rather have a game that takes longer to load, but never crashes than a game that loads faster, yet rides closer to the edge on memory usage, leaving the potential open for more crashes. I\u0027d still by far rather work with your newest version than the older version, as I was able to build and test rockets all night and the only crash I experienced was during play during atmospheric entry, so reloading brought me almost back to the same place. With the previous version, I could easily expect a crash every 5-30 minutes in the VAB, leading to multiple long reloads (80 mods takes about 5min from desktop to loaded save and I\u0027ve got KSP on a SSD) before I ever got to space.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-31T14:16:49Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2014 02:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SpacedInvader\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"frash23","CreatedById":69988,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-31T13:57:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Faark\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Faark\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi frash,\u003Cp\u003Ethis mod works on the layer below the unity engine and directly interacts with DirectX.

This is something that Kerbal should have build in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did run some test with ATM 3-1 and Loading on Demand 2.2. It seems like that LoD is not loading ATM\u0027s textures properly (easily to see when ATM is running in aggressive mode). Instead of using ATM\u0027s textures, it is loading textures directly from mod\u0027s resources. This is not normally issue, because LoD and ATM aggressive performance are almost equal - memory usage difference was around 1-2% in my tests. ATM aggressive is better, if you have large builds with lot\u0027s of different textures, but in other hand LoD builds are using high quality textures, LoD game is launching much more faster and LoD enabled game seems to be able to run much more longer because memory of unactive textures are quickly released (thus allowing small memory leaks that are in game/Mono build bit longer). Only reason why someone should use ATM aggressive instead of LoD is to reduce texture size so that their computer can run graphics easier. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope that you can implement someday active or maybe dynamic texture reduction (change to lower resolution textures after certain number of active textures) to your great plugin!
