I think the bug I found is to do with this. I was attempting to land my space plane but ended up crashing it, after the crash a few parts came off when noticed one of the control surfaces flying off. I changed to it and it was escaping back up out of the atmosphere. Also after it re-entered it bounced back out into space a few more times before it just feel back to Kerbin.
