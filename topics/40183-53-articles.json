I\u0027m curious as to how it\u0027s difficult to use both of these in case I need to make changes for compatibility/playability. I have played with MCE a bit (just a few hours) and found them to work quite well together. Instead of taking up malkuth\u0027s thread, I would be interested in continuing this conversation on my thread (link in my signature). KCT supports the pricing changes made by MCE to parts, which causes the build time to change as a result. It is possible that I will be spending some time soon on developing a new timing algorithm, as malkuth has provided me with a good starting point to mess around with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022malkuth\u0022 data-cite=\u0022malkuth\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd unless I\u0027m missing something..

How it works now is that you add the vessel to the build list and when enough time has passed you are given the ability to launch it. Then the ship gets put on the launchpad just as if you clicked on the launchpad from the space center scene. After takeoff, MCE will charge you for the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm. I see a potential loophole like issue now that ruins some of the \u0022realism\u0022 of using both of these together. You can scrap vessels that are completed for parts in KCT to reduce future build times with those parts. This doesn\u0027t cost anything in MCE, so you can do it for free essentially. I might, not sure yet, try charging them for the ship when it gets added to the build list and then giving it back at launch when MCE takes it (to balance the budget). Then giving some back if the ship gets cancelled or scrapped. Can you get a vessel\u0027s cost with the API (in the editor)? It doesn\u0027t appear so in the documentation.

(used the Mk16 to almost match vanilla and realchutes)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThen DragCoefficient * Deployed Area = total Drag\u003Cbr\u003EThen every single part is individually * by total Drag to =\u002B PartDrag\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ENow we go back to vanilla Values and use Parachute drag Per ton (which is 70 default)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESo if total Mass Of Vessel * 70 \u0026lt;= PargDrag then you get autorecyled for that part of vessel.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E[B]So for example[/B]\u003Cbr\u003EA RT-10 Solid Fuel booster with a Mk16 Parachute (realchutes) gives us these values.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EArea = 191.4408\u003Cbr\u003EDragC = 1\u003Cbr\u003EPartDrag = 191.4408\u003Cbr\u003E2 parts on this example the RT-10 and MK16 so both parts are added to PartDrag\u003Cbr\u003EPartMass .1284707 * TotalDrag 191.4408 = 24.594\u003Cbr\u003EPartMass .1284707 * TotalDrag191.4408 = 49.18906\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESo total of 49.18906 PartDrag\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Etotal Mass of Vessel is 45.7429 and is this less than 49.18906?\u003Cbr\u003EYes it is. So you get the recycling back for this part of vessel.  \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EI made this example pretty close to not passing because this is how this part works in vanilla also with these 2 parts.  If you add mass to vessel (like fuel that is added to mass so be careful)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThis is WIP type situation.. Im still on the fence if I should rewrite the Total Vessel Mass and Drag of 70 part of the code to fit more in line with realchutes values.. Instead of using a reducer to try and match Vanilla values. (some things it doesn\u0027t work well on like the inline chute has crazy Area).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EGive me your thoughts.
