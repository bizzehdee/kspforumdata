Move the one opposite the direction you flip closer to the end of the plane."},{"CreatedByName":"Mynorus","CreatedById":19103,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-05T15:50:57Z","Content":"I\\\u0027m trying to land it horizontally, like the Harrier or the F-35B."},{"CreatedByName":"Trekkin","CreatedById":23636,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-05T16:26:06Z","Content":"In that case, yes, it\\\u0027s probably your thruster placement. Look at what way it flips, and compensate for that by moving the opposite thrusters outwards to the edge or the same-side thrusters inwards to the middle of the craft. For example, if while hovering its nose rises, you need to move the nose thrusters inwards or the tail thrusters outwards."},{"CreatedByName":"Mynorus","CreatedById":19103,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-05T16:40:34Z","Content":"Awesome, thanks. The back would flip upwards, and the nose downwards. I was wondering if the wings would be messing with it (the wings are attached to the side of the engines.) For the design, think of it like a weird F-16-ish 4-engined design."},{"CreatedByName":"Trekkin","CreatedById":23636,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-05T18:58:44Z","Content":"Also, as a slightly silly solution, just add more RCS. It sounds like you might not be throttling down quickly enough, so nose RCS will help."},{"CreatedByName":"Mynorus","CreatedById":19103,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-06T14:57:45Z","Content":"Awesome, I\\\u0027ll be sure to try that."}]}
