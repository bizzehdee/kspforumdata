Greater realism in simulations is something to strive for and aspire to, in my book. I would hope that if a future release of KSP were to change some of the things to which I had become accustomed, I would understand and welcome such changes.\n\nI do, however, sympathise with those who may have spent a long time (in some cases, a **very** long time) getting to grips with how an earlier (pre-release) version functioned and be possibly dismayed by the apparent \u0027waste of time\u0027.

All I had to do to make it stable was turn the thrust down on the booster in the VAB. (the winglets did make it wobble but I just moved them from the bottom of the booster to 3/4ths the way up and it tuned down the oversteer and stopped the wobble. I actually created 10 different rockets to see if I could get a failure, and only the longest booster with an extremely top heavy payload caused a failure. \n\nMaybe all the stuff I make is super stable, I don\u0027t think so, I think the problem is that some folks here have gotten used to MACH 2 launch velocities that they fail to realized that there is a reason that most commerical AC cannot go more than 0.90 MACH, because it takes alot of recrafted aero to cross the speed of sound and maintain flight control. \n\nJust slow down your lift-offs maintain 5000 @ 160, 10000 @ 220, 15000 @ 260, 20000 @ 320 and pitch changes of 1\u0027 per 1000 feet to 15000 feet and 2\u0027 per 1000 feet to 36,000 feet."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T05:30:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Ok, something is wrong...
