No matter what I do. Even simple parts because of their CoM turns right when are stopped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what to do? I cant play like this, I am getting desperate, I really like a lot of the many changes the game got over the past year. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not been fun anymore, I know the trick of 10km 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA dont work, I saw many videos, tried to follow many suggestions here but I cant get it right. I am not a total noob in dealing with aerodynamic games (flight simulator anyone?), but KSP is not real. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this in mind, I really prefer to get dumb, and play the 0.90 model of aerodynamics. I just want to get into my career build rockets and planes and fly for fun, building stuff in space, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any way to \u0022dumb down\u0022 the aerodynamic model? I saw many options on the hacking console about the drag, heat, and so on, but those are things I do not understand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just really wanted to have 0.90 aero in the game.

I actually tried to make rockets fail today, I placed a 1150L tank \u002B PL on top of the super long booster and it remained stable until it hit 310 M/S (which is approximately the speed of sound at the altitude). All I had to do to make it stable was turn the thrust down on the booster in the VAB. (the winglets did make it wobble but I just moved them from the bottom of the booster to 3/4ths the way up and it tuned down the oversteer and stopped the wobble. I actually created 10 different rockets to see if I could get a failure, and only the longest booster with an extremely top heavy payload caused a failure. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe all the stuff I make is super stable, I don\u0027t think so, I think the problem is that some folks here have gotten used to MACH 2 launch velocities that they fail to realized that there is a reason that most commerical AC cannot go more than 0.90 MACH, because it takes alot of recrafted aero to cross the speed of sound and maintain flight control. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust slow down your lift-offs maintain 5000 @ 160, 10000 @ 220, 15000 @ 260, 20000 @ 320 and pitch changes of 1\u0027 per 1000 feet to 15000 feet and 2\u0027 per 1000 feet to 36,000 feet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T05:30:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Francois424\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Francois424\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk, something is wrong...
