Indeed, it seems pretty obvious that things like communication, the ability to pass on knowledge, and the manipulation of physical objects are probably requirements. Please see that other thread if you want to discuss that.\n\nPersonally, I think it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s more interesting to imagine how civilizations, once established, could evolve. Most science fiction writers and futurists are stuck in an unimaginative mind frame, imagining aliens as essentially unchanged from their naturally-evolved forms. An example is this-\n\n[http://www.newsweek.com/aliens-are-enormous-science-suggests-319448](http://www.newsweek.com/aliens-are-enormous-science-suggests-319448)\n\nI don\u0027t really wish to judge the accuracy of this thinking as applied to biological evolution. Though as a counter-argument to the whole idea that bigger animals are smarter, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d like to point out that one of the few non-human animals in the world shown to be self-aware (and otherwise very intelligent) is the European Magpie, which, while it has a large brain for its body size, still only weighs at most 0.25 kg. Other birds in the same family (the Corvids) have been observed using and fashioning tools (and are probably also self-aware). All this intellectual capacity is packed into a *tiny* brain. It is also likely that the majority of that tiny brain is not actually devoted to intellect. In the end, what the intelligent birds show us is that sapient beings need not be large.\n\nAnyway, as the article I linked points out, there are likely natural evolutionary pressures that encourage longer lifespans in larger animals (such as, the larger you are, the less likely you are fall prey to predation, and thus, it makes sense to have a longer reproductive period). I am a bit less sold on the link between intelligence and animal size, but at the least, the longer lifespan encourages the possibility that civilizations will be founded by larger beings.\n\nThis is where I think that the imagination of science fiction writers and futurists and all the like fail them. We already possess the tools to deliberately induce changes in our own evolutionary design (and those tools are only getting better and better with each passing year), and our civilization is at an infant stage compared to astronomical time spans. We are no longer subject to natural biological selective pressures (such as predation or limited food resources). In terms of our future evolution, as long as we maintain civilization, it is a folly to draw any conclusions based off of natural evolution. If we desire, *we* control evolution now, and we can evolve at a rate *much* greater than that of natural evolution.\n\nSo the error of science fiction is to assume that we can predict alien bodies and minds based on the rules of natural Darwinian evolution. When aliens are thousands, millions, or billions of years more advanced than us, they are bound to have deliberately evolved themselves into something else, using *artificial* rules of their own desire. In fact, they are likely to evolve themselves in many directions.\n\nFor example, what if you want to maximize the number of individuals living on a planet? What do you do? As shown right here on Earth by the Corvids, (and perhaps by the \u0022hobbit people\u0022, Homo floresiensis, though this needs more study) a sapient being does not have to be large. It might also be possible to be able to improve upon the biological neuron even further, increasing its processing capability and/or decreasing its size. The biological neuron is far from the smallest data processing unit possible. Either way, physics and the real-life example of intelligent birds shows us that we have rather large brains compared to our actual intellectual capacity. Thus, it seems highly possible that we could *decrease* body size without adversely affecting intellectual capacity. Smaller bodies consume less resources, and we could thus increase the number of people the planet could support by a factor of ten or more!\n\nSo- au contraire! Intelligent aliens might not be large at all- they could be *tiny*!\n\nDespite the physical size of aliens or future human descendants, there will still be the need to manipulate objects. This is where direct, brain-machine interfaces (BMI) could come in useful- controlling a machine by thought alone. So, an intelligent biological being need not even have *hands*, if there is always a BMI around to serve as a manipulator. (Though one would imagine that hands- or their equivalent- would be retained as a manual backup.)\n\nThere is only one example in fiction that I am aware of- the sapient \u0022Neo-dolphins\u0022 from David Brin\u0027s *Uplift* universe. They are dolphins that have been \u0022uplifted\u0022 by genetic engineering to a level of sapience equaling humans, and manipulate the world and move about on dry land (when necessary) using BMIs. They do not have hands. So science fiction has not *entirely* failed in this regard.\n\nAnyway, you might be wondering- what about cyborgs and intelligent machines? Well, I have entirely ignored them so far! The point is- just from genetic engineering *alone*, we have reason to believe that aliens- and any future descendants of ours- would differ greatly from their natural progenitors, and would be subject to artificial, deliberate selective pressures that have nothing or little in common with natural selective pressures. Once you factor in the emerging technologies of merging machine and biology, and the possibility of sapient machines, you have *even more* reason to believe that it is folly to speculate on the appearance of aliens based on their natural, Darwinian roots. Civilization- by definition of being non-natural- gives Darwin the middle finger, follows its own rules, and has the capability of evolving a species at a rate vastly higher than natural evolution. It seems likely that the only way we observe aliens in their true, Darwinian-evolved forms is if we catch their civilization in an infant stage. This seems unlikely, as even if only 1 in 1000 radio/spaceflight-capable alien civilizations survive for greater than one million years, they will outnumber \u0022infant\u0022 civilizations like ours. \n\nIn the end, we should be careful when we try to draw conclusions about the forms of aliens from the natural world, because civilization itself is unnatural, and if the aliens have deliberately \u0022adapted\u0022 themselves to it (nearly inevitable over thousands, millions, or billions of years), they may only have a passing resemblance to their original, progenitor forms, or even no resemblance at all. Our observations of natural selection are only applicable to predicting the *starting forms* of aliens. (It also seems possible that alien civilizations will consist of many different intelligent races sharing a common creator species, but that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s another topic.)\n\nOh and one more thing- even if harmfully conservative civilization maintains a prohibition on self-modification for millions of years, they will still evolve. People with certain traits will still produce more children than others. This leads to selective pressure, and a species will still \u0022naturally\u0022 evolve to the *unnatural* condition of civilization, which has entirely different selective pressures than nature. So even if a species deliberately prohibits genetic engineering of itself, it will still evolve away in a different direction than what normal, natural selection would dictate in the absence of civilization. So no matter what an intelligent race does- short of artificially preserving and maintaining an ancient genome- it will evolve in directions that cannot be predicted by natural Darwinian evolution!"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T13:46:08Z","Content":"Won\u0027t stop people from trying and it\u0027s fun.\n\nThere may indeed be some that look vaguely humanoid, upright with at least two pairs of limbs and an identifiable head, but the resemblance ends there.

And \u0022tons of space\u0022 does not do it justice. The current estimate for the number of Earth-sized and super-Earth sized planets in the habitable zones of stars between the mass of the Sun and the mass of a red dwarf in our galaxy is 40,000,000,000 (forty billion). There are around 200-ish billion galaxies in the observable universe. Conservatively estimating that the Milky Way galaxy is an unusually planet-rich galaxy by a factor of four, then we can estimate that there should be on the order of 200,000,000,000 X 40,000,000,000 X 0.25 = **2,000,000,000,000,000,000,000** potentially habitable planets in the observable universe. That\u0027s a 2 with **twenty one** zeros after it.\n\n\u003E In absence of evidence, I\u0027d say no. Just as I don\u0027t imagine there are fish people under the sea, moon people on the moon, Mars people on Mars... if I keep going, I can safely conclude there are no aliens elsewhere... until I do see evidence for it.\n\nYou\u0027re falling into the same folly that the Catholic church did when they prosecuted Galileo. You *want* to believe our place in the cosmos is special. I just want to believe whatever the truth is. \n\nFor centuries now, we\u0027ve been accumulating fact after fact after fact that shows our place in the cosmos is of **no** particular significance. First, we found out that we weren\u0027t the center of the universe, and that the planets revolved around the Sun. Then we found out that the Sun wasn\u0027t the only star. Then we found out that the Sun wasn\u0027t in the center of the galaxy, as early star censuses seemed to show. Then we found out that we weren\u0027t the only galaxy- there were hundreds of billions more in just the observable universe alone! Then we found out we weren\u0027t the only planetary system, that we weren\u0027t the only Earth mass planet, and that there are tens of billions of Earth and super-Earth planets orbiting in the habitable zones of yellow to red dwarf stars, just in this galaxy alone. \n\nAt this point, not believing that aliens exist somewhere out there in the universe makes about as much sense as believing in magic. Once you understand the sheer numbers involved and the science of it, it truly takes an act of religious faith to not believe in aliens. This is why all astronomers feel very strongly (a \u0022statistical certainty\u0022) that aliens exist. I\u0027m serious- an act of God is what it would take to prevent aliens from existing somewhere out there. If aliens don\u0027t exist, then God certainly does.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-09T19:52:46Z\u0022 title=\u002204/09/2015 07:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|**"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T20:22:07Z","Content":"Yet I am fairly confident that there is no interstellar civilization within our galaxy...\n\nA fusion powered vessel with the mass ratio of the saturn V could attain speeds well above 0.1c\n\nGiven the age of the universe, this planet, how long life has been on it, etc...\n\nIt seems there has been plenty of time for a spacefaring civilization to rise and colonize the entire galaxy.
