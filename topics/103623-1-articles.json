Indeed, it seems pretty obvious that things like communication, the ability to pass on knowledge, and the manipulation of physical objects are probably requirements. Please see that other thread if you want to discuss that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I think it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s more interesting to imagine how civilizations, once established, could evolve. Most science fiction writers and futurists are stuck in an unimaginative mind frame, imagining aliens as essentially unchanged from their naturally-evolved forms. An example is this-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.newsweek.com/aliens-are-enormous-science-suggests-319448\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.newsweek.com/aliens-are-enormous-science-suggests-319448\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t really wish to judge the accuracy of this thinking as applied to biological evolution. Though as a counter-argument to the whole idea that bigger animals are smarter, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d like to point out that one of the few non-human animals in the world shown to be self-aware (and otherwise very intelligent) is the European Magpie, which, while it has a large brain for its body size, still only weighs at most 0.25 kg. Other birds in the same family (the Corvids) have been observed using and fashioning tools (and are probably also self-aware). All this intellectual capacity is packed into a \u003Cem\u003Etiny\u003C/em\u003E brain. It is also likely that the majority of that tiny brain is not actually devoted to intellect. In the end, what the intelligent birds show us is that sapient beings need not be large.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, as the article I linked points out, there are likely natural evolutionary pressures that encourage longer lifespans in larger animals (such as, the larger you are, the less likely you are fall prey to predation, and thus, it makes sense to have a longer reproductive period). I am a bit less sold on the link between intelligence and animal size, but at the least, the longer lifespan encourages the possibility that civilizations will be founded by larger beings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is where I think that the imagination of science fiction writers and futurists and all the like fail them. We already possess the tools to deliberately induce changes in our own evolutionary design (and those tools are only getting better and better with each passing year), and our civilization is at an infant stage compared to astronomical time spans. We are no longer subject to natural biological selective pressures (such as predation or limited food resources). In terms of our future evolution, as long as we maintain civilization, it is a folly to draw any conclusions based off of natural evolution. If we desire, \u003Cem\u003Ewe\u003C/em\u003E control evolution now, and we can evolve at a rate \u003Cem\u003Emuch\u003C/em\u003E greater than that of natural evolution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the error of science fiction is to assume that we can predict alien bodies and minds based on the rules of natural Darwinian evolution. When aliens are thousands, millions, or billions of years more advanced than us, they are bound to have deliberately evolved themselves into something else, using \u003Cem\u003Eartificial\u003C/em\u003E rules of their own desire. In fact, they are likely to evolve themselves in many directions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, what if you want to maximize the number of individuals living on a planet? What do you do? As shown right here on Earth by the Corvids, (and perhaps by the \u0022hobbit people\u0022, Homo floresiensis, though this needs more study) a sapient being does not have to be large. It might also be possible to be able to improve upon the biological neuron even further, increasing its processing capability and/or decreasing its size. The biological neuron is far from the smallest data processing unit possible. Either way, physics and the real-life example of intelligent birds shows us that we have rather large brains compared to our actual intellectual capacity. Thus, it seems highly possible that we could \u003Cem\u003Edecrease\u003C/em\u003E body size without adversely affecting intellectual capacity. Smaller bodies consume less resources, and we could thus increase the number of people the planet could support by a factor of ten or more!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo- au contraire! Intelligent aliens might not be large at all- they could be \u003Cem\u003Etiny\u003C/em\u003E!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite the physical size of aliens or future human descendants, there will still be the need to manipulate objects. This is where direct, brain-machine interfaces (BMI) could come in useful- controlling a machine by thought alone. So, an intelligent biological being need not even have \u003Cem\u003Ehands\u003C/em\u003E, if there is always a BMI around to serve as a manipulator. (Though one would imagine that hands- or their equivalent- would be retained as a manual backup.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is only one example in fiction that I am aware of- the sapient \u0022Neo-dolphins\u0022 from David Brin\u0027s \u003Cem\u003EUplift\u003C/em\u003E universe. They are dolphins that have been \u0022uplifted\u0022 by genetic engineering to a level of sapience equaling humans, and manipulate the world and move about on dry land (when necessary) using BMIs. They do not have hands. So science fiction has not \u003Cem\u003Eentirely\u003C/em\u003E failed in this regard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, you might be wondering- what about cyborgs and intelligent machines? Well, I have entirely ignored them so far! The point is- just from genetic engineering \u003Cem\u003Ealone\u003C/em\u003E, we have reason to believe that aliens- and any future descendants of ours- would differ greatly from their natural progenitors, and would be subject to artificial, deliberate selective pressures that have nothing or little in common with natural selective pressures. Once you factor in the emerging technologies of merging machine and biology, and the possibility of sapient machines, you have \u003Cem\u003Eeven more\u003C/em\u003E reason to believe that it is folly to speculate on the appearance of aliens based on their natural, Darwinian roots. Civilization- by definition of being non-natural- gives Darwin the middle finger, follows its own rules, and has the capability of evolving a species at a rate vastly higher than natural evolution. It seems likely that the only way we observe aliens in their true, Darwinian-evolved forms is if we catch their civilization in an infant stage. This seems unlikely, as even if only 1 in 1000 radio/spaceflight-capable alien civilizations survive for greater than one million years, they will outnumber \u0022infant\u0022 civilizations like ours. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, we should be careful when we try to draw conclusions about the forms of aliens from the natural world, because civilization itself is unnatural, and if the aliens have deliberately \u0022adapted\u0022 themselves to it (nearly inevitable over thousands, millions, or billions of years), they may only have a passing resemblance to their original, progenitor forms, or even no resemblance at all. Our observations of natural selection are only applicable to predicting the \u003Cem\u003Estarting forms\u003C/em\u003E of aliens. (It also seems possible that alien civilizations will consist of many different intelligent races sharing a common creator species, but that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s another topic.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and one more thing- even if harmfully conservative civilization maintains a prohibition on self-modification for millions of years, they will still evolve. People with certain traits will still produce more children than others. This leads to selective pressure, and a species will still \u0022naturally\u0022 evolve to the \u003Cem\u003Eunnatural\u003C/em\u003E condition of civilization, which has entirely different selective pressures than nature. So even if a species deliberately prohibits genetic engineering of itself, it will still evolve away in a different direction than what normal, natural selection would dictate in the absence of civilization. So no matter what an intelligent race does- short of artificially preserving and maintaining an ancient genome- it will evolve in directions that cannot be predicted by natural Darwinian evolution!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T13:46:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWon\u0027t stop people from trying and it\u0027s fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere may indeed be some that look vaguely humanoid, upright with at least two pairs of limbs and an identifiable head, but the resemblance ends there.
