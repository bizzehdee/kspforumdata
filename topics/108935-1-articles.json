The circumstances we\u0027re talking about are so vastly beyond the strength and heat capacity of the parachute material, that I believe it would almost instantly shred or vaporise, before it could transmit much shock load. I\u0027m speaking from some experience here, having shredded very large sails made from parachute material, they just go instantly when you exceed max load (but you do get recoil shock in that situation, as it was typically under sustained max load before it shredded). Subject normal modern parachute cloth to extreme heat, and it will just vaporise rapidly. The only way I see the capsule experiencing shock is if it was under significant load for some time before being destroyed."},{"CreatedByName":"Kuu Lightwing","CreatedById":142724,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T19:18:42Z","Content":"Thank you for that piece of information, Murph, but, uh...

I was showing ksp to a friend earlier today, he was playing and he opened the chutes at 600m/s ;\n\nAt first he didnt even understand what was going on, until he read the \u0022chute was ripped off\u0022 message, and at this point, no player will feel panic, stress, and the need to save the kerbals in another way ! When you read the message and the chute just disappears, you are simply disappointed and revert...\n\nIt could definitely use a burning/ripping effect, some camera shake and a IVA warning (like light turning red inside the capsule, emergency mode or so)"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T22:35:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Same with engine exhaust.
