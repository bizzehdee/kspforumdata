I\u0027ve been getting better at making the parts since then, especially with texturing them. KSP is a bit challenging to model for:\n\n- I\u0027m only allowed 1 material per model object. This means breaking up model polygons which will have the different material\n\n- Memory consumption of textures is a huge issue: This means either creative use of baked textures or tileable textures. Even then Baked textures are less desirable as they have to be a decent resolution to be of any quality when rendered, which cuts into the memory available in KSP. The surface attach house part demonstrates my attempt to split the polygons used in it into sub sections so that the UV islands are bigger.\n\nFor most of the retexturing I\u0027m doing for the civ-pop parts I\u0027m trying to stay away from baked textures. This is primarily for memory purposes but also to allow tiled panel textures.\n\nYou refer to the science module as to the look you want. It\u0027s not a matter of texture but a general lack of detail. I can certainly go back and address that.\n\nAs for the other one: the mining lasers working from orbit... that\u0027s a Regolith problem. The laser drill uses the regolith harvester and I\u0027m pretty sure I told it to be a drill (I mostly copied settings from the MKS drill) so when RoverDude updates regolith like he hinted at previously I can update it in the Civ pop and see."},{"CreatedByName":"AlonzoTG","CreatedById":118178,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T17:28:01Z","Content":"yeah, and the drill does not work when placed right up next to the deposit if it is KAS connected to a base that is in a different biome. =\\ -- made 20M procedural parts storage tower to hold teh waterz.
