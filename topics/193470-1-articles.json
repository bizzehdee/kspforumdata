Eventually I could retool it for mining and exploration. First I need to get it off the runway for an appreciable amount of time without it exploding or just losing its wings. I\u0027m using four rapier engines, to save on oxidizer in atmosphere and just overall weight efficiency. (Four engines for both space ant atmosphere instead of rockets and jets, that sort of thing.)\u00A0I\u0027ve tried using Matt Lowne\u0027s craft files but the only one that opens for me is a space station. Nevertheless I\u0027ve been inspired by his designs. The first iteration I made \u0022piecemeal\u0022 wings that work better now that I\u0027ve autostrutted them.

I had a look at the first one, the \u0022Rapier Sketch.craft\u0022. The first and most important issue I noticed was that you seem to use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E! \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E changes the aerodynamics quite a lot compared to the stock aerodynamics so that makes a big difference. And I don\u0027t use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E, so there is little that I can help you with that. (And if you use other mods that might be relevant, then please mention them.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving said that, I did give it a try with stock aerodynamics. The design is aerodynamically quite stable, with a rather large distance between \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E. This means that it needs quite a bit of pitch-up trim to fly straight, but in stock that is not a problem, you have enough control authority for that. It does mean that with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E in \u0022stability assist\u0022 the nose drops quite a bit before \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E applies enough trim to keep it stable. (Again, not a problem, but something one needs to take into account.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou also use quite a few struts, but no autostruts. The relevant difference here is that regular struts generate drag, while autostruts don\u0027t. To enable autostruts you need to activate \u0022advanced tweakables\u0022 in the settings menu. Once you did that you\u0027ll have more options in the PAWs (the \u0022right click windows\u0022) of the parts, one of them being the autostruts. Autostruts have their own set of problems - in particular when they flip from one part to another e.g. because fuel consumption changes which part is the heaviest - but autostruts to grandparent are usually safe. For a test I removed all the obvious external struts without activating any autostruts, and the craft still flew fine without falling apart or anything. But that may be different with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are using the RAPIERs in air-breathing mode but you bring enough oxidizer to burn all liquid fuel in rocket mode.

In the atmosphere that is not much of an issue because the aerodynamic forces of the control surfaces give you enough authority to counteract the resulting torque. In space you only have the torque from the reaction wheels to keep you straight which in this case means that you can run the engines only at very low thrust levels without the craft flipping out of control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome more tips:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI find it very useful for my spaceplane to put toggling the engines on or off and switching them between air-breathing and closed cycle (plus toggling the air intakes) onto action groups.

That means not getting too high too soon, you\u0027ll want to get to at least 1000 m/s in air-breathing mode. My flight profile for your craft (with stock aerodynamics!) looks like that: after take-off pitch about 20 deg up until I got to ca. 6000m altitude (at sub-sonic speeds); then slowly lower the nose to the horizon to gain speed (this will loose altitude but I kept above 5000m); once I got to 440 m/s I raised the nose to about 10 deg pitch up, making sure that I don\u0027t drop below 400 m/s(!); the increasing speed and the curvature of Kerbin means that the pitch (relative to the surface) will slowly increase, that\u0027s fine and what I want; once the thrust of the RAPIERs drops below 170 kN I switch to closed-cycle mode (because that craft has excess oxidizer, on my craft I usually wait till near flame-out before switching); when the time to apoapsis gets above 1 min I switch \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to prograde hold; when the apoapsis gets to 80 km I throttle down, coast, and circularize.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jakewhistler","CreatedById":203963,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-29T10:43:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sorry, I forgot to mention that I use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E. It came recommended in the Basic Aircraft Design tutorial. What made sense to me was that KSP adds the drag from each component and not just those on the outside. The example given is a probe inside a fairing has more drag than just the probe on the rocket. This made sense to me. Does it not do this? (That guide was posted seven years ago but edited just before KSP 1.9.1 came out, but after 1.9, so I don\u0027t know what that means.) Other than that there\u0027s Mod Manager and Docking Port Alignment Indicator. (Sometimes I really wish this machine could play Orbiter. So much instrumentation, but no spacecraft construction!) I didn\u0027t initially auto strut the wings because I didn\u0027t want to poke the Kraken. I\u0027m running on a laptop and KSP doesn\u0027t run at its best.

When I first started out making spaceplanes I always used the MK2 bicoupler with heavy engines. This was bad because it make the spaceplane center of mass go towards the back rather than the central part which is where the center of mass should be. I recommend you place these on the Delta Wing as close to the fuselage as possible. Connect one fuel-line to it. Struct it properly so the fuel-tanks with the engines don\u0027t go flying off and bouncing around. :)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3).\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003ECrewed or AI, the AI drone core reduces weight significantly as it is just a small drone core compared to the cockpits. The drawback is that the AI drone core will need something to generate power. You can have a small cargo-bay to stash the radioactive isotope generators and a few batteries. If you are not that far ahead, you can opt to place a few batteries and a solar panel instead.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E4).\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003ELights are somewhat important if you plan on doing night-time flying whether it\u0027s on Kerbin or anywhere else. I recommend four. (two on the delta-wing top side to illuminate the runway as real planes have, two on the bottom of the fuselage for illumination)... The lights drain power so you\u0027ll need some batteries for the cargobay.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E5).\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003ELanding gear is also important, there should be two on the wing with one forward and one in the back to deter tailstrike. Size depends on how big of a craft you\u0027re gonna be building.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll in all, building a successful spaceplane is easy but it requires trials and usually these trials are by fire\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u00A0(if not worse... LoL!) and at the end of it you\u0027ll come out with a successful spaceplane. The biggest joy for me on this game is when I launch a space shuttle (Mine is a AI-drone named the \u0022Cargolifter MK1\u0022 designed sort of like the space shuttle.) and I get it into orbit, open the little cargobay doors and I release the satellite into \u0022the wild\u0022 (so to speak.)..\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOf course you can also make a cargo spaceplane that can take off from the runway. Heck, even a spaceplane boat designed to \u0022surf\u0022 the waves of Laythe and look for new stuff. The possibilities are as endless as your imagination goes!
