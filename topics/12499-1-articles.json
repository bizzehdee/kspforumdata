Exploding rockets and designing bizarre planes is fun but once you learn basic rocket design and orbital mechanics you may feel the urge to do something more purposeful. For those looking for a mission with a reason, or a reason to do a mission, the KGSS invites you to attempt the below hypothetical mission:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EInsert a satellite in Minus-stationary orbit\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KGSS needs to place a satellite in a geostationary orbit above Minmus to measure night/day surface temperatures over a five Minmus day period. It is how unknown what the correct geostationary altitude is or if Minmus can maintain craft in this orbit.
