you learn about is wire wrap. \u00A0As the name implies, it is a means of connecting wires by simply wrapping the exposed conductor around a terminal several times. \u00A0Quick to attach and de-attach, it is a favorite means of prototyping (especially at the frequencies 6502 and Z-80 operate at, much less useful with modern gear). \u00A0I\u0027ve seen plenty of older computers that were *shipped* using wire wrap, so it isn\u0027t just a \u0022cheap hobbyist\u0022 method.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile wire wrap is great, expect to learn how to solder. \u00A0It takes a little practice and the basics involve heating both sides hot enough so that when you apply the solder to them (not the iron), the solder melts and flows on them. \u00A0Don\u0027t get the leads to chips too hot. \u00A0A good solder joint is shiny (well used to be, I\u0027m less sure with modern silver-based solder).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I was introduced to professional electronics, my professor forced us to by textbooks (which seemed expensive at the time, but nothing compared to now), mostly to assign homework. \u00A0We were told that the text book was sort of right, the book containing the data sheets was supposed to be right, but the actual computer (much like the cat in psych) was *always* right. \u00A0A quick test is often easier to do and harder to misunderstand than reading through a datasheet. \u00A0Still, you need to know how to do the test and a higher level book is a good place to start.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBooks from that era are almost certainly out of print (although \u0022Soul of a New Machine\u0022 is probably good for inspiration, and almost certainly available). \u00A0Go through a used bookstore and see if you can find anything that looks good from that era (I scored a \u0022TTL databook\u0022 once. \u00A0While absolutely nobody builds anything that it describes, the current stuff all has the same pinout and is largely backwards compatible). \u00A0One thing that should cover the basics is\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.amazon.com/Bebop-Boolean-Boogie-Third-Unconventional/dp/1856175073\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.amazon.com/Bebop-Boolean-Boogie-Third-Unconventional/dp/1856175073\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0(note this is third edition. \u00A0The second edition lists a $12 \u00A0used\u00A0book (might not include shipping) and is certainly written since 2000, thus not being a problem).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor PCB design, I certainly would recommend downloading the Eagle CAD package. \u00A0While it completely lacks the polish of professional CAD, it should be able to get the design done. \u00A0You can also build something like 10cm by 10cm boards (check before starting) without paying anything for this software (and smaller circuit boards will always be cheaper to have manufactured anyway).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAssembling a circuit board can be more tricky. \u00A0One small startup I worked at had built circuit boards by manually placing parts on the board and then cooking the whole thing in a toaster oven. \u00A0I never got the hang of placing the tiniest components, but an earlier guy could. \u00A0Note that there are a lot of hidden costs in this, as you need things like solder mask stencils to have something to stick you components on and cook (and don\u0027t use a toaster oven for food that has cooked lead).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to get really creative and build your computer from the architecture up, I\u0027d recommend looking into FPGAs. \u00A0In any event, I\u0027d look into FPGAs and CPLDs if only to reduce part count. \u00A0Basically, this is a way to design your own chip in \u0022software\u0022. \u00A0Typical ways to program involve languages like Verilog and VHDL and the chip vendors probably have *something* you can download and convert into the necessary bitstream (although they will be designed primarily\u00A0to work with some seriously expensive software). \u00A0Also learn what microcode is/was. \u00A0Microcode basically lets you program a pile of chips to be a computer, and was the basis of computer design until things like Verilog and VHDL could compile down to a whole chip (microcode took up a lot of a few of my electrical engineering classes at school and at least on professor quoted a computer designer as \u0022never making another non-microcoded computer\u0022. \u00A0Microcode was effectively obsolete by the time I graduated, but still used in the dark corners of modern Intel machines for all those instructions that haven\u0027t been used since the 90s). \u00A0If this seems like cheating and not sufficiently \u0022hardcore\u0022 compared to using your soldering iron, don\u0027t forget that the pros in \u0022Soul of a New Machine\u0022 were half \u0022microkids\u0022 who were doing the microcode and the hardware guys were slapping down \u0022PAL here\u0022 (a CPLD forerunner) every time they needed something complicated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor overall computer design, as far as I know \u0022the book\u0022 is still Hennesy and Patterson: Computer Architecture, a Quantitative Approach. \u00A0Note that it is used in graduate level classes as well as upper level undergraduate courses, so you might be spending some time in the first few chapters furiously trying to build up the background. \u00A0It isn\u0027t cheap, but sufficiently advanced libraries should have earlier editions (I\u0027d expect current ones to be checked out by students). \u00A0They also wrote an introductory book called Computer Organization and Design, and if you can get it first I\u0027d recommend it. \u00A0Unfortunately I bought it after studying the first and was greatly disappointed (so I really don\u0027t know if it is any good or not).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd don\u0027t try to build anything huge as your first soldering project. \u00A0The lessons KSP teaches you about fake rocket design carry well over into other design fields. \u00A0Make sure whatever you build is small enough that you can figure out why it doesn\u0027t work. \u00A0When engineers first apply power to a design it is called a \u0022smoke test\u0022. \u00A0If no smoke comes out of the device, they are happy. \u00A0They often don\u0027t expect it to work. \u00A0Then the real work goes into discovering exactly what it is doing and adjusting the design/manufacturing so that it does what it is supposed to, and iterate from there. \u00A0If you have multiple errors in you device (design flaws plus soldering globs plus unsoldered pins) it will be vastly harder to troubleshoot than a single failure (which can often be divided and conquered, no matter how invisible the error).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS: I remain convinced the the \u0022best\u0022 architecture for that era would have been a stack-based architecture with a fairly large DRAM array on chip. \u00A0The point of a stack architecture would be for the single addressing (both one source and destination would typically be top of stack) so that a single word would come off the DRAM array (you can only use DRAM if you can deal with only one port). \u00A0The DRAM array would be useful for other things, as an instruction/loop buffer (probably too small for a real cache), for a stack buffer, and (tiny) data cache. \u00A0Not sure if fast page memory would be early enough to make it make sense (it needs *some* form of burst memory reading), but it would certainly hit a brick wall around the time multiple issue RISC designs came out (early 90s), so perhaps we are better off without such a design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MDZhB","CreatedById":99243,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-01T02:30:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022
