I\u0027d say probably two. In one hand, there\u0027s less cross-dependencies to calculate as strains on the end of one 150-part vessel don\u0027t need to be distributed over the other vessel; any force travels only through 150 parts, not 300. OTOH the game must check for collisions between the two. Within a single vessel things like clipping are possible because the game doesn\u0027t check for self-collisions (although there are exceptions, esp. with moving parts - e.g. the ramp lowered using landing legs pushing it down works basing on collision between the ramp and the legs and these belong to a single vessel. OTOH the ramp based on airbrakes requires to be detached; if it belonged to the same vessel the airbrakes would just phase through.)\n\nSo... do the reduced physical complexity of the body outweigh the overhead of collision-checking? Honestly, I don\u0027t know.\n\nedit re: orbital calculations. These really don\u0027t create much lag. The game can handle hundreds of objects in orbital flight at the same time just fine, adding one more does very little.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-18T14:12:25Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2015 02:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy**"},{"CreatedByName":"micr0wave","CreatedById":136352,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T14:16:18Z","Content":"yeah, within physics of course."},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T15:25:35Z","Content":"I think the game uses one core per vessel inside the same physics bubble.\n\nIt would lag a little bit more than half of it when youre using two 150 parts instead of 300 parts, since 300parts will be stuffed in one core and two 150 part ships will be using two cores."},{"CreatedByName":"Violent Jeb","CreatedById":130681,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T15:30:13Z","Content":"I\u0027m sure it\u0027s the latter.

You can see this phenomena in action when you lift off with huge rocket with many, many boosters. As soon as you ditch them all out, your FPS rise considerably, even though that all those parts are still on screen and still in physics bauble, but no longer affecting each other, but each flying on its own. Atmospheric drag calculations are still very simple as opposed to part interactions."}]}
