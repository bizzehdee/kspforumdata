My impressions are that KSP is a mixture of an open ended building game (which doesn\u0027t appeal to me too much) and a skill challenge game which is more interesting to me but has limited replay value. I\u0027ve enjoyed the demo but I\u0027ve found fairly few challenges (orbited Kerbin / Mun / Sun and returned safely with the last things I can see to do is to be able to land under power and doing so at a predetermined location both powered and unpowered) and wanted to make sure I\u0027m not making unjust assumptions about the main game. Some youtube reviews make it look like there were plenty of variations on several times the possibilities in the demo but I\u0027m currently umm\u0027ing and arr\u0027ing about it (space planes looked really fun).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make sure I\u0027ve got a fair understanding of the required game piloting skill could someone tell me if the following minimal orbiter performance is anything close to what a skilled player can achieve. This is the best I can reliably currently do and I am trying to use it to determine if there is a large amount of piloting skill development that I will be able to grapple with in the full game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP demo (v0.18 I think)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EMinimal Orbiter\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESingle stack:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMk16 Parachute\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommand Pod Mk1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETR-18A Stack Decoupler\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFL-T400 Fuel Tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFL-T800 Fuel Tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFL-T800 Fuel Tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV-T45 Engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EAscent Profile\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAscend at full throttle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImmediately ascend at 85 degrees\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 7km alt ascend at 70 degrees\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlign thrust vector with velocity vector when \u0026lt;70 degrees during rest of ascent\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECut thrust when apoapsis reaches 70km altitude\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERide apoapsis initially at T-20s to enter \u0026gt;70km orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ERemaining fuel in established circular orbit\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E15 \u002B/- 4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBased on this (very limited) test how far am I from the launch piloting skill required for the challenge (career???) mode of the game?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy sincere thanks for you help,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERichard\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T15:42:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome aboard!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, it\u0027s certainly difficult to tell, even with your impressive list of accomplishments there.
