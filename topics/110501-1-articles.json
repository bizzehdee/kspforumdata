My impressions are that KSP is a mixture of an open ended building game (which doesn\u0027t appeal to me too much) and a skill challenge game which is more interesting to me but has limited replay value. I\u0027ve enjoyed the demo but I\u0027ve found fairly few challenges (orbited Kerbin / Mun / Sun and returned safely with the last things I can see to do is to be able to land under power and doing so at a predetermined location both powered and unpowered) and wanted to make sure I\u0027m not making unjust assumptions about the main game. Some youtube reviews make it look like there were plenty of variations on several times the possibilities in the demo but I\u0027m currently umm\u0027ing and arr\u0027ing about it (space planes looked really fun).\n\nTo make sure I\u0027ve got a fair understanding of the required game piloting skill could someone tell me if the following minimal orbiter performance is anything close to what a skilled player can achieve. This is the best I can reliably currently do and I am trying to use it to determine if there is a large amount of piloting skill development that I will be able to grapple with in the full game.\n\nKSP demo (v0.18 I think)\n\nMinimal Orbiter\n\nSingle stack:\n\nMk16 Parachute\n\nCommand Pod Mk1\n\nTR-18A Stack Decoupler\n\nFL-T400 Fuel Tank\n\nFL-T800 Fuel Tank\n\nFL-T800 Fuel Tank\n\nLV-T45 Engine\n\nAscent Profile\n\nAscend at full throttle\n\nImmediately ascend at 85 degrees\n\nAt 7km alt ascend at 70 degrees\n\nAlign thrust vector with velocity vector when \u003C70 degrees during rest of ascent\n\nCut thrust when apoapsis reaches 70km altitude\n\nRide apoapsis initially at T-20s to enter \u003E70km orbit\n\nRemaining fuel in established circular orbit\n\n15 \u002B/- 4\n\nBased on this (very limited) test how far am I from the launch piloting skill required for the challenge (career???) mode of the game?\n\nMy sincere thanks for you help,\n\nRichard"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T15:42:04Z","Content":"Welcome aboard!\n\nWell, it\u0027s certainly difficult to tell, even with your impressive list of accomplishments there. Honestly even I don\u0027t keep track of the procedure all that well, I just go with the plan of (since 1.0, anyway) \u0022slowly tip the rocket over and end up almost horizontal by the time the atmosphere runs out,\u0022 which is enough to get you into a nice suborbit for the boost into actual orbit. I\u0027ll just say that as long as you have enough delta-v you can do anything! ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)\n\nThe best advice would be to just give the full game and career mode a whirl, it\u0027s all a learning experience!"},{"CreatedByName":"RidiculousRichard","CreatedById":144734,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T20:09:23Z","Content":"For those interested in this or similar question I found the following delta-v diagram at [http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/7/73/KerbinDeltaVMap.png](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/7/73/KerbinDeltaVMap.png) which is used in [http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Cheat_sheet](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Cheat_sheet) andwhich suggests it takes ~4550m/s delta-v to launch to a 80km circular orbit.\n\nThe rocket above has a full weight of 13.7 and a dry weight of 3.7.\n\nIf you assume an Isp of 345 over the full flight this gives the rocket above a maximum delta-v of 4426m/s which is just enough to get to a 70km altitude.\n\nNB: the difference between a 70km and 80km orbit is only a 17m/s delta-v if I\u0027ve plugged the numbers into [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit#Calculation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit#Calculation) correctly (600km planet radius \u0026 u=3.53x10^12)\n\nI suspect the Isp should be higher since the rocket climbs out of the densest part of the atmosphere quickly (max Isp of 370 gives delta-v capability of 4747m/s) which means there is room for improvement on my launch piloting.\n\nDespite my Isp suspicions I am at least now happy that I\u0027ve not got piloting totally wrong.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-23T21:37:16Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2015 09:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RidiculousRichard**"},{"CreatedByName":"RidiculousRichard","CreatedById":144734,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T10:42:19Z","Content":"Arrrg, I may need to start a local Kerbal Anonymous; must stop playing now ..... noooo can\u0027t resist one more contract!"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T15:27:09Z","Content":"Hahaha, same.\n\nBut srsly, it can be pretty addictive.\n\nWelcome to your demise!"}]}
