Not only was I able to design a craft that can make it to orbit in one stage and back, but I was able to land back on the Runway itself which is another achievement.

As far as the ascent goes, I\u0027ve found two different ascents that I thought were both pretty useful. The first is to ascend at a 60 degree angle until I reach 7km, then I start leveling off to 30 degrees. From there I just continue accelerating until my air intakes read that they have 15 units left. There I activate the rocket engine and when i get to 10 intake left I close the intakes and shut the engines down. From here it is a pretty standard rocket ascent profile. I haven\u0027t really done this enough times to develop a consistent system however.\n"}]}
