What else do the femme kerbals have to do but go to space?\n\nIs anybody else running an all-female space program? I kept Jebediah for old times\u0027 sake, and he\u0027ll probably tag along on some interplanetary missions to bodies he hasn\u0027t seen in my older saves. Bill and Bob are now Kax and Zela, my transgender crew. I haven\u0027t rescued a single male kerbal, and so far, I\u0027ve rescued all the female kerbals which have popped up.\n\nI\u0027m appreciative that Squad have included female kerbals, but they certainly didn\u0027t take it very far.
