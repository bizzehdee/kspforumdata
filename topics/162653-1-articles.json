I once experienced one of your anecdotal situations, where the game deleted an entire functional service module that I had left up in a parking orbit around Duna while I explored the surface. There was nothing wrong with it, it was a perfectly serviceable craft that was basically a huge tank of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E\u002BO\u00A0with an NTR (this was basically stock; no Real Fuels. Quite a while ago) and some solar panels, a monoprop tank and a Sr docking port. I totally did not think of it as debris but it was so marked because it didn\u0027t have any manned pods or a probe part or anything else to mark it as anything other than debris. And while I as on the surface, I exited to main menu and turned down the max allowable amount of debris. And eventually came back to my Duna mission, launched them into orbit and then starting hunting around for the service module so they could dock up and return to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd of course, it was gone. I too wondered if it had been some kind of bug and said to myself that maybe the game got too aggressive about garbage deletion. And I went into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to spawn another ship to send to Duna to rescue the Kerbals there. And discovered after removing the crewed components that I couldn\u0027t control the craft at all. I had THOUGHT there was a large probe control part but of course there wasn\u0027t. It was just a Sr docking port, a large tank, some solar panels and an NTR engine. In other words: Debris.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot to me of course, it was perfectly serviceable in the capacity that I had originally designed it for as it hadn\u0027t been originally designed for autonomous operation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that\u0027s probably where your anecdotal cases come from.
