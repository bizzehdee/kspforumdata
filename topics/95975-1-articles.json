My suggestion to help reduce part counts is to have the ability to combine small parts into a single part (Equipment Bay), perhaps in a \u0027Factory\u0027 building. I envision it working like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Select the fuselage part, probably choosing between a short straight section and the different size adapters. It would probably be best if the fuselage parts had a set number of slots for internal parts, maybe 2-4 slots depending on size/diameter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Select what part you want in each slot. Of course, some slots could be left empty. Parts to choose from should include LF and LFO tanks, Monoprop tanks, batteries, RTGs, avionics (probe cores), reaction wheels, and science sensors. Maybe even lights and RCS thrusters!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Weld it! This would combine everything into a single part (EB), with mass equal to the sum of all the parts inside. The cost would also be the sum of all the parts, plus a percentage to create the part. The finished part could be a one-off, one use custom part, or perhaps for an extra fee it could be prototyped and added to the part inventory for unlimited use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: Use it! The new Equipment Bay could appear in subassemblies, structural parts, or perhaps a new \u0027Custom Part\u0027 category.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBonus Sub-part: Science Rack! Stick all the small science sensors (seismic, gravioli, thermometer, barometer) onto a rack which fits into just one EB slot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy inspiration for this is from trying to clip parts inside the otherwise empty adapter parts, which may help aesthetics but doesn\u0027t help part counts. With this scheme, including the Science Rack, in a 4-slot EB, 8 parts could become one, using up what would be otherwise empty space (if using an adapter).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you all think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nemrav","CreatedById":91029,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T01:36:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you\u0027re thinking of the Weld mod \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main reason why you wouldn\u0027t want this, is that then explosions destroy huge chunks of your vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I think that maybe, if things are in a cargo bay (like a probe), then you can do this, but otherwise keep it limited, and when your probe detaches, it separates into the individual parts again..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T01:48:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, it\u0027s inspired by the Weld mod, and explosions will generally ruin Bill\u0027s day anyways.
