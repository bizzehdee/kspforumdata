We\u0027re looking at 24 Dawns consuming a total of 216ec/s at full tilt. Solar obviously isn\u0027t an option because the inverse square law is a thing, and since I\u0027m limited to stock parts I can\u0027t just slap on a NearFuture fission reactor and call it a day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently, I\u0027m considering clipping a ring of 12 RTGs to each Dawn, which should provide enough power to run them all at max throttle. The problem is that the total mass of all these RTGs will be about 24 tons - not huge relative to the rest of the ship, and the Dawns have the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E to burn, but every ton counts when your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is almost non-existent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe alternative is using fuel cell arrays. Each array can pump out enough juice to run two drives, so only about 3 tons would be added in total. But, they consume \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E, slashing the effective \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E of the Dawns from 4200 to 1300ish, and that\u0027s before the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E impacts of all the fuel I\u0027d have to carry with me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo...

Your acceleration is roughly 1 m/s\u00B2 (one tenth of Kerbin\u0027s gravity), and you need to expend 1000 m/s in order to escape. Once you have an escape trajectory, you can keep burning as long as you want, but until you have one you\u0027re still stuck in orbit, so escape is your effective limit. At this \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E it would take you 1000 seconds, or 16 minutes and 40 seconds, in order to escape. This is clearly impractical, because any burn larger than roughly 1/6th of your orbit is going to start making problems for you with imprecision. We\u0027ll assume that you are in a 36 minute orbit of Kerbin, so 1/6th of that orbit is 6 minutes. This will clearly be a periapsis kick sequence made of three burns. The first two burns will input 720 m/s, so there\u0027s no risk to encounter the Mun as you loop around for the final burn, so this is a good setup. You can fly with your spacecraft as it is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGoing futher with this example, now answer the question: on this mission, do you ever expect to have to make a burn that is longer than six minutes? One that asks you to expend more than, mass loss included, let\u0027s say 400 m/s worth of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E in one go? You\u0027re going to Jool, so an aerobrake-assisted capture burn is an option, which might well let you get away with this amount. After all, as long as you get any capture at all, even a super eccentric one, you\u0027ve safely arrived. Afterwards, you can either lower this orbit through successive aerobraking/further burns, or tweak your orbit at apoapsis to target Laythe and aerocapture there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe point of this thought exercise is this: once you have figured out your maximum expected burn length, you can design your spacecraft to the most mass-efficient specifications possible to supply full engine power for just that long and no more than that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example: to generate 216 Ec/s with RTGs, you need 288 of them, and that weighs 23 tons. However, if you brought only enough RTGs for 66 Ec/s, you\u0027d only need 88, and they\u0027d only weigh 7 tons. Then, you need to provide 6 minutes of 150 Ec/s worth of battery storage, or in other words, 54,000 Ec. Since all batteries weight the same - 1 ton for 20,000 Ec - you can calculate that that will weigh 2.7 tons. Now your final mass for your power solution is 7 \u002B 2.7 = 9.7 tons, instead of 23 tons for straight RTGs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-25T21:46:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbut then, if you wait 10 minutes to recharge the batteries to run 20 engines for 1 minute, you may as well have 12 engines running for 2 minutes, or 6 engines for 4 minutes, and so on. it doesn\u0027t change much, your thrust is still limited by how much electricity you can produce.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand i\u0027m afraid there are no other solutions. getting so much electricity has a price. i\u0027d try with a mix: instead of 20 tons of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a.
