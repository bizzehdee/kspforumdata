It\u0027s very close to being finished, still have one problem item though.  I\u0027ve re textured the turrets to make it easier later alterations and things like kerbal paint. while hopefully staying in keeping with the original color schemes(ish)\n\nThe exception to the color is the Challenger, It\u0027s  color is as yet unfinalised, I like it as it is right now, but it may be too dark for some people\n\nThanks to work for another mod, the Challenger hull now gets a coaxial machine gun mounted at the driver view port position, it also gets a basic IVA featuring of course lots of RPM . and space for four kerbals .\n\nI\u0027ll likely fit a coxial gun to both the centurion and scorpion hull, doubt I\u0027ll get an internal into the scorp but there\u0027s a good probability that I can squeeze one into the chieftain hull, this will of course take a bit longer, but still shouldn\u0027t be much longer.\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/4pmx7/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"DYo12234","CreatedById":130916,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-09T03:41:44Z","Content":"Will you be adding in the Chieftain body and turret?

I really liked the look of that tank and I would like it if you added it back in.\n\u003E \n\nHi, as these things go it is the chieftain  ( and AS90) turret and hull that are the problem items mentioned in the post, the trouble being they are stuffed with junk geometry, that is faces and polys that are not visible.\n\nThis is far from optimal or even passable, the texture space allowed is 1024x1024 and the whole uv map is squeezed into a strip that occupies less than 2% of this space , culling these faces in order to sensibly map the model has proved to be very difficult without ruining the integrity of the external faces, so it\u0027s been slow going. ( in reality it would be easier just to remake it properly, but that\u0027s beyond the scope of this update)\n\n  I have now decided to pretty much give up on fixing these issues and just get them firing and rotating as they should and call it a day at that, but because of the aforementioned  issues it will not be able to have an IVA .\n\nSo yes they\u0027ll be back , but nowhere near how I\u0027d like them to be\n\n,"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-11T20:03:37Z","Content":"Hi all some good news for those interested parties, had a brainstorm after posting the other day and manged be devious means ( fair enough, i remade a large part of the hull)  to get the Centurion to something like a passable state AND include a basic Iva.\n\nI\u0027ve arranged it also to use it\u0027s built in targeting camera system as RPM cameras, good or what, so you can now view the cameras from IVA on the usual RPM screen, This feature has been extended to all the other turrets where possible  \n\n.With the finalising of the Centurion I\u0027m going to release (in next couple of days)  what i have done so far , It will include 1 item previously not released that was hiding in the asset files kindly passed on by PrototypeTheta, that being a miniaturized Gustav train gun, it\u0027s still not small but doesn\u0027t take 1100 kerbs to operate! \n\nThere are more views of the Centurion and the rest in the album a couple of posts up the page\n\n![TmWRcQm.png](http://i.imgur.com/TmWRcQm.png)\n\n![w5GIfaC.png](http://i.imgur.com/w5GIfaC.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-11T20:42:49Z\u0022 title=\u002203/11/2016 08:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by SpannerMonkey(smce)**\n  \npic addition"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-13T20:40:02Z","Content":"\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://spacedock.info/mod/406/NeverEnuffDakkaRedux/download/0.1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENeverEnuffDakkaRedux\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\nHI all It\u0027s here I\u0027ve finally gotten my act together and published the mod redux  to [SpaceDock](http://spacedock.info/mod/406/NeverEnuffDakkaRedux/download/0.1), feel free to download and praise or abuse as you see fit.
