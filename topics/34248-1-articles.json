If your target is in a highly epileptic orbit, then try matching this eccentricity and putting your poapsis/periapsis approximately at the same place. But that might be hard, so it\u0027s better if your target is in a near circular orbit. Then, get an orbit a few hundred kilometers above or below the one of your target, depending on where it is compared to Kerbin. Then you do as you would for a normal rendez-vous:L you wait for the orbits to align for a Hohmann tansfer. That might be long because orbiting the sun is rather ong. But just be precise and place your maneuver nodes correctly and you should be able to get a rather acceptable rendez-vous \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Uberick","CreatedById":65954,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T06:49:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E^^^ The mechanics are going to remain the same as normal docking, you\u0027re just dealing with much greater distances.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sauron","CreatedById":69931,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T07:05:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suppose, the big question I had was whether it\u0027d be more productive to use RCS or an ion engine to make the ridiculously tiny corrections that are going to inevitably pop up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T07:17:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sauron\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sauron\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI suppose, the big question I had was whether it\u0027d be more productive to use RCS or an ion engine to make the ridiculously tiny corrections that are going to inevitably pop up.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably Ion engine.
