I\u0027ve built some that have been beautifully stable at 4x speed. I just unlocked some Mk2 parts, and I\u0027m trying to take the next step - a two-seater for heavier payloads. It\u0027s been a learning experience for building heavy aircraft, a stepping stone as a player to building spaceplanes of my own design. My new design has plenty of lift and probably too much thrust, but I\u0027m having problems getting it off the runway.
