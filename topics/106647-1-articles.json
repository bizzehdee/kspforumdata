Stall behavior is simulated to an extent. Planes will lose lift at high angles of attack and slow speeds. However, the stall AoA is quite high and the resulting \u0022free fall\u0022 can still generate quite a bit of lift while falling straight down.\n\nSo there is some stall-like behavior, but it\u0027s extremely forgiving and you probably aren\u0027t going to suffer a \u0022crash and burn\u0022 from a pure stall event. However, the curves were made externally modifiable, so that they can be tweaked to provide quite a different feel if desired.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T00:55:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 12:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw**"},{"CreatedByName":"Gfurst","CreatedById":126201,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T21:18:01Z","Content":"So there still quite a bit of need for a nuFAR.\n\nStalls are happening pretty good at least for my first plane, pitching up heavily without thrust and it immediately drops its speed to around 30m/s when falling down on its nose again.\n\nAnyway, I\u0027m wondering how drag have been altered, I\u0027m having a rather bad behavior with in-line rockets generating lots and lots of drag, specific thread: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119898-Help-with-the-1-0-2-Aero?p=1913178#post1913178](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119898-Help-with-the-1-0-2-Aero?p=1913178#post1913178)"}]}
