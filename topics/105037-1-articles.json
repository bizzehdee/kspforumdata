Then we got .90 and Kerbals needed EXP and dedicated crew for each skill. We also got more Bioms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E so I ended up at 1/2 the weight of my first mission to Jool but a stock Detachable rover and room for many science. [This being my second time through, regrettably once my rovers proof of concept was realized, I stopped collecting Science. But lets assume the Kerbals didn\u0027t find it boring and just forgot to take pictures.]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other aim of this mission was to illustrate the need for the resources page and many screen shots.
