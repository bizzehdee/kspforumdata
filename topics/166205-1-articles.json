The effect of this, besides very confusing reactions to your steering input (\u0027D\u0027 probably steers left and \u0027A\u0027 right, reversing unexpectedly depending on the slope), is that the navball will be near to useless for navigation while driving, because it won\u0027t show you your \u0027heading\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHad it pointed forward, to head south and slightly west you would\u0027ve turned until your navball heading (the \u0027HDG\u0027 nr at the bottom of the navball, in your screenshot currently showing 273) read about 165-170 (180 being exactly south). You can still try this now, but due to the incorrect orientation of the probe core, that heading is going to swing violently depending on the slope of the terrain you\u0027re on and can at times be very misleading.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow it\u0027s been a good while since I last used the Engineer mod, but I remember it\u0027s possible to create custom readouts out of an extensive selection of parameters, so you might want to see if it doesn\u0027t have some sort of waypoint readout that you could enable. It\u0027s possible that those too may be affected by the probe core orientation, but it\u0027s worth a try.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf none of the above helps, then you will need to try navigating the very old-fashioned way: by the sky. Go to map mode, and try to get a bearing on the position of the Sun, Kerbin, and/or the star background, then go back to your rover and use that as reference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I really wish this forum would tell me somehow when a thread has updated between when I started a reply and when I finally post it, especially a thread was previously empty.

The effect of this, besides very confusing reactions to your steering input (\u0027D\u0027 probably steers left and \u0027A\u0027 right, reversing unexpectedly depending on the slope), is that the navball will be near to useless for navigation while driving, because it won\u0027t show you your \u0027heading\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHad it pointed forward, to head south and slightly west you would\u0027ve turned until your navball heading (the \u0027HDG\u0027 nr at the bottom of the navball, in your screenshot currently showing 273) read about 165-170 (180 being exactly south). You can still try this now, but due to the incorrect orientation of the probe core, that heading is going to swing violently depending on the slope of the terrain you\u0027re on and can at times be very misleading.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow it\u0027s been a good while since I last used the Engineer mod, but I remember it\u0027s possible to create custom readouts out of an extensive selection of parameters, so you might want to see if it doesn\u0027t have some sort of waypoint readout that you could enable. It\u0027s possible that those too may be affected by the probe core orientation, but it\u0027s worth a try.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf none of the above helps, then you will need to try navigating the very old-fashioned way: by the sky. Go to map mode, and try to get a bearing on the position of the Sun, Kerbin, and/or the star background, then go back to your rover and use that as reference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I really wish this forum would tell me somehow when a thread has updated between when I started a reply and when I finally post it, especially a thread was previously empty. My apologies for those whose quicker replies I mirrored.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that with a probe core pointing up, this is only valid on perfectly flat terrain without any slope. On the Mun, the navball heading will start changing quite a bit while driving depending on the slope, sometimes even swinging entirely \u0027backwards\u0027 (when driving up a slope).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo following your advice I moded the rover and the naveball looks like how it should have been.
