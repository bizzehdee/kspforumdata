The main problem I see with the current LP/ore system is you spend so much time on logistics of getting parts to make storage so you can send enough parts to make bigger storage and so on in a cycle until you can finally build something worthwhile. A decent heavy lifter costs a vast amount of parts to build, ore mining is very very slow - the electric drain I can live with but 10 per second per drill is terrible. Even on high time warp it takes an age to fill up and process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started out with a launchpad and a KAS hub (ship with a kerbal in and 8 winches round the bottom plus 4 movable plugs).
