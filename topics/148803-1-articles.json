After countless hours of hard work, it\u2019s very fulfilling to see a project coming to fruition. The development process of any update is long and all the steps within it are vital to a successful release; that includes this final phase, where the participation of the community has been and is crucial to polish the final details. We\u2019re almost there and we couldn\u2019t be any prouder!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u2019ll start by thanking everyone who has submitted their bug reports on the pre-release project on the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/projects/prerelease/issues\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u00A0KSP\u2019s Bug Tracker\u003C/a\u003E and congratulating the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/148724-first-winners-bug-hunting-contest/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Efirst 3 winners of the Bug Hunting Contest\u003C/a\u003E. Remember that the contest isn\u2019t over yet, so keep those reports coming!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESteve (Squelch), Dave (TriggerAu) and the QA team have been wrapping up the test cases this past week. They\u2019ve also been keeping an eye on the public tracker alongside the experimentals to keep them in sync. There have been some great reports coming in, and the Devs have been hard at work fixing, passing them to QA and Experimentals for first and second pass testing before applying them to the latest pre-release build. A big shout out to the rest of the QA team that rarely get a mention and are the unsung heroes. They have done a stirling job working through the test cases and generally being on the ball with fix testing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe pre-release has been going very well. We\u2019re spending a lot of time fixing bugs, doing performance optimisations and balancing the new features. Let\u2019s go through the details that Mike (Mu) and the team has been working on:\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThroughout the week, Jim (Romfarer) has been fixing mostly non-critical bugs, he also fixed an old bug/feature where you were not able to undo deleting a whole vessel in the editor. This is now possible and should hopefully make for a lot less grief when this happens accidentally. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to the usual round of bug fixes, Bob (Roverdude) had some time to add on the new 0.625m heat shield, and continued on the biome rework. Part of this is looking for ways to make each of the planets a bit more interesting, as well as make the maps themselves more aesthetically pleasing, since they are now visible in KerbNet (and not just via the cheat menu). Eve has now fourteen biomes, and has a much prettier \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8VnKqeX.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ebiome map\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELast week our valiant pre-release testers uncovered a logical issue that was causing Exploration contracts to only issue flyby objectives. Upon fixing that, and discussing feedback with them, we went ahead and made Exploration contracts have a 100% chance to appear if you enter Mission Control and one isn\u2019t on the board. This should go a long way towards giving career mode some more structured narrative, and has been received well by the testers. Brian (Arsonide) also worked with Jeremie (Nightingale) on changing the contract weighting logic to add a small negative weight to contracts that were read but never accepted, which should make weighing much more intelligent. Jeremie also made the tourist contracts play better with the optional Kerbal Gee functionality (including adding a small chance for a special contract).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENathanael (NathanKell), made some further refinements to Krakensbane and Floating Origin. Position and velocity precision is maintained much better now, explosions stay fixed to the ground where they occur, and vessels don\u2019t jump when you fly near them. In addition, Nathanael made the resources and modules on EVA kerbals accessible through an external cfg file to let the community modify some of their key parameters, this will solve some of the issues people had been having while adding resources to them in the pre-release. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBill (taniwha) recently returned from a trip to Australia visiting family and taking part in the Koala Space Program. On return, Bill fixed placing maneuver nodes on solar hyperbolic trajectories, and fixed the world disappearing when the camera is under \u003Ca href=\u0022http://taniwha.org/~bill/deep.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E1000m below sea level\u003C/a\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENathan (Claw) continues to add refinements and quality of life additions, as well as fixing some crashtastic bugs. Near-range targeting now has a bit more logic. If you double click on a targetable part (such as a docking port), that part will become the target, while clicking on other parts of a ship will target the vessel itself. Furthermore, clicking on the ship in control will now deselect the target. Claw also tracked down a bug that was causing the game to crash when decoupling certain parts and flying them away from the mothership. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELike most of the team, S\u00E9bastien (Sarbian) has been focusing on bug fixing, but there are 3 things that stand out among these tasks. First, Sarbian spent some time with the Text Mesh Pro font editor to add more characters to our default font. Secondly, S\u00E9bastien worked together with Nestor, Roy and Manuel on finding a solution for a issue we\u2019re experiencing with the Steam Controller in 1.2 and it looks like a solution is near. Third, but not least, Sarbian invested some time playing with Quaternions and we finally have a fix for the LT-1 and LT-2 leg rotation in the editor!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERodrigo (Roy) worked on the launcher for KSP; it has been updated according to our new patch solution and its visuals have been improved a little, too. Roy also helped fixing some bugs on the tracker, most of them regarding interface or part issues.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPablo (Paul_Amsterdam) and Leticia (Leto) are working very hard on the 1.2 teaser \u0026amp; cinematic trailer and it\u2019s looking GOOD! We can\u2019t wait to premier it and let you see the final product!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the Social Media \u0026amp; Communication front we\u2019ve been working on and implementing new ideas to enrich the content we share and to engage with the community. Andrea (Badie) wants to let you know that we\u2019re open to feedback and suggestions. Furthermore, Daniele (UomoCapra) and Alejandro (alecenturion), our business developer, will be attending Twitchcon this week, so if you happen to be there, come by and say hi! \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENestor, our producer, has some great news: the Xbox One patch has passed certification! This patch will be released this week and it will finally solve the save file issue that Xbox One players have been experiencing. Please stay tuned on the forum for the announcement. Nestor also wanted to let you know that we are still testing the PS4 patch to solve all the issues this port has presented, we\u2019ll keep you informed about the advancements, but unfortunately there are no news regarding the release date for that patch, yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESadly we have a man down for this Devnote, so no poetry from Mathew (sal_vager) due to an unscheduled excursion to the hospital. Join us in wishing him well and a speedy recovery. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u2019s it for this week. Be sure to join us on our official forums, and don\u2019t forget to follow us on Twitter and Facebook. The KSP subreddit is also a great place to hang out and discuss the upcoming update.
