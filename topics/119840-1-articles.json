With pleasing aesthetics and a cool ~5 hour burn time, this ship packs a punch! Just don\u0027t go too fast, as during testing at around 50m/s it capsized, and not the normal way, it flipped, front went way up and it just flipped. Daring test pilots Eileen and Ribvey were unscathed and were later recovered by the recovery crew in inflatable dinghies. I highly recommend Better Buoyancy because this boat was tested with that, and Hyperedit to put it in the water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/c7imHzi.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022c7imHzi.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEileen and Ribvey enjoying a cruise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1uzjYUh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221uzjYUh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was about 53m/s, stay below 45m/s for safety.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0UOyWFQ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220UOyWFQ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t forget your safety suits!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/k0jyBXb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022k0jyBXb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the VAB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can turn without even moving forward!
