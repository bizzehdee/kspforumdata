Some of it is actually published (though self-published only). One of my stories I actually wrote down about a year before I encountered KSP. But the story discusses a long space journey in a vessel I named The Far Probe. Not so long ago, I got inspired and created my fictional ship inside KSP (at least, as much as KSP would allow me to at this point).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have considered slightly modifying the tale to include the Kerbal universe, or just posting it as-is. It IS a tale about rockets and long journeys, and I wondered if there was any kind of objection to me just basically pasting it in here. Off the top of my head I\\\u0027m not remembering how long it was . . . maybe just six or eight pages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\\\u0027t know what else to do with my stories . . . any objections?
