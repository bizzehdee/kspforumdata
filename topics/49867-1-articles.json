The thing that I think is weird is that I am allow to set up an action group and spam click on the transmission button instead of returning any sample because I don\u0027t need to. This way I can harvest all the science points quickly. I personally got about 6000 science points for scanning Jool and its moons with a flyby to all of them, with only one probe. It got me thinking that, \u0022Is this really fair?, did the developers know that I can do this\u0022. I filled up my tech tree with a days playtime and now I want to create a new career were I only transmit once or return the whole sample.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you know what I mean, is this really the way of doing science, maybe in KSP but still, I don\u0027t think that the scientist on the ground is interested in the exact same 100 samples of the same thing, even kerbal scientists if you know what I mean \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tracer","CreatedById":72149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T13:54:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, i also find it a bit strange that you can just jump in and out of your ship 4 times, and send 4 eva reports - all of which earn you science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also find it strange that you can \u0027transmit\u0027 soil samples back to kerbin - seems like they have installed some kind of star trek transporter onto my ship without telling me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, it is a first go at an implementation - hopefully they have lots of tweaks / changes to make to fine tune things \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T13:58:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo really get the most out of KSP you also have to invent your own rules. Yes you can get a ton of points by doing a mission to Jool and its moons, but that is jumping in the deep end. One of my rules is to gradually work out from Kerbin, getting what I can from Kerbin and then its moons before going to the further planets. Cos really you\u0027d not explore the edge of your solar system before first exploring your home world. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClearly you already know what your doing if you can get to Jool and all its moons on low tech stuff and the tech tree is partly intended to ease new players into the game without swamping them in parts. It\u0027s been said before that experienced players could max it out in about 3 missions and then your back to being basically in sandbox mode.
