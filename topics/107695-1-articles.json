As for a example, while my opinion is that 1.0 is by far the best KSP I ever played, IMHO the UI in 1.0.x is objectively worse than in 0.90, even if because there are more menus scattered around in nonsensical places and worse, intel that should be upfront and easy to reach is tucked into the dev toolbar, in the same standing that the cheats menu. And those beliefs are not contradictory \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hawk_za","CreatedById":59433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T18:59:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am in full agreement with the op \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eman to have nose cone that do things and are not just dead weight is a great and grand thing\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"J.Random","CreatedById":63332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T19:10:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have to agree.

Minor things considering the fact that the memory leaks seemed gone and we had a more realistic aerodynamics system, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen in 1.0.2 (I didn\u0027t get the chance to install 1.0.1 before 1.0.2 came out, so I missed out on that one), the parachutes and heatshields are fixed, but now the balance is wonky enough that heatshields aren\u0027t necessary. The worst part about it is that we got a memory leak mixed in there. So mostly minor bugs mixed in with balancing.
