Ive just finished building my first PC which I\u0027m pretty happy about. Ive run into some issues. My specs are Asrock H87 Pro4 Mobo, Intel Quad I5-4570s, 2x8gb Vengance, WD Seagate 1TB HDD, Samsung SH-224DB/BEBE DVD/CD Writer, Corsair CX600M PSU, and my GTX 660 should be coming on monday. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy issue is that I\u0027ve set up everything correctly and powered it on right after I finished building it to test it. It worked fine, but I didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t connect it to a monitor. I turned it off and took it into my office to set it up. I plugged it in and plugged my monitors in. I then switched on the PSU from the rear switch and my front Molex fan spun up and the LEDs came on. It then turned off. I then pressed the power button on my case which which didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t do anything neither did the reset button. I switched it off at the PSU then switched it on at the PSU again and it still happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have already tried booting without RAM and removing everything from the mobo apart from the boot button. None of these worked. I will do the paper clip test for my PSU tonight and I will reseat everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnybody got any suggestions about whats wrong and how to fix it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIll post a reply to this thread and edit this original post to include the results of the paper clip test once I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, thanks in advance for any replies/ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-14T15:04:21Z\u0022 title=\u002201/14/2015 03:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by hotmailcompany52\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Espelling\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZedNova","CreatedById":57175,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T16:06:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid you check to make sure everything is plugged into the motherboard correctly? A picture may help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suspect it\u0027s a power supply or motherboard problem.
