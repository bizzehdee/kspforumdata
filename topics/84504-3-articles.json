After leaving Mun SOI I decided to EVA because I wanted to pull some Science data from a pair of Materials Study and Mystery Goo containers into the Command Pod (the stock Mk1 1.25m). After exiting the (very small) spacecraft the clock numbers went from green to yellow and my FPS plummeted. I assumed this was because AT was calculating my decent profile so I reentered the spacecraft, went into Map mode, and unchecked the two boxes (Display Trajectory and Auto-update iirc?) in the upper left corner. This did not help when I EVA\u0027d again. I boarded the craft again and burned a little radial out to raise my Pe out of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and that did the trick.
