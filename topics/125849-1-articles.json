I just cannot wrap my head around that. I guess the Buran was much lighter so its offset wasnt as bad, so... yea. I just cant help but think that even with a large gimbal range the Energia with the Buran crabbed all the way to orbit.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beale","CreatedById":70533,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T02:41:49Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Motokid600\u0027]Hmm...

The gimbal range and performance of the engines really is just fantastic! :)\n"}]}
