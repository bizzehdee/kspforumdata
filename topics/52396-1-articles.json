This would allow a player to output game sound to a device separately from their default device selected in the operating system settings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are several use cases why this would be very helpful. Most importantly for myself, it would allow me to isolate game sound for recording and streaming, so that alert sounds from other applications, streams I may be watching, or external voice chat does not get recorded. I expect that it may be useful in some home theater PC setups, or for people who have multiple speakers/headphones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile there are some workarounds in this area that can sometimes work, in a case where a person wants to handle two different applications\u0027 audio separately, and both those applications do not have discrete devices options, there is no way to separate their audio. I know linux systems have better OS audio handling, perhaps macs as well, but windows is not capable of per-application audio output device settings in the OS itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would love for KSP to be one of the good, quality applications that don\u0027t cause issues in this area.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nachocuban","CreatedById":100587,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T04:16:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis would be an incredibly welcome feature in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Orbital Vagabond","CreatedById":145561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T19:40:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA bit of a necro, but I\u0027d like to see this feature added to KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kilmeister","CreatedById":65062,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T14:52:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would like this as well as I have a setup where I often switch audio outputs and If I fire up KSP with a setting I don\u0027t want the only way to change it to close it down and start up again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spitfire2k6","CreatedById":146199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T09:36:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBeen waiting for this since I first got the game all those years ago! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MajorNr01","CreatedById":43823,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-21T15:14:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI support this.
