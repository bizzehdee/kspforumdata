With electrical motors, size and weight go down (assuming constant power output) if you increase the speed of the motor (thus lowering torque).

The Harmonic Drive does just that; it offers a super light-weight, reliable (little moving parts) transmission with super high transmission ratios (the rover used a 80:1 ratio on the wheels), and from what my teacher told me modern harmonic drives wouldn\u0027t be where they are today if not for the research required for the rover drives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe innovation required (to do it at manageable cost) alone will be worth it going back, even if a robot could do it a lot easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moar Boosters","CreatedById":79218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T21:21:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lajoswinkler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lajoswinkler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOf course I don\u0027t have a choice.
