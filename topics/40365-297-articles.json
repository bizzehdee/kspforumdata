Thrust received is given a formula, but for liquid fuel (best Isp) it was something like 0.0152KN/MW, so 100MW gives 1,5KN of thrust... You would almost be better to carry a reactor with you, slightly better power available, depending where in career(?) tree you are.

He could do something in the same vein as RemoteTech2. RT2 has directional dishes that need to be aligned with their counterparts to form a connection. There is no visual tracking though. You could make it that the transmitter has to be given a specific receiver it\u0027s sending to, and keep the current receiver behavior, since you are going to be piloting the receiving vessel anyway.
