The challenging player selects a hex area for the battle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Both sides agree on the number of vehicles, (Minimum of 3, and a maximum of 10 total ground, air, or sea) and the size of these vehicles.

The Challenger sets up their units within 2km of one another but no closer than 100m. Air units are placed in the nearest hex containing a friendly airfield. Sea based units are placed in any sea area within the battle hex. Take some screenshots of your craft and post them on this thread with the name of the battle listed first in the post. (Keep in mind that each turn has to be turned in within the agreed upon time, witch by default is 15 min)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. The defender does the same. Sets up their units within 2km of one another but no closer than 100m. Air units are placed in the nearest hex containing a friendly airfield. Sea based units are placed in any sea area within the battle hex. (Keep in mind that each turn has to be turned in within the agreed upon time, witch by default is 15 min). Also no defending craft may be placed within 4km-2.5km of the opposing force.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Now the finished persist file is given to the Challenger to make the first move. A player may move one of their units and then attack but may not make another move after attacking. Aircraft may of course land after attacking, in any hex adjacent to the battle hex if they can. Also aircraft may attack other aircraft before and after they have taken their turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. The defender does the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7.Rinse and repeat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVictory goes to the player with the most craft still mobile within the battle hex when all ammunition has been expired or to the last player standing. Aircraft and ships do not count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe winner gains a certain amount of Kerbitz.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo reduce the amount of exploits that can occur take screenshots of each move that include the resources tab open. If a smart missile is launched a screenshot of it in flight must be taken with the resources tab open. Only one screenshot is required per move and attack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll turns must be taken with 15 real life minutes with a player post of \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E\u0022Battle of (name of battle) Turn (turn #) File Ready?\u0022\u003C/span\u003E signaling to the opponent that you are done with that turn. Posting it in red helps others see it better. \u003Cstrong\u003EDo not\u003C/strong\u003E post the Persist file until you receive an answer of \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#0000FF;\u0022\u003E\u0022Battle of (name of battle) Turn (turn #) I Am Ready!\u0022\u003C/span\u003E from your opponent. If for some reason something comes up that prevents you from taking your turn within the allotted 15 min simply state that it may take you longer and explain why briefly. Have to walk dog, Mom is nagging me, Have to take out the trash brb, etc... When you get a response from your opponent post the screenshots and the Persist file link. If you take more than 15 min for your turn then your opponent has the option to skip your turn. This is not meant for players to take advantage of one another rather it is to ensure that Persist files are not being loaded and reloaded to ensure that your turn goes favorably. It is to reduce the possibility of exploitation. You also have the option if both sides agree to forgo this rule but I have used it with others on a personal level and discovered that they are not as good a shot as they had previously been in earlier battles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can manage to get a screen shot of your weapon detonating on an enemy craft or just before or after that would be awesome. Save me some trouble. Video of the attack would be even better and there are some free options our there. That way you don\u0027t have to hit F12 at the right moment..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso absolutely no editing of craft files or your part files to enhance the effectiveness of your craft or reduce the effectiveness of your opponent. It had perplex me for quite a while how a .3 ton projectile moving at 150-200 mps could break apart ships made of reinforced structural plates. If you are doing this and you know who you are, you will be caught and publicly ostracized and branded as a cheater. I also would like to note that I am a fan of drawing and quartering my prisoners. Just kidding. Though it would be interesting to see with 4 SRB\u0027s.

Not to big of a problem but i would have to follow this thread for everything rather than just a few things. If someone has a battle going on i would have to keep track of that, if they want to use Kerbitz to buy something i would have to keep track of that, if they wanted to design and post new craft i would have to keep track of that. When it is on one thread i cant follow everything as closely than if i split it up into several. So this battle thread is for battles, the Standing thread is for purchases, the Tier and Challenge thread is for posting challenges and keeping track of all those craft in one place, and the Buildings and craft thread is for posting combat ready designs and your creative buildings. It is far simpler for players and us to keep track of all that goes on in the game. It was either that or come up with some nifty java scripting and all though i can do that i had three days to come up with the best and simplest way to create an entire game in that allotted time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may compress into one after we get everything set up and ready for more than 8 players. Most people would only have to spend 5 min to catch up with everything. There is less irrelevant junk i have to sift through this way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo answer the second question it is not that big of a deal honestly if you just mention it to the person you are battling with. I live in the states and i am on like 20 hours out of the day lol. If someone says they are not battling you because of it just tell me and I\u0027ll talk to them. On that note of your missiles are always doing the best damage to their targets and you never miss then a video of your turn may be required, but I\u0027m sure you will be fine. It\u0027s only there to make sure people don\u0027t just reload their persist files over and over and over again. In fact if you take your turn and post the persist anyway after 15 min and still post the The \u0022Battle of (name of battle) Turn (turn #) File Ready?\u0022 that\u0027s ok I\u0027ll just make sure that your opponent posts theirs in time. If you use media fire it will tell you when the file was downloaded so you can tell if they have had it for a while if you are suspicious.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-09T11:26:04Z\u0022 title=\u002211/09/2013 11:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by camulus777\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Efixes\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Krevsin","CreatedById":83150,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-09T12:40:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, lovely stuff.
