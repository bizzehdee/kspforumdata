The engine developer is specifically intending projects made on Unity 4 to be ported to 5... \n\nBesides, Unity 5 has had *months* of beta testing. It\u0027s ready. You aren\u0027t a software dev by the sounds of it with your naive speculation that everything is going to be completely broken and hard to port.
