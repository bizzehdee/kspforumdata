It would pitch the craft away from the vehicle (firing for only 0.6 seconds) and then 11 seconds later, canards on the escape tower would deploy to reorient the craft. 11 seconds is a long time, and since we have enough torque from the pod itself to reorient it manually, we don\u0027t need the canards and can just do it ourselves.

A well placed CoM offset could probably slow this down until the LES is nearly empty. I haven\u0027t mesed a lot with the LES so I don\u0027t know exactly how fast it is, but it should be possible to minimize it with some hacks. However I don\u0027t know how much of an offset it would need.

The problem is that a proper LES would need at least 2 separate engines (3 if you want a powered decouple) you\u0027ll need high thrust escape motors which can be accomplished by the current modules, and a lower thrust pitch motor to direct the entire craft away from danger. What I ended up doing was separating it into 2 parts and forwent the pitch motor in favor of abort motors and separation motors.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T17:40:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wish there was an Orion capsule instead of using an Apollo one...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deltac","CreatedById":12493,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T21:13:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022stupid_chris\u0022 data-cite=\u0022stupid_chris\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe LES technically should thrust you away from the craft, and right as it burns out, it should flip the pod bottom facing windflow.

I actually got pretty close, and I was happy with how it turned out. I really wasn\u0027t happy the first time I saw the new LES in one of the .23.5 preview videos though, and I was hoping I could at least tweak it a bit myself. Sadly I cannot, and I\u0027m left with a part I will never touch because of how repulsive it looks when used.
