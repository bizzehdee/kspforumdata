So either you play that card, saying you have the technology, requiring huge amounts of energy, recharging, etc., or you should implement timed transfer. In that case I see some ways to handle accidents and even to \u0022track\u0022 the transfer with background processing; in fact, if the host or the target hangars are destroyed in mid-transfer, you can spawn the transferred vessel at the coordinates where it should be at the moment. Another problem is working with the ProtoVessel of the unloaded target hangar to check is the transferred vessel fits and all that; but that\u0027s also doable. What bothers me much more is the terrain; especially oceans. How could you decide if the transfer (im)possible due to terrain? I would say, that you need to access planetary height and biome maps for that and perform some heavy calculations to be realistic enough. You may even need to go as far as a real path-finding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd you don\u0027t really need the hangars in both cases. A vessel could be placed at any lat-long-alt coordinates on any body as it is. So in the first case you need some new part that acts like teleportation station; with proper FX and all. And in the second I can imagine a mod that is actually a sort of background autopilot. You switch to tracking station and tell a vehicle to move from that point to that one, which it does at some reasonable speed. I would also look at the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85630\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERoutine Mission Manager\u003C/a\u003E for some ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso could you describe some in-game scenarios for such functionality as you see them? I mean, why destroy the challenge of transportation to the far reaches of a planet?

So either you play that card, saying you have the technology, requiring huge amounts of energy, recharging, etc., or you should implement timed transfer. In that case I see some ways to handle accidents and even to \u0022track\u0022 the transfer with background processing; in fact, if the host or the target hangars are destroyed in mid-transfer, you can spawn the transferred vessel at the coordinates where it should be at the moment. Another problem is working with the ProtoVessel of the unloaded target hangar to check is the transferred vessel fits and all that; but that\u0027s also doable. What bothers me much more is the terrain; especially oceans. How could you decide if the transfer (im)possible due to terrain? I would say, that you need to access planetary height and biome maps for that and perform some heavy calculations to be realistic enough. You may even need to go as far as a real path-finding.\u003Cp\u003EAnd you don\u0027t really need the hangars in both cases. A vessel could be placed at any lat-long-alt coordinates on any body as it is. So in the first case you need some new part that acts like teleportation station; with proper FX and all. And in the second I can imagine a mod that is actually a sort of background autopilot. You switch to tracking station and tell a vehicle to move from that point to that one, which it does at some reasonable speed.

Here are my results so far:\u003Cp\u003E1) In most cases, with proper step probability construction a single MCMC walker finds a path to a reachable destination in less than 100000 generations; given the step is not too small, of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) I haven\u0027t yet established a separate thread for the calculations, so I do them in a coroutine, 10 steps per frame. This still results in some framerate decrease as the search progresses, but not considerable. As a consequence, depending on the distance and relief complexity the search takes up to 4 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Walker fails if the characteristic dimensions of a relief feature that hinders direct approach is much greater than the step (you\u0027ll see this in the pictures below).
