Since they won\u0027t be of much use without something to attach them to, an install of the aforementioned Procedural Fairings is a prerequisite.\n\nThe currently included fairings are:\n\n- Angara-style with three texture options.\n\n- generic grey fairing one w/ Black Arrow texture option\n\n- Tsiklon-style\n\n- Soyuz-style\n\n*As of version 1.1, this addon comes bundled with* [*Snjo\u0027s awesome Firespitter plugin*](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24551-Firespitter-propeller-plane-and-helicopter-parts-v7-1-%28May-5th%29-for-KSP-1-0)*.*\n\n\u003Ciframe frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Download here:**\n\n[![iFAEK7Y.png](http://i.imgur.com/iFAEK7Y.png)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rvxemqa7igmyhoy/Gryphon%20Fairings%20v1.4.zip?dl=0)\n\n**Warning: update 1.4 changes some part and texture names and might be craft-breaking!**  **For those who have a previous version installed: remove the fairings from all crafts that use it; delete the entire \u0022GameData\\Gryphon folder; install new version. Send me a PM if you need a download link to the old version.**\n\n    CHANGELOG\n    \n    1.4 \t- fixed shading bug on all fairing types- new interior for Angara textures- better texture compression used, should reduce the amount of off-colour pixels- updated typos and manufacturer info\n    \n    ________________\n    \n    1.3.5 - increased the grey texture\u0027s resolution and made a new interior for it\n    \n    1.3.1 - minor fixes\n    \n    1.3 - added Soyuz 2.1 fairing, fixed boattail of blank Angara texture (no detailing was showing up)\n    \n    1.2 - added two more texture options, updated some normal maps, added texture switcher to Grey fairing\n    \n    1.1 - added Firespitter texture switching functionality to the Angara fairing, updated Tsyklon interior\n    \n    1.01 - fixed config file for grey fairing to include the ThermalMassModifier line and...not explode.\n    \n    1.0 - initial release\n\n    ISSUES\n    \n    - Textures are way too glossy. I\u0027ll need to fix this somehow.\n    - \u0022Angara\u0022 and \u0022Grey\u0022 parts show up without texture in part list.\n    - I\u0027m bad at making believable interiors\n\n**INSTALLATION**\n\nDownload.
