You may be familiar with my first post. The schism is still here, and therefore I still have more stuff to complain about. So, I\u2019m going to make another post, even longer this time, hopefully this time with better formatting and active correction to remove bias. I really just want this whole thing to calm down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003Ethe schism\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs everyone who\u2019s ever poked KSP2 or these forums with a 39-and-a-half-foot-pole has noticed, there\u2019s a big schism in the community between what is basically two parties engaging in passive aggressive discourse on basically every single forum topic in this entire freaking subforum, even on other sections of the greater forums as a whole. The two sides, as I see it, are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn one side, there are people who have trust in the developers, and believe in a future for the development of KSP2. They see patience as a necessity to a good community, despite the fact a full release was expected 3 years ago. They think the devs aren\u2019t bad people, and they deserve trust and patience. The vision they dreamed of for KSP2 is coming, and all they need is to sit tight and encourage the developers. Eventually, one day, the version of KSP2 they get heart palpitations just thinking about will be here. A few (not all!) members of this side deny there is anything wrong with KSP2, and see genuine constructive criticism as bad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other side, there are people who have little to no trust in the developer team\u2019s competency. They see the 6 months of little tangible feature development as a sign that KSP2 is dead, dying, or doomed. The devs did an awful job launching, and the game probably won\u2019t survive very long before T2 pulls the plug on funding. They typically provide genuine constructive criticism of the game, usually with tone issues. Often they think the developers overpromised or are otherwise incapable of meeting their promises, and that the dev team is inefficient or slow at development. A few (not all!) members of this side think KSP2 is a cash grab scheme, or think everyone who bought into the game early has been intentionally misled and can\u2019t see reality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere do I stand? Well, in the past, I\u2019ve been pretty firmly in the first group, and I think I still am to some degree. However, as I step back a bit, I see the development is going really rough. The game is certainly lackluster in comparison to modding its predecessor, and I enjoy and play KSP1 way more right now. The devs are doing all they can to maintain a positive public image, and can\u2019t, because let\u2019s be honest, the launch was \u003Cem\u003Ereally frickityfracking awful\u003C/em\u003E. Communication issues, performance scares, and the incredibly buggy nature of the release has huge and long-lasting effects. Player count is not going up. Things are Not Great.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, how I see it, in my personal opinion, the devs \u003Cem\u003Estill \u003C/em\u003Edeserve some slack. The devs faced extreme hardships, and they deserve patience. In my opinion, any predatory release tactics are probably T2\u2019s fault (like, honestly, it\u2019s kinda like, their whole identity at this point in the gaming community). KSP2 is objectively not very good right now, but recently the devs have managed to remove a TON of huge and pressing bugs. Performance has freaking skyrocketed, pun intended, and multiple people I know are now capable of running it on their machines. Foundations have been getting put in place for future updates. I have trust in the developers and a good belief that KSP2 will, one day, a year or three down the line, meet its promises, and I will be encouraging and patient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut honestly I\u2019m not here to talk about all that. I\u2019ve got like, a much more pressing problem to talk about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003Ethe actual issue of the schism\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019m not here to focus and fixate on the squabbles. I hate to participate in them, they make me feel icky. I don\u2019t want to fuel the fire, because it\u2019s an objectively really really big and long-winded fire that I subjectively just want to see the end of. I think my last post \u003Cem\u003Econtributed \u003C/em\u003Eto the fire, because more of it than I\u2019d like was centered around \u201Cno guys devs actually good\u201D, but I realize standing behind my opinion and tainting the possibility of neutrality of my post probably detracted a lot from it and was in general disagreeable to the side I wasn\u2019t a part of. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve cut down on that, and I\u2019ll be spending the next obscene number of pages focusing on this community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fact there\u2019s a schism at all is harrowing, is it not? Let\u2019s think about what both sides have in common: we\u2019re all fans of KSP or KSP2. We\u2019re all astrophysics majors, rocket scientists, dorky nerds who like space, armchair engineers, computer scientists, and geeky nerds who play with model rockets in their backyard. We all are disappointed by the state of KSP2. We all looked at the trailer and probably died of heart attack at least three times each. Nobody can say that KSP2 is really superior to KSP1 with mods, in terms of performance, features, playability, stability, support, customizability and in some cases even graphics too. We all have been impacted by the really awful launch. We all participate in the community, regardless of whether we argue or just chat or just lurk, and want to play a fun game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat differences do we have? Well, one side thinks KSP2 will be good and the devs deserve slack, and one side thinks KSP2 won\u2019t be good or that the devs are meanies. Well, when you stack it up like that, it seems kinda silly how we\u2019ve driven a wedge between the two parties who both just wish they could enjoy KSP2 as much as the release trailer promised. We\u2019re all KSP dorks who just wanted a cool sequel like the one in the trailer. We can all agree we don\u2019t have that yet. Is it coming? Depends on who you ask. I think so, but my opinion is not relevant to this part of the post.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019ve stayed off the forums for a while. I\u2019ve lurked a lot, checking the forums basically daily, since my last post. Most of my interactions with the community since then have been posting youtube videos and responding to comments on the original post. I tried to come back and have a good time, but the sense there was this unkillable beast of flame wars and tension writhing in one of the most active categories of this forum is at least a little unsettling. It says a lot about the lack of coherence and unity in the community if people can split themselves for OVER HALF A YEAR over an issue like this. And don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s a huge and stressful issue. But how I see it, this is no excuse for how we (me included) have been treating others on the forum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003Ewe are the schism. that\u0027s us.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u2019s a friendly reminder: Community is \u003Cem\u003Eeveryone\u003C/em\u003E. Community is you specifically. Community is also me. Community is also my friend Steve. Community is also the mod \u0026amp; dev teams. Community is every member who reads this page or responds. Community is a Lot of people. In fact, community, as it so happens, is \u003Cem\u003Eall \u003C/em\u003Eof us. We did this. Nobody is at not at fault to some degree. We\u2019re to blame. We\u2019re responsible for fixing this, me included, you included, and we\u2019re responsible for being nice to the community (this includes everyone in the community). As a community it is OUR duty and responsibility to not be mean or blind about it. WE are the community. Please take a second to just read over this paragraph and internalize it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis post here is the next chapter of my participation in trying to patch the schism, but no one single dweebus such as myself can do this alone. But seeing the state of these forums doesn\u2019t give me confidence we can recover naturally anyways. We\u2019ve already torn this huge gap in the community, and if we don\u2019t close it, that gap will stay there. If it\u2019s announced tomorrow that funding gets slashed severely, there will still be individuals who claim that the devs will rise from the ashes and miraculously make one of the most ambitious video games in gaming history. If KSP2 miraculously gets an update tomorrow that makes it completely exactly how we all wanted it, colonies and interstellar included, hundreds of handcrafted star systems, there will still be individuals who claim it doesn\u2019t meet standards and bash it on the forums.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot one year ago, the KSP forums community was a freaking amazing place to be. We\u2019d all go screw around with silly mods, make cool videos, share epic screenshots, say \u201Cguys won\u2019t KSP2 be so cool when it releases\u201D while ogling at some dev videos, and collaborate together with massive and elaborate community projects, and I would be hard pressed to find a single genuine insult anywhere on the forums, which still had like bajillions of active members. I really miss that community. I want it back, if that\u2019s okay with you guys. I don\u2019t like this place very much right now, and I can\u2019t convince myself to stay active here for very long, because I simply don\u2019t like the vibes that like 40% of the forums radiates and the other 60% is actively trying to ignore or pretend isn\u0027t a problem. Multiple people have left the forums before my eyes due to this issue, some even having directly contacted me to talk to me about it, because what I described in my first post is exactly why they left.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a genuine issue. These forums are not as fun to stay in as they used to be, and the sense of unity and community and fun is severely damaged. This is a genuine concern I genuinely raise about the genuine state and genuine future of these forums. I don\u2019t know how else to emphasize \u201Cguys this is a problem, we should fix it together\u201D. If this post hasn\u2019t convinced you \u201Cmaybe we should be nicer to eachother\u201D then I don\u2019t know what to do, since this is the last thing I can think of to do, unless I wanna write four thousand words next time I make a big post. Which I don\u2019t feel like doing. Please don\u2019t make me have to write another post. I have carpal tunnel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003Eok, cool, whatever, so what do you propose we do then, dweebus?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI genuinely don\u2019t know. My guess is to start along the lines of \u201Cbe nice\u201D but that\u2019s a lot easier said than done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of mean comments thrown at people. I\u2019ve seen a lot of passive aggressive ickiness from both sides. I\u2019ve seen a lot of people just joke and make fun of other people for having an opinion that is not theirs. I\u2019ve seen people start cursing out eachother or even hurling slurs over something as silly as \u201Cshould there be this thing in this silly computer program about silly green aliens doing rocketry\u201D or perhaps \u201Cwhy isn\u2019t this thing here in this silly computer program yet\u201D. And, mind you, this is all the stuff I\u2019ve seen AFTER the moderation team filtered out the worst and most rulebreaking attacks. I\u2019m not a mod, so I have absolutely no clue what the worst of the worst looks like. All I know is what I\u2019ve seen can only be the tip of the iceberg.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what I propose is maybe just like, let\u2019s all collectively resist the urge to yell at people who don\u2019t share our opinion. Let\u2019s also collectively resist the urge to yell at people who yell at us. Those usually are conducive to a good community, I would assume. Maybe we can set some collective terms for what we want, such as \u201Cconstructive criticism is good but let\u2019s be nice about it\u201D, or maybe \u201Clet\u2019s all agree KSP2 isn\u2019t perfect yet\u201D, or even perhaps the apparently very controversial and difficult to understand \u201Ci don\u2019t like to be called a [insert long string of swear words]\u201D. Those seem like reasonable demands to make of our friends and allies here in the community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I don\u2019t have a good idea of what we as a community should do. These situations probably have a lot more nuance to them than I can immediately think of, and my solutions aren\u0027t easy nor universal. I don\u0027t have an objectively untinted view of the situation, and I don\u0027t have a bird\u0027s eye view like moderators or developers might. I, as a dweebus member of the forums with no qualifications, really do want you all to collaborate and work together to find a way to make things better here. I want people to start thinking of ways to make the community a less toxic and flame-infested place, and I can\u2019t do it alone. I\u0027m not that good with people. Plus, you can\u2019t do it alone either, since you too are just one person. Can we perhaps do this together please?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019d like to think this post is less of \u201Ci\u2019m complaining, but loudly, and then some people agreed with me\u201D like last time, and more \u201Ccall to action to help actually make the community less mean to eachother\u201D or perhaps even \u201Copen letter\u201D in style and purpose. Like seriously I really just want me and everyone else to be able to enjoy the community like we did before. I really want us to be a unified, collaborative community again. It really hurts to see people just being like this to eachother.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003Ea conclusion i guess\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, so, to recap: we\u2019re all being mean to eachother, despite the fact we\u2019re pretty similar in the end. This is bad, because being nice to eachother is good. We should all make an effort to be nicer, so that people stop leaving and people start enjoying the forums more.
