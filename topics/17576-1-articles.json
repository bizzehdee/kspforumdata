This craft is surprisingly stable, it never flapped like a bird (like some of mine tend to do). It can reach sustained hi-altitude flight at 15,000 metres, and has really good air grip. Plus the way I made this makes the afterburners really look menacing at night. Its max speed gets over Mach 1, but surprise me if it can do better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Catfish9200","CreatedById":8657,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-23T06:31:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWoah, I really like the looks of this ship, I\u0027m going to try it out right away.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlueFalcon77","CreatedById":12907,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-23T07:00:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you, Catfish.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlueSubstance","CreatedById":40362,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-23T09:06:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPretty cool plane!
