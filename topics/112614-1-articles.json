I remember flying my first space plane and I was able to track my location via the Orbit map which made it much easily to keep track of the locations of my current objectives when doing missions and whatnot, however I just loaded up a new plane and when I switch to the Orbit map it no longer shows my plane, however it does center the map on my location. Is this normal? Did I hit some button I shouldn\u0027t have? I tried googling and I can\u0027t seem to find this issue anywhere. Any help would be appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T23:26:19Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 11:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OrangeTang\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T23:03:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi OrangeTang, is this plane a probe?
