At the 100k warp, ships can pass right through planetary bodies. After the \u0022warp to\u0022 feature is made stock in 1.0, it would be nice to get higher warp levels without having to mod the game. It would also be nice to have some safety checks hardcoded into the game too. What I mean by this is say for instance you are shooting for a aerobraking maneuver at Duna. Before the warp is even initiated, the game should check for what date and time is currently predicted for an encounter with Duna\u0027s atmosphere. Then, create a node, either hidden or visible based on user preference, so that the game knows it has to reduce warp to make sure it doesn\u0027t warp right through the atmosphere, or collide with Ike, or get slung out into no man\u0027s land. This is a doable thing I would think.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelsteele3","CreatedById":127113,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T13:16:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSP Already has X1 time warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E del wit it\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T13:21:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am not 100% sure but I believe if everything you have in the game is in stable orbits that have 0% chance of intersecting another SOI \u003Cstrong\u003EEVER\u003C/strong\u003E, then any level of time warp works.
