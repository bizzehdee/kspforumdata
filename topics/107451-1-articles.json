Do they produce enough power per unit fuel to enable them to power the drills and ore refiner, perhaps at such a distance from Sol that the solar panels are not viable? I can\u0027t think of any other applications where I\u0027d want to trade fuel for electrical charge.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T16:20:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022THX1138\u0022 data-cite=\u0022THX1138\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDo they produce enough power per unit fuel to enable them to power the drills and ore refiner\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, even if you\u0027re foolish enough to sit there mining the launchpad \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E.

This isn\u0027t as good as a solar ion, but is twice as good as an LV-N and far less massive, so has its uses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main use I see for fuel cells, however, is mining the moons of Jool. Solar panels are reportedly pretty much useless beyond Dres now, and mining takes a fair amount of power. As do the rover needed to move a very heavy mining rover.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
