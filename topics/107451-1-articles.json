Do they produce enough power per unit fuel to enable them to power the drills and ore refiner, perhaps at such a distance from Sol that the solar panels are not viable?

This isn\u0027t as good as a solar ion, but is twice as good as an LV-N and far less massive, so has its uses.\n\nThe main use I see for fuel cells, however, is mining the moons of Jool. Solar panels are reportedly pretty much useless beyond Dres now, and mining takes a fair amount of power. As do the rover needed to move a very heavy mining rover."}]}
