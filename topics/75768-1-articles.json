A team of physicists are working on what they say is going to be the most precise \u0022clock\u0022 ever. So, their plan is to send many of these quantum clocks up into orbit. The clocks will then prepare entangled particles (for those of you who don\u0027t know, entangled particles [usually photons] are particles that are... well, entangled. If one particle is observed [presumably in a superposition before the observation] to have a certain spin, then the other particle in the entangled pair will have it\u0027s spin relative to that. It isn\u0027t always opposite or the same, but if one particle changes, the other will change based on that change as well. Entangled particles can be used as a data link, as some Dutch scientists just managed to do, that can \u0022communicate\u0022 at roughly 10000 times the speed of light, which, for all human perception is concerned, is instantaneous.). The clocks will form a link using these particles and will become a sort of \u0022quantum network\u0022. If only we could do more with entanglement; it\u0027s just too fragile of a state. That\u0027s why quantum computing is out of our reach at the moment. On the other hand, quantum entanglement has shown effects after breaking, too (not entirely sure what, though), and quantum physicist Seth Lloyd suggests did some of his own research that brings to mind that if one were to make a camera that filters out all photons except for the photons that have had their entanglement broken, it could open up possibilities of camera flashes and sensors that use this, and therefore would eliminate all unwanted background light that can generate fuzz. We\u0027re finally bridging into quantum data and similar things.

I forgot to mention that these clocks are atomic clocks, as well, so it is pretty much a network of incredibly accurate clocks linked together to (presumably) form an average of their data at incredibly fast speeds, thanks to the entanglement link. So, if one clock has an error of a microsecond or two, it will be quickly leveled out using the link. The reason they use entanglement is because at the accuracy of these atomic clocks, speed-of-light communication (radio waves and other light-based com systems) just won\u0027t do.

I have an algorithm that can do a 1000x \u0022compression\u0022 using modern tech, and can be expanded up to 1Mx potentially. There are actually powerful enough solid state QCs to do rudimentary quantum information processing on a cell phone now. It\u0027s generating the signal that\u0027s the problem. So far, I\u0027ve only figured out how to squish 400MHz worth of data into it, and you can do better than that with ordinary cell tower. I\u0027m looking into EPR for an alt generator, though, which would bring me to 10\u003Csup\u003E12\u003C/sup\u003E Hz, potentially.
