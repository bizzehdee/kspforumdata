This has actually gotten me thinking about how I would accomplish it... I do actually code stuff with Unity (for 3 years now) so learning the KSP syntax wouldn\u0027t be too tough. The hardest foreseeable part of the plugin would be adding the \u0022Part Health\u0022 variable to the config so that the parts can determine whether or not they\u0027re working. Generating the radiation is pretty easy, I\u0027d just have to look into whether or not the radiation travels through planets without Mag-sphere (I think it does... I should know this!) to decide if I should use raycasting for determining how much radiation the ship receives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty easy plugin, actually, I\u0027d just have to redirect my attentions from modeling to programming, but I think if I can get 3_bit trained well enough in that field and the current projects finished I can do it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E No guarantees ATM, however. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy stuff on the U3D forums, if you want it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/179697-Vehicle-Access-System\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008000;\u0022\u003E\u0026lt;CURRENT\u0026gt;\u003C/span\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EVehicle System\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/137446-Door-Opener-Script\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E\u0026lt;OLD\u0026gt;\u003C/span\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EDoor Opener\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/155481-Simple-Aquaphysics-Package\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E\u0026lt;OLD\u0026gt;\u003C/span\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EBasic Flotation\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
