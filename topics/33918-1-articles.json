They would for example, press 1 to switch sabers from air to jet mode, 2 closes cargo bays, 3 starts up lights, etc. Anyone know how to do this, it would make my life a lot easier?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"msyblade","CreatedById":69250,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T06:41:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the VAB, next to the \u0022parts\u0022 tab in the upper left, there is a tab labeled \u0022action groups\u0022. Click that tab, and select a category. then click a part on your ship and it will move it into the selected category, and you can pick an action for that part. For instance, if you pick \u0022Gear\u0022, then point at your landing struts, you could select \u0022Toggle Gear\u0022 or \u0022Lower Gear\u0022. Then when you hit the Gear key, what you selected will occur. (Or Lights, or all of your solar panels at once, etc. . .) This can be useful for staging, decoupling, and landing. The \u0022Custom\u0022 tabs are your number keys 1-9 (along the top, not the Numpad). Also, symmetry works for action groups, so you need only select 1 of your 3 solar panels if they were placed in symmetry mode. Hope that helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T06:43:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the VAB, on the top bar, left of the place where you name your craft there\u0027s two button, one says \u0022parts\u0022, the other \u0022action groups\u0022. Click on the second one, and there will be the normal actions, such as lights, brakes, SAS, etc and some called \u0022action group 1\u0022 and so forth to 10. Just click on one of those, then if you click on a part in the VAB, some options will appear in the left part of the screen depending on the part you selected. If you click on an action group then click one of the listed actions, it will add this to the action group. So if you click on action group 10, then on an engine and then select \u0022toggle gimbal\u0022, then when in flight, if you press 0 the gimbal on the selected engine will toggle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you can understand this nonsense! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: dammit ninja\u0027d!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-20T06:43:40Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2013 06:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by stupid_chris\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Egrr\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Weatherman159","CreatedById":48008,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T06:48:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you both misinterpreted what the OP is asking.
