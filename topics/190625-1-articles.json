Design your base so that the center of thrust aligns with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E when empty. Then adjust fuel level in various tanks so that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E remains along the same line.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeadJohn","CreatedById":201293,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-26T15:40:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe easiest way IMO is to keep all your fuel near the middle (mass-wise) of your base, so that the center of mass does not shift as you burn fuel during landing. Here are some ways to do that:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Design\u00A0your base starting with fuel tank and engine as the center core, then build 2 or more\u00A0\u0022wings\u0022 that extend sideways. All wings need to be similar masses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Design your base without any fuel or engine. Then find the center of mass indicator, place a docking port or decoupler just above or below, and add fuel and engines to that port. This is similar to a \u0022skycrane\u0022 concept.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Build your horizontal base in a straight line,\u00A0more like a rocket and have the engine aimed lengthwise. Land vertically on the engine, then use reaction wheels or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E to tip over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fierce Wolf","CreatedById":200019,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-26T17:29:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat i did: Use 8 side mounted engines and a main engine on the back of the base module. Once the landing starts, turn off the main and on the side rockets. Adjust thrust limit on the one\u0027s that are pushing too hard and try to keep it even, you should have enough time to check which rockets need compensation. Sounds complicated but it\u0027s actually simple, becames routine after the second module of your base.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-27T09:00:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m guessing that even though you have an even distribution of fuel tanks they aren\u0027t being used evenly and so the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E shifts.
