You can see the [docking rules here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79594-Docking-and-Vessel-Type-Rules-%280-23-5%29), and naming convention generally follows suit. I think there are a few occasions where the names will revert strangely, but if your station is actually labeled as a station, it should remain the parent when docking anything of lower priority. If docking \u0022base\u0022 or \u0022station\u0022 craft, then the name will still change.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"}]}
