You can see the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79594-Docking-and-Vessel-Type-Rules-%280-23-5%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edocking rules here\u003C/a\u003E, and naming convention generally follows suit. I think there are a few occasions where the names will revert strangely, but if your station is actually labeled as a station, it should remain the parent when docking anything of lower priority. If docking \u0022base\u0022 or \u0022station\u0022 craft, then the name will still change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
