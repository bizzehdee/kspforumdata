You can go ahead with contracts to fund your own agenda. Personally, I find that even more entertaining than sandbox.\n\nThe point of a campaign or career game is to provide some sort of context, and be immersive, IMO. That I have to actively alter the way I view contracts is in fact anti-immersive. I have to assume any pure science contracts are not \u0022contracts,\u0022 but ideas from my own scientists, for example. I have to think of the funds not as payment, but as budget. \n\nLike it or not, unlocking tech is the only reward system. We can all play for our own reasons, but there is some psychology at play that none of us really have control over. People like ticking off boxes in games unconsciously. This has been well examined and is true. \n\nIf science was actually useful, then that would be another kind of reward. If the solar system were variable, and you needed to map/do science to unlock useful data---like doing atmospheric experiments would give you something like the trajectories mod *for that world-*--then we\u0027d actually see exploring as rewarding (in replay). The whole career/contract/science/tech part of the game is deeply flawed. The tools and funding are a grind, not a challenge. It\u0027s just a matter of how many annoying early game things you have to grind through, then funds and tech entirely disappear as a problem. That is true without using \u0022strategies\u0022 (which I don\u0027t) since they are so OP now, that it eliminates even those small speed bumps. Career doesn\u0027t feel like management to me at all. It doesn\u0027t feel limiting past the early grind.
