I view career as so much more than \u0022unlocking stuff\u0022. It\u0027s about accomplishing what you can with the tools and funding you have available, then being rewarded for your successes. Once the tech tree is fully researched, the game doesn\u0027t end: you still have your reputation and funds to balance and you still have plenty to do from that point onwards. You can go ahead with contracts to fund your own agenda. Personally, I find that even more entertaining than sandbox.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point of a campaign or career game is to provide some sort of context, and be immersive, IMO. That I have to actively alter the way I view contracts is in fact anti-immersive. I have to assume any pure science contracts are not \u0022contracts,\u0022 but ideas from my own scientists, for example. I have to think of the funds not as payment, but as budget. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike it or not, unlocking tech is the only reward system. We can all play for our own reasons, but there is some psychology at play that none of us really have control over. People like ticking off boxes in games unconsciously. This has been well examined and is true. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf science was actually useful, then that would be another kind of reward. If the solar system were variable, and you needed to map/do science to unlock useful data---like doing atmospheric experiments would give you something like the trajectories mod \u003Cem\u003Efor that world-\u003C/em\u003E--then we\u0027d actually see exploring as rewarding (in replay). The whole career/contract/science/tech part of the game is deeply flawed. The tools and funding are a grind, not a challenge. It\u0027s just a matter of how many annoying early game things you have to grind through, then funds and tech entirely disappear as a problem. That is true without using \u0022strategies\u0022 (which I don\u0027t) since they are so OP now, that it eliminates even those small speed bumps. Career doesn\u0027t feel like management to me at all. It doesn\u0027t feel limiting past the early grind. It really is hardest right at the very start (great for noobs?), then might as well be sandbox/science mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t see it as fixable \u0022within the box.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Torquemadus","CreatedById":97777,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T19:56:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Deddly\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Deddly\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt seems to me that a deadline makes a lot of sense when they are making deals with other companies for merchandise, possibly advertising (and maybe redistribution?) etc.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad often make vague references to business deal negotiations in the devnotes.
