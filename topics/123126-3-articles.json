without ripping the wings off, as your angle of attack more closely follows your prograde vector), so the key to doing this effectively would be to develop a really *long*\u00A0spaceplane that\u0027s basically a flying-wing\u00A0(so you can have low wing loading but still have\u00A0high wing-sweep). \u00A0This also lends itself well to hypersonic deployment, since a plane with lower wing-loading flies higher at the same speed (and thus flies in lower dynamic pressure).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003EI\u0027ve\u00A0always been a fan of designing planes to have really low wing-loading, but in this case it makes a lot of sense. \u00A0Larger wings mean the plane masses more- so its stability is less likely to be adversely affected by the deployment of a given size rocket- and planes with lower wingloading have an easier time dolphining above their max cruising altitude and deploying their payload in a stall, yet still safely\u00A0recovering afterwards (as lower wing-loading also means lower stall-speed).\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003EFinally, since the spaceplane would, at best, only be suborbital (if it even crossed the Karman Line at all), it wouldn\u0027t have to worry about hauling those huge wings all the way to orbit, or indeed spending much of the flight profile at all at altitudes where wings would only be deadweight. \u00A0The rocket in the cargo bay,\u00A0meanwhile, would reap all the benefits of a higher deployment (thus enabling use of more fuel-efficient engines) without having to worry about extra mass...\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003EHonestly, I think\u00A0the biggest problems with Stratolaunch previously were that they deployed a small solid rocket at a comparatively low altitude and speed,

exhaust pressure (which suffers less from ambient presdure)\u00A0and actually detract from aerodynamic stability due to concentrating mass at the wrong end. \u00A0Stratolaunch should have used a liquid rocket (probably KeroLOX as it is least cryogenic) for its higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E, which would

and speed were a mistake, meanwhile, because they detracted from the benefits of an air-launch. \u00A0If they were going through all the trouble of designing their rocket to launch from a plane, they shouldn\u0027t have utilized a modified commercial subsonic plane (I can see that they did this to try and save on R\u0026amp;D, but it ultimately limited them to a very small rocket, which still proved quite complicated and expensive to air-launch, but derived very little benefit from the modified commercial plane\u0027s comparatively\u00A0low cruising

BIG (so it could carry a larger rocket), with huge wings and engines/shape optimized for hypersonic flight at very high altitudes... \u00A0Sure, it would have been much\u00A0more expensive to design and build in the first place, but it was the only way they were ever going to get their ongoing costs low enough to turn a real profit vs. conventional launches...\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNone of it may matter too much now, as SpaceX and the British Skylon project (a true, orbital spaceplane- which could just as easily be modified to fly a suborbital trajectory and leave circularization for the cargo\u00A0in order to carry a heavier payload on each flight) have rendered StratoLaunch largely irrelevant anyways.
