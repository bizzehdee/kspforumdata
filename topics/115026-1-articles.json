I always get confused on which) are set to pitch only and the rear ones are set to pitch and roll.\n\n![YYCUT6p.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/YYCUT6p.jpg)\n\n![INqGEhL.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/INqGEhL.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-04T12:47:26Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2015 12:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MartGonzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"rofltehcat","CreatedById":145224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T11:07:40Z","Content":"I yesterday had a problem as well where my front control surfaces would suddenly invert.
