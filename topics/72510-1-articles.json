Forgot to put a probe core on the launcher, so Jeb hopped in one of the planes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings actually went pretty well, until I dropped the first stage. Not sure why, but almost every tank in the rocket separated and started drifting apart. The engines kept burning, spreading out the tanks. It takes me a couple seconds to rearrange the stages and drop the spaceplanes. It takes me a lot longer to cycle through all the bits of debris until I found Jeb\u0027s plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point engines are spiraling off into the distance, tanks are exploding all around Jeb, broken bits of rocket and plane are falling from above and Jeb is (rightfully) losing his mind. One of the planes smashes through the mass of fuel tanks, sending the last of the engines careening off into what is now a debris cloud and setting off even more explosions. Miraculously, Jeb\u0027s ship appears undamaged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb made a valiant effort to fly out of the debris field, he really did.

Like a bolt from the blue, one of the other planes comes crashing down from above, shears off two thirds of the starboard wing and its engine.

I quickly slapped together a ship, the upper stage consisting of a bunch of nervas in a circle around a tank, and lifted by a fairly standard orange tank setup. It was horribly thrown together and the thing barely flew straight, it took the best of my piloting skills to keep it in line for the direct ascent to Mun flight plan. At about 60km, I realized that the fuel lines were all done wrong and the lifter would stage improperly, which I could tell would ruin the mission and leave me without enough fuel to save the kerbal. Instead of reverting the flight, I began manually staging and transferring fuel mid burn from multiple tanks, keeping the thing pointed straight while balancing the fuel transfer as best as I could. After about a minute of insane stress, the fuel on one side ran out and the entire ship began to spin wildly. I decoupled the lifter with the throttle on, spun the upper stage to the right direction, and fired the nervas, barely missing the remnants of the lifter. I flew to the Mun in record time, and proceeded to rendezvous with the kerbal in his highly eccentric orbit. Once I managed to get close, I realized that the kerbal could not hop in on his own without fuel, so I had to move my (RCS lacking) ship just so he would bump into the ladder and could grab on. After successfully picking him up, I flew home and landed safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was by far the most insane mission I have ever flown.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"XIRA","CreatedById":42509,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-16T10:32:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Emy first airplane flight, I had no idea how to make a good working craft and the result was that it immediatly started spinning after take-off, for some reason it just magically landed on it\u0027s gear while still spinning like crazy, nothing broke off\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EvilotionCR2","CreatedById":27754,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-16T14:34:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENone, I always record everything in H264 format and cut out funny bits.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Epthelyn","CreatedById":57970,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-16T17:16:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESkimming the surface of Tylo and missing by less than the width of the solar panels I had on the craft I took there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was one of those times when I just had to take a moment to believe that had been real, by which time I was too late to take a screenshot, let alone fire up a video recorder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe worst part is that the encounter was the result of a post-quicksave attempt to save a little fuel which would\u0027ve otherwise been lost to gravity, which I ran with because I\u0027d just quicksaved.

Well, I have Jeb trying to land at the North Pole for some science and things got a bit dicey when in very short order the reentry burned through my first five heat shields and quickly ate away all of the science gear and struts. Luckily I had planned for this and there was two heat shields in between the cockpit and the rest of the ship. The first one burns away very quickly, and the second one is clearly going to burn through as well. I know that if this happens, the capsule\u0027s own ability to survive is basically zero. But I had no more engines left to reduce my speed. I am sitting there watching the heat bar on the last shield rapidly rising and I am thinking \u0022How can I slow him down?! All I have is a capsule, a parachute that wont work because of my altitude, and the escape rockets for failed launches....THE ESCAPE ROCKETS!\u0022 and I quickly readjusted the staging, during which time my last heat shield burst. I could see my capsules heat level rising rapidly and I slammed my finger down on the space bar, activating the two separatrons on the capsule. The heat level reached about two or three pixels away from max before it paused and started dropping down. Once the glow faded away, I deployed my chute and safely landed on the ground with a sigh of relief.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wampa842","CreatedById":85841,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-16T22:21:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was doing some EVA maintenance of a disabled ship that had no electricity with its solar panels retracted.
