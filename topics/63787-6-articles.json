Not surprising considering how big Jupiters SOI is (48.2 Gigameters [Well, for it\u0027s distance from the sun])! Converting this to a KSP scale, a light gas dwarf could easily orbit at that distance, especially when it is taken into account that Jools SOI is is (Acording to the wiki) 2.4559852 Gigameters, and multiplying that by 10 due to real life distances we find that Jool has an SOI roughly 2 times smaller than KSP scale Jupiters. So, knowing that Saturn orbits the sun 1.84 times the distance of Jupiter (1,433,000,000 km, compared to Jupiters 778,500,000 km) We can safely assume that a body orbiting 2 times further away from Kerbol than Jool, would be able to house an Kepler 11f sized body orbiting at the edge of its SOI without much change to the COM!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways if you still want to stick to your original idea, that\u0027s fine.
