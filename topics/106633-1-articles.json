All I did was change/add some parts and configs. Any possible additions in the future would still follow Nazari1382\u0027s style and use his textures.*\n\nI\u0027m personally using this mod everyday for various purposes and goals. It provides a very good part collection for extraordinary contraptions, sci-fi 60\u0027s style space stations, and ground bases. One can even use for underwater bases on Eve or Laythe or even Kerbin! All in all, it is a perfect part selection for most crazy purposes.\n\nChanges to the original part-pack:\n\n**removed Aurora thruster**\n\n**added 1x1 glass panel**\n\n**removed mk1 orbital enclosure**\n\n**added 4x4 panel**\n\n**added a lot of glass domes**\n\n**added better tri-panel**\n\n**fixed mod directory**\n\n**added flags**\n\n**proper balancing**\n\n**techtree integration**\n\n**glass tube now has fuel crossfeed capabilities**\n\n**replaced glass tube with fresh model**\n\n**compatibility with KSP 1.3.1**\n\n**TweakScale integration**\n\nChange log from 1.8 (and 1.9):\n\n**fully compatible with KSP 1.3.1**\n\n**new dome model**\n\n**4 total dome sizes (10m, 3.75m, 2.5m, 1.25m)**\n\nDownload:\n\n[SpaceDock](http://spacedock.info/mod/312/Glass%20Panes%20and%20Enclosures%20%28GPE%29)\n\n[CurseForge](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/projects/glass-panes-and-enclosures-gpe)\n\nScreenshots:\n\n[Imgur](http://imgur.com/a/wZDua) (old, will update with 2.0 release)\n\nLicense:\n\nCreative Commons (CC) 3.0\n\nOriginal partpack: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/26641-Glass-Box-Enclosure-and-Glass-panels-mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/26641-Glass-Box-Enclosure-and-Glass-panels-mod)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-25T04:04:57Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2018 04:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by 2001kraft**\n  \nCompatibility"},{"CreatedByName":"2001kraft","CreatedById":120475,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T20:09:07Z","Content":"Fixed 1x1 panel geometry!\n\nIt was a little bit too thin ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nMigrated all parts to the Structural tab.
