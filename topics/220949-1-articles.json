I\u0027ve been playing since 2011 on version 0.8.1 and I wanted to rehash some of my milestones and achievements starting from the founding of Voyager Labs back in 2013. After countless hours on the wayback machine for the KSP forums, as well as ripping through my old laptops and Imgur accounts I was finally able to find the majority of my old images, designs, mission profiles, etc. I decided about four years ago I wanted to turn this into a Youtube series, and see where it leads. Unfortunately up until recently I\u0027ve either not had the time, or not had the motivation. But, I was able to overcome this to put out a Prologue episode. As well as start a thread to keep updated videos. Any feedback is welcome, I\u0027ve not touched any video editing in about 3 years so any help is appreciated!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1GKsoIrBzGk?feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022Arcosmos: Our First Steps\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-11-24T23:08:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNicely made video. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
