Seriously people don\u0027t even get how fun these are now, and just how efficiently you can move around the system if you plan things right. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink about it this way--you can do a 4 man Duna mission with an 8 Ion tug and only enough LFO to ascend out of duna\u0027s atmosphere. You can go to Jool on less than 1t in fuel. Leave Kerbin on a sundive trajectory and then drop half your panels and use OX-STATS close to kerbol to do ultra-fast transfer to wherever you want.

Have you checked what the numbers were then? By all rights, xenon consumption is the only thing that was \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E changed in this patch, everything else got buffed. Massively. Like, power consumption per kN of thrust got reduced by 85%. Thrust itself got increased to 400% of what it was before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally, complaining that \u0022ion engines are pretty much useless now\u0022 is just like trading your Smart car in for a 16-seater bus and complaining that you \u0022can\u0027t transport any real amount of people now\u0022. I\u0027m just like, wut?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if you can prove that xenon consumption for a given ion-powered craft increased beyond what it should, then you may have found a bug that\u0027s worth reporting in the appropriate subforum (not in this one). If you have a craft with 8 ion engines in .23.5 and in consumes 3.88 xenon per second, then the same craft in .23 should be consuming 0.97 xenon per second. If this is true, then everything works as intended. If the .23 vessel consumes less than 0.97, something odd is going on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T07:24:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELammatt, you\u0027ve got to think about how these actually work in practice. Very often, especially on burns to outer planets, the most efficient ejection angle puts you very close Kerbin\u0027s shadow. Even with multiple oberth passes it behooves you to get more thrust over a shorter period of time before the sun sets. The same can happen around Joolian moons when timely captures are much more critical and you need more weight in panels to power them. I\u0027m moving landers and science labs around this way, sometimes you need 8.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superluminaut","CreatedById":58963,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T07:28:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI feel like ion engines need an \u0022ion warp\u0022, something that produces an on rails spiraling orbit.
