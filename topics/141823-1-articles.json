It almost feels like this would be an ideal extension of EL, but I suspect it\u0027s NOT a quick hack that could be applied on top of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny thoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-15T14:29:03Z\u0022 title=\u002206/15/2016 02:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by etmoonshade\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EEdited thread title\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-15T07:04:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could probably use USI Kolonization System with its Extraplanetary Launchpads integration. IIRC, the resource cost of building a rocket with that depends on its mass, not on its cost. So you could write a MM patch that makes the relevant USI modules available from the start. Then you create your own launchpad and assembly infrastructure somewhere on the KSC grounds via those modules, and build all your spacecraft there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn order to disable building rockets with money, you could use MM patches to increase the price of most common parts to absurd levels. Then it would no longer be feasible to use the VAB or SPH. The problem, of course, is that part recovery will make you huge amounts of cash. I don\u0027t know how to deal with this - but you might be able to create a modded strategy for the Administration building that reduces recovery yields to 0% or the like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for buying resources with money: you\u0027d just go to the VAB and put a pre-filled resource tank onto the pad or runway (these tanks obviously wouldn\u0027t have increased cost). Then you\u0027d use a surface vehicle or pumping network (KIS/KAS) to transfer the resources to your assembly infrastructure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-15T07:05:47Z\u0022 title=\u002206/15/2016 07:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"etmoonshade","CreatedById":1852,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-15T19:12:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMKS/OKS extends the resource chain a bit too much for my tastes, but it\u0027d definitely work in general - and you\u0027re correct in pointing out the nice integration with EL. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree that setting parts to cost absurd amounts would be weird - also, it doesn\u0027t fit in with the integration of resources into the VAB (if it\u0027s even possible, of course.) With that said, I\u0027m pretty sure I could configure StageRecovery to set the recovery value to 0.
