If you are in a equatorial orbit your camera have to be also in the same plane so that the orbit is visually only as a line and then i turn the camera around this orbit until the target orbit is also only a line. There the two orbits should look like a X and at the intersection of this 2 lines I make my planechange. After this its only burning prograde until your apoapsis reaches the target orbit and at this new apoapsis finish the desired orbit with another prograde burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreetings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBen\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"funkcanna","CreatedById":138944,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T14:32:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Barefoot Friar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Barefoot Friar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy advice to you is to get \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/220221-mechjeb\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMechJeb\u003C/a\u003E or \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/222685-kerbal-engineer-redux-v1-0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Engineer Redux\u003C/a\u003E; both of those give you the numbers you need to complete the contracts.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have mechjeb installed but no clue how to use it yet!

If that doesn\u0027t work, try doing a bit of math, subtracting various angles from 360 until you can get MJ to put up the maneuver you want.
