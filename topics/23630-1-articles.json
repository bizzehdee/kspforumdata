As this is my first I decided to choose something already built to go off of, so I went with the Bubble ship cockpit from the movie Oblivion. I choose it because its a beautiful design, simplistic and extremely unique and seemed extremely modern and spacy and I am not going to put the guns on because its not approved by the game developers and because those spots could be put to better use with other attachments. I am using Google Sketchup for most of the modeling as its a great program to get a model rolling and let you tinker and refine the design you want. It has its faults which I will brush out in 3Ds Max and then texture using Mud-Box. Let me know if I am going the wrong direction with anything as opinions and constructive criticism are welcome!!! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s9.photobucket.com/user/Lthawk77/media/SketchUp2013-04-2220-27-49-95_zpscbd8e2eb.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a92/Lthawk77/SketchUp2013-04-2220-27-49-95_zpscbd8e2eb.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SketchUp2013-04-2220-27-49-95_zpscbd8e2eb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s9.photobucket.com/user/Lthawk77/media/BubbleCockpit_zpsa8978614.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a92/Lthawk77/BubbleCockpit_zpsa8978614.png\u0022 alt=\u0022BubbleCockpit_zpsa8978614.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-23T06:51:09Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2013 06:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Phoenix-Aerospace\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ghost010","CreatedById":57302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T09:59:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eif your doing this,than you should be doing an IVA..and doing an IVA s hard so i haveheard.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"loppnessmonsta","CreatedById":58525,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T21:28:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love your concept.
