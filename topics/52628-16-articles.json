Sooo... Sharing the craft file might not be so practical. I\u0027ll do it if asked, but I\u0027ll be surprised if it works on your setup.\u003C/span\u003E Scratch that, I added a list of mods on the bottom. It\u0027ll be a bit of a process to get this working but I\u0027ll work through it if anyone\u0027s interested in downloading this craft once I\u0027m finished with its final tweaks. I\u0027ll also include a little guide on how to use it XD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut here\u0027s the mission: I\u0027m landing on Mars, the Galilean moons of the Jovian system, and Titan, all in one mission. The Galilean moons are all similar enough that I decided to use one lander for all of them - I\u0027ve named, appropriately, the Galileo. That way, I don\u0027t have to haul around the dry mass of a lander for each of them - cutting my mass requirements way down. Further inspection showed that taking off from Mars was also close enough in Delta-Vee requirements that I could do that with the same lander, too! (Powered descent \u002B Ascent from Galilean moon = ~ Ascent from Mars). So what I have then, is this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ne1AX45.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ne1AX45.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I\u0027ll be hauling him all around the Solar System, I decided to go with Hydrolox propellant to cut mass.

It would doubtlessly require a very large and heavy tank (unsuitable for a small craft such as a lander), so I\u0027ve decided that for the transportation, all the cryogens (LOX and LH2) will be stored in large Zero Boil-Off (ZBO) tanks on the mothership, then the various crafts can be fuelled up right before they perform their various missions (which max at about a month).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E///\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA quick overview of the other vehicles that will be on this mission:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mothership will carry the Crew Excursion Shuttle (CES) Galileo, the Shuttle Transportation Vehicle (STV) Dragonfire, and Titan Lander (cool, final name pending for that one). Oh, and the Mothership I\u0027ve decided to name the InterPlanetary Vehicle (IPV) Harmony.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, IPV Harmony: Mothership [VASIMR thruster, Fission powerplants]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECES Galileo: Lander for Mars, and Galilean moons. [Hydrolox MPS, Aerizone\u002BN2O4 RCS/OMS, and RTG power]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESTV Dragonfire: The Harmony will enter orbit over Mars and Callisto, so the Galileo can directly undock for those missions. For Ganymede, Europa, and Io, however, I decided it would save mass to use a tug to carry the Galileo from Callisto orbit to the other Galilean moons and back; that way I don\u0027t have to haul the Titan Lander, large habitat modules, heat shields, nuclear powerplants, etc. that are hard-mounted on the Harmony around the entire Jovian system. [NERVA-NTR MPS, Aerizone\u002BN204 RCS/OMS, and RTG power]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETitan Lander: For Titan, of course.

Galileo, for example, has the omni antenna (500km) by default, but also has a long-range antenna (I needed 2 Gm or so, but the closest I could get that was enough was 250!) for direct communication to the Mothership Harmony AND a medium-range antenna for communication to the STV Dragonfire (which will remain in orbit at 100 km, just like the Apollo CSM). Dragonfire and Harmony will also be in communication. This way, all three vessels will have comms, so if any of the links break, they will still all be connected unless a second one breaks (and even then, two can still be connected). For even further safety/redundancy, the Dragonfire will carry a single occupant Apollo-style for the Io and Europa missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now that I\u0027ve explained the circumstances around the craft, and what it needs to do and such, without further adeu, the craft itself!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JxawPRY.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022JxawPRY.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* I hacked the various engine configs on the RL-10 to make myself the fictional \u0022C-4\u0022 engine (eheheheh). It\u0027s identical to the B-2, except it\u0027s maximum thrust is only about 65 kN instead of 111, and it can throttle down to about 12%, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20090028814.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eas per a study done by NASA\u003C/a\u003E. This gives me the ability to land on the various places it needs to land on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E** As for the EM Shielding and radiation and all?... That\u0027s not simulated in the game at all \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E I just decided to include that for realisms\u0027 sake, and the EM generator is just a 235 kg procedural structural element.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*** Goldfinger assembly is part of the STV Dragonfire. It will go to Mars without it, it will go to Callisto and Ganymede with the Goldfinger still on the Dragonfire, but when it undocks in orbit over Europa and Io, the Goldfinger will undock from the Dragonfire, so that it remains attached to Galileo while Galileo goes and lands on Io and Europa.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a long conversation with an old friend of mine over Facebook about measures I\u0027d need to take against radiation shielding (If I had a mod that necessitated that. I\u0027m just such a stickler for realism \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E ), and I took some screenshots of this WIP to show him the results of our conversations; the Goldfinger assembly and EM Shield. Then I got carried away and made all this. Maybe I\u0027ll do something similar for the other crafts of this mission. Certainly the IPV Harmony (Mothership) will deserve a nice post about it! Anyways, enjoy. Be sure to give me some rep points if you likey, hehe. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and PS, yes, this craft isn\u0027t technically *finished*. I\u0027m still testing it on ascent/descent over the various Galilean moons. The calculations I did are only approximations, and I found I massively over-estimated my delta-vee requirements, so I cut them back by a lot, and now I\u0027m just making sure I didn\u0027t cut them back by \u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E much. The only thing that\u0027ll change from here, though, is the tank size if anything. The thrust on the RL-10C-4 is a wide enough range that the small changes I make won\u0027t necessitate a change in it, and, I probably won\u0027t even need to change the size of the Hydrolox tanks at all, seeing as my most delta-vee intense mission (Io) doesn\u0027t even need the main tank full if the Goldfinger is full (in fact, if the main tank and Goldfinger are both full, then it has too much weight for the single RL-10C-4 engine to land it, and if I used two of the RL-10B-2\u0027s, it produces too much thrust. The main purpose of the Goldfinger isn\u0027t to add more Delta-vee, though it does add a little more, but its main purpose is to move a lot of the Hydrolox storage into a position that provides radiation shielding for the crew (X-rays in specific), instead of keeping it in the main tank where it doesn\u0027t block as much. And I can\u0027t shrink the main tanks because it needs those full to take off from Mars, where for aerodynamic reasons it can\u0027t have the Goldfinger attached. Yeah, it\u0027s a bit inefficient, but still much better than carrying around an entire extra lander).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and I almost forgot, stats:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Mars Stage:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMars Stage gives 664 m/s (vacuum)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E636 kN - 60 kN (center RL-10B-2 engine is cut off for final moments of descent).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal mass with full Mars stage: 48 tons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGalileo alone:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~5,000 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E510.4 kN - 7.5 kN (4 outboard engines cut off, landing engine at minimum throttle)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWet mass: 33.8 tons. 10.5 tons without hydrolox. 9.3 tons without hydrolox or OMS/RCS propellant (Aerizone\u002BN2O4).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGalileo in Io configuration (Goldfinger assembly attached and full, but main tanks are not full) :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~5,500 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWet mass: 39.4 tons. 11.3 tons without hydrolox. 10.1 tons without hydrolox or OMS/RCS propellant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll get to see this baby in action when she\u0027s finished and I go to post about my Grand Tour adventure in full \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, here\u0027s some of the mods this uses off the top of my head:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Realism Overhaul (and all its required mods)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Remote Tech 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Crossfeed Enabler\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Procedural Parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Procedural Fairings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Near Future Solar Panels\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Near Future Electrical?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*KW Rocketry (I think that\u0027s where the thrust plate multi-adapators come from.

The Galilean moons are all similar enough that I decided to use one lander for all of them - I\u0027ve named, appropriately, the Galileo. That way, I don\u0027t have to haul around the dry mass of a lander for each of them - cutting my mass requirements way down. Further inspection showed that taking off from Mars was also close enough in Delta-Vee requirements that I could do that with the same lander, too! (Powered descent \u002B Ascent from Galilean moon = ~ Ascent from Mars). So what I have then, is this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ne1AX45.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/ne1AX45.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I\u0027ll be hauling him all around the Solar System, I decided to go with Hydrolox propellant to cut mass.

It would doubtlessly require a very large and heavy tank (unsuitable for a small craft such as a lander), so I\u0027ve decided that for the transportation, all the cryogens (LOX and LH2) will be stored in large Zero Boil-Off (ZBO) tanks on the mothership, then the various crafts can be fuelled up right before they perform their various missions (which max at about a month).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E///\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA quick overview of the other vehicles that will be on this mission:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mothership will carry the Crew Excursion Shuttle (CES) Galileo, the Shuttle Transportation Vehicle (STV) Dragonfire, and Titan Lander (cool, final name pending for that one). Oh, and the Mothership I\u0027ve decided to name the InterPlanetary Vehicle (IPV) Harmony.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, IPV Harmony: Mothership [VASIMR thruster, Fission powerplants]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECES Galileo: Lander for Mars, and Galilean moons.

For Ganymede, Europa, and Io, however, I decided it would save mass to use a tug to carry the Galileo from Callisto orbit to the other Galilean moons and back; that way I don\u0027t have to haul the Titan Lander, large habitat modules, heat shields, nuclear powerplants, etc. that are hard-mounted on the Harmony around the entire Jovian system. [NERVA-NTR MPS, Aerizone\u002BN204 RCS/OMS, and RTG power]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETitan Lander: For Titan, of course.

Galileo, for example, has the omni antenna (500km) by default, but also has a long-range antenna (I needed 2 Gm or so, but the closest I could get that was enough was 250!) for direct communication to the Mothership Harmony AND a medium-range antenna for communication to the STV Dragonfire (which will remain in orbit at 100 km, just like the Apollo CSM). Dragonfire and Harmony will also be in communication. This way, all three vessels will have comms, so if any of the links break, they will still all be connected unless a second one breaks (and even then, two can still be connected). For even further safety/redundancy, the Dragonfire will carry a single occupant Apollo-style for the Io and Europa missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now that I\u0027ve explained the circumstances around the craft, and what it needs to do and such, without further adeu, the craft itself!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JxawPRY.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/JxawPRY.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* I hacked the various engine configs on the RL-10 to make myself the fictional \u0022C-4\u0022 engine (eheheheh). It\u0027s identical to the B-2, except it\u0027s maximum thrust is only about 65 kN instead of 111, and it can throttle down to about 12%, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20090028814.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eas per a study done by NASA\u003C/a\u003E.

It will go to Mars without it, it will go to Callisto and Ganymede with the Goldfinger still on the Dragonfire, but when it undocks in orbit over Europa and Io, the Goldfinger will undock from the Dragonfire, so that it remains attached to Galileo while Galileo goes and lands on Io and Europa.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a long conversation with an old friend of mine over Facebook about measures I\u0027d need to take against radiation shielding (If I had a mod that necessitated that.

Then I got carried away and made all this. Maybe I\u0027ll do something similar for the other crafts of this mission. Certainly the IPV Harmony (Mothership) will deserve a nice post about it! Anyways, enjoy. Be sure to give me some rep points if you likey, hehe. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and PS, yes, this craft isn\u0027t technically *finished*. I\u0027m still testing it on ascent/descent over the various Galilean moons. The calculations I did are only approximations, and I found I massively over-estimated my delta-vee requirements, so I cut them back by a lot, and now I\u0027m just making sure I didn\u0027t cut them back by \u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E much. The only thing that\u0027ll change from here, though, is the tank size if anything. The thrust on the RL-10C-4 is a wide enough range that the small changes I make won\u0027t necessitate a change in it, and, I probably won\u0027t even need to change the size of the Hydrolox tanks at all, seeing as my most delta-vee intense mission (Io) doesn\u0027t even need the main tank full if the Goldfinger is full (in fact, if the main tank and Goldfinger are both full, then it has too much weight for the single RL-10C-4 engine to land it, and if I used two of the RL-10B-2\u0027s, it produces too much thrust. The main purpose of the Goldfinger isn\u0027t to add more Delta-vee, though it does add a little more, but its main purpose is to move a lot of the Hydrolox storage into a position that provides radiation shielding for the crew (X-rays in specific), instead of keeping it in the main tank where it doesn\u0027t block as much. And I can\u0027t shrink the main tanks because it needs those full to take off from Mars, where for aerodynamic reasons it can\u0027t have the Goldfinger attached. Yeah, it\u0027s a bit inefficient, but still much better than carrying around an entire extra lander).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and I almost forgot, stats:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Mars Stage:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMars Stage gives 664 m/s (vacuum)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E636 kN - 60 kN (center RL-10B-2 engine is cut off for final moments of descent).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal mass with full Mars stage: 48 tons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGalileo alone:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~5,000 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E510.4 kN - 7.5 kN (4 outboard engines cut off, landing engine at minimum throttle)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWet mass: 33.8 tons. 10.5 tons without hydrolox. 9.3 tons without hydrolox or OMS/RCS propellant (Aerizone\u002BN2O4).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGalileo in Io configuration (Goldfinger assembly attached and full, but main tanks are not full) :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~5,500 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWet mass: 39.4 tons. 11.3 tons without hydrolox. 10.1 tons without hydrolox or OMS/RCS propellant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll get to see this baby in action when she\u0027s finished and I go to post about my Grand Tour adventure in full \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, here\u0027s some of the mods this uses off the top of my head:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Realism Overhaul (and all its required mods)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Remote Tech 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Crossfeed Enabler\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Procedural Parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Procedural Fairings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Near Future Solar Panels\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Near Future Electrical?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*KW Rocketry (I think that\u0027s where the thrust plate multi-adapators come from.

Ignition 3 performs LOI, and ignition 4 performs TEI. Might consider using RCS hypergolics to complete the ascent, giving an extra ignition for any major course corrections or braking before Earth re-entry, since the SIVB (Second stage on Saturn IB) burns out just a hundred m/s or so from orbit - or at least it did on this test run.*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Low T/W on the SII means I needed a lot of vertical velocity at staging.
