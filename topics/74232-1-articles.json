I\u0027ve played KSP for a while now, but only recently made my modding debut together with Zarenor. (Shameless plug: Come check out our work so far over at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81981-0-23-5-GlowStrips-v0-2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGlowStrips\u003C/a\u003E!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like building large systems, to the point of rarely finishing them (quite sadly), particularly with some of the space stations I\u0027ve been putting up lately. Definitely more of an idea\u003Cem\u003Es\u003C/em\u003E-guy than the we-only-need-one-idea guy. I plan on \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E letting that happen with any add-on\u0027s I produce, btw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been seeing for a long time now what the community here is capable of making -- some of which is truly unique and inspiring -- and I\u0027d like to be a part of that and add what I can. Modding seems like the best way to keep up with what everyone\u0027s working on and with the direction of KSP right now, so here I am. I\u0027m a couple credits shy of my BS in Physics and I\u0027m getting to know C#, so, I mean, I have, like, \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003E useful skills, I guess. Take that as you will.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, general greetings, I hope everyone\u0027s doing well out there in all of your extra-low Earth orbits. Feel free to chat me if you like. I\u0027ll try to wander aimlessly into the KSP IRC by accident one of these days (\u0022Where am I?\u0022), so maybe I\u0027ll catch you there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-05T22:00:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello quantumscrewdriver, and welcome to the forum. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI never finish my stations, either.
