I only started playing this in 0.21.1 and career mode made perfect sense to me, I chose to try it stock and give up mechJeb because I wanted to prove something to myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever enough about me, I just want to posit about what sort of people find career mode, or even KSP in general fun, or not fun. How one deals with frustration and failure and how one responds to learning are somehow at the crux of this. There are people who get their enjoyment in KSP in the time they spend planning and thinking then having that borne out proving their ability to understand. Others are the shoot from the hip, charge down the corridor at the stormtroopers type who accept failure as a matter of course and who simply try again after blow ups, they get their fun not because they visualized an outcome and went through an iterative process to get there. It is possible that some people who might enjoy one of those two styles tries the other first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the charge that there is not enough documentation or enough learning structure built into the game, it seems to me that comes from a level of frustration, not so much correlated to the nerdiness of the player. Sure someone who can Google up an answer to their immediate question (which in general I have been able to when I couldn\u0027t figure something out) has more fun and being able to to navigate searching as research tool is a little nerdy I guess, but the fact is I have a lot of space knowledge and needed to do the googling, I still haven\u0027t mastered landing winged craft in KSP and I have my pilot\u0027s license. Others are stymied by the concepts of orbital mechanics, some with the requirement to think symetrically in designing boosters. However, the common threads I see for (and in) complaints are about:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) getting a leg up in terms of learning how KSP and it\u0027s underlying physics work in a way that doesn\u0027t conflict with the users learning style and doesn\u0027t mess with their frustration tolerance levels\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) being oriented towards a specific goal (SSTO, orbital space plane, docking, landing, etc) and becoming increasingly frustrated by failure\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) seeing a lack of specific reward (particularly pre 0.22) beyond self actualization for in game accomplishements \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) a lack of gamelike rules and constraints, while some of us simply add our own (I have read people who have added rules for the use of Nerva engines or RTG, many of us try like hell never to \u0022terminate\u0022 debris or missions, some expend inordinate efforts down to restarting from scratch if we kill a Kerbal) the point though is that many complain that the rules aren\u0027t there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand just since 0.22 came out:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) feeling constrained by career mode. Why there is a feeling of constraint has to do I think with people comparing themselves with the most vocal, nerdy and successful of us, who, when we found we were given a set of rules under which there was a clear goal but constraints on achieving the goal we embraced and then started making it even tougher on ourselves. Those of us who already had some added rules (like point 4 above) tried to apply those rules, beyond that many of us dreamed up new ones. Then we were vocal about it, talked about our success and I feel that may have left many feeling like their enjoyment of the game was tied to following the same path or having the same enthusiasms.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brusura","CreatedById":57899,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T17:40:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyour lack of inventive is disturbing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E , seriously, things can get done in many different ways even with the basic parts, just need more time and fantasy for career mode\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vetrox","CreatedById":69796,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T17:44:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI still maintain that the game isnt particularly hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed but i like spacey things (planets are perty!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started playing with no knowledge of orbital mechanics at all.

I have a couple friends who tried the demo and were discouraged by the learning curve of the game. To that end, I think the career starts off rather well by limiting parts and making it easier to build a basic rocket. I also agree that some hints and more involved tutorials are a good idea in the finished game. That said, none of us know for sure (other than the devs) what the final game will contain on that subject. The power problem in particular is a playing style error rather than a game/design issue. It\u0027s a challenge, to find the correct way to play through that particular part of the game.

So whats a challenge differs from person to person and whats fun differs from person to person. Some people enjoy the game with mechjeb, others hate it.

If you reduce it too much like, say, to a tenth of the original values, yes, it would become a major chore. But from my experience a reducing to around somewhere between 70% and 50% for select science items, along with some balance changes like implementing a limit on how much science one can get from transmissions resulted in a generally fair paced advancement, not too slow to the point it felt like I was going need to do hundreds and hundreds of launches to get where, but I actually had to go places if I wanted to keep unlocking the high tier stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s what motivated me to finally get around to planning, building, and actually doing a manned Duna landing and return and break my streak of staying within Kerbin\u0027s SoI for all manned missions each time I did a save, if only because I wanted some parts to improve my spaceplane.

I\u0027d like to see meaningful life support (none of this infinite recycler BS), craft failures, time lag, reasons for actually putting up a satellite, etc... I hope to see resources in the game at some point but I think the paradigm is pretty bad at the moment; scanning for resources shouldn\u0027t involve putting something in orbit, time-warping at 50X, and walking away to watch some TV while you wait four hours for Moho to make a complete \u0022year\u0022 rotation, it should involve gameplay that gives you a reason to go places.
