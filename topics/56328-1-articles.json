Let\u0027s say a rocket can carry, say, 10% of its weight to orbit as payload. If you double the rocket\u0027s mass, that payload percentage doesn\u0027t decrease; if anything, it increases slightly as certain components (like cockpits, batteries, etc.) won\u0027t always need to be doubled as well. For a given payload size, then, it\u0027s nearly always better to launch a bigger rocket if possible. The exponential nature of rocket sizes (the Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation) says that you get less effect out of each successive linear increase in size, forcing you to launch gigantic rockets to get even a minor improvement in velocity over smaller rockets, but it\u0027s never a BAD thing to increase your booster in size, and almost never a GOOD thing to go smaller. The only real benefits to going smaller:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1\u0026gt; Economics, which KSP doesn\u0027t include at all\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u0026gt; Ease of steering, which was a major issue back in older versions before flywheels were separated from SAS, but which is now a non-issue in KSP\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3\u0026gt; Stability, although it\u0027s usually nothing you can\u0027t fix with more struts and/or large-part mods like KW Rocketry. (In real life this one\u0027s much more of a concern.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4\u0026gt; Lag, since Unity\u0027s lack of multithreading forces us to limit our part counts unless we want to slideshow our way to orbit, but again, KW Rocketry and such make this a lot better. (In real life, this one\u0027s less of a concern.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn older KSP versions, add 5\u0026gt; You\u0027ll run into the launch tower if you go too big.
