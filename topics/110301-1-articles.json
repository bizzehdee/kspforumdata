If they wanted those idiotic results they shouldn\u0027t have bothered, I could have crapped out ten lines of concatenation to make it happen.\n\nI took a look at the cfg that generates the text, and it didn\u0027t look all that simple at least. Then again, I\u0027ve only done a little programming, so maybe it\u0027s simpler than it looks.\n\nI\u0027ll try to locate it again, but it was somewhere in the KSP folder (duh) with a name along the lines of \u0022storyline\u0022 or something like that (and the first few lines were a Spoiler warning... so I figured it HAD to be something good!). I opened it hoping to find something interesting, but after a while realized what I was looking at.\n\n---\n\nEdit: Okay, now that I\u0027m home (I have a long commute - can you tell?) I can say that the file in question is located at \\GameData\\Squad\\Resources\\StoryDefs.cfg, and the first two lines are:\n\n// definitions for the storyline generator used in contracts and such.\n\n// WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS\n\nHow could you NOT look at it after that? ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nBut yeah, it then goes on to explain how it works and such, and I guess it really doesn\u0027t look too complicated. But it looks easy to edit, I think.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T00:02:29Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 12:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Slam\\_Jones**"},{"CreatedByName":"DarkGravity","CreatedById":143383,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T08:29:53Z","Content":"I do enjoy the humor that is in the mission descriptions very much.
