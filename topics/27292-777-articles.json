I began by revising the design of the \u003Cem\u003ESojourner 7\u003C/em\u003E survey probe and launching it to Mun for a contract; I don\u0027t need \u003Cem\u003ESojourners\u003C/em\u003E for Kerbin\u0027s moons at this point, but it still made me a fair chunk of change when I got it into position. I was a might concerned after the launch when it looked like the craft wasn\u0027t recharging; I looked at the panels and when they said \u0022Blocked by Mun\u0022, I had the notion to go take a look at Kerbol and caught a solar eclipse in progress. After that I launched a quick series of craft in succession, largely supporting mining operations - I began by launching Bob to Mun aboard a \u003Cem\u003EFireball 7b\u003C/em\u003E craft to gather science and plant a flag for contract. Next, I launched a \u003Cem\u003EMosquito 7\u003C/em\u003E drilling rig, a refinery base module for Munport and lastly a \u003Cem\u003EMidas 7\u003C/em\u003E refinery lander all headed for Mun. I was down to \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1156k by the end of afternoon play that day. I decided to hold off on launching a \u003Cem\u003EWildcat\u003C/em\u003E control and ore-delivery lander for Mun for now, at least until Theogel (an engineer rescued from Minmus) finally arrives back at Kerbin. I plan for him to head for Munport aboard the \u003Cem\u003EWildcat\u003C/em\u003E, pick up Verise (the engineer already there), and then land them near the Mosquito to begin drilling ops in earnest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings started arriving at their destinations during play that evening; I had a proper flotilla arriving at Mun, with the \u003Cem\u003ESojourner\u003C/em\u003E probe arriving in Mun\u0027s SOI a full ten minutes ahead of the refinery base and then the \u003Cem\u003EFireball\u003C/em\u003E arriving at Mun\u0027s SOI as those two craft were approaching their orbital insertion burns. The \u003Cem\u003EMosquito\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003EMidas\u003C/em\u003E craft also arrived at one hour intervals, as the prior craft was nearing their insertion burns - so I had my hands full there for a while, and was grateful for having KAC to keep everything straight. The arrival of the \u003Cem\u003EMidas\u003C/em\u003E craft was particularly hair raising, as it happened while the refinery module was on final docking approach with Munport. Speaking of which, I wound up with the refinery base\u0027s transfer stage nearly full of fuel, and I made an attempt to dock with it still attached to the craft. Unfortunately, I had no RCS thrusters on it and I couldn\u0027t compensate for its mass, so I had to dump it - which I was most certainly NOT happy about seeing as how the Munport station was completely out of fuel. I suppose on the plus side, with the refinery module attached to the Mun it should be able to manufacture its own fuel as soon as I can get some ore up there. I ended play on Friday by finding a suitable landing site for the \u003Cem\u003EMosquito\u003C/em\u003E drilling rig and putting it on the Munar surface. Drilling ops on Mun have commenced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was out of town on Saturday and arrived back in town late Sunday, so not a lot happened over the rest of the weekend. I did go ahead and land Bob to begin gathering surface science, and I landed the Midas lander as close to the Mosquito lander as I could get it. Bit of a botch there - she landed on her side - but given that that the lander is not supposed to take off from Mun, it was an \u0022acceptable\u0022 landing. I just hope I won\u0027t have the same kind of problems when the \u003Cem\u003EWildcat\u003C/em\u003E ultimately begins making delivery runs to Munport...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, a Midas lander and refinery module are both en route to Minmus to support mining operations there, as is the \u003Cem\u003EEnola Gay\u003C/em\u003E craft with its batch of tourists.
