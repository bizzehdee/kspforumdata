For one its orbit is significantly more inclined than the other moons. Secondly, it is a very jagged moon, and hardly what one would call spherical. It just seems so out of place from the others, like it wasn\u0027t always there or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe opportunity to study the moon came when the Koviet Union\u0027s \u003Cem\u003EPyongyang-4\u003C/em\u003E probe had just entered the jool system after a very patient 4 year wait. The probe gathered exciting new data on Laythe, Jool\u0027s inner most moon, which mission control at Moskow noted as a potential place for colonization. \u003Cem\u003EPyongyang-4\u003C/em\u003E also finally settled the very heated debate over whether Pol was a real moon or just a very notorious speck of pollen on telescopes(the conspiracy theories continue to this day however by some kerbals). Mission control planned a flyby of Bop 3 days away, and kerbal scientists were very eager to study the future images of bop which soon will be beamed to kerbal at light speed by the probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat the data they received was very perplexing, and raised more questions than answers. So much so, that the kerbals checked \u003Cem\u003EPyongyang-4\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s systems, then double checked them, and even octuple(?) checking them. Little did the kerbals know that they had come across on of the darkest secrets in their solar system. For starters the probe shot a photograph of a \u003Cem\u003Estructure\u003C/em\u003E of some kind on the surface. Not only that, but there were apparently heat signatures, which were faint yet still anomalous, on the surface. Kerbals were at loss of an explanation, a ground rover was needed for further exploration of this facility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis wasn\u0027t the first anomaly the kerbals have discovered, they\u0027ve discovered the mysterious monoliths, which are among the more known, and in particular they have discovered a pyramid structure on duna. This pyramid was very interesting, as it appeared to be transmitting some sort of signal, an image can be produced from the radio jargon, showing a strange symbol and 4 kerbanoid figures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you may wonder what this all has to do with bop, well there obviously was a far more advance civilization before the kerbals, whose home planet appeared to be duna. They had to have been the ones who built this said structure on bop the kerbals concluded...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[continued]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022rover beginning final decent, control\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022roger, begin final burn\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022uhh control we\u0027ve done a slight miscalculation and we\u0027re about 2km off course\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022got it, set a course for the anomaly and give me an eta\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022done, about 12 minutes after touchdown;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eaaand rover has touched down, and has successful separation from lander\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rover \u003Cem\u003ENo Tomorrow\u003C/em\u003E began the 2km long trek to the structure, hopping and skipping over Bop\u0027s mountainous surface. 12 minutes later, as expected it began to come up on the structure; video linkage was established giving the kerbals a first look at the structure. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was no doubting it was artificial, geometric grooves lined the walls, which were made from a an unknown alloy, crafted with extreme precision. The structure was about the size of a rocket assembly building, casting an ominous shadow acros the surface of bop which nearly engulfed the tiny rover in its darkness. The geometric patterns appeared to form words, in some archaic language lost to time. Heat signatures were still present, despite Bop being -79c on a sunny day, coming from inside the structure. \u003Cem\u003ENo Tomorrow\u003C/em\u003E began probing for an opening of some kind, after a long hour of searching the perimeter, what appeared to be a maintenance shaft was found. \u003Cem\u003ENo Tomorrow\u003C/em\u003E sliced through the panel with relative ease, and entered the structure, the rover powered on its lights, overpowering the darkness which occupied the room for millennium. A long corridor was seen, with doors on the neatly placed on opposite sides of the walls. They all appeared to be opened with force, shallow holes cratered the walls, floors and ceilings. A fight had clearly taken place, yet they didn\u0027t appear to be caused by bullets, whatever made those holes seemed to vaporize the metal itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, \u003Cem\u003ENo Tomorrow\u003C/em\u003E wasn\u0027t equipped with the instruments to perform further tests, it simply was designed to explore, and that it did. Progressing further into the structure, more signs of some kind of firefight were evident, doors smashed in, holes panging surfaces. The kerbals back at mission control were mystified, they had no idea what to think about it all. The data just kept on coming as the rover explored room after room, hallway after hallway. The building was practically dead, power ceased to flow through its electrical veins long long ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat was most unsettling was, there were clear signs of a very bloody fight between two factions, yet not a single body was anywhere to be found, absolutely no organic signs whatsoever. Could they all have disintegrated? or were the dead carted away and the station was abandoned? The rover\u0027s life was soon to be ended, however. A loud \u0022AAUUGHHHH\u0022 was heard over the loudspeaker, followed by static. Moskow had lost \u003Cem\u003ENo Tomorrow\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s signal soon thereafter. Not a single kerbal had any idea what to think, and analyzed the rover\u0027s final moments. What they saw sent chills down every kerbal\u0027s spine in the room. The final frame of video broadcast by \u003Cem\u003ENo Tomorrow\u003C/em\u003E, was of a deformed hand swatting in the direction of the rover. It was clear what ever that hand was attached to had destroyed the rover. At this point, the kerbals in the room unanimously agreed this would never leave mission control. The mission never happened, \u003Cem\u003ENo Tomorrow\u003C/em\u003E had crash landed, and \u003Cem\u003EPyongyang-4\u003C/em\u003E missed the intercept with Bop,publicly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Koviet Union has interests behind the curtain still, an armed manned team is being assembled to investigate, and a huge orbital weapons platform is being developed, but not for kerbin contrary to what they are saying. There\u0027s certainly something dark hidden on Bop, something that should never have been discovered, the kerbals\u0027 thirst for discovery shall soon be discovered to be their achilles heel....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewell i hope you enjoyed! lemme know what you liked or think i could have improved on! this is my first time writing something like this in a while \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-21T05:39:49Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2013 05:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by th3shameless\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Napoleon","CreatedById":71252,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-21T01:45:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoar! this is good! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"th3shameless","CreatedById":57326,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-21T05:40:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Esecond part finished!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SuperWeegee4000","CreatedById":71621,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T03:19:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI read this in bed late.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurses.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Voyager55","CreatedById":70945,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T16:58:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoar moar MOOAAAARRR! :3\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ninjakids","CreatedById":70896,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T18:20:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECreepy and cool!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SUPERVIP101","CreatedById":71930,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T20:14:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice story!
