I have tried EVERYTHING even the paper clip method, it refuses to open. It\\\u0027s a \u0027Labelflash\u0027 CD ROM. (According to the front of the drive.) When I press the open button I hear several thumps, it sounds like he mechanism that opens it is hitting the side of the drive. Unfortunatley we don\\\u0027t have a warranty as this PC is bought from a renting place.(It was suppost to be a temporary PC.) I was wondering if the drive is bad because we need this for almost every game I play.(I even have backups of MC and my KSP saves,plugins,rocket folders on CDs.) I got it manually opened with a christmas ornament clip. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-11T22:12:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EConsidering a replacement drive would cost less than $20, just get a new one.
