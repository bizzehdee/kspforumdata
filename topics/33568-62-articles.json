It then uses a small 50,000 km dish to talk to a relay satellite (inner dot), which then uses a 2500 km omni antenna to talk to KSC or, when KSC is not visible it bounces signals off any of 7 other satellites with 2500 km omni antennas (only 3 of my dedicated comsats are shown here - see the whole picture \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.blade-edge.com/images/KSA/Flights/body.asp?r=true\u0026amp;db=bodies\u0026amp;body=Kerbin\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I depict these three satellites is because they also contain 50,000 km dishes to talk to satellites around Mun and Minmus. However since MA treats everything as omni, it will think any of these three satellites can talk directly to my IP ComSat. So the red line is the path the comm route is supposed to take, blue is the path MA will analyze it taking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGranted, at the speed of light across these distances near Kerbin we\u0027re talking a negligible difference in travel time - but it still largely affects 3 of the 4 graphs being output by the comm analysis window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother example is that I actually have two IP ComSats in Molniya orbits (so one is always visible) and a craft around Duna and Ike - both are only able to talk to one IP ComSat. So if the craft around Ike can\u0027t see its IP ComSat, it should try to route through the craft around Duna to the second one. However MA will just connect it straight to the second IP ComSat it\u0027s not supposed to be talking to if it can see it. (or it can actually talk directly to KSC from this distance - which again it\u0027s not supposed to do)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s an interesting idea.

Spherical coordinates use an azimuth (angle in a plane) and elevation (angle out of the plane) and DV magnitude to define the maneuver.

Here\u0027s the changes (as I remember them):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Resolved an issue where the GUI would rapidly slow down after running the optimizer multiple times. This issue was around since v1.0.0 but was exasperated by v1.4.0. The actual root cause of the issue is probably a bug in MATLAB\u0027s memory management, but I actually like the fix better than the old way I was doing things, so I\u0027m going to keep it permanent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Resolved an issue where variables not marked for optimization in a burn (or any multi-variable event) would get changed by the optimizer. Thanks for pointing this out, Gaiiden. Turns out it was very easy to fix...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) \u0022Re-optimize Mission\u0022 in the Mission Architect Optimization menu now actually serves a purpose and is useful. Before it would just run the exact same case again, providing the same answer you already got. Now it runs the current script with the same optimization settings/constraints/objective/etc, which was its original purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Some other minor speed improvements here and there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother note: I\u0027m currently evaluating MATLAB R2015b, just released a few days ago, for use with KSP TOT. KSP TOT v1.5.0 will still be released on R2014b, but future versions (v1.5.1\u002B) may be on R2015b. The reason for this has to do with some serious improvements The MathWorks made to the MATLAB execution engine. Some benchmarks I\u0027ve seen suggest that runtime could be halved in some cases (meaning code executes about twice as quickly). There are also optimizations to the back-end graphics engine with means that plots get drawn faster. Since Mission Architect relies on quick draw times to produce trajectory plots and all that, this is a welcome improvement. If there are any objections to me moving to R2015b, please let me know. The only action end-users would need to take is to download the R2015b MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) and install it.

When you load up the mission plan and put numbers into the initial state, you get an orbit. When you re-open up the initial state, the closest string representation of the double you entered is what shows up in the box (which is VERY VERY SLIGHTLY) different than what you entered. 16 events later, this results in an orbit which doesn\u0027t find an SoI transition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can try it yourself. Move the orbit plot to event 16, then open and save the initial state as you describe. You\u0027ll see the orbit move radically. Let me know if that answers your questions. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T17:42:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Arrowstar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Arrowstar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think what I\u0027m actually going to do is set things up so when you push \u0022add\u0022 you get a generic spacecraft/ground site/thruster.
