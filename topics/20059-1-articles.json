Fly single-man landers there, then leave them there and pick everyone up in a larger ship that has a Crewtank on it. I\u0027ve been working on this larger ship (the Legionary) for a couple days, and it\u0027s a behemoth with 378 parts at 420 tons on the pad. It *should* work, I\u0027ve ironed out all the bugs except one. My engines sometimes decide to randomly not work. They have fuel. They\u0027re still attached, nothing broke off. In fact, they display the graphics as if they work (plume of fire). But they don\u0027t respond to throttle and produce no thrust, either on Mechjeb\u0027s readouts or empirically. Also, if I decouple them they still look like they\u0027re firing, complete with sound. Why does this happen? It doesn\u0027t happen always, just sometimes, and it\u0027s really messing up my rocket- especially when in a cluster of five rockets, only four work and I start spinning wildly out of control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Richy teh space man","CreatedById":12511,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-23T18:30:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETried saving and reloading?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouzu","CreatedById":1117,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-23T20:41:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah.
