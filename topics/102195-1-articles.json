I achieved all check-marks and it was considered complete, or so I thought... I was also going for the 33k altitude challenge so I decoupled the booster and had parachutes attached so that it\u0027d land safely and continued onward to my 33k mark which I achieved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I was coming back down, I noticed the achievement-watcher-drop-down ( which doesn\u0027t save the size you set - another bug ) removed check-marks as I went up but as I was coming back down it gave me check-marks and removed them in real-time; odd...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the issue where the game removes ( and takes the money ) components that are 2.5km away also bugs the achievement system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, this is quite game-breaking....
