I achieved all check-marks and it was considered complete, or so I thought... I was also going for the 33k altitude challenge so I decoupled the booster and had parachutes attached so that it\u0027d land safely and continued onward to my 33k mark which I achieved.\n\nAs I was coming back down, I noticed the achievement-watcher-drop-down ( which doesn\u0027t save the size you set - another bug ) removed check-marks as I went up but as I was coming back down it gave me check-marks and removed them in real-time; odd...\n\nAnyway, the issue where the game removes ( and takes the money ) components that are 2.5km away also bugs the achievement system.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nActually, this is quite game-breaking.... The issue is even though ALL of the requirements were met ( by it being activated when all check-marks were green ) and it highlighted it in green ( the title ), and removed the requirements underneath the title, when you are coming back down it undoes it and says you need to meet the requirements....\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nFinally; after completing it 5 times it finally stuck.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-18T06:29:01Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2015 06:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Acecool**"}]}
