The list should contain the same items as the menu in the VAB. I currently have the following code to do so.\n\n    var items = new List();foreach (var loadedPart in PartLoader.LoadedPartsList){    if (ResearchAndDevelopment.PartModelPurchased(loadedPart))    {        items.Add(loadedPart);    }}\n\nThis code seems to work in science mode, but not in career mode. Is there another thing to check besides the PartModelPurchased?\n\nThank you."}]}
