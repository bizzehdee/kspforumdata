If so, to what extent and in what manner?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it\u0027s fair to say that most of us know the pain that can come in the mid/late game. You have a station or two, 20\u002B communication satellites, 3 or 4 active probes going to different locations, or whatever it may be. Regardless, keeping up with all of these different things going on continuously and keeping them maintained can make the late game turn dull or boring (\u0022milk runs\u0022). I feel if this issue isn\u0027t tackled head on managing the normal drag from KSP 1 with the addition of running\u00A0multiple colonies and continuously supplying multiple orbital shipyards stacked on top then essentially no ones ever going to get interstellar anyways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far I see 3 levels of automation:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nNone - The game continues, as is, and every maneuver is handeled manually\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMinimal - Rockets are made as normal, launched to orbit, then a series of maneuvers are planned, and are performed in the background as their resources are taken into account and staged accordingly. Actions such as docking, take off, and landing are performed manually still\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSome - Similar to minimal but take off, landing, and docking are also planed ahead of time and automated as well.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLots - Resources for each colony/station\u00A0can be monitored and \u0022milk runs\u0022 can be ordered. Either default transport craft (depending on tech level) or user built craft can have entire routes simulated and effectively a run is ordered and all that matters is the time to wait for the resources to arrive.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously, these are not the only ways this problem can be solved.
