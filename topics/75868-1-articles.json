I can\u0027t get it out of my head and this occured in about 2 days. Also I would not suggest you play minecraft online, because it sucks for almost the same reason. The beauty of the game to me lies in the solo aspect and it is great in that regard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for a sandbox game suggestion I can give you one that has given me hours of inter game joy and its free,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.scuzzstuff.org/oe_cake/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.scuzzstuff.org/oe_cake/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically you throw together materials/liquids with all kinds of custom properties and see how they react with each other, you can also make some very complex experiments, well worth a shot.
