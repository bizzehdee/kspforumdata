Some stacks for streamlining, some fat asparagus with nose cones, 4 stages, 8 stages, lots of fins, lots of SAS, various to-orbit profile from turning at 1km to 30km...\n\nNone get to orbit. I could do this fairly easily with just trial and error under 0.9. \n\nThe problems are:\n\nA lot of the engines have little or no thrust at lower altitude. Makes it hard to find a good set of engines for the lift.\n\nEven with streamlining the things shake themselves apart without lots of strutting and even then they wobble something fierce. \n\nIt flips out at various altitudes. Fins and SAS help some but I can\u0027t seem to find the balance. \n\nHere\u0027s the latest disaster that doesn\u0027t have the dV for orbit, I was just hoping to get it fly to high altitude but it flips out at stage 3. \n\nAnyone got a working Eve lifter that will get a Kerbal to orbit?\n\n![ag0zrAc.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ag0zrAc.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"maccollo","CreatedById":72759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T14:41:43Z","Content":"Ok, so the problem is god awful ISP and thrust close to sea level. The solution?\n\nYou really cannot afford to linger at the bottom with barely enough thrust to take off. You must get out of there fast, drag be dammed!\n\nHere\u0027s a design just over 110 tonnes that can launch from the very bottom.\n\n![EAV.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22015656/EAV.png)\n\nGenerally the design principle here is MAAAAAXIMUM POOOOWER for about 10 seconds, then stage and sustain the acquired velocity with less thrust. Once you are up to speed you don\u0027t need nearly as much thrust to sustain that speed, and you can quite easily climb out of the ISP black hole.\n\nObviously, you don\u0027t have to take off from sea level. I believe the highest point is at about 5 km, which goes a really long way to mitigate the problem.\n\nHitting it from orbit is very hard, but you can put wheels on your EAV and drive there. The old pancake EAVs obviously wont cut it anymore, but way back I built this rickety contraption which might actually be pretty useful now.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/2wkMg1BFTIg?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T15:54:25Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 03:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by maccollo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T14:58:40Z","Content":"Thanks, that\u0027s really helpful. \n\nYou have flown that in 1.0.2, right?

Total vacuum delta deltaV to orbit is about 7.5 km/s.\n\nAlso while the design isn\u0027t aerodynamically stable it is very controllable. This is a good thing actually, because it means you come down engines first during EDL.\n\nCraft file: [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22015656/eve%20lander.craft](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22015656/eve%20lander.craft)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/PLkC3XhqT3c?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T15:51:44Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 03:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by maccollo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T15:55:46Z","Content":"Confirmed.

Ended up a bit to high, so 45 degrees at 35-40 km seems like a good mark for this particular ascent vehicle.\n\nProtip:\n\nIt seems like struts add a significant amount of mass now, but only to the part where you first attach them. So whenever you add struts start from the bottom stage so you can ditch the strut mass when you stage."}]}
