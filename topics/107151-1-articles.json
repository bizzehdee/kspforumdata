You must get out of there fast, drag be dammed!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a design just over 110 tonnes that can launch from the very bottom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22015656/EAV.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EAV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally the design principle here is MAAAAAXIMUM POOOOWER for about 10 seconds, then stage and sustain the acquired velocity with less thrust. Once you are up to speed you don\u0027t need nearly as much thrust to sustain that speed, and you can quite easily climb out of the ISP black hole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, you don\u0027t have to take off from sea level. I believe the highest point is at about 5 km, which goes a really long way to mitigate the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHitting it from orbit is very hard, but you can put wheels on your EAV and drive there.
