You don\u0027t have that option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo shorten your takeoff run: you either need to increase your acceleration (more thrust, less mass) or reduce your takeoff speed (more lift, less mass).

Else they will deploy downwards and actually cause negative lift. Also, you need to set negative AOA else the flap will stall ( along with the rest of the wing) as soon as you pull up .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn my plane, I set flap deploy to -13.5 degrees, AOA to -90% and control surface deflection to 10 degrees\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee if that helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor true slats, we\u0027d need something that pushes the leading control surface fowards....
