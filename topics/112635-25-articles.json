Buoyancy. Since Dice is pretty busy of late, I\u0027ve decided to take a look at an even better revamp of KSP buoyancy. Currently, the Submarine Pack is using Firespitter\u0027s Buoyancy and the Maritime Pack is using bent laws of physics whereby all the parts are super light. Firespitter\u0027s buoyancy was only designed to make float planes. While it does work, it leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nWe all know that V shaped hulls provide great buoyancy, at least on earth. In the Kerbol system, they\u0027re more like a lever. They\u0027ll either roll to starboard or port. No buoyancy code fixes that. None. So, before I can begin to produce \u0027real\u0027 boats (and sail boats), buoyancy needs to be fixed. \n\nSo I went in search of answers. I didn\u0027t like what I found. One of the things people have complained about in the past was that my parts and Better Buoyancy don\u0027t always like each other. I\u0027ve found out why.\n\nI took a look at Ferram\u0027s code and ummm. Well, ok then. If that\u0027s buoyancy then I can understand why there\u0027s a problem. Ferram tries to calculate the volume of a part in order to determine how well it floats. But there\u0027s a slight problem. His volume calculations assume that everything is a square. He multiplies the height of the part, by the width and the depth in order to come up with a volume. I dunno bout you guys but I hardly EVER see or use a perfectly square part. The comments in his code even state that he knows these calculations are way off but claims they work. Ok, let\u0027s find out.\n\nHere\u0027s some examples of some rather large boat parts I\u0027m working on and some volume calculations I ran.\n\nDice has allowed me to use some code he has that calculates the volume of a part based on all of the triangles in it\u0027s mesh. So let\u0027s compare some part volumes:\n\n10/27/2015 11:59:26 AM: Actual Volume: 5881.335\n\n10/27/2015 11:59:26 AM: BB Volume: 5909.129\n\nOk, that was a center hull piece which is pretty squared off. His calculations aren\u0027t terribly different from reality. Now, let\u0027s take a look at a pointy bow part:\n\n10/27/2015 11:59:27 AM: Actual Volume: 3972.705\n\n10/27/2015 11:59:27 AM: BB Volume: 20888.03\n\nUmmm quite a difference there. Now if you were going to calculate the density of that part based on it\u0027s volume and mass, and then calculate how well it would float, you\u0027d end up with a cork. Attach those two parts together and you\u0027d have one half sunk and the other bobbing around on the surface.\n\nNow this is just my opinion, but before you can claim to have improved things, shouldn\u0027t your calculations at least be in the ballpark?\n\nNext problem I see. His calculations have nothing to do with the mass of the part. Mass only affects the drag. Instead, he again determines how deep a part sinks in the water based on it\u0027s size, gravity and ocean density. So if you have a cargo ship with 100 tons of ore in it, and you offload that ore to another ship, your buoyancy doesn\u0027t change one bit. You still ride just as high or just as low in the water. Now call me silly but, according to Wikipedia - In science, buoyancy is an upward force exerted by a fluid that opposes the weight of an immersed object. So, how can you calculate buoyancy without mass?\n\nOk, so I\u0027ve firmly decided. Buoyancy needs a REAL update. Whether I can pull it off or not is another question, but I\u0027m off to play in the water.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-27T18:49:05Z\u0022 title=\u002210/27/2015 06:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist**"},{"CreatedByName":"Generalstarwars333","CreatedById":151938,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-27T21:51:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Ummm, because...
