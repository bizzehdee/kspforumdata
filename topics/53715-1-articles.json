It can put 115 tons in LKO (circular 70 km orbit) with a TWR between 1.5 and 2.0 the whole way at full throttle. No fancy piloting needed, just basic knowledge of a gravity turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe upper stage is an independent vessel so you can turn it around and deorbit it.

Your carrying a huge amount of excess weight for long periods of time and it\u0027s slowing your craft down and making them less efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-20T07:44:04Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2013 07:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by 700NitroXpress\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nhnifong","CreatedById":12196,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-20T07:47:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Giggleplex777\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Giggleplex777\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOriginally, the rocket had 220 parts and was very unreliable.
