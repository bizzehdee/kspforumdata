Honestly, I think that they have slapped the back of a SABRE engine onto the top half of a reaction control wheel (SAS module).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t get me wrong, I like the back end of the engine and I can appreciate the coding that went into allowing multiple exhausts and all that, but I feel like the developers just worked too long on the rear end of the model and realised they were missing the front and so slapped a SAS module on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you search up \u0027SABRE Engine\u0027 in google images you will see they look pretty badass and, to a degree, so does the RAPIER, but I just wish they had made the front of the model a little nicer...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would love to hear your thoughts on this matter!

The jet engines have texture to them, and the bells on almost all the rockets are exposed with the juicy bits for us to oogle at. I get that in a lot of the pictures the thing is a smooth cylinder in real life, but that\u0027s fairing rather than engine. If they jutted the four bells out to match the other rockets in the game, and perhaps modeled the stair-step look of the intercooler, I think we\u0027d have a unique, awesome looking engine that doesn\u0027t look like it came from a different game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Liowen","CreatedById":94498,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T03:41:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt could be a placeholder model to test out how the engine will be received, since they are improving the game with every patch I would bet that this current model will most likely get a reskin. Look at the science lab right now, it has no IVA mode but I feel that will most likely change as well. I kind of like the cylinder shape myself to be completely honest, it makes it feel like part of the fuel cell to me.

That aside, when I get back to playing with mods again I will probably use SABRE engines instead because they blend nicely with associated stock mods. That being said, and the reason I\u0027m replying honestly, is just to say I find the RAPIER to be incredibly powerful. I never use SABRE even when I have KW installed because I could just never get it to work nicely for me. Well having just unlocked the RAPIER I made one of my better if not best SSTO\u0027s in recent memory in one go. It runs on 870/880/108 LF/OX/MO and 2 RAPIERS/1 Turbo Jet with 4 Intakes. There is some part clipping involved to use 2 large 1.25m fuel tanks between the wings with a bi-plane wing setup.
