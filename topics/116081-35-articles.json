Did this in the previous version of Gliido and did not even look at the action groups before launching the 7P. Oh well--what\u0027s done is done, and you\u0027ll all see what happened to Kenlie, his passengers and Martystu just as soon as I can make the pages. \n\nSo now that that\u0027s solved I officially \u003C3 this new Gliido! Handles better in atmosphere than anything I\u0027ve ever built. In a separate trial I overshot the runway,did a 180 and landed on it--all without turning on the engine. It gets to Micarooni Station with fuel to spare, and of course from there it can go pretty much anywhere in the solar system.
