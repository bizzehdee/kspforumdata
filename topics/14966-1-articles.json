What a marvelous thing it is, for certain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever I am experiencing an issue, in that I no longer seem to be able to cast shadows. Now, I am using KSP on a newer and better laptop machine now, and I switched just before the update was released. I have changed nothing in the settings except the resolution - it now runs in 1280x600, in order to provide me with the feeling of luxury associated with widescreen entertainment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI considered posting it as a bug, but I have seen other folks posting screenshots and they all seem to be enjoying lovely shadows (as I was, long ago). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only shadows that are absent are those cast by the vehicles and the kerbals - the scenery still shades itself nicely and all of that.

This is not, however, the cause of my absent shadows.

In all honesty, if it weren\\\u0027t for landings upon the Mun and the other thing, I\\\u0027d probably not have noticed yet. It does considerably increase the difficulty of a perfect touchdown.
