The current plan is to get the two by flying the plane over them (surprise, surprise!) and the others by parachuting the plane to the surface and going extra-vehicle to walk to each.\n\n2) I\u0027m sure there are better ways to fulfil the contract but is this a reasonable way to do it?\n\n3) I thought of launching the plane with rockets to cut the journey time i.e. a sub-orbital trajectory but can\u0027t work out how to attach the rockets to the plane. Can this even be done?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-30T23:52:00Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2015 11:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wakaleo**"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T07:04:49Z","Content":"1. Navball shows direction (I don\u0027t think it tells distance, actually), map view shows the actual place on the planet (roughly, though).\n\n2. They are one of the types of contracts that I start rejecting early - usually I just do it once and then reject forever. Especially for Kerbin ones you don\u0027t have turbojets until mid-career but you start getting \u0022above 17km\u0022 contracts right away. They were doable with the old jets, but not any more in 1.0, and contract parameters aren\u0027t changed, so... For bucks I go rescues, and for science I go Mun/Minmus. No point worrying about those low-return time-consuming contracts.\n\n3. It can be done, and it\u0027s even done by a pure rocket - of course, one target at a time."},{"CreatedByName":"MarvinKitFox","CreatedById":99545,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T07:08:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 1) Is the navball icon denoting the contract for which I have activated navigation the only guide to how close I\u0027m getting to it?\n\nOn map view, you can click on the target icon and make it your target. Then it will show a symbol on your navball indicating exact direction.

You are looking at a 3-4 hour flight to get there!\n\nRemember these points:\n\n\\*An observation \u0022above\u0022 a certain height can be \\*any\\* height above, including orbit.\n\n\\*it is much easier to get to the other side of the planet, by flying above the atmosphere.
