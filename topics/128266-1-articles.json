I know this has been asked before, and I\u0027m aware that there is a site I can go to to get the new MechJeb Mod. But the problem is I am an idiot with computers. I know how to install a mod, and thats about it. I just want to make sure that when I update MechJeb, all my existing flights with MechJeb parts won\u0027t get destroyed (this happened when I was trying to use Karbonite and I did some dumb stuff). Anyways, basically what I\u0027m asking is for some kind soul to take the time to tell me the steps I need to take to do this properly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks a ton!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Icemanau","CreatedById":145438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-21T10:41:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst of all, go to this site and download CKAN. It will make installing and updating modules so much easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/wiki\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/wiki\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRead the user guide and follow it\u0027s instructions. I\u00A0installed the file in my main KSP directory and created a link on the desktop to run it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow go to the GameData folder in your KSP directory and MOVE almost every directory AND file to a spare directory elsewhere. Make sure to leave the SQUAD directory and it\u0027s contents in the KSP GameData directory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow Start CKAN and after you point it to the KSP files, it will automatically get a list of available mods for you. It will only ask for the game files the first time you run it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClick on the Filter button (Magnifying Glass) and select Compatible from the list. Scroll down the list until you find MechJeb\u00A02 and click on the box in front of it to select it. I also recommend \u0027MechJeb and Engineer for all!\u0027 as well as \u0027Menu Stabilizer\u0027 which help with things in flight. Next, click on the Apply Changes button and CKAN will take care of downloading and installing everything without causing you any frustration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMake sure to select any other mods that you had installed to get them installed under CKAN as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI normally run CKAN once before I begin playing just to make sure that all my mods are up to date.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegards Brad\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
