But often in KSP there are instances when a simplified model of hard-scientific reality does just that. Could managing off-world resources fit into that camp?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nLets look a moment at the kind of resources we might find on other bodies:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nH2O\u003Cbr\u003E\nCO2\u003Cbr\u003E\nO2 (bound up in rock)\u003Cbr\u003E\nMetals (Al, Fe, Mg)\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nXenon (extracted from atmo)\u003Cbr\u003E\nUranium\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe3\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFrom those you can create most of the things we\u0027ll need:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nCH4 \u002B O2 (methalox)\u003Cbr\u003E\nLife support: (O2, H2O, Carbohydrates)\u003Cbr\u003E\nMonoprop: (H2O2)\u003Cbr\u003E\nH2\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nRocket \u002B colony parts\u003Cbr\u003E\nIon propellant\u003Cbr\u003E\nNuclear fuel\u003Cbr\u003E\nFission fuel\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think for simplicity it makes a lot of sense to get as much milage out of a generic, harvestable \u0022Ore\u0022 resource for most of the mid-game and using the various fuel factories to convert that supply into usable resources. Technically carbon is hard to come by on the moon and many bodies, but we could probably pretend the Mun and Minmus are more cabonaceous to keep early \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E simple. The question I have is should it be possible to convert methalox into life support? or H2 or monoprop? It was certainly a fun dynamic in the Martian and could produce some interesting strategies. The other question is how many resources\u00A0should go into making parts? We\u0027ve seen in an early screen-cap that some parts use ore and uranium, but does it make sense to have more than that? Does it help or hurt to have intermediate resources like metals or polymers? I\u0027ve played around with MKS and found it fun, but probably much more complicated than KSP2 wants to be. But it could be\u00A0that water ice and atmospheric CO2 could be harvestable resources from which you could easily produce fuel and LS but not new rocket parts?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe big thing for me would be seeing how the availability of different resources guides the way players strategize their colony development and trade. I think its important that there aren\u0027t places where you could set up one colony that produced everything. There should be locations where ore is more concentrated but there\u0027s little Uranium or science to be mined, that you\u0027d have to set up in multiple locations and cleverly ship key resources around. Does it make sense that Ore could be refined into an intermediate resource so it could be shipped to orbit or other colonies more easily? If you\u0027re setting up a resource chain does it make it easier if you can just ship methalox fuel somewhere and then convert that into other things like LS and Monoprop?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-04-19T15:16:09Z\u0022 title=\u002204/19/2021 03:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EApril 19, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PlutoISaPlanet","CreatedById":206057,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-19T15:10:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI absolutely agree that to get certain resources you should have a different colony or outpost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shdwlrd","CreatedById":113880,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-19T17:05:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I would like ore to stick around for a generic construction material.

I think it would also be nice if most necessary resources could be found within a planets\u0027 system so you weren\u0027t dependent on too many interplanetary transfers that take a long time. Now you could also add in ice \u002B CO2 as harvestable resources, or make Ore inherently low-carbon and have carbonate as a harvestable resource that could be combined with Ore to produce LS, polymers and and Methalox, but the more I think about it this probably makes things more complicated than they need to be. I think you want to be able to flip back between different resource overlays to find the best base locations, but you don\u0027t want those intersections so rare that there\u0027s really only one place to build. I still think it might be nice\u00A0to make \u0022Metals\u0022 an intermediate resource derived from ore that you could make into\u00A0parts so that you could ship just that fraction to orbital shipyards.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe question is how might local resource scarcity drive different overall strategies?

So you can do a lot with just those 2 resources. Maybe however there\u0027s an alternate strategy in which you invest in Xenon engines, set up a refinery in orbit above Eve, then leverage that to expand to Jool and Laythe? Or maybe instead you set up a robust Duna base using NERVAs, and then eventually start mining He3 and using fusion power to produce\u00A0metallic hydrogen on Ike?

And just to make things more exciting the two most common monopropellants are hydrazine and hydrogen peroxide, which come from two different categories of the above.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP keeping it down to just \u0022liquid fuel\u0022 and \u0022liquid oxidizer\u0022 was the right call.\u00A0At least, until you start thinking about NTR propulsion, because you aren\u0027t going to run an efficient NTR on kerosene, and jet planes are going to have to have much bigger tanks if they are running on hydrogen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith addition of fusion, I think, calling out hydrogen explicitly is the way to go. I would, therefore, limit the liquid fuels to \u0022Liquid Fuel,\u0022 which is some unspecified hydrocarbon, \u0022Liquid Hydrogen,\u0022 says it on the tin, and \u0022Monopropellant,\u0022 which I would argue should be more hydrazine inspired. For starters, I think it would be interesting to have an option to burn monopropellant with oxidizer in some engine types, and have a unified fuel tank for both your main engines and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if we don\u0027t need hydrogen peroxide for oxidizer, I\u0027m pretty happy just having \u0022Liquid Oxidizer,\u0022 and model it after liquid oxygen. If life support is, indeed, part of stock, I would be perfectly happy with it being one of the consumables for that system as well. I don\u0027t think it has to be explicitly called out as oxygen either way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn terms of raw resources, this does play nicely with just keeping most minerals under umbrella of \u0022ores\u0022, which can provide metals for construction and SRBs as well as byproduct oxygen. Now, I\u0027m not aware of any process that even attempts to reclaim oxygen in ore refining, but then again, why would you try on Earth? I\u0027m sure that various arc methods will produce plenty of oxygen gas as a byproduct that will have to be captured and extracted. But what I would then add is water ice and ammonia ice. The later being used to replace atmospheric nitrogen if you want to subsist on asteroid mining.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis does still leave a lot of chemistry, but now, I think, it can be hidden under the hood for casual player. For example, lets say you are setting up the gas condenser on Duna. What we have going into it is mostly CO2 and what we want to be getting out is methane and oxygen. Without getting into details, the UI for the condenser can simply show: \u0022Oxidizer: \u002BX units/minute, Liquid Fuel: \u002BY units/minute, Hydrogen: -Z units/minute.\u0022 The negative water production tells you that you need to hook up a hydrogen storage tank and some way of filling it up\u00A0if you want to have the condenser do anything. Whereas, same unit sitting on Kerbin might tell you something like, \u0022Oxidizer: \u002BX units per minute. Optional: Monopropellant: \u002BY units per minute, Hydrogen: -Z units per minute.\u0022 So if you just need oxygen, it will do perfectly fine on its own, but if you want to make use of nitrogen as well, then you\u0027ll need to provide a source of hydrogen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor people who want to crunch out the numbers, all the stoichiometry can be provided either somewhere deep within the game or on Wiki. And for anyone who wants to just figure things out live, the UI provides most of the information they need to make it work, possibly, via some iteration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shdwlrd","CreatedById":113880,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-19T23:36:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223957346\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022201827\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221618867817\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/113880-shdwlrd/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022113880\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/113880-shdwlrd/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@shdwlrd\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Haha yeah, I mean these are just a for-instance.

There are two parts to streamlining, making something understandable so players aren\u0027t wasting time making big mistakes, and condensing things so there aren\u0027t so many variables and parts to worry about. For instance if some element of chemistry can happen inside a converter and doesn\u0027t need to be transported then that element can be kept under the hood and doesn\u0027t need its own in-game resource or tanks. Fortunately the only intermediate resources in your scheme are O2 and H2 which will probably have their own tanks anyway. I also really like the idea that a colony that was lacking a resource could be supplemented by capturing an asteroid--always a fun challenge.\u00A0The other handy thing is this is a toy solar system and we can kind of make up whatever surface composition we want, but its always nice if it maps on to the real solar system.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat I think matters quite a bit gameplay-wise is how prospecting works. Say you had a surface spectrometer part that you could put in orbit and get an overlay of where different elements were most common. When selecting your colony location you\u0027re going to want a spot that has as much of what you need as possible. To keep things fun early on you\u0027re certainly going to need a source for some basics--Methalox, Monoprop, \u002B LS. So thats at the very least some source of carbon and ice, maybe nitrogen. Later as you start phase 2 building new components and rockets on site you\u0027ll need metals from Ore and Uranium. If all these were represented in a scan you\u0027d be looking at 5 different harvestable resources, and looking for areas with as much coverage as possible. I think this is probably too many. For the sake of simplicity you could say all ore has enough metal in it to be suitable making parts, and what you\u0027re really looking for are areas that are high in water ice. You could probably also for simplicity pretend we were using H2O2 rather than Hydrazine and pretend away nitrogen in LS. That would get us down to 3 scannable resources--H20, Carbon (either mined chondrites or CO2), and Uranium. That might not be so cumbersome to find in combination. If you were breaking out carbon it might also make sense that most parts were just a combination of metals and plastics and that only a few advanced parts required Uranium. Maybe his sounds overcomplicated, but you\u0027d only need one refinery part that could process both if you have access to ice-rich ore and carbon.\u00A0In either case I think ideally you want all of these available within each planets\u0027 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0so you\u0027d have the option to build and expand one main base either on the surface or in orbit and feed it with outposts gathering whatever it lacks.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n--Or you could break it up a different way--to assume all ore contains sufficient carbon and a high Ore concentration means its rich with metals, but there\u0027s a separate scan for ice that lets you mine and combine to produce fuel and LS? At that point though you may as well stick to a single \u0022ore\u0022 resource, and a high reading means its got high values of everything except Uranium and other exotic resources.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223957625\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022201827\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221618919028\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022206057\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PlutoISaPlanet\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, PlutoISaPlanet said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just realized, minmus will probably have better resources then the mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy do you think?

Plenty of ways of making things easier though - adding nitrogen to Duna\u0027s atmosphere would be an obvious help.\u00A0 Alternatively, you could flesh out the nitrogen manufacturing a bit by adding ammonia as an intermediate - and then making ammonia extractable from icy bodies.
