Now he\u0027s at 30 kilometers altitude, and he just sits there and holds that while his craft continues to decelerate. My thinking is you could make anything that ballistically hits, say, 36 kilometers and then just use your momentum and aerodynamics to hold that for a certain relatively small plateau, all the while decelerating from drag despite the best efforts to maintain airspeed. My thinking is we wouldn\u0027t want to see something like that in the number 1 position. But this is just my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I\u0027ve already had prototypes that can \u0022plateau loft\u0022 well over 28 kilometers, and for quite some time too because they can get up a lot of speed at 25 km, and they are extremely low drag so it takes a pretty long time to lose enough speed that they can\u0027t hold that lofty 28, 29 or 30\u002B altitude any longer. But, I\u0027ve chosen not to submit it because of my concern with this metric of performance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T21:55:38Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 09:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MunGazer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngusJimiKeith","CreatedById":101138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T22:02:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see where you\u0027re coming from.
