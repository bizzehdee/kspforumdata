Let\u0027s say hypothetically we have a craft that can maintain 1200 m/s airspeed and 28 kilometers altitude for 60 seconds. However, if he lofts up, voilla. Now he\u0027s at 30 kilometers altitude, and he just sits there and holds that while his craft continues to decelerate. My thinking is you could make anything that ballistically hits, say, 36 kilometers and then just use your momentum and aerodynamics to hold that for a certain relatively small plateau, all the while decelerating from drag despite the best efforts to maintain airspeed. My thinking is we wouldn\u0027t want to see something like that in the number 1 position. But this is just my opinion.\n\nEdit: I\u0027ve already had prototypes that can \u0022plateau loft\u0022 well over 28 kilometers, and for quite some time too because they can get up a lot of speed at 25 km, and they are extremely low drag so it takes a pretty long time to lose enough speed that they can\u0027t hold that lofty 28, 29 or 30\u002B altitude any longer.
