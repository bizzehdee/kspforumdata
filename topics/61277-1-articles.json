But I\u0027m starting to try Mechjeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m trying to travel to minmus from a parked orbit of 100 km. Here\u0027s what I have done using mechjeb manuever planner:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Add node to match inclination with minmus\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Add node to hohmann transfer to minmus\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Execute all nodes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a pretty big ship with 1 orange tank with 1 Neva and a command pod/lander science thing. It takes about 10 something minutes to do the Hohmann transfer. However what I\u0027m seeing is that even after the encounter with minmus, Mechjeb keeps firing thrusters to escape Kerbin orbit.... Also it seems that the m/s and timer thing keeps adding after I am far from the node start...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had to hit abort and fix the path manually. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this normal or I\u0027m doing something wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-27T14:24:10Z\u0022 title=\u002201/27/2014 02:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by m4rt14n\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadd more info..\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-27T14:47:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have trouble understanding what MJ is doing.

Have you tried doing the nodes seperate in the same ship??\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe couple times I have seen this happen it seems as if the length of the burn for first node messes up the calulation MJ did for the second. Not sure how accurate this is, but sure seems like what happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly I would recomend fly big low thrust ships like this yourself, as MJ2 will most tiimes not start long burns enough before the node. IMO a 5min burn should be started at around 3min prior to the node..whereas MJ will wait till a min or so. Thats more of a personal preferance thing though tbh....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rickenbacker","CreatedById":2349,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-27T21:22:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had this happen when going to Jool with very low TWR. The burn is so long that the projected trajectory misses the encounter, and MJ just keeps burning until it\u0027s out of fuel. In those cases it\u0027s probably better to set up a manual node, let MJ burn it and then adjust once you\u0027re on the way, that seems to work OK.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m4rt14n","CreatedById":101179,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-27T23:04:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYea it seems to be whats happening. Although it misses the intended encounter, it still does encounter but at a different time. I guess its better to do some of the work myself. And to answer the other question, yes it does the same thing with 1 node only.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
