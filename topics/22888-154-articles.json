Both crafts \u0027explode\u0027 when the crew tries to undock. Undock works fine if I haven\u0027t restored from save, i.e. from a direct launch, but unfortunately Apollo 11 is standing-by orbiting the Mun and ready to land our first Kerbal! Their life-support is running out so we sent Ken Mattingly down to the simulator to see if he could squeeze 3 or 4 more amps and here\u0027s what he found:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst Ken installed a fresh KSP .90 x32 on his Win8 rig. Then using CKAN he deployed *only* FASA 5.2 and no other mods and copied the \u0022FASA Sandbox\u0022 to his saves dir, fired up the game loading FASA Sandbox, selected the \u0027FASA Apollo Saturn V.craft\u0027 and launched it into a high orbit. After successful capture and extraction of the LEM, he transferred Jeb and Bill into the LEM and saved the game. As I said before we can undock at this point without issues, but if we Load from save disaster strikes and nobody gets to go to the Mun!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime is running out people so I want that procedure and I want it NOW!!!!

Instead of exploding on undock, the LEM appears to still be attached to the CSM \u0027logically\u0027 in that RCS thrust can be seen from CSM and LEM at the same time even though they are technically no longer attached. At the same time the parachute shield unattaches itself and so does the CSM docking port and the Apollo heat shield too.
