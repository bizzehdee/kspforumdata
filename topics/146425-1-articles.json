I got a corner window, \u0022your display driver has stopped working\u0022 that wouldn\u0027t close until the game closed. I have had the issue on vanilla too, although the issue was fixed when I updated drivers, until now when I installed mods. I have 16gb ram intel i7 and a gtx850m on a hp envy 17 laptop. It has always been a great gaming pc, and I have never had problems like this before. I am unable to attach the crash reports, can anyone help with that? My drivers are up to date.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022maxresdefault.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qVT0iNcImlc/maxresdefault.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-23T19:38:34Z\u0022 title=\u002208/23/2016 07:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Polandball\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
