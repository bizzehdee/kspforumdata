One idea is those yellow/red flashing indicators should become akin to LED \u0022gauges\u0022, not only becoming yellow or red when fuel is low/absent, but also having more or less \u0022segments\u0022 light up.

However, if I follow the needles until moving in one direction moves the needle to the opposite side of the navball that I moved in (IE, I move left, the needle goes to the right side), and do that for every direction, I end up in a spot where I seem to be aligned. But then I go out of IVA to see if I did it right, and I\u0027m nowhere near the node, and instead I\u0027m aligned to \u002Bradial. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got an imgur album displaying what I\u0027m seeing. You can see how I do have man. node set for the FDAI and what it looks like when I am actually aligned with the node versus when I allow the needles to tell me where to point. And just to clarify, while I am past the node at the point I took the pictures, how it was aligning me didn\u0027t change regardless of whether I was ahead of or behind the node.

Which version of RPM are you using? I\u0027ve not seen a problem like this. I\u0027ll go try it out some today to see if I can reproduce it here (usually I use MJ to manage maneuvers, so I don\u0027t align it manually).

Because the yaw error ranges between -180 and \u002B180, but the pitch error ranges between -90 and \u002B90, you ideally will zero the yaw error first, and then the pitch error. So, the \u0022best practice\u0022, at least from what I\u0027ve found, is to maneuver in the yaw axis until the yaw error needle (bottom yellow needle) is centered. Then you adjust the pitch until the pitch error needle (right needle) is also zero\u0027d. All the yellow chevron does is indicate roll.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe roll error needle (top needle) is only used for docking (FDAI GUID MODE = TARGET, \u002B/- switch = -) when a docking port is targeted (which happens automatically if you\u0027re using the Gemini docking nose cone and you turn on the radar).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, thank you for the feedback - it points out an important detail that the wiki overlooks.
