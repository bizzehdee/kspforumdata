The radiant heat that in real life would be thrown out in all directions to the sides of the flames is ignored completely. This is what allows \u0022puller\u0022 rockets to work safely despite flames licking all down their sides.

The single raycast is perfect, but since I can\u0027t use the force to switch, I must use temperature. Using the seebeck mod, I can create electricity out of temperature differential, and therefore I\u0027m busy with creating a simple electronics mod. \n\nBut ...
