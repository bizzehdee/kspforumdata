I did see you could zoom in but didn\u0027t realize you can zoom in more than once. That will probably help. I\u0027ve used KER for a long time but never noticed the info about slope since mainly I just use it to keep track of delta-v. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI generally don\u0027t have trouble landing on a slope since my landers are low and wide, for the most part.
