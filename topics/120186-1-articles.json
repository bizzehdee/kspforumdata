Laythe (2nd moon of Jool) is a good next destination because it has oxygen, it has an atmosphere that isn\u0027t too thick or too thin, and gravity is a bit lower than Kerbin. It really depends on what kind of challenge you want to tackle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaythe - If a plane flies well on Kerbin it probably flies better here. However, you have a long trip so good interplanetary navigation skills are required. Also finding a viable landing spot can be a challenge. The main design challenge is getting enough fuel capacity for the interplanetary journey while remaining light enough when you get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna - Like others have said if you want it to fly as a plane you need a lot of wings. The atmosphere is thin and it takes a lot of lift to do any good, but the thin atmosphere also means you get nearly vacuum ISP and thrust. The main design challenge is getting enough lift. You probably want to try to land in a low-lying area so the atmosphere is as thick as possible when you land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve - I don\u0027t know what it is like in 1.0\u002B yet, but from what I\u0027ve heard it remains one of the more challenging places to get anything off of. Getting an SSTO off of Eve will probably require a mod with engines that can use atmosphere. In stock the only advantages of an SSTO are that it can have a TWR less than 1 and it can control its descent and land on a high mountain which reduces the Delta-V required. The main design challenge is getting enough delta-V and TWR to get into orbit. Definitely tackle this one last, it is hard enough with a multi-stage rocket. The SSTO constraints make this very very difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hagen von Tronje","CreatedById":148278,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-05T16:43:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sirine\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sirine\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDoing it stock and you can tell yourself, you can repeat that achievement on any updates version of KSP without worries of mod following the KSP updates or not.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can tell yourself that, but it won\u0027t be true.

On Duna, it\u0027s very easy to go very fast, as the atmosphere is so thin that drag is practically a nonissue, but stopping and landing is unbelievably dangerous due to the bumpy terrain and poor opportunities for braking, and in-flight maneuvers will feel somewhat floaty even with a ton of wings and control surfaces. On Eve, maneuvering is a snap (you can literally yaw into turns and have it work out fine) and you can brake on a dime (just don\u0027t flip!), but don\u0027t expect high speeds close to the surface, as the drag is just outrageous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso worth mentioning that in stock, rocket engines are the only thing that will operate on Eve, and Eve\u0027s atmosphere utterly murders the effectiveness of rockets.

But anything that will fly well on Duna will suck on Kerbin and vice versa because they\u0027re totally different environments. The various flight parameters of lift, drag, thrust, and weight (not mass) work very differently so require VERY different ratios of wing to mass, thrust to mass, etc. Plus, Duna (and Eve) have no free-range oxygen so the jets you use to take off at Kerbin are totally dead weight everywhere else but Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, I think it\u0027s probably impossible to build an SSTO that will work for both Kerbin and Duna as airplane/spaceplane. You might be able to do it as a capsule at Duna, landing with chutes and taking off as a rocket, but then why bother sending a spaceplane?
