So far, i mostly found aircraft -like cockpits but only very few that look appropriate for a larger ship or non SSTOs in general.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat kind of command pod do (or would) you guys use for large ships like that?\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ve been playing KSP for years now, but i always stumble over the same problem that i can\u0027t find a appropriate command center for more time consuming missions. (no need for fully made interiors)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI usually used Near Future Spacecraft but since it hasn\u0027t been fully updated i realized that i know of no other mod that features similar command pods.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAre there any mods out there you guys may know of that i migh have missed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wolf Baginski","CreatedById":138549,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-28T18:43:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a Taurus HCV capsules\u00A0that carries 7 Kerbals, and I have had good results from using a 2.5m-3.74m adaptor that is outfitted with space for 4 kerbals, but I can\u0027t recall which mod that\u0027s in.
