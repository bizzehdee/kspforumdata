I\u0027m really having a blast thus far. But now I stumbled upon the first problem I can\u0027t solve. After the Mun I traveled to Minmus and set up a base there. Managed to land with pretty much the last drop of fuel in the landing module. Did some science and everything went pretty well. \n\n... until I wanted to return home. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n Here is an image:\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/IgDpdqk.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/IgDpdqk.jpg)\n\nThe problem is: The upper stage won\u0027t lift off. At first I thought it has to much mass so I transfered most of the fuel back into the landing module. But still... it doesn\u0027t accelerate. So I thought maybe even with half empty tanks it has to much mass. So I decoupled two of the three capsules on top and tried it again. Same problem. \n\nBut... now with the landing module having fuel again I accidentially thrusted the whole landing module with the upper stage on top(!) and it lift up without a hassle. Since both engines are the same I can\u0027t really explain why the upper stage alone can\u0027t get up. I checked everything, like having the upper engines throttle lowered and so on. But nothing. One thing I noticed is that the blind (marked in the picture) don\u0027t blast off when I decouple the upper stage. Is this the problem? I tried to slide over the ground to get rid of it but that didn\u0027t work. I remember that one time this kind of blind didn\u0027t blast off when I was using the atomic engine but I\u0027m pretty sure it wasn\u0027t a problem back then. \n\nSo has anyone any idea how to fix this and get Jeb and company back to Kerbin? \n\nThanks! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-17T23:55:04Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2015 11:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by shuno**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T23:35:33Z","Content":"Hmm I can\u0027t see your staging, is the decoupler not decoupling?"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T23:38:08Z","Content":"At a guess (and I stress that it\u0027s just a guess), you may have attached the return stage\u0027s engine to the wrong attachment node of the decoupler.

But it just falls of the whole landing module and lays on the ground. So I tried to slide on the ground to get rid of the marked blind but it didn\u0027t work.
