And the shuttle program had two failures in 135 missions, whereas before that the entirety of the U.S. manned orbital spaceflights was what, 28 launches? (4 Mercury, 10 Gemini, 11 Apollo moon missions, and 3 Skylab missions, and that\u0027s NOT including Apollo 1 as a mission.) So when one program comprises over 80% of your history of manned flight, how is it surprising that it had more deaths than the others?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the thing about the Shuttle. It was billed as a one-size-fits-all design, which is all well and good, but most of the things it did could have been done by more specialized (and therefore cheaper) designs. Most of the things it launched could have been lifted on a normal booster, and most of the scientific experiments done onboard could have been done on a more specialized capsule. (Although, a capsule large enough for seven people to live on for a week at a time? Not so easy.) But there were a few things it did that really couldn\u0027t have been done as well in other ways, like launching/servicing the Hubble telescope or launching the biggest communication satellites. One of its biggest advantages for launching satellites with very delicate components was that the astronauts could check the payload out after the high-stress launch, before deploying, which made the launch far less likely to utterly fail (not uncommon with commercial satellites).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf NASA had continued their development of traditional rockets alongside the shuttle, it wouldn\u0027t have been so bad, but instead we had a couple decades where the shuttles were used for pretty much everything important.

The shuttle was never an inherently safe method of getting to space:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) No real Launch Escape System. Essentially, the plan was either to detach the shuttle somehow (which everyone said was next to impossible to do), or literally have the astronauts jump out the side and risk the exhaust plume, not to mention no abort in a Columbia- style failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) It combined the technical complexities of rockets and spaceplanes- though it was a good craft, it was hideously complex (it took a year to install all the Thermal tiles on the Columbia) and also very heavy- the orbiter alone weighed ~100,000kg, and because it was a combined crew/ cargo vehicle this meant the facilities to make a reuseable orbiter with the SSME\u0027s with room for humans greatly reduced its cargo payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) You said it wasn\u0027t a technical challenge, and I would say that you\u0027re dead wrong. The challenge in building engines powerful enough to push the shuttle and ET into orbit after SRB separation was huge- the engines were $45 million EACH and ran at pressures 3 times greater than any previous engine. A Space Shuttle Main Engine is incredibly expensive and vulnerable- it\u0027s supposed to be reusable, hence the large budget for it, but regardless there was no way that they\u0027d be able to ever turn around a rocket with such extreme engines so quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would agree completely with your other points though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) It was far too political a spacecraft- what was intended to be a useable demonstration of reusable spaceplane technologies and manned space access turned into a program huge in scope and budget. It was an engineering triumph, but politics inflated it far beyond what it should have been.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) Politicians became too involved in the spacecraft, especially from the beginning when NASA announced it was going to be cheap to run. When money is the sole reason of \u0022going to space today\u0022, chances are you won\u0027t \u0022go to space tomorrow\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) The Space Shuttle should\u0027ve been replaced by the Ares-1. I think the Ares-1 was a great idea, far cheaper to launch than a Space Shuttle and yet carrying a capable Command Module with a Launch Escape System. I might not agree with Bush on many things, but his sponsorship of the Constellation program was a good idea. What are we even going to do with a LV as powerful as the SLS? We\u0027re not building space stations and a Martian mission is very far off, but had the Ares-1 been continued the Orion program would likely be flourishing now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T01:34:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAres I is a whole nother can of worms.
