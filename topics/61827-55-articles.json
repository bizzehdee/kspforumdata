(if the field has no gui component to it, it\u0027s going to be inaccessable from kOS - I\u0027m only trying to expose the menu, under the principle that the kOS autopilot should be able to see what the human pilot can see, and should be able to click buttons the human pilot can click. That\u0027s why I\u0027d really like to find a good way to abstract away the PartModule step - because the context menu doesn\u0027t show the partmodules to the user - it makes it look *as if* the part just natively has those fields, without explaining which ones came from which mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps the solution is to allow both:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake it so you can say:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E somePart:someModule:someField\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOR you can equivalently say:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E somePart:someField\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand it will search for you to figure out which module has a field called someField that is gui-exposed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat way you\u0027d only *have* to use the module name when there is a name clash and two mods ended up putting fields on the menu with the exact same gui label on them, which if the writers of mods are doing things well, they probably shouldn\u0027t be doing anyway as that makes for a messy user interface.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-22T14:53:01Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2014 02:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Steven Mading\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"erendrake","CreatedById":57164,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-22T19:15:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPerhaps the solution is to allow both\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was just about to post exactly this, and you beat me to it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022undercoveryankee\u0022 data-cite=\u0022undercoveryankee\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAre there any plans for how to handle the case where a part has more than one instance of the same PartModule?

Type commands in the text file like you would at the interactive terminal. Save the text file in the Plugins/PluginData/Archive folder, with a filename like \u0022MYFILE.txt\u0022.

Type commands in the text file like you would at the interactive terminal. Save the text file in the Plugins/PluginData/Archive folder, with a filename like \u0022MYFILE.txt\u0022. At the interactive terminal type these three commands: SWITCH TO 1. COPY MYFILE FROM ARCHIVE. RUN MYFILE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s important to know that any program you store on the \u0022local\u0022 volume (which is the default when you don\u0027t use the SWITCH TO command), is actually stored inside that one ship. If this ship crashes, or if you revert the flight to erase what you did to the ship, that copy of the program is gone. If it was your only copy of the program it\u0027s gone for good. So don\u0027t use that method except as a quick and dirty test.

It was designed for kOS missions. That challenge seems to be mostly dead. I\u0027d consider starting one up but I\u0027d rather not add the extra work as I fear it would detract from my working on kOS itself to help erendrake get bug fixes and features out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there anyone willing to come up with an interesting challenge and post it? The reason I ask is that I remember the last one was actually quite a boon for kOS as it sort of forced the discovery of limitations in the language once people started trying to use it to do more complex things. It increased the visibility of, and interest in, the new mod and helped test it at the same time. I think it would be great if the next release (real soon now??? dunno) were to be accompanied by such a new challenge post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings I can think of that might make interesting challenge contests off the top of my head:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe docking tests:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Build the biggest space station, taking as many launches as you feel like to complete the task. Score based on total mass and variety of parts (i.e. count unique part names that come back from LIST PARTS, so a station made of solar panels, habitats, fuel tanks, labs, etc is worth more than one made of just 10 boring fuel tanks lined up.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Perform an apollo-style mission including the docking and undocking rendezvous in munar orbit between command module and lander. Better score for landing at the actual Apollo 11 site (or, well, the Munar equivalent - the shorter the distance to the Armstrong Memorial, the higher the score). Allow lesser points for partial completion of some of the parts (i.e, you landed and came back, but didn\u0027t do it with a docking rendezvous).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBot vs Bot ideas. These would involve the contest host setting up a campaign save ready for the contest start, and inserting people\u0027s crafts into the save game and running their code on the host\u0027s computer to see how it performs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Rover obstacle course and vision test: Contestants are told only what Body the contest occurs on so they know what gravity level to design for, the names of the waypoints and the rough distance they\u0027ll cover, and that there will be some debris in the way. They must design a rover and autopilot that will allow them to run the course to the waypoints (which will be short one-part debris vessels named ahead of time so they know how to write them in the script, as in \u0022I know I need to write a program that heads for a vessel called \u0022point 1\u0022, then one called \u0022point 2\u0022, even though I don\u0027t know where those points will be yet in the actual test.\u0022. I\u0027m envisioning having to use the laserdist mod to \u0022read\u0022 the obstacles in the way of the rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Rover vs Rover soccer match: Using the soccer ball mod that SQUAD put out during the world cup, each contestant makes 2 rovers for their \u0022team\u0022, to face off against 2 rovers from an opposing team, trying to shove the ball into the other\u0027s goal. No grabbing the ball with a robot arm or asteroid grabber- it must be shoved and pushed. The goalposts would be inserted into the game save ahead of time, and the two bots from each team would be artificially inserted into the field at pre-advertised starting points. For fairness, in this one everyone has to drive the same rover (so you don\u0027t just make a goalie rover that\u0027s wide and fills the whole goal) that the contest host designs - it\u0027s a contest of the software, not the hardware, so the host would provide everyone with a copy of the savegame that has the starting conditions ahead of time for them to test with. Bots would have known names ahead of time - if you are team A then your bots are called \u0022A1\u0022 and \u0022A2\u0022 and if you\u0027re team B then you bots are called \u0022B1\u0022 and \u0022B2\u0022. Each player would provide a packet of programs to load onto the 10000byte module, and the host will load the exact same software on both their team bots.). Each bot would have to have one program called with RUN GAMESTART(whistletime), where whistletime is the TIME:SECONDS in the near future when the game is actually supposed to start (the bot better not move before then). This gives the hosting person time to run around and type that into all the bots and get them ready and waiting to go at the same time as each other. Each bot can query its own SHIP:NAME to find out if it\u0027s name is A1,A2,B1,or B2, which tells it which team it\u0027s on, and perhaps the player might program them to change their behavior accordingly (i.e. make the \u00271\u0027 bot go on offense and the \u00272\u0027 bot go on defense).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are just ideas off the top of my head that could be fun. Obviously if you wish to be the host of such a challenge, you\u0027ll have a lot more details than that to discuss and hammer out. These are just quick and fuzzy brainstorming ideas - take them or leave them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lilleman","CreatedById":112321,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-27T16:11:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome new challenges would be great, but I don\u0027t see myself maintaining a thread about them without having completed at least one before...
