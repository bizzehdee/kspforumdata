\u00A0Make a flyby mission that gets there as fast as possible and, hopefully, in time to inform the design for the less difficult transfer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have just unlocked the Skipper and some of the 2.5m fuel tanks. \u00A0A serious limitation is the dish that I can field which can only get about 90 Gm range. \u00A0The probe is about 1.5m and I determined that after launch into a 100km circular orbit, I had about 4.7km/s delta-v available. \u00A0Enter KSP Trajectory Optimization Tool (by Arrowstar). \u00A0Using this tool, I determined that I could burn about 4km/s and get an encounter in about 130d. \u00A0This gets me close to the optimal transfer window for the next mission. \u00A0I have some contracts to obtain near and high data over Ike so in KSPTOT I had optimized for the Ike transfer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m still sorting through how to translate the burns from KSPTOT to how to actually time them in KSP. \u00A0It\u0027s non-trivial when you have maneuvers of 4\u002Bkm/s on a Poodle that takes 3 minutes to complete. \u00A0However, I managed the burns near-Kerbin to obtain the first close approach to Ike. \u00A0After leaving the SOI of Kerbin, I conducted a small correction burn to get me a close approach to both Ike and Duna. \u00A0There\u0027s still a few hundred delta-V in the probe, so I might try to arrange a flyby of Jool if I can get the trajectory off of Duna, but even so, this mission will be a success. \u00A0Some images are here in this imgur album.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/wPEiw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSP 1.1.2 Kolony!\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll supplement the thread when the probe arrives.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSPTOT definitely took a lot of guess-work out of the mission. \u00A0I\u0027m hoping to get mission planning a bit more accurate than I did on this first attempt, but so far this has been a nice experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DivisionByZero","CreatedById":62591,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-27T05:49:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFly by complete!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Imgur album is updated with a few more images:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/wPEiw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/wPEiw\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mission was pretty successful. \u00A0The flyby maneuver, though, was really fast! \u00A0Only a couple hours after entering the Duna \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E did I get to Duna periapsis with the Ike flyby in between. \u00A0I had to use RemoteTech to get the near-space science timed correctly and it mostly worked. \u00A0The battery drain during transmission really knocked out a lot of information I would have otherwise gained. \u00A0There will still be work for my manned Duna mission to do, I suppose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had an unexpected treat that I captured in the screenshots: Ike was providing an eclipses on Duna when I entered the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. \u00A0I hadn\u0027t thought about this, but there it was as I got closer. \u00A0Pretty neat - made me appreciate the game again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot enough delta-v to catch an encounter with Jool, unfortunately. \u00A0I only have about 388 m/s on-board. \u00A0Instead, I set up a theoretical maneuver at apoapsis that will get me the Jool encounter in a mere 23 years. \u00A0lol. \u00A0Even though apoapsis is still within the orbit of Sarnus, I don\u0027t think the antenna that was put on the probe can make it. \u00A0No matter, I\u0027ll have long since sent Kerbals to Jool by then. \u00A0I better have sent them, I think.
