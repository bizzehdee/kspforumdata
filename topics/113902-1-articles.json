Now I\u0027ll add RCS, parachutes, solar and all the necessities - currently it\u0027s pretty bare-bones (doesn\u0027t even have anything on the nose - I could really have put a nose cone there...). I really don\u0027t want to try horizontal landing with this huge cow, but with \u0022powered landing\u0022 (descent slowed by jets and held vertical by parachute) the landing on landing struts should work okay. If anything, the engines will serve as crumple zone. (I have one such lander already; would hit the ground at dangerous speed but smashing the engine to smithereens saves the cabin and payload.)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

That was long and arduous, and involved switching three upper rows of jet engines off manually as it just won\u0027t keep its nose up at less than 200m/s. (and with four jets operating at full power it was losing speed in horizontal flight...) The braking itself took a good three minutes - this thing is HEAVY.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T21:19:17Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 09:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy**"}]}
