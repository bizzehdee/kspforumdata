Not particularly useful but I would like to see it working in any case. The plane functions perfectly, but the drone doesn\u0027t, when I drop the drone and switch to it the navball is oriented wrong and thus screws up my controls. When I press up I go right, when I press left I go down, etc, etc. And I can\u0027t figure out why. I am using the infernal robotics mod for this plane. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
