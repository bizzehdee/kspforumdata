Not particularly useful but I would like to see it working in any case. The plane functions perfectly, but the drone doesn\u0027t, when I drop the drone and switch to it the navball is oriented wrong and thus screws up my controls. When I press up I go right, when I press left I go down, etc, etc. And I can\u0027t figure out why. I am using the infernal robotics mod for this plane. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Here is the plane.![mohaHlB.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/mohaHlB.jpg)\n\nHere is the drone, and how it detaches.![TWGupdg.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/TWGupdg.jpg)\n\nAnd here is the drone unfolded on the runway with normal navball. (Launched as its own vehicle)![SCVqfXY.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/SCVqfXY.jpg)\n\nProblem is that when I detach it from the carrier having launched them as one craft switching to the drone shows its navball is wrongly oriented. And here is a pic of that After landing. ![gTCffqT.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/gTCffqT.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T10:39:22Z","Content":"Right click the correct part and choose \u0022Control from here\u0022\n\nMost likely by default game uses the part that used to directly attach to the detaching part for initial navball orientation."},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T10:47:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Right click the correct part and choose \u0022Control from here\u0022\n\u003E Most likely by default game uses the part that used to directly attach to the detaching part for initial navball orientation.\n\nThis is correct.
