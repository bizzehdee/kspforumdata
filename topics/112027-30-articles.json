Nah, I\u0027ll stick to using the Poodle or Rhino, because I suck at keeping things lightweight (gotta have all the science experiments on the lander, and that means a fairly large lander, especially when you\u0027re sending that lander all the way out to Jool).\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think that comes from balancing based on the LV-N, which is in a very sad state relative to the performance of its real-world counterpart, IIRC the KSP devs specifically said \u0022we made it pretty bad so it doesn\u0027t just render the regular rocket engines obsolete\u0022, when in reality that\u0027s exactly what it would do... if humans were immune to radiation damage like Kerbals are anyways. So I remove about 2 tons of mass from the LV-N, and double the thrust, and half the amount of stock heat it generates, and hey presto the LV-N is looking like a pretty good alternative to the Poodle now, even if it is still pretty heavy and low thrust in comparison. I mean stock the LV-N is only putting out 60kn of thrust in a vacuum for almost 4t of engine mass, which is quite frankly awful unless you have the patience of a saint, which I do not. Then you have to factor in the amount of radiators, which just makes the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E (and therefore burn times) worse, and then you need even MORE radiators to handle that longer burn time.\u003Cbr\u003E\nPoint being, I can make a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E based interplanetary transfer stage for a rocket fairly easily. Yes, nuclear rocket engines are more complex, but they\u0027re supposed to reduce trip times, not increase them, and since you can time warp past the slower transfer speeds of \u0022\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E rocket\u0022-friendly transfer trajectories, it ends up being MORE of a headache to use the stock nuclear engine than it is to just use the dang old boring \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E rockets, which is exactly the opposite of the result I think they wanted.
