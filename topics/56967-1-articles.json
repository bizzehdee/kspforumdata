You should see a folder with the name of your save in there - that\u0027s what you need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECOPY that folder (we don\u0027t want to move it or do anything that might destroy it - just in case!), and then open up your .23 version folder. Again, go to KSP_win/saves and PASTE your save folder in there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat should do it. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy launching!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jsfalconero","CreatedById":89120,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T03:20:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAdding to the above, they\u0027ve recently included a patcher (under the main KSP folder or accessable through the launcher) that will update the game without disturbing your current saves. As long as an update doesn\u0027t break saves you can update that way and keep your saves without any added effort. Personally I like to start fresh each time, but it\u0027s another option for next time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you can move individual crafts between saves by looking in the ships folder (under VAB or SPH) finding and moving the craft. That way you can build a ship in one save then launch it in another, or build a ship you like and use it in all your saves.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
