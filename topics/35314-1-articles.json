So panicking. I just started burning retrograde hoping for the best, My rocket crashed down hard and I ejected the landing probe to see if I could save the valuable piece of equipment. (RP) I softly landed it onto the Mun using its tiny little engine, sadly one of its solarpanels broke and all of its lights, but that didnt matter, because what we landed in front of was un real... I had managed to crash land directly in front of the only easter egg on the Mun I hadnt found yet:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i44.tinypic.com/i3c3g1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022i3c3g1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still cant believe I got this lucky.
