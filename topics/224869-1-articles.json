Is there a way we can prompt a fix to this? On April 25th, they released a post saying talking about upcoming improvements, including specifically \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul style=\u0022background-color:#25282e;color:#cfd2d3;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nManeuver nodes refuse to allow the player to plan beyond the calculated Delta-V allowance, which in many cases is an incorrect value\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis isn\u0027t the same problem as I\u0027m describing, but I wouldn\u0027t prompt for them to fix not being able to plan a node when time is stopped.
