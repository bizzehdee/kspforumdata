There was so much whining and worrying about little things, and some are valid, but on the good side, you have 100% completely nailed it. I\u0027m just playing with planes for now, and the new parts are amazingly modeled, with some of the best detail I\u0027ve ever seen, they look beautiful in design, and the function is awesome. Just playing with the new airbrakes and tweakables for control surfaces, with being able to pitch and yaw with airbrakes, and using control surfaces for flaps and brakes?? It\u0027s amazing Squad, you\u0027ve truly outdone yourself. The atmospheric effects with the clouds with engine startup, the smoke on the launch pad, the rumble and camera shake at high speeds and tight turns - I had my mouth open the whole time through this, and my family thinks I\u0027m an idiot for telling my computer how amazing this game is. Again, thank you so much, you\u0027ve done a great job. This is by far the best update I have ever seen for any game.\n\nThe only thing is the few wishes I have. I think a tweakable slide bar for fairings for how many pieces a clamshell fairing would open into would perfect the fairings, and I don\u0027t think the Mk 1 inline cockpit *quite* fits with the style of the rest of the parts, but the IVA is great.\n\nThanks again Squad, you guys are awesome!\n\n-Slab"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T01:24:31Z","Content":"While true there is already a thread for this.
