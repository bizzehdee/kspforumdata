If binding the KAL-1000 to for example the pitch axis, that controller and only that controller can modify the active position of the flap, and hence the flap can only be used for pitch control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be much more useful if KAL-1000 controllers could be engaged, and disengaged with action groups, and simultaneously if multiple controllers with the sample priority, controlling the same part, would have their part control position interpolated. This means that if you had two KAL-1000 controllers with the same priority, one set for pitch, and one set for roll, that when they both try to control the same part (flap, tail, etc) that they would find the best \u0022inbetween\u0022 position. Effectively allowing you to simultaneously control one part with two controllers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso is it possible to bind a KAL-1000 to the autopilot? So for example a KAL-1000 controller can control a servo with respect to holding prograde/retrograde/etc? Additionally KAL-1000 controllers bound to specific control axes hold their position and do not return to neutral when control input is removed. Is there a way to set them to return to neutral automatically if no autopilot is engaged?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKind Regards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chem trail","CreatedById":209258,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-07T03:59:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust to echo Noxissist, make a KAL-1000 that allows for variable\u00A0inputs instead of playing a track. \u00A0Autopilots, FADECs for turbo shaft engines, controlling\u00A0the fins on my SpaceX Starship reproduction while in belly flop phase of flight. \u00A0That would be monumental.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blaarkies","CreatedById":153700,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-07T06:48:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat would be awesome, i have struggled so much trying to make a KAL controlled rocket (even just trying to hit the runway island with it).

It kind of has the effect of allowing each mode to activated individually, although it\u0027s an odd work around. The controllers (and hence flaps) also do not automatically return to a neutral position like the space-plane flaps and are not linked to the autopilot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou will be able to see from the video, why the interpolation is needed for advanced craft designs. When trying to land the \u0022Starship Mini\u0022 there is only one controller active, and it can only control pitch. The roll and yaw axis control are non-existent and the craft only really maintains those orientations because of it\u0027s inherent stability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be awesome to be able to mount the main probe core to a hinge, and have the flaps attached to the autopilot via the KAL-1000 controllers, then simply setting probe core relative angle with the hinge and with the autopilot for example prograde, will set the desired craft pitch, and the autopilot can do the hard work of controlling the flaps to maintain orientation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnjoy the video, it\u0027s short and sweet, and the landing nicely illustrates what I am talking about with KAL-1000 controller interpolation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKind Regards,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GDale28","CreatedById":211740,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-20T05:25:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would like to ask if there are ways or methods that could KAL- 1000 controller could automatically adjust a part\u0027s position. For example, a flap like the starship made out of hinges that would automatically adjust into a different angle when the ship\u0027s position would alter or move. It would be the same with airbrakes that would adjust its yaw, pitch, and roll in order to have a steady flight shown in a video of Tim (Everyday Astronaut)\u00A0 1:10:00.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/uEdtSsADEGM?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
