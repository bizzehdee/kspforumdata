A spaceship is dangerous to entire planets, spacecraft and spacestations. Han Solo won\u0027t exist, anymore than he flies airliners. Professional spaceflight companies would fly spaceships, and no one would OWN a vessel unless super rich.

Yet the real problem is is ship and station rendezvous. Possible, but do you really want nukes going off in your ship\u0027s direction as another\u00A0ship slows to dock? Realistically a ship would need plenty of propellant for docking and rendezvous in outer\u00A0space. No one wants nuke blasts during docking LOL.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I like about this drive is that it scales up and down well. Put it on a missile OR big ship. Works either way. Lots of thrust and delta v. Want months long acceleration? Payload will be small, ship would be full of bomblets. Several days of acceleration is more likely if the ship has warp or FTL, since acceleration is only needed for adjusting orbitsl trajectories anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you think?

No concept is truly DOA, though some things require more work than others to make believable. Your list definitely has concepts that require a fair amount of work to really make sense, but it isn\u0027t impossible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Private ownership of starships - If \u0022planetary shields\u0022 are a thing you could allow private ownership because you now have a defense (of course now you need to explain how shields can exist). There is also the option of doing something like Babylon 5 where non-military ships require well controlled jumpgates rather than being able to achieve high speeds on their own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Anti-gravity and spacestations - If anti-gravity fields require a lot of power then space stations can still make sense. It really depends on the rules you create for your anti-gravity drive whether it really kills space stations. You can also make a plausible case for space stations as orbital habitats (maybe to handle overpopulation or just to give humanity a backup option) even if anti-gravity makes it easy to get to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving said that, good science fiction extrapolates from existing science to a place that is logical enough that it doesn\u0027t require a lot of explanation to to achieve \u0022suspension of disbelief\u0022. There are certainly a lot of tropes in science fiction that are extremely common, but actually don\u0027t make a lot of sense based on current science. These are usually because they were tropes before the science was established or more often because they fix a common need in narrative story telling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExamples:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. FTL - While there are some vague theories about how this can be achieved, most require negative energy and other things that may simply not exist. It does however make it plausible for the same crew to see more than one planet in their lifetime, so we generally accept it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Transporters (Matter-\u0026gt;Energy-\u0026gt;Matter type) - The Heisenburg uncertainty principle makes this highly unlikely. The fact that this involves containing the same energy as a matter/anti-matter detonation of equivalent mass also stretches credibility. Star Trek at least had the Heisenburg compensators as a nod to those in the audience who knew why it probably wouldn\u0027t work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Telepathy\u00A0 - The idea of one brain naturally interfacing with another is pretty far-fetched. Doing it wirelessly is even more so. I will however give Babylon 5 credit for having a semi-plausible explanation (direct genetic manipulation by a more advanced species rather than a naturally emerging trait).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Energy Shields - We know of nothing that could allow anything like an energy shield to exist. They do however make it possible to have space battles that aren\u0027t just ships firing missiles beyond visual range at one another (though the Expanse proves that can be cool too if you know what you\u0027re doing).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Knew elements with fantastic properties - No matter what planet you\u0027re on the atomic elements are the same (different ratios for certain, but the same elements). You aren\u0027t going to another planet and finding new elements, that will probably happen in a lab. If the proposed \u0022island of stability\u0022 exists you might be able to create heavier elements, but they will almost certainly have the properties you can extrapolate from their position on the periodic table. Also my recollection is that the stability is relative and they are still short lived, just not the femtosecond lifetime you might expect. You can definitely get some materials with unexpected properties, but the trope is usually a new atomic element.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReally you need to keep your audience engaged and keep from pulling them out of the story while they try to make sense of your concept. This usually means not straying too far from the rules we have come to know in our everyday lives with some plausible extrapolations. You should also try to avoid creating rules that contradict existing laws (over-unity energy production for example).
