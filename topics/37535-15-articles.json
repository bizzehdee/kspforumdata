Although there will be a navball on the control panel (just above the altimeter and inbetween the center and pilot MFDs) we are not spending any time or effort working on it. Although I\u0027m placing it at the best location so you are able to zoom out a window while still having it in view.

However, I think in the end you will appreciate it much more than the cluttered up Navball. All of the information you need will be in NAV mode in an intuitive and clutter free method. We\u0027ll test it extensively before you download this mod and start playing. If we find that it doesn\u0027t work, then we\u0027ll bring it closer to the Navball.

The reason it ended up being separate parts was because I didn\u0027t/don\u0027t know how KSP handles components. When I proposed the project (this thread) most of the responses and advice leaned towards the \u0022parts\u0022 idea. Originally the KSO fuselage was going to be a single piece, with the vertical planes, landing gear, avionics, and docking component separate. Since learning that it didn\u0027t have to be separate parts, I\u0027ve welded some sections permanently (i.e. the SAS and Cockpit segments for example).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI specifically made the wing base so that it would snap to the cargo bay in that fashion. Again keep in mind that I originally never planned for the wings to be separate parts. The other issue (the more important one) is the one of aesthetics; I don\u0027t want a disjointed look. I intentionally designed the KSO to be sleek and aerodynamic and \u0022chibby\u0022 like the original pics that inspired me to make it. To get proper edge flow, loops, and later sub-division of surfaces, meant that the wing-to-fuselage join as well as other locations wouldn\u0027t be flush if I split them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could have made it very geometric, but then we wouldn\u0027t have ended up with the aerodynamic look I wanted.
