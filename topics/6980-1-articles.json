This makes the design unstable at high thrust-weight ratios and prone to tipping over uncontrollably. Here is my experiment to make a design with more of the thrust at the top for stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had to work around two main challenges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) The fuel of the craft drains from the top down. This means stages have to be jettisoned from the top down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Dropped stages from above tend to crash into the stages below them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis makes the vessel somewhat complicated to pilot. Stages need to be dropped 1 fuel tank after they stop working. Also, the third stage in needs to be dropped at about 60% thrust or the entire thing will explode. You also might need to activate RCSs about 3 stages in as the late stages are unstable, the balancing thrusters have been jettisoned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship itself isn\\\u0027t remarkable, but it\\\u0027s an interesting design concept.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xivios","CreatedById":3685,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-24T05:11:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s also a flawed concept, in fact, Wikipedia has a very nice article on exactly this, the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum_rocket_fallacy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPendulum Rocket Fallacy\u003C/a\u003E (and before anyone jumps down my throat for using wikipedia, note that the article is referenced).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThat said\u003C/em\u003E, making it work definately qualifies as Kerbal to me 8).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"corinoco","CreatedById":13156,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-24T05:39:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy \\\u0027This Way Up\\\u0027 design explored the same challenges; and yes, I already knew about the \u003Cem\u003ERocket Pendulum Fallacy\u003C/em\u003E - but clearly Jeb hasn\\\u0027t heard of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery impressive to get all the way to the Mun with your design though; I was never able to keep the upper stages stable for long enough to achieve an accurate trans-Munar orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Duban","CreatedById":16399,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-24T05:40:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Xivios\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Xivios\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s also a flawed concept, in fact, Wikipedia has a very nice article on exactly this, the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum_rocket_fallacy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPendulum Rocket Fallacy\u003C/a\u003E (and before anyone jumps down my throat for using wikipedia, note that the article is referenced).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThat said\u003C/em\u003E, making it work definately qualifies as Kerbal to me 8).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood point.

(That is, gravity points down from the center, and thrust points up upwards of the center.) These forces are thus in a stable equilibrium.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen this is reversed, with gravity pointing downward above the thrust pointing upward, this causes an unstable equilibrium.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rigidity of a rocket renders moot any unstable equilibrium that might exist in this case. But because the rocket is not rigid, any slight wobbles will necessarily cause a net torque on the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI performed a test for this. I made two 30m tall rockets, one with engines at the bottom, the other with engines at the top. for the engines at the top case the rocket tended to go straight up, but for the engines at the bottom case the rocket curled up and crashed into the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
