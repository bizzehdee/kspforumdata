Company employees have an inside joke that CMAU\u0027s motto is \u0027Go big or go home\u0027 as many designs the CMAU R\u0026amp;D department came up with were seriously overkill in either weapons or size, to the point of affecting the vessels performance. Fortunately, the designs were usually \u0027tamed\u0027 over time and often generated pretty good vessels. Originally, they were on the side of GMI, as they believed that HKA was monopolizing the Kethane business. However, they had thought that GMI merely wanted trade equality. CMAU\u0027s board of directors was shocked when GMI conducted their unprovoked attack on HKA. They called for a board vote as to what the company\u0027s reaction would be, and two options came to the forefront: withdrawal of all support for GMI, and fully supporting HKA against GMI, or withdrawing from the situation utterly, supporting neither side, and refuse to comment on the matter. The board gridlocked for weeks over it, those arguing to support HKA claiming that GMI had gone too far and crossed the line and that if the company did nothing, GMI would eventually do the same to them. Those who argued to withdraw claimed that while GMI had obviously crossed the line, it was really a matter between GMI and HKA. They hypothesized that the attack was actually not unprovoked, it was just the end result of a long drawn conflict between the two sides that they hadn\u0027t seen before because it really was a private matter and if CMAU dived into the matter, not only would it destroy business, it would mean that CMAU would earn a reputation for meddling in private affairs. Besides, HKA was doing fine on their own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe board eventually decided to put up a company-wide poll asking employees to express their opinions on the matter. A small majority was in favor of withdrawal, with an imaginative addition: open a new branch to manufacture space dreadnaughts so that if GMI did decide to clash with CMAU, they would lose badly. The CEO presented this option to the Board as a safeguard, and the motion passed. A few were still discontent, claiming that it wouldn\u0027t be enough. Some even claimed to have inside GMI sources saying that GMI wanted to take over the world, but no proof was found and most blew it off as yet another conspiracy theory. When GMI seemed to be disbanded, those who had advocated withdrawal appeared to be proven right, and most said CMAU had made the right decision. They even had a handsome profit from the new branch. Everything seemed perfect. Then, GMI shocked the world with their comeback. The dissenters of course took it as proof that they had been right all along, but few wanted to believe them. Few want to believe that there is a malevolent force that wants to take over the world.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then GMI did take over the world. Their blockade proved the dissenters right, and suddenly HKA was practically destroyed, and GMI could rain missiles from orbit on anyone they chose. The board met secretly, and unanimously voted to take the side of the HKA and fight. They decided to do it secretly, though. Officially, CMAU remained neutral. They obtained a pass to continue launching and building ships. Fortunately, they already had a massive fleet already in orbit that next to no one knew about, since it was in an orbit far beyond Minmus. The jewel of the fleet was called the Leviathan, and it was the biggest ship CMAU ever made, dwarfing some skyscrapers and most seagoing battle ships. Made from futuristic technology developed in top secret as part of the deterrence initiative, it fully lived up to the inside joke: \u0027Go big or go home\u0027. It was accompanied by several other large space battle ships, but none as large or impressive as it was.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCMAU decided to bring it and its fleet into the war as soon as the fleet could be ready. Also they decided to commit a significant amount of the company\u0027s resources to manufacture as many fighters, bombers and tanks as could be kept secret. The board was well aware that as soon as they made a public move that sided with HKA, all bets would be up and they would become GMI\u0027s enemy. This would mean that GMI would strike at them as soon as possible, to neutralize the threat before it became any bigger. This meant that literally the very day they officially took a side, they would have to be ready to fight, perhaps even within the hour. The only reason that GMI was allowing them to make so many war machines at all was because secretly, the CEO had hinted that CMAU would soon enter on the side of GMI, but because of public opinion, he wanted to prepare as many ships as possible before officially announcing CMAU\u0027s stance since public opinion of his company, sales, profits, and therefore funding would plummet as a direct result of the announcement. This would allow the maximum number of ships to be made \u0027for\u0027 GMI before funding died. In reality, CMAU was trying to make as many ships as possible so that not only could they help HKA more, they could defend their assets when under attack by GMI. It didn\u0027t hurt that it was easier to make ships when not under attack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yes, it is a colossal ship.

Company employees have an inside joke that CMAU\u0027s motto is \u0027Go big or go home\u0027 as many designs the CMAU R\u0026amp;D department came up with were seriously overkill in either weapons or size, to the point of affecting the vessels performance. Fortunately, the designs were usually \u0027tamed\u0027 over time and often generated pretty good vessels. Originally, they were on the side of GMI, as they believed that HKA was monopolizing the Kethane business. However, they had thought that GMI merely wanted trade equality. CMAU\u0027s board of directors was shocked when GMI conducted their unprovoked attack on HKA. They called for a board vote as to what the company\u0027s reaction would be, and two options came to the forefront: withdrawal of all support for GMI, and fully supporting HKA against GMI, or withdrawing from the situation utterly, supporting neither side, and refuse to comment on the matter. The board gridlocked for weeks over it, those arguing to support HKA claiming that GMI had gone too far and crossed the line and that if the company did nothing, GMI would eventually do the same to them. Those who argued to withdraw claimed that while GMI had obviously crossed the line, it was really a matter between GMI and HKA. They hypothesized that the attack was actually not unprovoked, it was just the end result of a long drawn conflict between the two sides that they hadn\u0027t seen before because it really was a private matter and if CMAU dived into the matter, not only would it destroy business, it would mean that CMAU would earn a reputation for meddling in private affairs. Besides, HKA was doing fine on their own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe board eventually decided to put up a company-wide poll asking employees to express their opinions on the matter. A small majority was in favor of withdrawal, with an imaginative addition: open a new branch to manufacture space dreadnaughts so that if GMI did decide to clash with CMAU, they would lose badly. The CEO presented this option to the Board as a safeguard, and the motion passed. A few were still discontent, claiming that it wouldn\u0027t be enough. Some even claimed to have inside GMI sources saying that GMI wanted to take over the world, but no proof was found and most blew it off as yet another conspiracy theory. When GMI seemed to be disbanded, those who had advocated withdrawal appeared to be proven right, and most said CMAU had made the right decision. They even had a handsome profit from the new branch. Everything seemed perfect. Then, GMI shocked the world with their comeback. The dissenters of course took it as proof that they had been right all along, but few wanted to believe them. Few want to believe that there is a malevolent force that wants to take over the world.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then GMI did take over the world. Their blockade proved the dissenters right, and suddenly HKA was practically destroyed, and GMI could rain missiles from orbit on anyone they chose. The board met secretly, and unanimously voted to take the side of the HKA and fight. They decided to do it secretly, though. Officially, CMAU remained neutral. They obtained a pass to continue launching and building ships. Fortunately, they already had a massive fleet already in orbit that next to no one knew about, since it was in an orbit far beyond Minmus. The jewel of the fleet was called the Leviathan, and it was the biggest ship CMAU ever made, dwarfing some skyscrapers and most seagoing battle ships. Made from futuristic technology developed in top secret as part of the deterrence initiative, it fully lived up to the inside joke: \u0027Go big or go home\u0027. It was accompanied by several other large space battle ships, but none as large or impressive as it was.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCMAU decided to bring it and its fleet into the war as soon as the fleet could be ready. Also they decided to commit a significant amount of the company\u0027s resources to manufacture as many fighters, bombers and tanks as could be kept secret. The board was well aware that as soon as they made a public move that sided with HKA, all bets would be up and they would become GMI\u0027s enemy. This would mean that GMI would strike at them as soon as possible, to neutralize the threat before it became any bigger. This meant that literally the very day they officially took a side, they would have to be ready to fight, perhaps even within the hour. The only reason that GMI was allowing them to make so many war machines at all was because secretly, the CEO had hinted that CMAU would soon enter on the side of GMI, but because of public opinion, he wanted to prepare as many ships as possible before officially announcing CMAU\u0027s stance since public opinion of his company, sales, profits, and therefore funding would plummet as a direct result of the announcement. This would allow the maximum number of ships to be made \u0027for\u0027 GMI before funding died. In reality, CMAU was trying to make as many ships as possible so that not only could they help HKA more, they could defend their assets when under attack by GMI. It didn\u0027t hurt that it was easier to make ships when not under attack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yes, it is a colossal ship.

Anyway, I hope my major mess up doesn\u0027t mean that I\u0027m black-listed, as I have quite a few stock ships that I would still like to submit, and I am actually quite looking forward to designing a stock space battleship. I was quite impressed with your creative designs like the Aegis, and I think I can make something along those lines.

Some people build them in a similar manner to non-military spacecraft, putting vital part(s) as the root. However, tougher, more purpose-built warship designs tend to have a strong structural-part skeletal support structure that the root part is often enmeshed in.
