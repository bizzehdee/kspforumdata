I\u0027m running v1.2.2, is that an important difference?\n\u003E \n\nImpact is compatible with all KSP 1.2 versions\n\nImpact is based on a few real world experiments, The seismometer is based on the [Apollo Passive Seismic Experimen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Surface_Experiment_Package)t which studies the internal structure of the moon by listening to the effects of moonquakes and meteorite impacts. As there are no natural impacts in KSP, and because I like explosions the kerbals have to create their own impacts by crashing as hard as possible into the body. Gameplay wise you have to land the seismometer anywhere on the target body and then crash a probe into the body at a couple of km/s\n\nThe Spectometer is based on a few experiments like the NASA [Deep impact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Impact_%28spacecraft%29) and India\u0027s [Moon Impact Probe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Impact_Probe) which have crashed impactors into things in order to analyse the spectra of the ejected debris. Gameplay wise you need to set up an impact and time it so that a probe carrying a spectrometer is in orbit and above the horizon at the time of impact.\n\nThe DMagic seismometer experiments are more like local active seismology - they will tell you about what lies in the top few KM below the surface in detail but won\u0027t have anything to say about the interior. Gameplay wise it involves setting up a couple of pods a few km away and then triggering the hammer experiment."},{"CreatedByName":"MisterFister","CreatedById":85686,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-03T10:46:28Z","Content":"Ok, but I\u0027m asking a different question, and I apologize for not being clearer.

Impact has it\u0027s own contracts so shouldn\u0027t interact with Contract configurator, although I think that pack that gives you contracts to get all the science will ask you to get impact science too.\n\nGameplay wise the difference is that for my mod you need to set up the instrument either on the surface or an appropriate orbit and then take a second craft and Crash it. For dmagic you need to set up the seismic pods and then run the experimet by clicking it, KSPIE looks like it only requires clicking to run like most of the stock ones, and SEP is about the set up with an engineer and scientist and then alowing time to pass.\n\nOf course the more science mods you have in your game the easier it is to fill out the tree without leaving the Kerbin system, which can be positive or negative depending on how you feel about landing a materials bay into every mun biome.\n\nRole-play wise the KSPIE and Dmagic are different experiments although SEP does overlap."},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-03T15:28:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, MisterFister said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Ok, but I\u0027m asking a different question, and I apologize for not being clearer.
