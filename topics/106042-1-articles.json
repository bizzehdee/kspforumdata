The only thing that sort of works to get the Kerbals off the plane is using their RCS thrusters and repeatedly pushing F (climb) until he/she falls of the craft.\n\nA craft that is parked in perfect horizontal condition such as on the KSC runway, is not giving the Kerbals such a headache and walking around on the craft works fine.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T17:47:42Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 05:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Andy81le**"}]}
