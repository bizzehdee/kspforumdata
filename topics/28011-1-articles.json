The long nose will scrape the ground if it bounces off the runway at any less than ~40 m/sec. Going faster, the suspension rebound tends to dig the nose in. So with foils at maximum trim, the KATV swans down the runway and approaches the water no faster than 7-8 m/sec.

All at once, thanks to clever hotkeys for the servos. Binding both hinges to the same group preserves their relative orientation, meaning that the hinges move equal amounts in opposite directions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v165/piloter/KSP/46dd8970-fdf9-49c0-b44d-adf324dcb9b4.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u002246dd8970-fdf9-49c0-b44d-adf324dcb9b4.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v165/piloter/KSP/9e09e9ba-893a-40a0-82da-630e65b681b7.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u00229e09e9ba-893a-40a0-82da-630e65b681b7.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the foils fully deployed, the extensions come into play. Because I haven\u0027t yet added an angle-of-attack rotational adjustment (ugh!), the center of lift goes below the center of mass and acts to pull the craft downward. By giving more up, it can handle more speed. The nose also extends separately...this is one of those things that used to help in high-speed flight and speedboating, then became somewhat useless but it looks cool as heck so I kept it in. LARGE control surfaces help here, as does SAS, but the speed limiting factor is when the leading edge touches the surface. The rover wheels really slow the boat down with mass and drag and shifting the CoM around, a prior version (Failboat Five) would reliably cruise at 150\u002B m/sec but this only manages ~110.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v165/piloter/KSP/2b96c9c0-8615-4793-b3d5-b9fdf212193b.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u00222b96c9c0-8615-4793-b3d5-b9fdf212193b.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame 25% throttle and now it\u0027ll do ~50m/sec. Hydrofoils....they really, really work. As long as the subsurface bits don\u0027t MOVE, because then SAS will just explode your boat the first time it wiggles them. The rescue system extends....stacked ladders. Unfortunately the pWing plugin is really a pain in the ass here, the trailing edge is not \u0027solid\u0027 to the point where you can attach things to it, and ladders just vanish if you try.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v165/piloter/KSP/d9d3945c-d86b-4656-b9a7-c2db2fc45a24.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022d9d3945c-d86b-4656-b9a7-c2db2fc45a24.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFun fact...between Kerbal collision issues and pWing solidity issues the rescue system doesn\u0027t actually work in the water. They can climb the ladders but never sit in the seats...the boat can never remain completely still, so when the Kerbals hit a moving surface (like the pWing) they just go catatonic, little arms wide, and can\u0027t move until they roll off from acceleration. On LAND it works great! I\u0027m going to see if I can\u0027t improvise something with the boat parts walk-through struts and maybe put the seats on the actual winglets instead. Anyway, it\u0027ll do ~110 m/sec under jet power before the front wheels dig in and destroy the boat. I lock the gimbals and enable SAS because otherwise there\u0027s a nasty steering wobble issue that I can\u0027t track down. At certain speeds I start getting a pitch-bob issue which the nose extension seems to help with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v165/piloter/KSP/26d217fb-3df9-4e1d-9024-c36c4a8478e5.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u002226d217fb-3df9-4e1d-9024-c36c4a8478e5.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s easy to get out of the water, too.

As long as the slope is shallow enough for the front overhang, it\u0027ll climb right out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid I mention it flies? Raise the foils and hit full power. The end of the runway (~150m/sec) will bounce the nose up and it\u0027ll start climbing. The foil angle IS the nose trim, bringing them down again mostly level will lower the CoL until the pitch is neutral. You can also dial in some negative trim this way. Extending the nose and winglets will result in a little more roll stability although it doesn\u0027t need much attention as-is...once airborne there\u0027s a LOT of lift. It\u0027ll fly stable or unstable as you want, with or without thrust vectoring.

It also has an absolutely beautiful landing approach...you can chop the engines and it\u0027s still got lift at around 40 m/sec. There may be enough lift to slow it down enough to land it at ~10m/sec on the water which I think is about the threshold for things ripping off, but so far I don\u0027t have the deft touch to make that happen. (Maybe if Squad adds joystick support.)

To do this, pick a fuel tank as the core, then add additional fuel tanks / engines / cockpits etc in such a way that the CoM does not really move from the position it was in when your craft was the just the core tank alone. Set up your fuel lines so that tanks drain towards the middle with the core tank draining last. Once you have a stable core add length and the hydrofoils 100% symmetrically at either end. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- With any lifting surfaces you use make sure they are symmetric but inverted at either end. . . if they all point the same way you\u0027ll start generating a decent amount of lift which can mess up stability. Basically you want the have the lift /downforce from wings at either end cancelling each other out\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Following the above principle its then not a bad idea to put a few canards at the extremes of either end to help keep the craft stable. . . I dunno if its strictly needed but I disabled the yaw and roll controls for the canards to be safe. . . having them only control pitch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Large wings with just a couple of radial intakes (like those in designs below) make the best hydrofoils. . . over do the intakes and it might be a bit too buoyant, the craft will bounce around like a mad thing when it hits the water from chutes and at speed might lift up enough that you have things breaking the surface repeatedly and snapping off\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If your dropping the craft by parachute (as I was) then the flatter it hits the water the better. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If you\u0027re going for speed use turbo jets, if you don\u0027t mind sacrificing about 20-50 m/s for a vastly longer range / higher fuel efficiency use standard jet engines.
