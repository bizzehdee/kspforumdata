You gave pretty good coverage over the electronic effects of having an oxygen present -\u00A0The only thing I\u0027d add is that simple ol\u0027 mass has a significant effect on melting/boiling points.

These pairs are available to form a sort-of \u0022pseudo bond\u0022 with any electron-deficient areas on neighbouring molecules. Hydrogen has a strong affinity for its electrons, but it is\u00A0electron-deficient, all of its electrons being involved in the bond it is involved in. Thus there is a delta-positive and a \u0022lone pair\u0022 from a nearby oxygen will be able to make a bond here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rule is \u0022FON\u0022. Fluorine, Nitrogen and Oxygen have an abundance of electrons and have these \u0022lone pairs\u0022 in their outer shells which are able to bond to hydrogen, forming the \u0022pseudo bond\u0022 known imaginatively as a \u0022hydrogen bond\u0022. These bonds can be as strong as a regular covalent bond in some cases, but are often significantly weaker, depending on the molecular structures involved. The exact geometry and makeup of whatever molecule will also have an effect on the degree of hydrogen bonding present.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs always, it gets more and more complicated the closer you look \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0(and of course there are exceptions to every rule)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peadar1987","CreatedById":81207,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-07T09:13:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course.
