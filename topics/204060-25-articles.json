Almost anyone, with rare exceptions, can build up to impressive strength with training, and while being Olympic champion might require some genetic predisposition, you can still compete on the word stage by dedication and training alone. But when you tell someone, \u0022You\u0027re not strong enough to lift that,\u0022 they tend to be fine with it. You say, \u0022You\u0027re not smart\u00A0 enough to understand it,\u0022 and they take offense. And that\u0027s a cultural issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSay I wanted to move a piano. Like, a proper, full upright, a metric-ton-if-it-is-a-pound piano. Now, I don\u0027t know how you picture me, but I\u0027m not a large person, and while I\u0027m reasonably athletic for an average person, I couldn\u0027t make a full piano budge by running at it full speed. Any reasonable person can tell if they can move a piano. Perhaps, if they\u0027re not familiar with the instrument or suspect it might be a fake, they might need to give it a trial push to convince themselves. And maybe if it just needs to be moved a few feet, a few people know they\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0move it by maneuvering one side at a time. Most of us will also be able to identify a group of people who can move it by working together, and will be satisfied that with the right tools, the group can be smaller. Looking for help or hiring a professional team to move a piano is a completely reasonable behavior, and we kind of expect a competent person to manage that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you would not call reasonable behavior is if I was pushing against the piano on my own, make struggling noises, and insisting that I\u0027m making progress. And if I started accusing anyone pointing out that the piano hasn\u0027t shifted an inch of being in the pocket of piano moving companies, you would be right to be concerned about my mental health. And yet, that\u0027s the attitude a lot of people are taking with scientific topics. There are a lot of concepts that an average person won\u0027t make anymore progress with than I would with moving a piano. Finding people who can help you out with that is the right call. In some cases, you also need to be able to tell people who can help from these who\u0027d just get in the way. This is what I expect from a reasonable person, whether they are trying to understand something for their own sake, or if they have a political decision to make.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeSchmuckatelli","CreatedById":154477,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-21T00:39:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EBut based on initial estimates, it is not looking like the latest Tongan eruption has released enough sulphur dioxide to cause significant cooling.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-01-21/how-has-the-tonga-volcano-affected-the-weather-/100532346\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHow do volcanoes affect the weather and what\u0027s going on with the Tongan\u00A0eruption?\u00A0\u00A0 - ABC News\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\nThe last volcano which did have a global cooling effect, Mount Pinatubo in 1991, released significantly more sulphur dioxide.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Mount Pinatubo emitted about 15 to 20 megatonnes, so somewhere in the order of 100 times more than what the Tongan volcano has.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NFUN","CreatedById":78715,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-21T01:51:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224079724\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022204060\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221642691557\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022206402\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SunlitZelkova\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, SunlitZelkova said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am not necessarily asking average citizens to actually be responsible for crafting a full scale climate change response plan. \u003Cstrong\u003EWhen there are economic problems, officials go to economists to figure out how to sort things out\u003C/strong\u003E.
