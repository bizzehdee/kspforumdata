(I kinda like that they\u0027re not just magic-electricity-with-no-downside anymore.)\n\n- They generate heat that you can\u0027t turn off. It\u0027s their primary distinguishing characteristic IRL.\n\n- Radiators inside a closed container shouldn\u0027t work. Dunno how KSP models this (as I mention, I don\u0027t do spaceplanes), but they really shouldn\u0027t work because there\u0027s nowhere to radiate *to*.\n\n- Putting them in a container that you then *open* ought to work (at least in terms of realistic physics): they should be able to rotate through the open cargo door (or whatever), though I\u0027m not sure whether KSP models this.\n\nAs for a lightweight solution for your spaceplanes: Have you tried putting deployable radiators in a service bay?

The issue is due to *another shortcut* in the heating system: Parts can\u0027t radiate any heat at all when in a cargo bay. Why one would do this I don\u0027t know, physics fail.\n\nParts in a cargo bay should radiate, heat be absorbed by the bay walls and re-radiated out into space, possibly via external radiators. Disabling radiant heat in a closed cargo bay is just stupid.\n\nConsidering the number of \u0022illogical heating / exploding\u0022 reports coming in, I guess we\u0027ll have to wait for yet another emergency patch for a poorly tested system. This is getting ridiculous.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-25T07:38:39Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2015 07:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by steve\\_v**"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T07:55:35Z","Content":"Radiation wouldn\u0027t solve this problem.\n\nThe issue is that shielded parts get a large amount of heat dumped into them in a very short time, to the point of exploding. And while all parts in stock KSP are unrealistically good radiators, the ability to radiate is still exponentially related to part temperature, and linearly related to surface area. Parts need to get extremely hot in order to radiate significant amounts of heat, especially when they\u0027re small... unfortunately, batteries and RTGs and science experiments *are* very small. And to make that worse, they generally have very low maxTemp values.\n\nIf you put one of these parts at 99% maxTemp, then it has a certain radiation flux value that it gives off. That value is equal to the value of conduction flux that the part can receive without further increasing its temperature, which would result in an explosion. Because the part has low maxTemp, default emissiveConstant and a tiny surface area, the value is very small.\n\nHowever, since the part manages to spike all the way from space ambient temperature to explosion during the short period of reentry heating, this implies that the conduction flux it receives is significant. It\u0027s therefore reasonable to assume that it exceeds the ability of the part to radiate heat away. If the part was able to radiate while shielded, it might buy itself an extra 5-10 seconds lifetime, but it would not actually prevent overheating.\n\nRather, this behavior *is a bug*. Cargo bays are not supposed to conduct any noticable amount to shielded parts in 1.0.3 according to the patchnotes; however, the opposite seems to have happened. The bays actually conduct *more*, not less. That\u0027s the reason that this happens, and Squad must fix the conductivity."},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T14:34:08Z","Content":"Yep, not just RTG\u0027s.
