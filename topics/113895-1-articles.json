And while all parts in stock KSP are unrealistically good radiators, the ability to radiate is still exponentially related to part temperature, and linearly related to surface area. Parts need to get extremely hot in order to radiate significant amounts of heat, especially when they\u0027re small... unfortunately, batteries and RTGs and science experiments \u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E very small. And to make that worse, they generally have very low maxTemp values.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you put one of these parts at 99% maxTemp, then it has a certain radiation flux value that it gives off. That value is equal to the value of conduction flux that the part can receive without further increasing its temperature, which would result in an explosion. Because the part has low maxTemp, default emissiveConstant and a tiny surface area, the value is very small.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, since the part manages to spike all the way from space ambient temperature to explosion during the short period of reentry heating, this implies that the conduction flux it receives is significant. It\u0027s therefore reasonable to assume that it exceeds the ability of the part to radiate heat away. If the part was able to radiate while shielded, it might buy itself an extra 5-10 seconds lifetime, but it would not actually prevent overheating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERather, this behavior \u003Cem\u003Eis a bug\u003C/em\u003E. Cargo bays are not supposed to conduct any noticable amount to shielded parts in 1.0.3 according to the patchnotes; however, the opposite seems to have happened.
