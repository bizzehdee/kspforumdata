New to KSP and new to this Forum. I was checking out YouTube vids for another game/sim and came across a tutorial for KSP (by Squirrel or maybe dasquirrelnuts) and watched it and was hooked. I came home, ordered, paid for, downloaded and was up and running within an hour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did the tutorial missions, but failed to achieve an intercept with the Mun. I think maybe I need to adjust my thrust as I was intercepting it at about 90 degrees ahead, not 45 like the tutorial suggests. Am I right in saying that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I have plenty of time to discover interplanetary travel, as I started from the ground up (literally). I took a test flight on one of the stock aircraft, and successfully took off, looped around and landed and taxied back to the hangar (pretty good for a first attempt, but I do have flight sim experience).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will trawl through this forum this afternoon / evening, as it\u0027s not right to ask one of my million questions until I search through for answers and read to gain knowledge. I hope to contact you all again in the very near future. Hopefully my questions will not bore you with \u0022this old chestnut? why didn\u0027t he read the forum. I\u0027m going to ignore him\u0022 but will receive informative answers. I always do my homework, and always \u0022pay it back\u0022 and will respond to anyone that I can help with my limited knowledge (at this stage).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first question is about my Avatar. I can\u0027t edit my avatar, because I don\u0027t have one. I need to go to User Control Panel, but I don\u0027t have one of those either. Perhaps I need to post a few times in a civil manner before being permitted.

I guess that orbiting the Mun a few times and returning would not use as much fuel as a landing (and hopefully a return to the home planet), but it was suggested that a landing on the other moon (sorry I can\u0027t remember its name off-hand) was much easier.

The Mun is easier to reach directly from Kerbin, since it\u0027s in a perfectly circular orbit with no inclination relative to the planet, but it also takes more overall delta-v for a landing-and-return mission to the Mun than to Minmus. Minmus has lower gravity which makes the actual landing easier, but it\u0027s also in a distant, inclined orbit, meaning you have to do a little bit more planning to actually get there. Overall, I\u0027d recommend getting plenty of practice on and around both, but I\u0027ll leave the order up to whatever you feel most comfortable with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother helpful tip: Before going interplanetary, you might want to try transferring between the Mun and Minmus and back with one craft. You\u0027ll use the same basic principles to transfer between planets (only on a larger scale), and it\u0027s much less taxing on your fuel allowance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Check Six","CreatedById":85134,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-12T04:45:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks again for the warm welcome and much needed advice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will indeed practice all the manoeuvres required to eventually lead to interplanetary travel and habitats on moons or other extra terrestrial bodies (err...extra Kerbal bodies?) and space stations.
