Basically you\u0027ll need a lifter and an interplanetary stage, probably using low thrust/high efficiency nukes. this will mean long burn times, to Duna, probably around 10 minutes or so, so start out the burn half way from your maneuver node, (so if it will take 12 minutes then start at t-6 minutes), and then the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best way to do it with a single launch is to work each stage with enough delta v and not a lot more. For this I\u0027d highly recommend the Engineer Redux. It does all the maths for you and gives a nice read out of how much delta v you have at what thrust to weight. Incredibly useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need around 4,400 m/s to get into LKO. From there it\u0027s 800 or so to escape the sun\u0027s SOI. From there around 1,500 ish I think, to get to Duna and a few hundred to slow down again once there. Then you\u0027ll need an injection burn of not a lot to get into the atmosphere. Parachutes will help but will not slow you down completely, you need some thrust at the start of the atmosphere and at the end to help you slow down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get home again you\u0027ll need around 2000 m/s to achieve Dunan orbit and around 1,800 or so to get back again. All of these numbers are approximate, but using those and the engineer you can build a much more accurate rocket that doesn\u0027t waste fuel or weight anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T16:13:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@OP: I\u0027ma thinkin\u0027 that your issue is more likely with how you\u0027re piloting rather than your overall design, but to be sure, could you post a pic of a rocket you\u0027ve used to try to get to Duna?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting to other worlds differs from getting to M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn/Minmus in that you can\u0027t just go any time you want to. You have to wait for certain \u0022launch windows\u0022 that correspond with the target being at a certain \u0022phase angle\u0022 - if you don\u0027t, the delta-V requirements rapidly go up. You also want to set your maneuver node to eject either at Kerbin sunrise (for Moho/Eve) or sunset (for every other world, and hopefully I don\u0027t have that backwards). Finally, you need to plan to do a correction burn at some point along your route; usually this is best done at either the ascending or descending node, and like a docking maneuver you want to get that value down as close to zero as you can. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink of an interplanetary transfer as a hole of golf - you do a long drive to tee off, you do one or more corrective drives to get you on the green, and then you put to get it in the hole. Same thing - a long drive to get you at least close to your target, correction burns to put you in the SOI, and then final corrective burns to put your periapsis where you want it.
