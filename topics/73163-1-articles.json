Most of the superhero makes their superhero a superhuman by mostly 2 ways:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst they do it biologically, like genetic engineering or something. Examples are Spiderman, Hulk, Captain America, Superman. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr they do it physically, by attaching some sort of mechanical stuff around the character. Examples are Iron Man, GI Joe characters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother way is they do it both ways, the wearer is biologically enhanced somehow. Examples are SPARTAN projects from Halo, including Master Chief, and Green Goblin from the new Spiderman\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, here is the thing. If you want to become a superhuman, which path is better? I could think of some pros and cons to each, but I\u0027m still confused\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xenomorph555","CreatedById":103080,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-23T12:08:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETelekinetic powers are the best of them all, I don\u0027t know what that would classify as since you can\u0027t engineer it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-23T12:50:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t see why you can\u0027t have both... which is what they do in Halo anyway, so....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I\u0027d say biological for a villian.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine you take stem cells, re-encode the genome to use an alternate \u0022code\u0022 (ie the triplet codon to amino acid mapping), inject them back into yourself, wait until most of your body is re-encoded cells.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimultaneously to the re-encoding, you also make it so that your body naturally produces a variety of very deadly viruses that can be exhaled at will.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to the re-encoding of your cells, you would be immune to all viruses (currently) in existence, as a virus uses the host cell machinery to translate its nucleic acid code.
