I was asking damny. There\u0027s an \u0022optimal\u0022 height listed in the cfg file for each part (as well as min/max heights). Presumably that\u0027s the best altitude to scan from, it\u0027s just not clear what changes when you are higher or lower.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JDobs","CreatedById":91072,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T06:50:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI played around with different orbital heights today and the closer you are to the planet (lower altitude) you cover a smaller scan path than that of a higher altitude. It appears that if you set up an orbit close to the max operational altitude of the scanners yo get the widest scan area and results on the map generated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"drtedastro","CreatedById":70911,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T06:58:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is from the older \u0027other\u0027 mapping program, but the orbital mechanics work for orbital resonance and can be used here to see best / worst orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/27999-ISA-Mapsat-Ideal-and-Non-Ideal-Altitudes\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/27999-ISA-Mapsat-Ideal-and-Non-Ideal-Altitudes\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas worked great for me for many different purposes...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Echeers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
