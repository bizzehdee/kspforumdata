I always like it when you clear the atmosphere and the you\u0027re-in-space music start up. Flying about in the atmosphere isn\u0027t too bad as you have engine noise, but driving on the Mun is always weird cos it\u0027s so quiet. Chatterer helps a bit, but I agree we need more sounds.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T15:27:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood to know I am not alone with this \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lobo1544","CreatedById":61396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T16:11:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAt first the music was a great improvement, but after hours listening to the SAME jazz tune in the VAB, I just play with music off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"I_Killed_Jeb","CreatedById":84817,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T16:16:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eactually, it\u0027d be great if we can have custom playlists from our own mp3 collection\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lobo1544","CreatedById":61396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T16:26:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022I_Killed_Jeb\u0022 data-cite=\u0022I_Killed_Jeb\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eactually, it\u0027d be great if we can have custom playlists from our own mp3 collection\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat would be great.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
