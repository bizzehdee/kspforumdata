It has four wheels that can reach up to record-breaking 9 m/s speeds. It also has 8 LV-1 Ant engines distributed evenly with some SAS to keep it in check. It flies nicely in Kerbin, although I haven\u0027t tested it elsewhere. Due to the compact size, there\u0027s not much fuel on board. There is \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003E (big emphasis on some) water capabilities; I really only managed to land it in the water and nothing else. Supporting landing legs on the bottom support landing, and there\u0027s three large parachutes to land softly in an atmosphere. There\u0027s a single seat in the middle for a kerbal to sit on and scream in \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Eterror\u003C/span\u003E absolute joy. If you slapped on some instruments, this could be a somewhat okay probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EANYWAYS, AFTER THAT WALL OF TEXT, here are the instructions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are 2 unmanned command pods. I will never figure out which way is up with the probes, and I managed to put the original one upside down and thus reversing some controls. I fixed it by putting a second probe on, near the top, which you can control and have right side up movement. Action group 1 toggles the 2 Communotron antennas. Group 2 extends the two solar panels (Not necessary because there are some nukes on board, but it definitely looks nicer). Group 3 triggers the three parachutes. It\u0027s pretty self-explanatory after that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have Realchute installed, and hopefully it doesn\u0027t interfere with the parachutes...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/gu2ze13gr315zb0/ATV_mk2.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/gu2ze13gr315zb0/ATV_mk2.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nByp9Fo.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nByp9Fo.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/i12p7hh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022i12p7hh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T07:38:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExcuse me my ignorance.
