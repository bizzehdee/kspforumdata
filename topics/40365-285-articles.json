I\u0027ve been experimenting with a bunch of vehicle designs that have ISRU refineries in them, to try to set up an off-kerbin fuel supply line. Sofar though, I just cannot make it do what I want it to do. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was a video from Scott manley where he landed a ship with 2 ISRU\u0027s on minmus. He then set one of them on extract water from the minmus \u0027soil\u0027, and the other on electrolise water. I have basicly re-enacted this, but my ISRU\u0027s are giving me no options for mining water (or any other resource except thorium and uranium). Now, I had 4 1.25m nuclear reactors with the appropriate electrical generators on my craft, so power was not the issue. I had a pair of water containers and standard liquid fuel - oxidiser tanks for storage, but for some reason all resource extraction processes remained on offline without an activate option. What could be the issue here?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I am also wondering is this: what is the correct process for producing fuel on duna by means of ISRU\u0027s? As far as I understand it, you need to bring prerequisite liquid fuel (hydrogen), and then use the sabatier process to collect CO2 from the atmosphere. The ISRU refineries then react the H and CO2 to water and methane. This process is only really useable on duna due to the high atmospheric CO2 levels, correct? Now, I have a full tank of methane, what do i do with it? does it only function as a fuel for the specific methane engine added by the KSP interstellar mod? It doesnt work with regular oxidiser \u002B liquid fuel engines right?
