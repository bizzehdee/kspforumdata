Select layouts and change the keyboard layout to something different. You will be warned that this will change your settings. Then select your preferred layout again, and see if graphics settings are now working correctly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Z.R","CreatedById":183002,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-22T13:06:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223225380\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022167802\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221511351724\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022115992\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Squelch\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Squelch said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello Z.R,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums.

Thank you for your reply but the issue seems to be fixed. I\u0027m not so sure what fixed it but the last thing i did on my pc before trying to change settings in ksp again was uninstalling driver for Razer\u00A0and re-installing it.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
