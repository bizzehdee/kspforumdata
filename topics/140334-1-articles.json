I\u0027m playing a Science game, v1.1.2, with a few mods (x-science, chatterer, freeeva, scansat, and kac) ... none of which I would suspect to be the cause of what\u0027s going on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a spacestation I\u0027ve assembled in orbit around the Mun (I\u0027m very early on in the game mind you, without large docking ports unlocked yet). If I leave SAS on, the station begins to wobble after a few minutes, as though the SAS\u0027s on the various craft docked are competing and trying to tear the station apart. If I leave SAS off, the station begins to slowly spin, what appears to be on a random axis each time, if not on more than one axis. I can cancel the spin out by warping time, but the second I return to normal time the station begins (slowly) to spin again. Left alone, in no time at all the thing is really dancing around ... impossible to dock with. I have to quickly warp time a second to cancel out spin, jump back to real time, switch to the station and activate SAS, jump back to the craft I\u0027m attempting to dock and hope I can do so quickly before the station starts trying to tear itself apart again - and then, yes, remember to turn SAS off again. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEdit:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E I forgot to mention, the nearly circular stable orbit has been shifting ... from an Ap/Pe @ 50km, to 49km - 71km, and I\u0027m watching it shift about 1m on and off every few seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSound familiar?

you can build big space stations just fine without it, if they\u0027re properly designed.\u00A0 And my observation has been that using it often leads to other problems:\u00A0 wobble is the game\u0027s way of telling you \u0022maybe you need to rethink your design\u0022, and turning it on can just be a band-aid that leads to other problems such as poor rocket designs that have other issues.\u00A0 That\u0027s not to say that KJR should never ever be used by anybody-- just that I think it tends to get over-used as a band-aid when it\u0027s not necessary.\u00A0 People just look at wobble, and think \u0022wobble bad!\u0022, and use it without realizing all the implications.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then it\u0027s possible you could indeed be having some kraken issues, as folks here have suggested.\u00A0 If you\u0027ve got a station where you\u0027re not running any engines, and RCS is turned off, and your orbit is steadily and constantly growing (or shrinking) meaning that you have some \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethrust\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E rather than torque happening... yeah, that\u0027s a kraken.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I\u0027d suggest checking the above issues, first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-23T16:27:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcellent feedback.

It\u0027s categorically not a design issue or trim being applied and the KER g force meter doesn\u0027t read any forces being applied, yet it rotates uncontrollably and is slowly going into an unstable orbit. A smaller ship I docked with the craft in an attempt to resolve the spin then also encountered the same bug; I was still able to keep it controlled, likely because the reaction wheel torque is relatively stronger on a smaller vessel, but its orbit began to change quite rapidly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLast night I deorbited the space station sections (all except for the lab) and began construction of a new one.
