As you can see on the Cutter, there are areas that still don\u0027t look quite right.

Dig the deeper mod-named folder out and put it in GameData and it\u0027ll work. Alternately, if you\u0027re using an unzip program that lets you drill down and selectively unpack a subfolder inside a .zip, you can just go down a level and unpack from there. You just can\u0027t unpack the archive as it\u0027s currently structured and have it work correctly (without further file management), since the top-level folder shouldn\u0027t exist at all (it\u0027s at the level that KSP_win should be at, if you were packing from that level... which you shouldn\u0027t, since it\u0027s named differently on different OS versions of KSP).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etl;dr: Go into your GameData folder, and into your RLA Stockalike 0.6, and you\u0027ll find yet another GameData folder, and inside that, yet another RLA_stockalike folder. Pop \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E folder up two levels, delete the gratuitous RLA Stockalike folder, and all will be fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-06T19:20:01Z\u0022 title=\u002209/06/2013 07:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Gaius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
