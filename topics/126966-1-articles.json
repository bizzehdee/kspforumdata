Next to the rotating icon you\u0027ll see a little size scale, in meters. You can estimate the tank\u0027s height H and diameter D\u00A0from that, and then it\u0027s simply a matter of dividing the tank\u0027s ore capacity (in \u0022units\u0022) by the volume of the tank (it\u0027s approx. a\u00A0cylinder, so its volume is V = pi*(D/2)^2*H).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-05T02:48:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe the stock resources are 5L/unit.

I\u0027m building a ship from Star citizen and their SCUs(Standard Cargo Unit) are 1.95 tons per cubic meter. It seems to work conveniently and I wonder if it\u0027s not the same logical basis for the unit of ore used in this game. 200units*0.01 is 2 tons which is just over 1.95 tons. So, 195 units per ton per cubic meter?!
