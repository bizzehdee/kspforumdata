This allows the fairing to go off center and develop drag on the tip of the rocket, whice at transonic speeds is enough to overcome the stabilising fins at the bottom. The Thrust to weight ratio of the mainsail is good to get the rocket off the pad but it will get too fast too low in the stmosphere to remain stable. Suggestions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Strut between the main rocket and payload to prevent wobble\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Reduce throttle when you are close to 300m/s and then gradually increase speed once you are above 10km. Once you get to 25km ish, you should be able to go full throttle again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also suggest switching to a 2 stage rocket. Not for any more dV, though that would likely result. A second stage would be much smaller and would mean your SAS and RCS systems could more easily rotate and adjust the rocket.

Make your rocket a smooth cylinder, especially up near the front.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird is that you\u0027re going to have CoM problems, for two reasons. First, your payload is light, as you said. Any time you have a big, light payload in front of a heavy rocket, that\u0027s a recipe for trouble. The other problem is that \u003Cem\u003Eyou have a vertical stack of fuel tanks\u003C/em\u003E. That\u0027s almost always bad, because your engine will drain the tanks from the top down, which causes your CoM to move sharply downward as you go faster, which is the exact opposite of what you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s always better to have one tall tank than a stack of smaller ones, because the tall tank\u0027s CoM stays put as it drains. I\u0027m guessing you don\u0027t have the big orange tank researched yet?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne way to mitigate the top-down draining problem for tank stacks: go to the top tank in the VAB and disable its resources. That will prevent it from draining at all, and will help to hold your CoM forward. Then as your other tanks get near empty (and you\u0027re a lot higher in the atmosphere where aero stability doesn\u0027t matter as much), you can renable it to get at the fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greenfire32","CreatedById":36705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T05:26:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry disabling the engine gimbals.

Just make sure your skipper stage can get you up to ~30km. This will also make the rocket shorter and easier to fly.

You can both push your center of mass higher up the rocket, and push your center of lift lower down the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, for the center of mass: you\u0027ve mentioned that your payload is small. Rockets fly best when the mass is concentrated (as much as possible) at the nose. Paradoxically, a heavier payload would fly truer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, for the center of pressure: there are a lot of suggestions here. First, you want to minimize drag on the front of the rocket. This involves, as other posters have said, getting rid of that unsightly divot where you drop to 1.25 up at the top. If you have the Procedural Fairings mod, use a structural fairing. Otherwise, I\u0027m afraid your choice is limited to either redesigning the rocket to do without that upper stage, or using a 2.5m engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, you want the fairing to be as small as possible while still not causing a disconnect in diameter between itself and the rocket. If you can, shrink the fairing. Further, a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://spaceflightsystems.grc.nasa.gov/education/rocket/shaped.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eteardrop shape\u003C/a\u003E is less drag than any other, whereas you appear to have something more akin to a bullet shape. (Disclaimer: I fly FAR, and don\u0027t know if stock KSP properly models coefficient of drag according to such shapes.) Finally, you can employ bigger fins: try sticking the small delta or even regular delta on the bottom with a control surface, rather than the AV-R8s you have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an end note, you can also get around this problem by keeping SAS on, having sufficient control authority, and being careful not to deviate too much from the prograde vector. This is how most orbital lifters actually do things, since fins are extra mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clear Air Turbulence","CreatedById":149987,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T10:11:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll these are helpful suggestions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am running up against a technical limit at the moment - my 2.5 metre fairing is simply not big enough to cover the whole payload.
