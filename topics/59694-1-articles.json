There is an interesting possibility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo first order, gravity works like electromagnetism. So one can build an electrogravitomagnetic artificial gravity generator. First, you build two giant mass current loops. In practice, they\u0027d probably have to be particle accelerators. The two loops are in the same plane, side by side, almost touching, and mas rotation is in opposite directions. The region of artificial gravity is going to be located between the two loops. The way you generate gravity is by giving the whole thing a bit of a spin around the axis that connects the two loops. That will generate enormous stress on the structure, as the two gyroscopic effects will fight each other, but no net torque, so this will not require any energy to maintain, other than what you need to run particle accelerators.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy will this generate gravity? Faraday\u0027s Law of Induction. Mass current generates gravitomagnetic field. Because that field rotates, the total flux is time-variable, and that\u0027s going to induce a gravitational field around the rim of the current loop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, effect isn\u0027t strong. Given some surface density \u00C3\u00C2 of the current traveling at some proper-velocity u, the total mass current is J = \u00C3\u00C2u. That gives us the field strength B = (4\u00C3\u00E2\u201A\u00ACG/c\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2)J. The total flux is going to depend on the area of the loop, \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00A6 = \u00C3\u00E2\u201A\u00ACBR\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2. Time derivative for a rotating loop (axis of rotation perpendicular to axis of the loop) is d\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00A6/dt = \u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00A6. And that induced potential is divided along the perimeter of the loop. So we get g = \u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00A6/(2\u00C3\u00E2\u201A\u00ACR). Putting it all together, and taking into account the fact that we have two loops, we get the following overall formula.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eg = \u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0R (4\u00C3\u00E2\u201A\u00ACG/c\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2) \u00C3\u00C2u\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest problem is the G/c\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 term. It is equal to 7.425x10\u003Csup\u003E-28\u003C/sup\u003E m/kg. Units work out because \u00C3\u00C2 is in kg/m\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2. In fact, lets talk about \u00C3\u00C2. This is density of the particle stream in accelerator times the thickness of the stream. Later is limited by what we can do with the magnets. Former is very difficult to get to a high value. Let me push it to the limits of imagination and say that we can get the stream almost as dense as air, and we have a 10m gap between magnets. That gives us \u00C3\u00C2 = 10kg/m\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, lets talk about \u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0. The limiting factor is the same as in centrifuge. Humans don\u0027t like going spinning at high rates for very long. For a comfortable experience, the limit is about 2RPM. If we are prepared to venture a bit beyond comfortable, we can do, maybe, 5RPM. That gives us \u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0 = 0.52/second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the one place where we can make decent impact is u. That\u0027s proper velocity and we have a particle accelerator. Woot. LHC launches protons at well over 400GeV. Lets say we can achieve 1TeV per nucleon in our matter beam. Mass of a nucleon is just 1GeV. So we\u0027ve achieved u = 1,000c.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if we wish to walk away with an Earth-like acceleration of g = 9.8m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2, using all of the above parameter, we get the loop radius of (drum roll, please) R = 6.69x10\u003Csup\u003E14\u003C/sup\u003Em = 4,470 AU = 0.07ly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, a structure with above parameters is not only implausible, but impossible (an internet cookie to whoever figures out why) But if you don\u0027t care how much gravity you are generating, so long as you are generating some, and it\u0027s not due to the object accelerating with centrifuge, or whatever, you can just get to flywheels spinning in opposite directions next to each other and then start rotating the assembly. Gravity you can generate this way is going to be less than detectable, but it\u0027d be completely artificial.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan this be improved on? Maybe. You can try increasing both density and the proper velocity. You need about 6 orders of magnitude between the two to make the structure plausible. It would still be a megastructure, though, and centrifuge is much, much easier to build.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DonLorenzo","CreatedById":13642,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-12T22:39:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s very awesome. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake this toy sized, call it the SpaceTimeTwister and sell it to kids everywhere.
