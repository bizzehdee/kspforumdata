Additional features give you even more control over the tech tree.\n\n**What it does:**\n\nMain feature:\n\n- Adds option to hide any empty tech tree nodes, which automatically connects the resultant \u0022hanging\u0022 tech tree lines to unhidden nodes in a logical sense.\n\nAdditional features:\n\n- Adds option to hide unresearched nodes, similar to Fog of Tech. Disabled by default.\n- Adds option to change all node unlock requirements to \u0022Any\u0022 or \u0022All\u0022.\n- Adds option to manually set which nodes are hidden (when enabled, this uses \u0022hideEmpty\u0022 from RDNode modules. These can be edited with ModuleManager). \\*new\n- Adds option to transfer science points from hidden nodes to their children/descendants. \\*new\n- Adds option to remove empty space caused my missing rows/columns of empty nodes.\n- Adds options to change the zoom settings, so you can fit your large, modded tech tree onto your screen all at once. Default minimum zoom is changed from 60% to 35%.\n\nFeel free to further customize your tech tree using using Module Manager to suit your play style, by adding nodes, changing default node positions, etc. (with the appropriate edits!). This mod will take care of everything else.\n\n**Examples (click either picture to enter album):**\n\n[![Tech tree with hidden nodes](http://imgur.com/THJYlFt.png)](http://imgur.com/a/66gep)\n\n[![Unresearchable nodes hidden](http://imgur.com/oOg6UkE.jpg)](http://imgur.com/a/66gep)\n\n**Notes on mod behavior:**\n\nSpoiler\n\n\u003Cfont color=\u0022#0000ff\u0022\u003EIn order to fix some \u0022anomalous\u0022 \u003C/font\u003E![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022) \u003Cfont color=\u0022#0000ff\u0022\u003Ein-game issues with hidden tech nodes when outside of the R\u0026D center, this mod has changed from a \u0022visual\u0022 mod to an \u0022active\u0022 mod.

However because of the new mod behavior, there may be new bugs. Please let me know if you find any!\u003C/font\u003E\n\n* * *\n\n**Some Recommended Tech Trees:**\n\n[The Community Tech Tree](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/90530-15x-community-tech-tree-oct-16/) or any number or awesome tech trees, such as\n\n[Historical Progression Tech Tree](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/144295-113-historical-progression-tech-tree-v17-updated-9-10-16/)\n\n\\*[Engineering Tech Tree](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/112627-12-ett-engineering-tech-tree-oct-18th-2016/) (\u003C- see notes below)\n\n[UnKerballed Start](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/181932-18x-unkerballed-start-v110-updated-oct-27-2019/)\n\n![pOpdwHo.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/pOpdwHo.png?1)\n\n**\\*Notes on ETT support:**\n\nSpoiler\n\nThis mod supports tech trees in the ETT format, but does not support the Yonge\u0027s Tech Tree plugin. This simply means that the tree selection process at the beginning of a new game will do nothing. Instead, this mod reads the ETT changes done to the ModuleManager tech tree, and will change the TechRequired field for Parts from that file. The good news is that you can now use ModuleManager config files on the ETT! \n\nThe bad news is that modders who add their own nodes probably haven\u0027t accounted for the ETT because they never needed to yet, so there might be duplicate nodes (they need to add a NEEDS[!ETT] to their config file). If there are duplicate nodes in your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E tech tree, a message will display on screen and the debug log will give you a list of duplicate nodes so you can inform the modder.\n\n* * *\n\n**Download:**\n\n[SpaceDock](http://spacedock.info/mod/577/Hide%20Empty%20Tech%20Tree%20Nodes)\n\n[Source (GitHub)](https://github.com/Orthethac/HideEmptyTechTreeNodes)\n\n**Download instructions:**\n\nDownload the mod folder from the SpaceDock link and place the GameData folder in your KSP directory.\n\n**Changelog:**\n\nSpoiler\n\n- v1.3.2\n    - Fixed dictionary key-value error when trying to use a key that doesn\u0027t exist (for TETRIX Tech Tree)\n- v1.2.0\n    - Fixed deprecated parts counting in nodes, leading to empty nodes.\n    - Fixed version file URL (thx [@HebaruSan](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/156657-hebarusan/) ) .\n    - Added Chinese language support (thx [@tinygrox](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/201757-tinygrox/)).\n    - Reverted min zoom back to stock 60%.

I should get rid of that NEEDS part in the future.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E But you\u0027ll most likely have some tech lines intersecting some tech nodes (hopefully you won\u0027t!). I want to see if I can make it work for the ETT too, but only after KSP v1.1. The ETT is much tighter than the CTT, so I might need to find a different method to make sure that nothing intersects.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Check [this post](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/112627-10x-ett-engineering-tech-tree-dec-12th-2015/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=2272302) for reference.\n\u003E \n\nI just tried it like you suggested - it seems to work, there are no overlaps as far as I can see. This is great.
