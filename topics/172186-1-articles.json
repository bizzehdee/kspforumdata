At 33.000m and about 2100 m/s I engaged the built-in decoupler of the reentry pod, having angled the ship slightly away from retrograde.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom previous experience, what I expected to happen was that the tank would stay close, being slowed down at a different but comparable rate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat really happened was that the debris \u0022sped up\u0022, as if from one moment to the other it experienced dramatically less drag. It\u00A0 raced 300m ahead of me in a matter of a second or two and kept going... I have tried the same with an empty tank with a similar result.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t played in a while, but that strikes me as odd. Is anyone seeing something similar?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
