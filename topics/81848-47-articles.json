Figure out what the flight condition is when you loose control (mach and altitude). Calculate stability derivatives, and chances are you will see some red. Most likely dynamic pressure is just dropping to the point where your stabilizing surfaces are no longer effective. If this is the case, there are a couple of things you can do:\u003Cp\u003E1) Maintain higher dynamic pressure. This means flying lower, which means more heat. You might be able to mitigate that by replacing the intake at the front with a nose cone and placing several structural intakes on the top of the fuselage - intakes are usually the first things to overheat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Increase your vertical stabilization - replace your three vertical stabilizing surfaces with a single large one, as far back as you can put it. The ones at the ends of the wings probably aren\u0027t doing you much good anyway - they\u0027re too close to the CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had to put a ridiculously large tailfin to get green NB at 25km/mach 3-4, which is where the problem is.

Wave drag is pretty low, but it\u0027s barely stable in pitch. It seems nuFAR pitch stability is no longer simply a matter of CoL behind CoM. On one draft, adding canards apparently helped stability! I still don\u0027t understand exactly how that works now. Also, I ran into a bug, an interaction between FAR and Trajectories - hit map and your wings fall off, even if you\u0027re in orbit or aero failures are off. So I have to reenter without Trajectories. I came in on Hold Prograde, it looked like I was still in space, then my fins got heat bars.

It seems that outriggers are indeed the way to go for anything with a payload, even a 2t crew cabin. Transonic drag with the Astrotaxi maxes out around 450kN, which is huge, but each turbo is doing 440kN at that point, so like you said, not a problem. I tried some outrigger designs, but I was using 2x Lv45 \u0026amp; 1 turbo, partly because that lets you ride turbo till flameout and partly because the turbo seems so powerful now. But with the transonic drag of outriggers, it seems that 2 turbos works better. I notice the Astrotaxi only has ~0.8 TWR on the LV-45, which I thought would be way too low, but apparently I\u0027m wrong. My 1-jet 2-rocket craft would struggle to 25km then burn out all their fuel getting 70km Ap, since I thought you needed \u0026gt;1 TWR for the rocket phase. More rocket TWR does increase efficiency to some degree, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027m still not good at reentry - what\u0027s the rule of thumb for nuFAR?

But I\u0027m not sure how to keep it on course at a given AoA with just SAS. I have Pilot Assistant to tweak SAS, using the numbers you posted a while ago that worked great in 0.90.
