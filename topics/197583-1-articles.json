WIth that out of the way let\u0027s delve into my suggestions. Would much appreciate some thoughts from others on how appealing these things would be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1: Panel shape variants - rather than always being flat and straight edged they could be rounded, inverse rounded, curved and domed. Example of 90 degree rounded and curved on the right below, painted like the standard size 12 structural panels in KSP1 to make them a bit more relatable. Having 60 and 45 degree options would be nice as well but let\u0027s set aside the exact design variants for now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022structurals.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002244.44\u0022 height=\u0022400\u0022 width=\u0022900\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.postimg.cc/N0F8x2wJ/structurals.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2: Glass panels - same shape options as regular panels but transparent, fragile, heavy, sensitive to heat and generally useless. But would look great on things like the simple cockpit of the... thing... in the above picture. Optionally they may be well suited to having a bordered/borderless toggle in the shape of a slim metal frame.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3: Extended stack split/merge options, including twin stack fuel parts, extra wide cockpits and crew quarters, and maybe interesting engine mounts with more creative node options. Unlike KSP1 some parts would have an attachment node for other twin stacks rather than being entirely restricted to separated standard round stacks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4: Cargo bays that allow for more oddly shaped cargo. One example would be a twin stack version that when mounted flat in a space plane could have its \u0022floor\u0022 flip down to become a ramp for ease of use with small rovers, or extend the entire flat bottom section with pistons to ground level for ease of access. Alternate \u0022door\u0022 options would be to have the rounded sides open like the current round cargo bays in KSP1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly I\u0027d also suggest having an external seat for custom cockpits but one that isn\u0027t meant for pilots. It would probably be a bit much to ask that it provides actual real time information but if it came in one variant for scientists that had a screen with some random garbled \u0022science looking\u0022 data on it that would be nice, engineers could get a couple of buttons and a smaller display that says some useless thing like \u0022craft currently 80% unlikely to explode\u0022 or whatever other fluff might look funny on close inspection. Seat options are not structural things but this forum is still being drenched in new threads and I don\u0027t want to add another\u00A0for such a minor suggestion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-21T11:34:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis sounds more like an DLC for me.

Anyway regarding you fellows DLC comments, I\u0027m assuming most if not all of the KSP1 DLC parts will be integrated into the main game for KSP2 since it won\u0027t be popular with many players to have to buy the extras separately all over again, and I\u0027d be surprised (in a bad way) if the devs were already making plans for DLC a year ahead of release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027m trying to accomplish with this little poll is to get a good idea of things the devs can put on the list of stuff that can be added \u0022if the part creation specialists end up with time on their hands\u0022 due to finishing early. As far as I understand the main reason the release has been pushed so very far into the future is because the programming work turned out to be a much bigger task than they had anticipated, this doesn\u0027t mean the other devs don\u0027t have anything to do for the last year but there\u0027s a fair chance their workload is lower than initially projected. Better that they know about which little extras players would be delighted to see and how badly we\u0027d like them, also\u00A0several of the devs are KSP players themselves and may find motivation to put a bit of effort into fun extras if they get a nice little serving of inspiration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
