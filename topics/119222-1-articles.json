This sounds like poor rocket design more than anything. You should always use a gravity turn becaues it is far more efficient than trying to burn straight to your target altitude and then horizontal to circularize. In this instance, your Circularization burn is combined with your ascent to your target altitude. Planetary velocity will give you a small boost, on the order of 200m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T08:06:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AlextheBodacious\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AlextheBodacious\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBut I just use hyperedit cause it\u0027s so easy.
