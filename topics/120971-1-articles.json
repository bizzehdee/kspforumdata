This discovery is very important not only for Enceladus\u0027 biological potential, but also for all other icy moons in the solar system (Europa and the ice giants\u0027 satellites\u003Cem\u003E in primis\u003C/em\u003E), especially when you think that even a body as small as Enceladus somehow can mantain a liquid underground ocean. Where this heat comes from is still unknown; the authors of the study have speculated that the tidal stress Saturn exerts on Enceladus could be greater than thought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome important paragraphs from the press release, regarding how they arrived to this extraordinary conclusion:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECassini scientists analyzed more than seven years\u0027 worth of images of Enceladus taken by the spacecraft, which has been orbiting Saturn since mid-2004. They carefully mapped the positions of features on Enceladus -- mostly craters -- across hundreds of images, in order to measure changes in the moon\u0027s rotation with extreme precision.\u003Cp\u003EAs a result, they found Enceladus has a tiny, but measurable wobble as it orbits Saturn. Because the icy moon is not perfectly spherical -- and because it goes slightly faster and slower during different portions of its orbit around Saturn -- the giant planet subtly rocks Enceladus back and forth as it rotates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe team plugged their measurement of the wobble, called a libration, into different models for how Enceladus might be arranged on the inside, including ones in which the moon was frozen from surface to core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, here is a cool gif of Enceladus\u0027 rotation (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.pollucenotizie.com/2015/09/15.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Efrom here, in Italian\u003C/a\u003E):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ag_XCA3RfEw/VfiIbfHCryI/AAAAAAAAFuI/P6qeawN6YqM/s1600/Er26MX%2B%25281%2529.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022Er26MX%2B%25281%2529.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cydonian Monk","CreatedById":69224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-15T22:33:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy yes.
