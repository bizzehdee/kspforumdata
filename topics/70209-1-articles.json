I mean, I know there is already career mode ad sandbox mode, but is anybody else looking for a few more modes to play? One mode I thought of was a business mode. In this mode you would be a galactic transport company and you would have to transport people, cargo and even other ships to randomly generated space station, outposts and bases scattered around the kerbol galaxy. You would then receive money for these jobs to get bigger ships to do better jobs to get more money to get a bigger ship and so on. What do people think of this? What do people think about new modes? I would love to see everyones\u0027 thoughts and if you are feeling daring, maybe suggest a mode yourself. Lets make this a discussion. Lets talk about it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-23T06:04:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMost other modes could and probably will be put into career mode. The mode you propose as an example could easily be implemented through contracts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething that extensive would be far in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it isn\u0027t in squads interest to develop the contracts that far, it would be up to the modding community to build off of the contract system. Regardless the Career mode would allow most other modes to be implemented, either through contracts and other updates.(need part costs primarily )\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ikaneko","CreatedById":109214,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-23T16:30:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour suggestion would be the best scenario ever!
