Getting into them appears much cheaper and to get the science for those nodes I had to rocket around kerbin, harvesting all places I couldve gone by plane. So once I reached the Flight-nodes there wasnt much left for me to discover with plain flight which made the whopping price of 2x 60 science hardly reasonable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd theres the next thing - I dont see why basically Wings and Wheels/Jetengines are separated in two nodes? Both alone hardly get you anywhere. A jet without wheels cant properly land (Starting/Landing Planes is what most of the fun about planes is) when a Jet with wheels but only tiny wings/ailerons ... well - I couldve used such Jetcars at the very beginning, but not that much later when I reached the flight-nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheres other things later on - like two ladders taking up a node for 60 science.

The start node is a rover body, some rover wheels and a thermometer. I want science to be slow enough that it might end up 6 nodes in before you get any sort of rocket parts. I want to set it up so that you have to do science around KSC to get basic plane parts and make a plane and fly around kerbin to get enough science to be able to start building rockets. I want all the plane parts unlocked before any rocket parts. I may even make it so you would have to explore a few of the craters on Mun or go to Duna to get your first antenna\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T10:48:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProgression is a bit fast, in the end you are very quickly at rockets again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting with \u0022cars\u0022, developing to planes and then rockets like a game of civilization is really hardcore, but I somewhat like the thought on the other hand.
