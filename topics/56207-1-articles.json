KSC is on Kerbin\u0027s equator (or quite close to it) and provides a near-perfect launch profile to the rest of the system, so a shifted KSC would be extra challenging and such. Then I remembered that Kerbin has no axial tilt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince Earth actually has axial tilt to deal with we have things like the Tropic of Cancer which defines the maximum northern extent where the sun will lie directly overhead once per year. So, as I understand it, the actual Kennedy Space Station is only 5 degrees off from the Earth/Sun plane (from that frame of reference, I know we can get more involved but I\u0027m simplifying for KSP) once a day because it lies at roughly 28 degrees North. Given that Kerbin has no tilt would it be safe to say that Kennedy Space Center would lie at (roughly) 5 degrees north on Kerbin, and Baikonur Cosmodrome would lie at (roughly) 23 degrees north, or am I hallucinating?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-15T05:15:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDepends what you want to optimize for, really. If you\u0027re doing geocentric then latitude should be Earth-correct. Same with selenocentric, since I gave the Moon the inclination to match Earth\u0027s equator, not the ecliptic.
