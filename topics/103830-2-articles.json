Good luck with the new generation of train. I rather like the new look, even the whitewalls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the technical side of things, you now have 2 different types of tank car with different wheel configurations. Is it possible to convert a tank car from one configuration to the other in the field? And can you leave a car with wheels only on 1 end standing by itself and then reconnect to it during shunting? If not, there might be difficulties if you ever have to put a train back together after a wreck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETruck trailers have \u0022landing gear\u0022 at the front end to hold them up when you disconnect the tractor. But also, the wheels of the trailer can slide fore-and-aft. This is necessary for reasons of maintaining proper axle weights and keeping turn radii within the limits of certain roads. On truck trailers, the wheels can only slide within the last ~1/4 of the trailer\u0027s length, which is enough for these purposes, but there\u0027s no reason you couldn\u0027t make them slide from end to end of your tank cars, or least to the middle. That way, you could convert a center-axle car to an end-axle car if needed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T21:27:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/45400-Stockless-Space-Program?p=590180\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post590180\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESome train inspiration for you\u003C/a\u003E, from 2013.
