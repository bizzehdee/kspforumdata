As is using a prop - wasn\u0027t sure if things like Firespitter props would actually work in water - ah, hang on - they don\u0027t have to do they, if I can fit a prop on top of my rover?! Excellent idea, so long as the props aren\u0027t too large. Thank you!

So I can\u0027t change the graphics card, and the card that\u0027s in there renders about a dozen parts in 1.0 as pure black and doesn;t show exterior views from inside the cockpit. Which is just enough to b a deal-breaker for me.

That any problems at all only appeared with the 1.0 release on my PC is, IMO, amazing. And v0.9 is more fiun than any other game I\u0027ve owned, so I\u0027m certainly not complaining!
