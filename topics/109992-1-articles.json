Is there a way to propel craft through water in KSP that doesn;t involve rockets or jets?\n\nIf not, what is the most fuel-efficient method of propulsion in water? NB: I am not concerned about speed. 1m/s is fine, provided it can be kept up for a really long time.\n\nReason for the question - I\u0027d like to try a trip around Kerbin, but that\u0027ll inevitably mean a few trips across several kilometres or even tens of kilometres, of water. And I\u0027ve found that electrically powered wheels provide no propulsion whatsoever in water :-("},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T20:03:33Z","Content":"Best compromise I\u0027ve found (at least in 0.90) was jet-powered.

Admittedly, the real world marine applications have them either driving a propeller shaft or electrical generator (for a diesel-electric system) via a reduction gearbox from the turbine shaft, not using the jet exhaust for thrust.\n\nThe RR Olympus, as used on Concorde, was used in many Royal Navy warships (both big and small), and there have been many instances of larger fast patrol boats using 1 or 2 of turbojets. The QM2 has a turbojet electrical generator for operating at full speed, for when she\u0027s doing traditional fast runs across the Atlantic, but uses traditional piston diesel generators for slow speed running, as the turbojet is so fuel hungry."},{"CreatedByName":"merendel","CreatedById":97774,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T20:54:34Z","Content":"If you dont mind moding I know theres one or two out there that add propeller prop engines that run off electricity. Could strap one or two of those along with some solar pannles to whatever you want to travle through the water. Would let you move indefinatly during the day. I seem to recall a mod that added compressed air RCS jets (was it B9? cant remember) that could use air intakes to suck in more propellent. if you can track that down it would be another option.\n\nPure stock you prety much just have jets, rockets, or haveing a kerbal get out and push. I dont think a reaction wheel paddle wheel will work all that well, hasnt in the past for me. Not sure if 1.0 fixed the lader thrust glitch (kerbal climbing a ladder aimed so his head is bumping into the craft causeing phantom thrust as he climbs). If thats still in it would be faster than a swiming kerbal pushing."},{"CreatedByName":"DancesWithSquirrels","CreatedById":138267,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T21:01:06Z","Content":"Up through 0.90 an ion engine was a good alternative - low thrust but really high Isp.

I am in v0.9, as my PC can;t quite handle all the graphics for 1.0 (hoping to get a better PC later this year). I\u0027ll bear in mind the getting a Kerbal to push option, but I\u0027m really after something a tad more convenional, if possible :-} No, I\u0027m not averse to using mods. I\u0027ve got TAC LS , MKS, Mechjeb and Scansat installed currently. \n\nIon engine? Hmmn.. there\u0027s a thought! As is using a prop - wasn\u0027t sure if things like Firespitter props would actually work in water - ah, hang on - they don\u0027t have to do they, if I can fit a prop on top of my rover?! Excellent idea, so long as the props aren\u0027t too large. Thank you! I\u0027ve come up with a neat little 2-man electric rover that works fine on land, and I\u0027ve just trialled using RCS to propel it in water but as I can only fit on 4 spherical RCS tanks, I suspect that wouldnt get me more than a kilometre or two. If I lose the RCS that\u0027d give me more room for batteries, enabling more night-driving.\n\nRight, tomorrow I try to create the v3 version of the rover! :-)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T22:28:40Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 10:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Esme**\n  \ntypos."},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T22:44:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I am in v0.9, as my PC can;t quite handle all the graphics for 1.0 (hoping to get a better PC later this year).\n\nThat seems a little odd. 1.0 isn\u0027t really much different to 0.9 for graphics. I\u0027ve actually seen very little change in graphics demand from 0.21 to 1.0, maybe a little extra demand, but no major rise. Also, I can run KSP quite happily on 7\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u01538 year old machines (which were high-isn spec back then, admittedly, but still old Core 2 with 256MB GPU), just by keeping the graphics options turned down to a sane level for each machine.

So I can\u0027t change the graphics card, and the card that\u0027s in there renders about a dozen parts in 1.0 as pure black and doesn;t show exterior views from inside the cockpit. Which is just enough to b a deal-breaker for me. When I go looking for my next second-hand PC, I\u0027ll be making darned sure it\u0027ll take standard-sized graphics cards! 8-} But it\u0027s OK - I was amazed that this old crate could run KSP in the first place, and was expecting a few problems as KSP got close to 1.0. That any problems at all only appeared with the 1.0 release on my PC is, IMO, amazing. And v0.9 is more fiun than any other game I\u0027ve owned, so I\u0027m certainly not complaining! And by the time I can get a new PC, I should have worked out how to use MKS and so be ready to start a new game with the objective of setting up a self-sustaining colony on Duna :-)"}]}
