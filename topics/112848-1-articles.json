I can fulfill this easily if I can dock the new craft to my pre-built interplanetary stage. Will docking my new craft with the old one nullify the contract? Googling tells me that you could previously fulfill \u0027new craft\u0027 contracts endlessly through docking, but that it was fixed. What does that mean?\n\nHow does the \u0027new craft\u0027 requirement interplay with the docking mechanism?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-14T12:55:16Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2015 12:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cephalo**"},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T15:49:20Z","Content":"If every part you are going to connect got launched after you accepted the contract everything will be fine.

I tried docking it to my lab already in orbit, but that wouldn\u0027t work. \n\nOn the other hand, I was fortunate to get two base contracts at the same time. So the LKO station contract was satisfied while I was assembling the Minmus base.
