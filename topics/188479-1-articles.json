But they all lose the the emotions of anger and sadness. After\u00A02020 everything will revert back to normal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow crime is effected: Certain rates go down while others go up. Namely crimes of passion/murders by scorned lovers go waaay down. Strangely, some hate crimes continue, since often at their core such ones\u00A0feel threatened and are motivated by fear mostly, not hate. As does gang violence for the same reason. Also the suicide rate drops dramatically.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEconomics: There is a spike in productivity across many economic sectors as no one comes to work distracted\u00A0by sadness nor anger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow politics are effected: The USA and world politics will be different, with opposing sides playing on the public\u0027s potential fears more than anything. Less insults in the media everywhere, including the internet, since they no longer tick anyone off. Instead people start making threats and thus start getting arrested.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDeath: People no longer mourn at funerals, instead it is a joyous occasion celebrating the life of the deceased.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid I miss anything?
