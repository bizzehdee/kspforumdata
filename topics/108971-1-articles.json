More grand, more awesome than ever before, I present to you the Jool Grand Tour Spacecraft concept with all it\u0027s components side by side for scale:\n\n![lu1nrGx.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/lu1nrGx.jpg)\n\nThe whole ship consists of 3 separate vehicles, docked together in orbit around Kerbin. I have included the launch vehicle required to push the massive interplanetary stage to low orbit, landers have their launch vehicles WIP.\n\nHere is the powerful Tylo lander concept with it\u0027s versatile upper stage which will be used to land on Vall, Bop and Pol (!).\n\n![SNVLSgP.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/SNVLSgP.jpg)\n\nLaythe lander concept:\n\n![WbeVsIG.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/WbeVsIG.jpg)\n\nFlight plan: LKO - spacecraft docking/assembly -\u003E Jool transfer -\u003E Jool orbital insertion @200km -\u003E Direct Tylo transfer -\u003E Orbital Insertion at Tylo and landing. Upper stage of Tylo lander returns back to the mothership for refuel and inspection (Install DangIt! random failures mod to spice things up and) -\u003E Laythe transfer, orbit and landing -\u003E Transfering fuel left in the Laythe Lander into the mothership and Laythe lander termination -\u003E Vall transfer, landing,orbit. Docking Tylo lander upper stage for refuel and inspection -\u003E Bop and Pol landings -\u003E Gravity slingshot from Jool and Kerbin transfer (possible gravity assist from one of Jool\u0027s moons). -\u003E Final course correction, command pod separation from the mothership near Kerbin SOI -\u003E Ballistic re entry and landing.\n\nMods needed:\n\nModet Rocket Systems\n\nNearFutureSolar\n\nNearFutureSpacecraft\n\nTAC Life Support\n\nTweakScale\n\nKSP Interstellar extended\n\nRecommended: \n\nKerbal Joint Reinforcement \n\nDangIt!\n\nOptional:\n\nKerbal Alarm Clock\n\nTransfer Window Planner\n\nPrecise Node\n\nLinks:\n\n[http://kerbalx.com/iVG/Jool-Grand-Tour-Mothership-13](http://kerbalx.com/iVG/Jool-Grand-Tour-Mothership-13)\n\n[http://kerbalx.com/iVG/Jool-Grand-Tour-Tylo-lander-23](http://kerbalx.com/iVG/Jool-Grand-Tour-Tylo-lander-23)\n\n[http://kerbalx.com/iVG/Jool-Grand-Tour-Laythe-Lander-33](http://kerbalx.com/iVG/Jool-Grand-Tour-Laythe-Lander-33)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T23:38:02Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 11:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by iVG**"}]}
