Goes without saying that debug menu options are out. For simplicities sake it would be easy to say no mods, but we all know it is rarely that simple. Mods that affect parts and ship functions are right out. You might note that in my vid above I have alarm clock and haystack installed. Having such mods active as those that have no direct effect on ship parts and functions is not a concern. Mechjeb, I\u0060m not sure anymore how much help he\u0060s going to be in getting rendezvous and such, so would have to declare it illegal, but I suppose people like to use it for information, much as I like to use engineer. Therefore, although I suggest otherwise, you can use mechjeb or engineer for their information elements only** at a cost of a 3 hour handicap to your time (that means plus 3 hours), and noted on your entry that it was assisted. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo ahead, switch them off this one time \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor any and all claims you make for your entry, please submit at least one image.
