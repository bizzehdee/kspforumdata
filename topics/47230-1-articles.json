Bear in mind that there are many factors that real life has to deal with that KSP does not. Things such as lack of variances in gravity by mass, secondary and tertiary gravity influences(secondary being the Moon on an Earth satellite, tertiary being Jupiter on that same satellite as examples which even affect us on the ground). That just serves as an example of the many differences that exist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fact you are willing to make such effort shows you are nowhere being dumb, and even if your math and figuring is off, I bet it ain\u0027t by much.
