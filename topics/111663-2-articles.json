Squad should really be commended from their approach to pricing. I wish more games started out cheap in early access and got more expensive along the way as the game became more complete. Instead, you usually have the opposite where they want $90 for the privilege of using the buggy game early, then reduce it by $20 dollars a month later, etc. until they are 75% off $40 by actual launch (this was the real progression of a RTS game). Or they could charge $40 dollars for the initial game as KSP was around 0.20 and then $20 dollars for the science expansion, $20 for the careers, $20 for building expansions, and $10 for 3.5m parts. \n\nPlus despite being only $40 I\u0027ve still spent many more hours in KSP than I have in those other games.

I think 1.1 will go a long way towards that, however I previously did and still do believe that the current 1.0 version should not have been a 1.0 release. I think that was a mistake and trying to market what is, without any doubt, a beta game at best, as a gold release, is arguable.\n\nIf I strip my personal bias from 1200 hours away and examine the game as a whole, I honestly struggle a bit to justify a $40 price tag. If I imagine myself as a newer player who bought the game as soon as 1.0 dropped, I\u0027d be pretty annoyed with the handling of the hotfixes, mostly because the game was no longer early access and I wanted something bug free.\n\nUltimately this is a matter of opinion. Given my experience, I answer the title question with a resounding no, however looking more objectively while still including my raw experiences with gameplay, bugs, and patches, I struggle to give the same answer."},{"CreatedByName":"rollo1002","CreatedById":145192,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T00:44:39Z","Content":"I just bought the game at $40.00.

No. At it\u0027s current state, I\u0027d say $30 would be a good price point; however, a few more revisions and updates and yes the game would be worth the $40 I paid. There is a lot of things that are not polished and still rough around the edges. Tutorials and Training need more work and there is a lot of things that leave you wondering how do I do that?

Harder to do that if you really should/need to get $30 for each copy, and it\u0027s always there so can\u0027t join in on the sales as you really can\u0027t sell it for less and make out even with volume."},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T02:16:00Z","Content":"If you look at it from an outside view, then yeah, $40 could be seen as expensive for what is is.

The game is bound to be even more buggier when it moves over to \u00275 initially and it certainly will be very, very different (and not necessarily better - all those broken mods/ balance issues!).\n\nAnd another thing; when is the demo going to be updated? Now it is no longer early access, this is about the only thing to tempt a wary newbie into a purchase; at the moment the demo does the game no justice at all and is very unrepresentative of the current version.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-02T02:33:12Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2015 02:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mikeb30165**"},{"CreatedByName":"loch.ness","CreatedById":101329,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T02:26:30Z","Content":"I paid about 25-30 USD buying in at .23. \n\nI\u0027ve bought a few other games at that price range and Dragon Age Inquistion at double that.\n\nHours played (KSP beats everything by 10x or more).\n\nReplay value (KSP never truely ends and I don\u0027t seem to get bored of it).\n\nBrain stimulation: KSP has lead to me doing a lot of research into how real missions were flown and principles of rocketry and orbital mechanics.
