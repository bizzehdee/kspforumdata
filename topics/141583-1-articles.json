The same rocket design that put a Kerbal into orbit, also went to Mun and Minmus, just with some extra boosters slapped on. This creates an dilemma because I can never decide at what point it\u0027s time to retire a name and come up with something new. About the only time I DO know when to do this is when I launch permanent satellites that don\u0027t exist to run experiments. If the same rocket has a capsule instead of a probe on the end, does it get a new name? What about the addition of a lab, or a cargo bay, or a different electrical power source? Should I be changing it up every time I target a different world? I want to do something that closely matches how NASA handles it, but if there\u0027s a document written about the subject, (with real space agencies OR the game) I haven\u0027t been able to find it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-11T02:07:16Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2016 02:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by vger\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BebopRebop","CreatedById":159207,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-11T03:39:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve started using the subassembies and naming the different stages.

For example, my Tano launcher series consists of the Tano A, Tano X1, Tano X2, and Tano X4. All are non-recoverable 2.5m launchers with very similar designs (you can build all the way up the series from the basic Tano A) and a maximum payload mass that\u00A0increases as the power increases. My naming for launchers usually changes depending on diameter, and whether or not they\u0027re recoverable.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCommonly used sub-assemblies - I personally like to name things like command/service modules, because I\u0027ll use the same design for many different things (e.g. a three-crew Hydra 3a capsule with SRB-based LAS/landing motors and a 0.625m docking port can be used as a Mercury/Hermes capsule or for a non-reusable Mun/Minmus vehicle).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLanders/ascent vehicles/spaceplanes - Sometimes a planet needs a particular SSTO design, and I name it for that planet (e.g. Duna Exploration Vehicle/DEV), other times the same design can be used for multiple places, in which case it\u0027ll be given its own name (Ceres and Ceres\u00A0\u03B2 are two of my examples), or there\u0027s HAAVs (Heavy Atmospheric Ascent Vehicles, currently the Sugilite HAAV is the only one I have need for) for Eve and any modded worlds with high gravity and thick atmospheres. My naming conventions for spaceplanes don\u0027t really have a reasoning behind them, I\u0027ll just append mission nomenclature\u00A0depending on where their destination is, and give them an abbriviated classification (e.g. Single Stage Orbital Freighter/SSOF).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRovers/atmospheric planes/boats - Similar designs warrant similar names. I don\u0027t really have any good examples currently, because wheels have been buggy since I\u0027ve worked out my standardized nomenclature, and I haven\u0027t done much in-depth exploration of Laythe recently either.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nInterplanetary and interstellar transport vehicles - I have a few rules for these. The first part of the name is the vessel classification (IPT/InterPlanetary Transport, IPF/Interplanetary Freighter, IST/InterStellar Transport, ISF/InterStellar Freighter) depending on what it does. Transports are more modular and are usually used for early missions as well as crew transport, whilst freighters are a massive late-game solution for moving enormous colonial pieces. The next part of the name is the name of the vessel itself; I usually go with a piece of music that I like but it doesn\u0027t really matter what they\u0027re called. The final part of the name is the mission nomenclature.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMissions to a particular planet/moon - This is the mission nomenclature that I\u0027ve mentioned previously. Anything going further than Kerbin orbit will have a mission designation. This is unique to the planet being explored (I always explore moon systems wherever I go so there\u0027s no need to pick names for moons). The name (e.g. Athena for Duna missions) is added to the end of any relevant vessels in square brackets. An example Duna transport would be called \u0022IPT Red Star [Athena]\u0022.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAnything that\u0027s either unique or follows a particular aesthetic different from the rest of your vehicles - this is a special category. If you ever decide you want to experiment and make something completely out of your usual style, this is the sort of naming convention that might be good for you. My best example is my Titan vessel series: a set of truly enormous vehicles designed for colonising just about anywhere. The Hyperion Mass Crew Transport can land anywhere, and functions as an\u00A0SSTO from any stock world\u00A0except\u00A0Kerbin and Eve (so I still have to use HAAVs to get crew off Eve\u0027s surface) as long as you refuel it on the surface for the larger worlds; it holds 24 crew and every stock science experiment, and has a lot of docking ports so that it can serve either as a station core or as a base module. The Prometheus\u00A0\u03B2 and Prometheus Major are huge fuel transports that are still in the design phase but they are pretty big. The rest have yet to be named, but I have a skycrane planned, as well as a few other things. All will be named after Titans from ancient\u00A0Greek mythology, and for the most part there won\u0027t be any duplicate names because they\u0027re all designed to work anywhere (Prometheus \u03B2 was an exception because I needed fuel but the main Prometheus craft wasn\u0027t done yet).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is really just the way that I do things, but it might benefit you to develop a similarly in-depth naming convention so that you no longer have to wonder whether or not to give a new name to the vehicle or just to stick another number on the end of what you already have.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Optimist","CreatedById":151904,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-12T14:22:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI name mine something like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMHLV-2 MunLander\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMedium-Heavy Launch Vehicle mk2 \u00A0[Mission]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo a solar satellite using the same launch vehicle would be something like MHLV-2 Sunsat.

0.24 I had a manned mission series called \u0022Trailblazer\u0022, they were sequentially numbered and if they had nuclear engines they got an \u0022N\u0022 - i.e. \u0022Trailblazer XIIN\u0022. \u00A0I\u0027ve also sometimes named craft with -E or -MJ to indicate they were built with parts from Kerbal Engineer or MechJeb so that I knew which mods needed to be installed to load them into a newer game. \u00A0Some of my designs date back to version 0.17 or\u00A00.18.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vger","CreatedById":67603,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-12T18:02:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222627973\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022141583\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221465753691\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002263336\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022panarchist\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 minutes ago, panarchist said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNASA pre-STS named the programs after Greek or Roman gods, and the rockets (Subassemblies) had (and still have) separate program names from the payload. \u00A0Mercury was technically \u0022Mercury-Redstone\u0022 or \u0022Mercury-Atlas\u0022 depending on which rocket they used, but the governing convention in early NASA was that the short name was the name of the payload, sequentially numbered. \u00A0When the payload core changed (effectively equivalent to which command pod was used), it was due to a new program. \u00A0A few programs diverged widely in architecture from start to end, Mariner being the most notable -
