A simple test ship of a 1.25m thermal nozzle, 1.25m fusion reactor, 1.25m generator, small LOF tank, and a 1-crew pod. This actually works for me now at max time warp. Fusion reactor stays on and I get the expected behavior I\u0027ve come to know and love from the fission reactors.\u003Cp\u003EMy issue arises when I replace the crew pod with a 1.25m probe core and a comm dish (remote tech). At 10,000x time warp, MJ dips down a bit, then stabilizes at around 60% of max MJ amount. At 100,000x time warp, all power gets drained from the ship. I can\u0027t tell if this is because the reactor shuts down and the probe core and comm dish suck all the power or another issue. The speed at which I lose power might suggest that the reactor is consuming the 7MW it needs to stay turned on, but for some reason isn\u0027t generating power, so it just drains stored MJ until the reactor dies, then the generator consumes the last bit of thermal power for a little MJ with powers the probe core and comm dish for a brief period. At that point, the ship is then completely power dead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a sneaky feeling this might be related to RemoteTech. Maybe briefly losing communications with Mission Control is turning off the fusion reactor? Anyone else that plays with RemoteTech2 able to duplicate my situation? I have another install without RemoteTech. I\u0027ll give it a try and see if I get the same issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENope. Still having this issue without RemoteTech. Used an identical probe ship as above, minus a comm dish. At 1,000x speed, MJ flickered a bit then capped out. At 10,000x time warp, MJ drained down to exactly 3,000/5,000. When I accelerated to 100,000x time warp, MJ dropped down to zero, then all power died as the game ramped up to 100,000x speed. I\u0027d say around 80,000x speed or so is when the ship died.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think what might be happening is that the time step change is too much for the resource manager. Even with just the probe core and a single fusion reactor I think I run out of MJ before the resource manager realizes what\u0027s going on and is able to stabilize the power situation. I\u0027m thinking that if this is the problem, larger ships with more MJ storage capacity probably won\u0027t have this problem as they will have enough MJ left over after the time stamp scaling up to 100,000x to keep the fusion reactors online.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei think a good fix for this use Near-Future tech\u0027s capacitor module to make a capacitor, that works with MJ and Stored MJ. the standard capacitors in the mod keep electricity stored as stored charge, and when a button is pressed all of it is released, so you can store MJs in a resource where the fusion reactor cannot use, and then when your out of MJs, discharge the capacitor.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ratzap","CreatedById":75982,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-06T20:17:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs thorium supposed to be higher thrust with the thermal jet or not?
