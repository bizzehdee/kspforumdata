It has 4 RCS thrusters around its midsection. It also has a seperatron assisted takeoff which allows it to take off in no time at all (1 use only), but it can take off on just rcs alone. Its expensive so try not to crash it ok?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./?m40674iy7lf4csw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./?m40674iy7lf4csw\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr. Ivo Robotnik","CreatedById":83357,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-29T18:33:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Elooks great can you make a high altitude version?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-29T20:08:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eit\u0027s RCS powered so probably not...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-30T01:25:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt can be done, perhaps not stock though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
