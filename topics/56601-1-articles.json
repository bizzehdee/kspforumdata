It looks promising as far as DayZ goes. I really like what seems to be the addition of a lot of building interiors. I love buildings you can enter. Of course, my problem with DayZ is still people like DDG. Don\u0027t get me wrong, I love the videos, but the reason I stopped playing DayZ was that I was tired of the zombies being a sidenote in a zombie survival game. The focus of the game was either killing other players, or avoiding being killed by other players, and until I am convinced the standalone has fixed that problem, I\u0027m not interested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course if I had a group of local friends who all played the game then it would be fantastic for me.
