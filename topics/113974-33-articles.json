It hesitated, as if remembering, something it was not accustomed to. As if remembering something far older, far *deeper* than even *it*, from a time *before* it was dragged from its infernal abyss into this realm. Alarmed, it tried to retreat, but Valentina seized ahold of it, and *followed*...\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nDarkness...\n\nOnly darkness...\n\nThere was no light here. None at all. All the light had gone away. There was no light, and yet she could *see*. See, and more. \n\nThe air was thick with dust and the stink of rot. This place was as dry as the tomb, yet dank as the grave. It was crumbling... but somehow, also melting. \n\n*Home... this is someone\u0027s home...or... mind...*\n\nThe front door was torn off its hinges, smashed into splinters in the corner. The paint was peeling, the wallpaper sloughing off in great sheets like old skin. Here and there, holes in the plaster revealed the lathing beneath. Valentina moved to the wall, the floors creaking and crackling with each step. She raised a finger to it, and a large section just disintegrated and dripped away. \n\n*This isn\u0027t real... none of this is real...*\n\nNot a realization, but simply knowledge... as if remembering something she had always known, but never thought about... like the sun being yellow or the wind, cold. \n\n*Nothing here is real... it is here so that my mind can comprehend it.*\n\nShe turned to an old, cracked mirror on the wall, and stifled a gasp. \n\n...her eyes...\n\n...her *eyes*...!\n\nThe tiny, iridescent flecks in her eyes... the ones she thought about no more than the color of the sun... each one now blazed like a thousand suns, giving her light to see in this dark place. Enthralled, she again reached a hand to the mirror... it shattered and fell from the wall, the shards turning to dust and then nothing before they ever reached the floor. \n\nValentina stared for a moment, when a noise drew her attention. Somewhere... down that hall. As she walked on, an entirely different sound made her look back. The large piano off in the corner of the ante room tipped, shuddered, then collapsed and fell through the rotted floor. \n\nShe turned back, and continued down the hall. Here, old, framed photographs lined the walls. A tiny kerbling in a bassinet, flanked by his parents. Only... their faces were gone... faded away. The next picture... no, she did not know this youngster, now bouncing in a crib surrounded by more faceless family.  \n\n*These are... memories...*\n\nContinuing down the hall, toward the noise, Valentina watched the boy grow up in the fading, yellowed photos. It soon dawned on her, she *did* know this person. It was the Kerb who currently had her pinned up against a crate in another world, struggling for life. She watched him grow, mature, and then...\n\nShe stopped. Here, there *was* light. A faint, barely perceptible glow... a shadow of light, surrounding one photograph that hadn\u0027t faded at all. Here, the young Kerb stood in a cheap rental tuxedo, clasping hands with a pretty young Kerbelle in a plain white dress, certainly nothing that could be called a gown. They were both smiling brightly. \n\n*This... this is a \u003Cu\u003Epowerful\u003C/u\u003E memory... it grounds all the others... it is the last thing keeping this place here at all.*\n\nThere were more cracking pictures down the crumbling wall... but she heard the noise again. Valentina turned to it, and found a room. A small room, with a small bed. The disintegrated remains of a little boy\u0027s toys littered the floor. \n\nAnd there, huddled in the corner hugging his own knees, was the little boy. His clothes were old and torn, his hair unkempt, his skin filthy and bruised. He cried weak, sniffling sobs... the kind that come when you know crying will do no good, yet you have nothing else left. \n\nCarefully she approached, and laid a gentle hand on his shoulder, \u0022what ever is the matter, little one?\u0022\n\nHe didn\u0027t look up, or really move at all, just pointed over his shoulder. Over *her* shoulder...\n\nValentina spun around, and wanted to scream.  \n\nIt was not darkness, darkness is simply the absence of light. This... this was the *antithesis* of light. It radiated *not-light*, is if pulling the light in and annihilating it like a dying star. It rose steadily, roiling, seething, churning from shape to shape.\n\n*It\u0027s not real! It\u0027s not real!*\n\nNo, what\u0027s really there is far, *far* worse. \n\nThe Darkness grew, shifted, coalesced. It was formless, yet it had form. Soundless, yet it had sound. Arm-claw-tentacle-appendage-*things* jutted from its not-flanks randomly, always shifting, changing. Its not-skin was the agony of a thousand faces, and hideous visions torn from the nightmares of a trillion slumbering beings. And this horror had a face, where the Darkness grew darker still, two empty pits of unfathomable *nothingness*. It *floated*...\n\nIt towered over Valentina like a massif as the world faded away. It lowered its enormous, distorted, not-head to her, only centimeters away, its not-flesh a twisting mass of worms in carrion, and stared down into her with those abyss-like pools of *nothing*.\n\nBEHOLD. I AM DARKNESS. I AM DECAY. I AM DESTRUCTION. I AM\u2014*GAK!*\n\nValentina had done the only sensible thing she could do in that situation. She\u0027d grabbed it by the throat. But a moment ago, it *had* no throat. She watched, mesmerized, as the whole of the creature twisted and reshaped every part of itself in a parade of ever more horrible things. Every part of itself, that is, but the part she now had in her grasp.\n\nValentina watched. And she understood.\n\n\u0022You? No. ***I***. I am the Daughter of the Morning, the Firstborn of the Light. I am the Sword of the Broken. I am the Shield of the Bowed. I am Advocate, I am Councilor. I am Friend. I am the Voice of Justice, the Herald of Truth. Gadfly to the Wicked, Thorn to the Corrupt. I am the Beacon of the Last Day. I am the Final Cry. I am Shin-Breaker, Fork-Kicker, Eye-Spitter! I am the Scion of Vladimir. I am the Prodigy of Elena. I am *Marath\u0027inde Damane*, the One Who May Not Be Leashed. I am *Tenbish*, I am the Shadowscourge! I AM VALENTINA KERMANOVA.\u0022\n\nShe breathed in air that was not air, her face wrinkling just slightly, \u0022and you are stinking lump of *P\u0426TI\u0419*.\u0022\n\nThe Enemy, the *Other*, squirmed in her grasp. She could *feel* panicking, trying to retreat. Yet trapped, it rallied, and the world *shifted*. Now, a flaming forest. Now, a burning hallway. Vague, indistinct, dream-like. The thing struggling in her hand became a familiar blackened corpse. Its charred and melting flesh oozed between her fingers. \n\nYOU CANNOT ENDURE THE FIRE I WILL\u2014GAK!\n\nShe drew it close, its ruined face, its nothing-eyes, and *whispered*, \u0022***I am*** the Fire.\u0022 The world shifted again, \u0022*and you are not welcome here.*\u0022 \n\nThe piano she had seen earlier dropped on its head, crashing through the floor in a splintered hole that instantly disappeared, dragging it away. Distantly, she sensed it fleeing... No, not fleeing. *Driven*, as by the scourge. \n\nValentina blinked, and peered around, not at all sure of what had just happened. Now, she was... she was standing before the Imperial Throne in the Summer Palace, where she had once stood so many years before. Every detail, every *atom*, was crisp and right and perfect. \n\nEvery detail... except one. The hanging gallery where the Imperium once sat... was gone. \n\nAs she turned she *swished*, and looked down to find herself wearing an exquisite, iridescent gown. Colors danced and played across the fabric in hues she had never seen, and it even fit right. A little *too* right, she realized, and felt a bit of that color touch her cheeks despite the cavernous, empty room.\n\nNo, not quite empty. Standing at the foot of the steps leading up to the dais was the young boy she had seen before. His face was clean, his hair tidy, and he wore an adorable little suit. He smiled at her, and then...\n\n...then...\n\n...then...\n\n...she was floating... drifting... *rising*...\n\nValentina\u0027s eyes snapped open. She and the unknown Kerb who still had his hands at her neck slumped and collapsed to the floor. He looked around, stunned, and saw her.\n\n\u0022You...\u0022 he whispered, \u0022it\u0027s gone...\u0022 He shook his head, then with adulation, \u0022it\u0027s *gone!\u0022*\n\nShe crawled backwards a step, expecting the Kerb to come at her again. He only stared in awe.\n\n\u0022You... you can\u0027t do that... *how* did you do that?!\u0022 he pawed at the wide smile blooming across his face, \u0022it\u0027s gone!\u0022\n\n\u0022The... Shadow...?\u0022 Valentina asked. \n\n\u0022I don\u0027t know what you did, but it\u0027s *gone!*\u0022 he practically squealed, \u0022you saved me!\u0022\n\nHer eyes flicked back and forth as the pieces clicked together in her head... \n\n*Shadowscourge*...\n\n\u0022Edmund...\u0022 she mumbled, \u0022there are others, yes? Like you?\u0022\n\n\u0022Yes... can you help them too?\u0022\n\n\u0022I... I do not know, I... maybe...\u0022 she thought for a moment, \u0022this whole place, is everyone...?\u0022\n\n\u0022No, no,\u0022 he shook his head, \u0022there\u0027s not many. Only a few here, maybe a couple of dozen all over the world. Most folks here are just trying to make a root, or hide from something... a few true believers...\u0022 he paused, \u0022It\u0027s... it\u0027s *limted*... like, every time it\u0027s spread, it gets a little weaker.\u0022 He winced, rubbing at his temples.\n\n\u0022People in power, yes?\u0022 she prodded, \u0022The rich, the connected... leaders, yes?\u0022\n\nHe blinked, \u0022hm? Oh, no. No, no, no. They\u0027re easily corrupted with worldly things, no need to waste...\u0022, again he winced, \u0022we... they\u0027re janitors, garbage Kerbs, aids, secretaries. People no one sees. No one cares about. But they see all. Send messages. Do... things...\u0022 he shuddered.\n\nConcern spreading over her face, Valentina reached a hand out to him, \u0022and it is all Edmund? Edmund Kerman, the Kerbonaut? He controls it?\u0022\n\nThe other Kerbal squeezed his eyes shut, opened them wide, \u0022why\u0027s it getting so hard to think? Um, yes... no... Edmund controls us... *them*... the Tainted... does all the dirty work... but...\u0022 now he pressed both palms to his face, \u0022there\u0027s someone else. Someone giving him orders. There\u0027s... friction... they don\u0027t... always...\u0022\n\n\u0022Who?\u0022 she prodded, \u0022who is it?\u0022\n\n\u0022It\u0027s... it\u0027s... um,\u0022 one of his eyes began to twitch.\n\n\u0022Are you all right, friend? Should... I get help?\u0022\n\n\u0022No... my head... listen, there\u0027s... can\u0027t think...\u0022 he slapped the heel of a hand against his forehead, \u0022there\u0027s someone else, and...\u0022\n\nSuddenly his face jerked to hers, his eyes wide with terror, \u0022oh no... no...\u0022\n\n\u0022What? What is it?\u0022\n\n\u0022Someone... else... important... danger...\u0022 he grabbed her shirt trying to hold himself up, his entire face now twitching and spasming, \u0022you... you can\u0027t...\u0022 She put hands over his, tried to make sense...\n\n\u0022Don\u0027t... t... t... trust...\u0022\n\n\u0022Who? *Who!?* A name?\u0022 His whole body quaked. His lips peeled into horrifying shapes, his throat convulsed. Throbbing veins rose through his skin with effort. One last throe... and she felt him relax and slump against the crate. Color drained from his face as his eyes glazed over, dull and empty.\n\n\u0022No...\u0022 Valentina shook him, felt for a pulse. His head lolled against her shoulder.\n\n\u0022Gah!\u0022 he jumped back, \u0022where am I?!\u0022 He seemed to notice her for the first time, \u0022GAAH! Who are you?!\u0022\n\nValentina let out a slow sigh, and raised a hand to her face, \u0022let me guess. You have no idea who *you* are either, do you?\u0022\n\nHe blinked at her, \u0022no, of course I know who I am,\u0022 and recited, \u0022P. Kerman, 42 Wallaby Way, Kidney\u2014\u0022 his eyes popped wide. \n\nP. Kerman jumped up abruptly, lifting his shirt. He spun himself in little circles, peering over his shoulder as if trying very hard to look at his own backside. He pawed at his hips. Finally, relief washed across his face. \n\n\u0022Whew, still there! Boy, Meg would *really* be miffed if *that* happened again, let me tell ya!\u0022\n\nValentina just stared. \n\nThe relief washed away as quickly as it came, \u0022oh boy... oh *boy*...! I did again, didn\u0027t I?\u0022 trembling fingers ran through his now-unkempt hair, \u0022I\u2014I\u2014I\u2014I told Megselle I was just going out with the boys, no big deal! Just down to the pub for a couple hours, and I promised to stick to Shirley Temples, too!\u0022\n\nHe seemed to notice her again, \u0022wait a minute. Your accent. You and I, we didn\u0027t, um... you know...\u0022\n\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022NO!\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\n\u0022Whew!\u0022 there was that relief again, \u0022Meg would *really* be miffed if I came home with a mail order bride again, let me tell ya! The return shipping on those things is just like *whoa*. And besides,\u0022 he gave her an utterly innocent grin, \u0022you\u0027re kinda pudgy, too.\u0022\n\nValentina\u0027s jaw dropped open.\n\n\u0022So, where are we?\u0022 he said, looking around, \u0022is this Downtown?\u0022\n\n\u0022It is a bit farther that,\u0022 she rumbled. \n\nHis face fell again, \u0022oh boy... oh *boy*, I really went and did it this time, didn\u0027t I? Meg\u0027s gonna be so miffed! This is the wrong side of the track again, isn\u0027t it?\u0022 He took absolutely no notice of Valentina\u0027s mouth working like a fish, trying to find the words.\n\n\u0022I\u2014I\u2014I\u2014I\u2014it was just a couple of Shirley Temples, I swear! But then Corlen ordered a bottle of something called \u0027absinthe,\u0027 and\u2014\u0022\n\n\u0022Wait,\u0022 Valentina finally broke in, \u0022what *is* the last thing you remember?\u0022\n\n\u0022Well, this guy I met said he had something really cool to show me, but I had to go out the one-way door at the back of the bar and meet him in the dark, deserted alley,\u0022 P. Kerman mused on this for a moment, \u0022but if you can\u0027t trust a creepy random stranger in a trenchcoat you met in the bathroom of a seedy pub, then who can ya trust, right?\u0022 He beamed a happy grin at her. \n\nValentina gaped a moment longer before burying her face in her hands, \u0022you have got to be kidding me.\u0022 At length, she stood up with a sigh. She put on her best diplomatic smile and pointed somewhere off behind him, \u0022look! Um... is Superkerb!\u0022\n\n\u0022Really? Where?\u0022 *thump* \u0022Goodnight, Mommie!\u0022 *thud.*\n\nShe sighed once more and set to work. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*BANG! BANG! BANG!*\n\nWiping the sweat from her brow, Valentina finished pounding the last nail back into the crate. She thought about it, then added one more just to be safe. A low snoring sound drifted from inside. Maybe she should have added some air holes. \n\nShe shrugged, and checked the shipping manifest one more time. \n\nBOTTLED WATER  \n\nDEHYDRATED FOODSTUFFS  \n\nSWEET SNACK FOOD  \n\nFLASHLIGHTS  \n\nREADING MATERIALS  \n\nASSORTED SOFT SQUISHY THINGS\n\nShe smiled at her handiwork then scribbled on the outgoing shipping label. \n\nDELIVER TO:  \nM. Kerman  \n\n42 Wallaby Way, Kidney\n\nLovely city, Kidney. She\u0027d seen an opera there, once. Unfortunate name. \n\nNo sooner had she finished, when the loudspeakers buzzed to life, \u0022attention all personnel: stand down, secure from lockdown. All personnel return to duty stations.\u0022\n\nShouldn\u0027t be long now. Finally, *finally*, she had a plan. Just get through this next bit, tell the Kommissar, and go find Edmund. It wasn\u0027t too late. She could *save* him. She could save *everyone*. \n\n*But first,* she thought, standing a little straighter, *I have a rocket to catch.* \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-01-23T10:16:08Z\u0022 title=\u002201/23/2021 10:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 23, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"0111narwhalz","CreatedById":110660,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-08T07:02:09Z","Content":"Ooh, new chapter. ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif \u0022:cool:\u0022)\n\nAnd as always, Val is being a regular BadS.\n\n(Also, it\u0027s interesting to see how other writers do formatting.

Maybe. OK, we didn\u0027t ask anyone at all.\n\nSpoiler\n\nA harsh wind roars across a cracked, crumbling expanse of nothing, dried and dead, every last trace of moisture long passed. It kicks up gritty, alkaline dust, scouring the surface, shrouding the land in a sickly, yellow haze. Through this haze walks a figure, clad all in black, hunched over against the relentless wind. \n\nIts hands are bandaged, its legs wrapped in rags, leaving nothing exposed to the abrasive torrent around it. What might once have been a gas mask covers its eyes, the rubber cracked, the dark lenses scratched to near opacity. With one hand the figure holds its ragged cloak across the rest of its face, more out of habit than need. Its head is always bowed, studying the tortured ground as it lurches onward, never looking up. No, to look up is to know madness. \n\n*I want to cry... but I can\u0027t...*\n\nAs the dark figure trudges along, a great form looms out of the roiling sepia cloud. The figure approaches, unperturbed, and pauses before the enormous bulk rising out of the ruined land. Here, someone has cut a hole in the hull of the ancient fishing trawler. A torn square of cloth whips in the wind, half covering it. A pathetic patch of ground nearby has been scraped up, a few dried brown stalks of some stringy plant still stand, slowly being eroded by the unceasing gale. For a long time, the figure only stares, clutching its cloak against the maelstrom. It moves to brush the scrap of cloth aside, but the wind tears it from its mounts, and it disappears off into the torrent. \n\nInside, the howl is left a muted wail. Shafts of dim light from rusted holes illuminate the dust hanging in the air. All around are the cast off detritus of a waning world. The figure bends, reaching for an object on the ground. It is a tiny doll, cobbled together from whatever was to be found. The moment the figure lifts it, it crumbles away. \n\n*I want to cry... but I can\u0027t...*\n\nThe figure moves on into the next room, and there he sees. Two skeletons huddle on the floor, cradling another, much smaller, its features twisted and deformed. Even here, in this dying place, some had clung to hope until the last bitter breath. The figure looks on a moment longer before turning away. \n\nOutside, the wind rages louder than ever before. The figure trembles and slowly falls to its knees. Above, there is no sky. The sky has been gone since the day it receded, rolled up like a scroll; when the sun became as dark as sackcloth, the M\u00FCn became as blood, and the stars fell like rain. Above, there are only roiling clouds, red and angry. Snaking through them, twisting and churning, dominating what had once been the sky... \n\nIt is formless, yet it has form. Soundless, yet it has sound. Arm-claw-tentacle-appendage-*things* jut from its not-flanks randomly, always shifting, changing. Its not-skin is the agony of a thousand faces, and hideous visions torn from the nightmares of a trillion slumbering beings.\n\n*My fault... all my fault...*\n\nThe wind finally catches the figure\u0027s cloak, tearing it from its bandaged hand. Below the tattered remains of what might once have been a gas mask, there is only the weathered, desiccated jaw of a skull. \n\n*I want to cry... but I can\u0027t...I want to die... but I can\u0027t...*\n\nIndifferent, the wind roars on.\n\n**\\*\\*\\*COMING THIS SUMMER\\*\\*\\***\n\n*I watched as the last seal was opened, and tribulation spilled out upon the face of the land.* \n\n\u0022...seventh straight day of rioting, private security troops occupied the capitol building and detained the prime minister, effectively putting the entire country under the control of the Layland-Wutani Corporation...\u0022\n\n*Nation rose against Nation,*\n\n\u0022...unprovoked nuclear attack...\u0022\n\n*And Kingdom against Kingdom.*\n\n\u0022...and so I ask this Congress for nothing less than a *declaration of war* against the Ussari Federation, and its allies...\u0022\n\n*The strong preyed upon the weak,*\n\n\u0022If you were any other Kerb, I would kill you where you stand!\u0022\n\n*The wicked triumphed in their evildoing,*\n\n\u0022He is right.
