Ideally, you will continue turning throughout the ascent, but stepwise turns might be easier until you get the hang of it. I suggest 15 degrees after launch, 30 degrees at 5 km, 45 degrees at 10 km, and 60 degrees at 15 or 20 km. Once your speed is above 1000 m/s, switch to the map view and keep an eye on your apoapsis. Once it reaches 75-100 km, shut down the engine and coast the rest of the way up. Then burn prograde until you periapsis is above 70 km. If timed correctly, you can get a near-perfect circular orbit at this point, if not, you can raise your periapsis after orbiting once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour rocket may not have the aerodynamic stability required for this trajectory; if it flips on the way up, add fins to the bottom. If things get too hot, add a little more altitude before each turn (or throttle down if your rocket is overpowered).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know if this advice was actually any good. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T11:58:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe farther you burn from the apoapsis the more you\u0027re pushing the apoapsis away, and the tolerance for precise results is really like 10s (and with low-thrust engines you won\u0027t fit under 10s with circularizing...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best you can do for pretty circular orbits (not that they are really needed, all they do is make transfer burns easier to plan) is to get Kerbal Engineer Report, and during your approach to apoapsis observe \u0022Time to Apoapsis\u0022 entry on the HUD it provides. Start some 30s before and as you start the burn, keep the engine power such that the time keeps dropping, albeit slowly - at such a speed that you\u0027ll be finishing the burn when the counter reaches zero. (you can push it back by burning full throttle or speed it up by decreasing the throttle; also the closer to apoapsis the stronger the burn needs to be to keep the timer stopped.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, there are always partially radial/antiradial burns. Just plan a maneuver with such radial and prograde components (somewhere roughly halfway between periapsis and apoapsis) so that they are equal as result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: as for optimal ascent... don\u0027t worry about that too much. Yes, it\u0027s inefficient but it\u0027s fairly *easy*. Gravity Turn ascent profile is optimal and in the right rocket it requires a little nudge to get you right into a pretty circular orbit. The problem is the rockets you launch will hardly ever be \u0022right\u0022 and in that case the ascent requires excessive amounts of tweaking and maintenance so that your rocket won\u0027t flip over.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-22T12:01:54Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2015 12:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kurld","CreatedById":79950,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T12:01:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELike Jens said, it will be very hard to get a circular orbit this way. The thing at play here is that your new delta-v is not instantaneous. You will have to burn for some amount of time near your ap in order to arrive at orbital velocity. The lower you can get this time number, the easier it will be for you to circularize. You can do this by either having ridiculous TWR or by arriving at the ap already at close to the desired velocity. The way you do that is by an efficient ascent as Jens described.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing that will help in any case is to start the circularization burn before you get to the ap. For instance if your burn is to be for 12 seconds, you might start your burn at T-6 seconds. This will help \u0022average out\u0022 the thrust so that the entire burn is close to the ap.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T12:47:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI try to turn the rocket about 5 degrees at about 50 m/s, then just ride the prograde vector to orbit, but this depends on your TWR (and having mass at the front, drag at the back).
