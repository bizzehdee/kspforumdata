It\u0027s intended as a persistent ferry for interplanetary missions; hence the 5 docking ports (one shielded axial port into the flight deck, 4 mounted radially below a Hitchhiker module) so that I can just fly up the right payloads for each mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrimary propulsion is ol\u0027 Boom-boom, fed by the 600x3.5MN magazine stack plus 60 each of the .88MN \u0022trimming\u0022 charges and the 400MN transplanetary injection charges. Secondary propulsion (also acting as secondary attitude control thanks to thrust vectoring) comes from 6 NERVA engines, each fed by 3 FL-T800 tanks topped by SAS gyros. (I had to mount the NERVAs away from the ORION\u0027s hull, as otherwise the NERVA exhaust impinged upon the pusher plate with, er, less than entirely salutary results... I figured the Kerbal solution would be to add more fuel instead of putting them on pylons.) Primary attitude control comes from 18 RCS quad-blocks fed by a small ocean of hydrazine (4x FL-R1 tanks below the Hitchhiker, 18x FL-R25 tanks set one apiece atop the FL-T800s); 6 blocks just below the flight deck, 12 near the base of the Orion\u0027s working parts about half as far from the \u003Cem\u003EBig Stan\u0027s\u003C/em\u003E centre of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElectrical power is provided by 2 RTGs; I figure with all the fissionables already aboard two more sources wouldn\u0027t hurt. When running alone they\u0027re largely superfluous, but when payloads are docked they can keep payload batteries charged and power the 4 docking lights I have mounted to make docking a bit less hairy. I\u0027ve also festooned the upper areas with ladders to make EVA a bit less fraught.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlas my cunning plan has come aground slightly; I got a \u0022bomb truck\u0022 tender docked to \u003Cem\u003EBig Stan\u003C/em\u003E before discovering I can\u0027t transfer bombs to the main stack; I don\u0027t know if this is intended or not, as it must be terribly awkward to haul those magazines around in freefall.
