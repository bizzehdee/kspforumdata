I first deployed the big scanner, and as long as it\u0027s my current ship I can see the overlay. Then I deployed a lander probe with the narrow band scanner, as well as a ground scanner. The narrow band is easy enough to use, although the map gui thingy is kinda hard to read and figure out which direction to go, but oh well. Then the ground scanner says it logs info for whatever biome I\u0027m in, but I can\u0027t find where to view that info?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I understand it, I should be able to see the overlays even if my current ship isn\u0027t the main scanner (correct me if I\u0027m wrong) just by focusing on the body in question (Minmus, in this case), but that doesn\u0027t work. Also, I can\u0027t see any of the overlays from the tracking station. I can get the GUI to pop up, but there is no overlay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I doing something wrong, or am I getting glitches?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T05:10:06Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 05:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pearldrumbum\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T04:31:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn map view (including tracking station), focus on the planet or moon you\u0027re interested in, and a 3rd button should appear on the middle of the right edge of the screen, for the resources info. Click it to open the little resources panel, click \u0022Ore\u0022 in the list to enable the ore overlay (it\u0027s setup to list many different resources either from mods or other stock resources in the future). That assumes that you\u0027ve done a successful scan with the orbital scanner first (which you have, if it\u0027s showing you the overlay when it\u0027s the active craft). Adjust the % bottom left of the small resources info panel to adjust the threshold shown in the overlay (0% shows all, 100% will likely show nothing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s no separate display from the ground scanner, only the number shown in the right-click menu, as far as I\u0027m aware.
