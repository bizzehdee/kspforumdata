Sometimes they will not scale correctly. Too much SAS is uncontrollable even in stock. Also on smaller vessels having more than 1 SAS source can be uncontrollable. If you launched multiple sats from one rocket, if they were upside down on the parent vehicle, they could be confused and torquing in the wrong direction. (bast practice is to have all probes facing in the same direction.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother possibility - it sounds like you may be using Better Than Manned? If you are using directional antennae, or an antenna in the chain is continuously powering/depowering, your sats might be continuously losing/gaining control rapidly. Make sure you have enough batteries on every satellite to buffer any SAS or transmission drain to prevent brownouts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
