First, the auto-collection occurs as soon as the experiment is run, rather then in response to the player clicking keep in the science report, leading to a situation where the science report appears, but the experiment has already been collected and stored, so clicking Reset has no effect. this may or may not be possible, but it would provide better behavior if the auto-collect process ignored experiments where the report window was still open. Second, as an alternative to the first option, it might be a good idea to separate out the auto-run and auto-collect processes into two toolbar buttons that can be toggled independently, allowing the player to manually trigger collection of all on board experiments once they have reviewed the reports and have kept the results they are happy with. Both of these are intended as a solution to a problem i ran into frequently in the early game, where automatic runs were the most valuable with lots of low-value, run-once experiments in the flying low and flying high biomes around the space center, but where the automatic collection process was breaking the experiments for low value and preventing a non-science kerbal from resetting the experiment from the report window, as in the stock game, and using that experiment for higher returns later in the trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceTiger","CreatedById":133800,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T06:36:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh lots of feedback \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got a new version almost ready that fixes the resetting of experiments with a scientist and a way to hide the results window at least for everything that uses the stock module.
