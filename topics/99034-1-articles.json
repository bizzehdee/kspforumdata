The rover went to Duna. I detached my engine from the rover and came down to Duna. But, I was going so fast, not even the atmosphere would stop me. Luckily the chutes did. Though, I was still going to fast, and when I landed, the Materials bay and the wheels came of. The rest survived. I am currently going to work on something to carry parts of a base with a launchpad there, so then I can bring the Kerbal home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/538514066417859486/91393A9CE5EC20D13561DB44817B891E9FF6015A/\u0022 alt=\u002291393A9CE5EC20D13561DB44817B891E9FF6015A\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, this is where things get unexpected. I really didn\u0027t want to use MechJeb to land on anything anymore, so I tried it by myself on Ike. Somehow, I DID IT. A guy, who uses MechJeb all the time, who has no actually experience in landing, I did it. I was absolutely amazed when I did it. Then, I did something even MORE surprising for myself. I got into a Semi-Orbit, and LANDED in ANOTHER BIOME. I was so proud, even though it\u0027s you guys\u0027 bread and butter (aka most of you have done it before alot) and I thought to myself, \u0022my best ever episode of KSP\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah!
