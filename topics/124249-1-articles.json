I\u0027m new to challenges, and I apologize to post a challenge without even trying myself at the task. I simply don\u0027t have the enginereeing, designing, and programming skills to do this, but I\u0027m very curious if some of you can. I already saw some examples in this forum and I wonder if some of them may qualify - with some adjustment.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EKerWal - the Kerbal walker competition\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis competition is for designing crafts able to walk. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EGOAL\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe goal of this competition is to find the best solutions for manned and unmanned vehicles which rely on legs for movement and stability in increasingly difficoult terrains and situations.
