Helpless, he watched as the roof of his house blazed. Fear beset him: for his family, for his life, for everything he knew of his world going up in smoke. Though the fire department quenched the flames, much was lost just the same. The house was rendered uninhabitable, possibly beyond repair, and many of his electronics were doused in the waters that had saved the building from utter destruction. No lives were lost, thankfully (human or feline), but emotions ran raw and hard after such a chaotic and unpredictable horror. In those few hours before dawn, so much had been taken from him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/1Rdsj\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RZcRttc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RZcRttc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E[click the image for more pictures of the damage]\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESkyRender knew that very little would be the same after his house stopped smoking and the last firefighter left. After posting a message on the Kerbal Space Program Forum about the catastrophe, he began to receive PMs from numerous people who not only wanted to offer condolences, but also to help him overcome the blaze. They knew that with some help, he could reconcile the damage that the fire had wrought. Like a phoenix, he could rise from the ashes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll SkyRender wanted were kind words and messages of hope.
