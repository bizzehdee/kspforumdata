This way at bigger bodies you can use the lander\u002Badditional module together for landing, and for smaller worlds (like Bop, Pol and maybe Vall) you can left the fuel in Jool orbit and bring the lander to the moon with the (this way) moon-orbit module and back to the fuel section when the lander returned.

I\u0027m not sure if it will make the trip all the way back to Kerban, but getting to Duna should be no problem so I could put it into orbit around Duna and refuel there, then just head back to Kerban and land on the Runway.

So this is about somehow optimizing this mission into one big journey. If you send five separate missions to each moon and back then it\u0027s not one mission, even if it\u0027s done in the same time. Or, for example, if you would launch one big ship with crew and landers but the Tylo lander will be sent later then it\u0027s not really one mission, that would be easier and so it wouldn\u0027t be correct against the other contenders if I would accept that. So I should say you have to go to Jool as one ship and come back as one (you can drop the landers and unused stuff before returning, of course).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut on the other hand I created this challenge to encourage people to do this huge mission and to think about the best solutions (for different levels or with science), plan great ships and see how many ways there are, what are good and what are bad... and, at first, to have fun! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E So if you want to go this way then do it and I can put your name and infos at the Mixed Solution category.
