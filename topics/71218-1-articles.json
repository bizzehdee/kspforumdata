This mission is to demonstrate the capability for KSC to safely land and maintain a base of operations on the Mun, as a gateway to the rest of the kerbol system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah, and the twins Munlin and Tomlin will be our first pilots to land, and will be tasked with assembling the modules as they land. We will be using brand new technology in construction and assembly to properly ensure adequate support for all missions. These new technologies include Infernal Robotics, Kerbal Attachment System, as well as a few key components from B9 Aerospace, namely the light sources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first module to land was Habitat One. Hab1, as it is nicknamed, was flown up by Jebediah and Tomlin. A site had been targeted previously for this mission, so their job was simply to get it there in one piece. They did just that, and brilliantly so:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qGerHQM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022qGerHQM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase 2 was a bit trickier. Munlin took the task to land Habitat Two, or as he calls it The Extender. Except, now, the task is made a bit tougher since he has to execute a precision landing near the existing structure without damaging it. Then, to drive it over close to Hab1, again without damaging anything. And finally, to get the boys on one page to assemble the two units:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ktqP13i.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ktqP13i.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo halves getting real close.

We haven\u0027t had much luck in the past docking things while on the surface, so this was a method to ensure we could align them perfectly, regardless of terrain. Made up of three parts, two hinges and an extending pole. The two hinges allowed me to raise or lower the port while keeping it parallel to the other one. The extension was just in case our struts and landing stages got in the way. They didn\u0027t, thankfully, but it still gave me the vertical range to get the ports alligned perfectly. Once it snapped to docking, it was a simple matter of letting Munlin retract the arm and locking everything in place.

For instance, all my RCS pods are using the B9 rcs pods. And most of the lights are B9. I\u0027ve got parts from KAS, AEIS, KWRocketry. I was testing stuff out of the Near Future pack, and I don\u0027t remember if I\u0027m using any of those or not. I\u0027m also using SDHI, but I moved the attachment node up since I\u0027m not using the heatshield since I\u0027m not using Deadly Re-entry. And the radial engines on the resupply pod come from a pack that I don\u0027t remember the name of, and I scaled them down so they are smaller, less thrust, less effecient (the originals were basically light-weight nukes, and I felt they were a bit too cheaty). I was also trying out Kosmos and Interstellar to see if there were parts I could use. And again, I don\u0027t remember if I kept one or two or not. There\u0027s also the 6S Service Compartments, including the extra large ones someone else made to go with them. The big solar panels might be AIES, but I adjusted their power usage to be less, as I felt these were too effecient compared to stock. Launch clamps are FASA. There\u0027s also Infernal Robotics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssentially, my goal would be to find a specific part (for example, the large solar panels). Then I would install every single mod ever that has large solar panels. Then I would test them all, look at them all, play with them all. When I found the ones I wanted, I would delete everything in those mod packs except the solar panels I wanted to keep. This way I get the specific part I want without lagging my load times by overflowing my part catalog.
