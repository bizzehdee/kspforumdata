Seems like no matter how much you threaten to change it, it never does. You can\u0027t even reason with code. It\u0027s like they are written down or something. But, in any case, I am glad you\u0027ve yielded positive results. I tried my luck at texturing the other day. I gave a full day of wanting to design an interplanetary command module. Needless to say, I\u0027m getting better at modelling, but my texturing looks like a 2nd grader did it with a melted crayon with paste mixed in with it.\n\u003E \n\nLoL, indeed.  The code always wins.  I was mostly arguing with it over some methods regarding config nodes.  -I- felt that those methods should work regardless of where in the loading sequence they were called.  -They- felt like they only wanted to work after the parts-list was fully populated (PartLoader.Instance.GetDatabaseConfig(Part p);  do -not- call it during prefab construction, or it\u0027ll...crash horribly).  Thankfully I found out that I did not actually need them during the prefab construction, and could rely on the initial loading sequence without it crashing stuff.\n\nWas also arguing with it over why all of the PART config nodes have their \u0027name\u0027 value deleted after the part is loaded (so that you cannot tell what part the config belongs to).  Its like KSP is going out of its way to make it hard to access the parts original config data.  Really don\u0027t understand it.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, Gkirmathal said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/), question I\u0027d really like to start using LanderCore parts of SSTU, but I am uncertain which other parts of SSTU (shared Assets/Data \u0026 Props) LC relies on.

No clue really.\n\nLogically, you\u0027ll need all the lander core models and assets (even the shared assets... such as they use the texture for the -old- rcs ports), their part files, and of course the plugin to make it all function.\n\nWhen I go to finally publicly release the mod I\u0027ll be splitting it up into various minimal / single-purpose packages -- LanderCore, ShipCore, Engines, Tanks.  Still probably a month or two out on this though (need 1.1, -and- need time to update stuff after that).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, \\_Augustus\\_ said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Will you ever do the HG-3 or M1?\n\u003E \n\nProbably not either of them -- they were never fully developed engines, minimal information is available on them, and I already have a good selection of upper-stage engines (and with clusters, you don\u0027t really -need- such massive engines).  They would also never fit into the tech-tree appropriately (being low/mid-tech engines, but being so large, KSP would shoehorn them into the end of the tech-tree, making them useless for progression).\n\nAnd... RD-108 initial geometry:\n\n![wZVvQlr.png](http://i.imgur.com/wZVvQlr.png)\n\nEdit:\n\nAnd, in regards to the new engine cluster plugin/module -- current intent is to continue developing it, and perhaps release one or two engines using it for extended testing, but not do the official swap over until the 1.1 release/updating pass.  This is mostly so that I\u0027m not breaking -all- existing craft using the current engine clusters.\n\nHoping to have an updated test release tonight with the last few days\u0027 worth of updates in it -- RD-107 \u002B 108, SC-E prototype parts, and at least one test part for the new engine cluster module.\n\nAiming to get the engine(s) finished up sometime this week/end (or at least unwrapped and first couple passes of texturing), and then will be focusing on the SC-E parts until they are done or 1.1 is released (lots of geometry work yet to do... will likely take a few weeks to get them done).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-17T16:02:51Z\u0022 title=\u002202/17/2016 04:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-17T19:49:22Z","Content":"Looking great, Shadowmage!"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-17T22:11:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, regex said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Looking great, Shadowmage!\n\u003E \n\nThanks ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nHopefully I\u0027ll have some prototype parts available for testing tonight -- geometry will be finished (or very nearly), though they will not have any textures for this pass.

The shuttle body has a flap at the rear to -protect- the engines and provide entry aerobraking. \n\n![aft_fuselage_2.jpg](http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/images/aft_fuselage_2.jpg)\n\nThough, it appears that your model can support such a piece. I\u0027m not sure what kind of adjustments you\u0027d need to make to the wing set as you\u0027ll probably have to slide them back to accommodate this aerodynamic feature. Your thoughts on this?"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-18T22:01:05Z","Content":"Rear body flap is planned, but it will -not- be a movable control surface, will be visual only (at least/until stock fixes aero surfaces to work in a logical manner)."},{"CreatedByName":"ComatoseJedi","CreatedById":91567,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-18T22:05:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 minute ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Rear body flap is planned, but it will -not- be a movable control surface, will be visual only (at least/until stock fixes aero surfaces to work in a logical manner).\n\u003E \n\nAwesome. that\u0027s all I needed to know. It would appear that you wouldn\u0027t need it to move anyways with the current model aerodynamics. It works pretty good with initial tests without it, but I just noticed that there was a lot of fire hitting the engines and I was wondering if Jeb was going to pop out of the hatch and start roasting marshmellows on the SSMEs."}]}
