The issue is that docking ports are not overly useful for this kind of application, as sacrifices have to be made for size, shape, aesthetics, and location. I was wondering what mods are balanced in accordance to stock parts that would allow me to do this. Kerbal Attachment System is definitely an option, but I haven\u0027t used it since its very first release so I don\u0027t know what changes have been made, what new parts have been added, or even if it\u0027s a balanced mod.

It takes A WHOLE LOT of electricity to operate the drills and converters. You have to send sats to scan terrain to reveal deposits. I just wish there was a way scanning could be accomplished simultaneously on different planets instead of only the current active sat. This is a problem with MapSat and SatScan too. There should be a way for the sats to reveal the surface over time and allow you to move on to other missions and come back later to see the results. Instead it leaves huge gaps in the scans because you didn\u0027t babysit them every second. I hope that gets fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I have new mining rigs to extract and process Kethane and deliver fuel to orbiting craft. Fuel trucks to transport and refuel landing craft that before would be scrapped once empty because there was no way to refuel the fuel trucks. The BIGGEST headache is getting stock docking ports to link on land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYesterday I downloaded KAS, refitted my fuel truck with a vertical winch on the boom, front and rear horizontal winches, 4 large containers, a few minutes figuring what to put in them. There\u0027s a 40 and 80 weight limit depending on the container size. All KAS parts (there\u0027s not a lot) are placed logically in the science tree. All my tech is unlocked already so it\u0027s just a matter of revisiting past tech to find KAS parts and unlock those. Hands down Kerbal Attachment System is a must have mod for any base builders out there! I can\u0027t stress how stress free it is to be able to walk up to a container, grab a radial attachment port, walkover to a winch and drag the line over to another ship, attach the port and plug in the line, switch to the truck or ship and alt-right click both craft and transfer fuel, unplug and reel in the line.

Firespitter because sometimes it\u0027s fun to step back, stop shooting craters into the Mun, and fly a propeller plane around Kerbin. Or land a biplane on the Mun. Lack Luster Labs for some Sci-Fi inspired non-round parts that look Awesome and work well.

I was pondering whether or not to install KAS first, so I launched a test lander with Jebediah on-board while I weighed up the argument. This was a craft that I\u0027d used over and over, in total I\u0027ve gained ~5000 science with that craft alone, so I knew it would work.
