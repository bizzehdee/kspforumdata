It requires the [Kerbal Engineer Redux](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/18230-1-0-4-Kerbal-Engineer-Redux-v1-0-18-0) mod for the computers at the Engineer\u0027s station, and [TAC Self Destruct](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25830-1-0-2-TAC-Self-Destruct-v1-5-1-13May) for the explosions.\n\n![sfVjrT1.png](http://i.imgur.com/sfVjrT1.png)\n\nHere\u0027s the pages from the comic showing how it was used:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/tokbC)\n\nNote that for some of the explosions I used Whack-A-Kerbal in addition to the self-destruct charges. (Also note, your Kerbals will be in their EVA suits with helmets on unless you have a mod installed that lets them do otherwise.)\n\nAG1 toggles the jet engine smoke simulator.\n\nAG2 through AG5 are various explosive charges set all around the bridge. \n\nAG7 toggles the LV909 mass driver, very useful for blowing Kerbals around the bridge after an explosion. \n\nAG0 toggles the \u0027red alert\u0027 lights.\n\nYou can get the crew into their seats by transferring them from the hitchhiker pod to the \u0027turbolift\u0027 and then having them EVA onto the bridge. Alternatively, there is a ladder to the ground.\n\nThe probe core out back is there as an alternative point for the camera to focus on; I decoupled it and made it the active ship when I needed a lower angle shot of the action on the bridge.\n\nEnjoy!
