I landed on the moon today (YES I DID IT) and it\u0027s the first time for me to land on another celestial body in ksp. I need a few tips on how to get to another planet, more specifically, Eve, and back. Also, I have some suggestions for the developers to do in the game that I think would be pretty cool. First, it would be nice to have music for all the different planets/moons. I think it could add a nicer atmosphere to the planet/moon. and maybe on Kerbin there can be music for day and music for night. I would also like clouds. I don\u0027t really know what else to say about it, clouds would just be nice. Maybe a city called Kerbin City like in that mod would be pretty cool. Except I don\u0027t want a name like Kerbin City, I would like something more creative (no offense to anybody). I mean, there aren\u0027t any cities on Earth called Human City, so maybe the city could have a nice name that would be normal to find. Lastly, I would like for mining to be an option. Maybe there could be a building in KSC for building things from materials you get from other planets, and you could get more parts. That\u0027s really all for my suggestions. Unless you want to read my next one which is never going to be added or liked, which would be have one planet have a boss on it that you can fight and it\u0027s all tense and if you win the fight you get a fuel tank that never runs out or a capsule that never breaks or a thruster that thrusts really fast or something. I don\u0027t know how to properly end this paragraph.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Silent Majority","CreatedById":106117,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-09T06:29:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreetings fellow carbon (I presume) based life form.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECongrats on finding this game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t say much about the creative part (not my strong point), but concerning Eve, do not try to land and return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously, its the most difficult planet to return from (besides maybe Tylo (mun...) or Moho).
