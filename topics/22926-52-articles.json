I figured out, from reading a post on (I THOUGHT it was) this thread, from Kreuzung, that his/her module, I think it\u0027s called \u0027ModuleKRCrewCompartment\u0027, overrides the crew capacity of an EVA-capable part. After removing that module from the configs of the Hatch and Airlock Door, the problem went away. So try that. Hopefully you can figure out what I mean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only other thing I could think of is that the collider for the part with the clear windows is blocking Kerbals from getting out of the Hatch or Airlock. But you said you were having problems getting Kerbals out of the hatches even outside the ship, so I still think it\u0027s the problem I mentioned in the previous paragraph. I\u0027m pretty sure that the Kreuzung \u0027KR\u0027 crew compartment module doesn\u0027t work and play well with Crew Manifest. Not that it\u0027s a bad bit of code or anything, the two plugins just seem to conflict in this case. Like I said, try removing that module from all parts that you want to actually use to carry crew in, and I think that will solve the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, BTW, you won\u0027t get portraits of Kerbals if they\u0027re in an Airlock or Hull section, because those parts aren\u0027t modeled to have IVA views.
