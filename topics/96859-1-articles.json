Since taking a break from KSP and overclocking my computer, I am actually able to run less parts. The 700-part range was slow but doable for me, but now 300 parts is about the limit I can put up with. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy CPU is an AMD Phenom II hexacore overclocked to 4.0 ghz. I can see from gaming benchmarks that the latest Intel \u0022Core\u0022 CPUs have about a 25% IPC (instructions per clock) advantage over AMD CPUs in gaming related tasks. The AMD Phenom II CPUs like I have are slighly faster in IPC (5%) than the latest AMD CPUs that can reach higher clock rates. \u003Cstrong\u003E Tell me, what then would account for a computer with an Intel \u0022Core\u0022 CPU being able to run a ship with 1200 parts vs. my system only being able to run 300 parts? The instruction per clock difference is not enough to suggest such a staggering level of difference.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have also thought of some things that are not the cause of the performance discrepancy to rule out any armchair computer \u0022experts\u0022 giving BS answers:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMemory bandwidth/latency difference - all indications point to this not being a significant factor in game performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStorage device bandwidth/latency difference - all indications point to this not being a significant factor in game performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAMD vs. Nvidia - this literally makes no difference. Same bad FPS with a high end model of either brand of card.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinux vs. Windows - for me the Linux version runs noticeably worse allowing about 100 fewer parts than the Windows version. This is despite Linux running much faster in general.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E64-bit vs. 32 bit - no difference. 64-bit might even run slower when it\u0027s not crashing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing I can think that accounts for these problems are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Low standards - all my ships must pass a rigorous flight test included extended level flights through the atmosphere at high speeds. Cobbled together ships may be able to reach orbit with more parts and less testing. \u003Cstrong\u003EIf this is the case, I feel that misleading posts that show unusable ships should be removed from the forum to save people like myself the troubleshooting time trying to match standards that were never actually set in the first place because the person that posted the ship originally is in fact a horrible builder.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

Because that doesn\u0027t make any sense. Nobody is making you build massive 1000 part ships. Who cares if they want to make massively overbuilt and badly designed rockets. It doesn\u0027t affect you at all. If you don\u0027t want to build massive ships, it is entirely possible to go to Jool and back with a fifty part (or smaller) ship. And I doubt that KSP has slowed down to less than 50% of its old speed since whatever the last version you played on was. There have been numerous optimizations to the game engine over the years, so I suspect that the problem is on your end (maybe try adjusting the physics delta time).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xaiier","CreatedById":22833,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-17T02:11:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you have any hard evidence of comparative tests where a similarly rated Intel chip ran with 1200 parts and your AMD ran with 300?
