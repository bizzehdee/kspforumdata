At first I thought it could\u0027ve something to do with crew skills, but my engineer has lvl 3. The panels are visually not obstructed by anything, so I guess it is a bug. \n\n[http://imgur.com/a/7usNO](http://imgur.com/a/7usNO)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T23:56:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 11:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DepletedUraniumPenetrator**"},{"CreatedByName":"sebi.zzr","CreatedById":81294,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T00:01:18Z","Content":"1x6SolarPanels and 3x2SolarPanels;are no more retractable.It\u0027s not a bug."},{"CreatedByName":"DepletedUraniumPenetrator","CreatedById":113262,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T00:08:38Z","Content":"Thats... surprising."},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T00:10:20Z","Content":"Indeed, it was intended.
