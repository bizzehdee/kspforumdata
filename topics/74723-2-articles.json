That thing can take out like 5 stations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso keep in mind that you build stations in segments and it\u0027s perfectly ok to send up a missile in a single ship. To replenish missiles by the way, you have to buy another one. Also the swarm will be aloud to do a resupply on it\u0027s basic outer 4 missiles for regular cost.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-19T17:22:14Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2014 05:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by StrahmDude\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrahmDude","CreatedById":112637,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-19T17:25:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Westi29\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Westi29\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI like this idea a lot and want to be a part of it.

There is a limited number of buildings per planet that give you science, which you can use to get the money to make big things that go boom! Or ships or more science buildings. Whatever you like.
