Another common rookie mistake is to forsake transfer windows and just use more fuel to brute force trajectories\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) jool insertion. It should be reasonably cheap, a few hundred m/s at most. However, a jool insertion is not an optimized manuever either; you can get captured by a gravity assist from tylo or laythe. if your target is one of the larger moons, you can also go for direct intercept on the moon. \u003Cem\u003Ehere there are so many common rookie mistakes i can\u0027t count them. actually, navigating the moons is quite hard and takes experience.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) reach a moon. Again, not very expensive. You should lower jool apoapsis until you touch a moon at apoapsis, this will result in the lowest intercept speed.\u003Cem\u003E A common rookie mistake here would be to cross a moon orbit in a full frontal collision, resulting in a much higher intercept speed\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom what you say, it seems intercept speed is your main problem. The most important thing to know here is that the more different are your trajectory and the moon\u0027s orbit, the higher the intercept speed will be. It\u0027s like a car crash, really; two cars going in the same direction and colliding laterally will only get scratched, while a full frontal collision will be devastating. This goes both for a planet intercept and for a moon intercept. So, first image is a good transfer. in this case it was with another planet, as I don\u0027t have readily available pictures from jool. But notice how the ship touches lightly the planet\u0027s orbit, and the two are moving in the same direction during the encounter. there is still an intercept speed because the planet is moving faster than the ship, but it\u0027s a lot smaller than it would be if the ship was moving slower AND in a different direction\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022rSFIFY3.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/rSFIFY3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand incidentally, here\u0027s how a gravity capture on jool looks like. there are rules for gravity assist, the most basic one is that you pass in front of the celestial body to slow down and you pass behind to speed up, but this is something you can do with trial and error. just try to pass in front of laythe or tylo and play with the manuever a bit, you\u0027ll see.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022wKF99T0.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/wKF99T0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, about direct moon intercept. I said that you have to touch the moon\u0027s orbit with the same direction. again, example from another planet but works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSee that the ship is intercepting the moon at a time when they are moving in the same direction, and so the intercept speed is small (300 m/s)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bVEGDZ3.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/bVEGDZ3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhile here i changed things to show you how it canges if you don\u0027t get the moon at the right point; here it\u0027s a lateral collision, and the intercept speed increased to 450 m/s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022BPAK1CS.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/BPAK1CS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand here a full frontal collision, for more than 800 m/s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022zKEIAfU.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/zKEIAfU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd this is \u003Cstrong\u003Efar more important the faster the moons move\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWal orbits a smaller planet from afar, its orbital speed is only 400 m/s. The joolian inner moons have orbital speeds ranging from 2 to 3 km/s, and the difference in intercept speed for a wrong manuever will be proportionally greater.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo notice that that\u0027s only the deltaV needed for capture. For circularization on a moon without atmosphere you need to rocket brake, and there is no trick whatsoever to avoid that, you have to pay the deltaV price.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, do try it on jool. Your ship with 5 km/s vacuum deltaV can make it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S. To ensure that you hit the moon at the right time, do make a correction manuever where you burn a fraction of a m/s, or a few m/s at most, prograde/retrograde years before reaching jool. In a few years of travel, those few m/s going faster/slower will cause you to arrive a few days earlier/later, and you can use that to time your encounter to find the moons in the best position. Do perform this manuever in solar orbit once you\u0027ve already left kerbin, it\u0027s a small manuever. Then use normal and radial corrections to get an intercept with the moon you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.P.S. If the rocket has 10 km/s deltaV vacuum on the launchpad and you only have 5 left once in orbit, you are likely also doing the launch inefficiently. it should cost about 3.5 km/s on a normal rocket - unless one has horrible aerodinamic issues or somesuch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.P.S. 10 km/s on nuclear means a lot of fuel and few engines. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003Etwr\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E is really a problem. it would be easier to have a higher thrust stage to reach jool. It would also be more efficient to split that 10 km/s with some staging mechanism or using drop tanks to shed some weight\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.P.P.S.
