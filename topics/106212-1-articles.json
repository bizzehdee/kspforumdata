Where the names causing a problem in the was the game functions? If it was for neatness, why is neatness more important than giving players trouble? Sure, maybe some things might have been going to break in 1.0 anyway, but saves and craft files have often turned out more resilient than thought. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeems odd to add extra problems. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least, if we identify the parts that changed, it\u0027s relatively simple to fix.
