It looks like the parts were moved to the standard Squad Part folder. Was this on purpose or did I maybe not get a complete install (via Steam)? Any suggestions for correcting? I have well over a dozen craft I really don\u0027t want to have to re-build from scratch.\n\nAnd another question......why would Squad move the parts between folders knowing full well it is going to break every craft using them?"},{"CreatedByName":"Jarin","CreatedById":71395,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T04:26:08Z","Content":"I didn\u0027t realize that craft files referred to the part\u0027s file path and not just a part ID.

Where the names causing a problem in the was the game functions? If it was for neatness, why is neatness more important than giving players trouble? Sure, maybe some things might have been going to break in 1.0 anyway, but saves and craft files have often turned out more resilient than thought. \n\nSeems odd to add extra problems. \n\nAt least, if we identify the parts that changed, it\u0027s relatively simple to fix. Just a bit of a bother."}]}
