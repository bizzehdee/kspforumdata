Get into orbit and when you pass into a new biome, repeatedly hit the action key you assigned them to.\n\nYou\u0027ll find that you get multiple experiments back for each biome (works especially well with the gravity scanner). Normally this wouldn\u0027t be a problem, as the science goes down when you transmit return them. But it works just great for filling the MPL up with data :-)\n\nFor example, I have 4 experiments on my craft, if I hit the key quick enough I can get back 16 experiments back. I have an inkling it has something to do with the amount of time it takes for a mystery goo/materials bay to open and report back the science.\n\nEDIT:\n\nIt seems the MPL allows you to store more than one copy of a experiment/biome combo in the same place, unlike other pods.\n\nSo a really easy way to fill up the MPL to 500 data is to put one of the kerbals on EVA on the lab ladder, do an EVA report, store it, then do another, store it etc etc.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T20:51:41Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 08:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sonny\\_Jim**"}]}
