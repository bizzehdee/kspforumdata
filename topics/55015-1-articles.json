It is a thread started by our very own Harvester back in June of 2011. In it I think I remember reading that loose classes were considered at least from the beginning. In fact, the \u0022Bads\u0022 Modifier for different Kerbonauts is a carry over from that idea. It is supposed to represent pilots who are always happy when flying (That\u0027s why Jeb rarely frowns) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for if that is still the case is anyone\u0027s guess.

Orange stripe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Commander: increase the class abilities of all other kerbals in the same capsule. red stripe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Scientist: increased amount of science from crew and eva reports (not from instruments, because it would make probes even less useful), but lower speed when running in EVA, because they don\u0027t get out much. Blue stripe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Engineer: faster at repairing broken spacecraft parts (Repacking chutes, changing tires, and so forth). if it ever becomes possible to add struts in flight (for space stations and such), this would be the guy to do it.
