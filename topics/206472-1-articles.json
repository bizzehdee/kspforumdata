I had deleted them since I personally only had a use for maybe one of them and then totally forgot to put the others back in for the public release. I\u0027ll get on that once I have a spare hour or so to dig through my old installations again. The flags from the original mod download (if the old link works) should be fine in the meantime.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m a fan of GitHub (I preferentially use it for all my mod downloads) but I currently don\u0027t have an account and can\u0027t spare much time lately so I just threw it somewhere I was used to hosting files xP Also this one mod isn\u0027t likely to get any more maintenance (aside from me putting the flags back in) since the KSP code base is expected to be fixed from now on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
