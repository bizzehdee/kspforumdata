The new Skylake chips coming later this year will use an LGA1151 socket, where a haswell chip you buy today will use LGA1150. \n\nRemember that i3,i5 and i7 are just marketing terms and cover multiple generations of processors, so when you buy your new processor be sure to get a haswell or broadwell chip that uses the older socket."}]}
