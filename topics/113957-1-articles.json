I\u0027ve been using mk2 lander cans, but what I\u0027m looking for would ideally have more than one command station and enough slots for each command station to have a kerbal, the command stations/windows would be facing outwards in the same manner that the lander cans do (I don\u0027t know the proper terminology for \u0022out the side\u0022), the IVA would have those fancy MFDs that I see in a lot of mods (Raster prop monitor or something?), it would also be nice if one or more of the command consoles looked like a desk with a lamp or charts or something built onto it and a MFD (kinda like the rear seats in the mk.4 space plane mod).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for taking a look, and I would be very grateful if anyone could make something like this into one of their parts pack mods or know of a mod that has something like this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jackal40","CreatedById":77824,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T15:24:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would suggest Stockalike Station Parts Expansion \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91814-1-02-Stockalike-Station-Parts-Expansion-%2804-06-2015-bugfixes%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91814-1-02-Stockalike-Station-Parts-Expansion-%2804-06-2015-bugfixes%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use all of these parts in my stations and believe they have what you\u0027re looking for in the Command Center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
