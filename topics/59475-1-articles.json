I suggest we have finer-grained control at the lower altitudes (adding 250, 200, 150, 100, and possibly even 25), especially with a stock setup where the parachute opening carries such a drastic G-load. This would improve quality of life for heavier loads with many parachutes that may want staged openings for various purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, if I want to drop a fuel slug from a great height I may want an initial set of parachutes to open at 500, another at 400, another at 300, another at 200, and so on for a much more controlled descent without harsh parachute shocks. It would also be possible to have the initial set open at 500, another at 150, another at 100, another at 50, and the last at 25 (possibly), giving control over descent speed as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"austincurr","CreatedById":31939,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T23:39:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe a box to set your own value, or a \u002B-25\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
