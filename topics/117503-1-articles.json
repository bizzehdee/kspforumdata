But this, I went to the menu, right clicked, Release...and nothing happened. I tried switching vessels, and there were no other vessels to switch to. I can right click the Klaw and select \u0022Disarm\u0022, and it retracts into it\u0027s shell...but it still acts attached to the station, as in it doesn\u0027t float away or move. If I arm it again, then \u0022Release\u0022 shows on the menu again...but selecting it does nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe kerbal sitting on the command seat does not appear on the list of all Kerbals in the space station the Tug is attached to, nor does she show up as an EVA. I can still access her menu by right clicking her, but otherwise, she kind of doesn\u0027t exist anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
