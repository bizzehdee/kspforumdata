I tried quickloading too but nothing happened. Now twice I have had to go into the save file and manually reset the state of my orange suits to alive and get back the money and rep lost ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif). Anyone else have this? Is there a way to stop it? Is it just a bug? \n\nI cant exit to the space center either so this means I was forced to exit the game.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T01:29:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 01:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T23:20:27Z","Content":"Please see the support stickies and provide your game logs ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacecraftX","CreatedById":58769,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T00:30:36Z","Content":"I quit the game and restarted it and I\u0027m not able to replicate it.

Looks like the first problem happened when you crashed. It\u0027s also happening later. Are you, by chance, decoupling multiple pods or probe cores at the same time?\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacecraftX","CreatedById":58769,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T12:04:54Z","Content":"Yes I am decoupling 3 small pods at once.

It\u0027s an old bug, but decoupling multiple controlled ships from a single core causes this bug.
