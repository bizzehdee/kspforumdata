The system would work like this: The Vall miner would land on Vall, mine the ore and refuel itself, then take the ore up to Vall Station, where passing ships would refuel. Unfortunately I am running into some problems with my miner. The first version made orbit fine, but after converting the ore it mined into fuel so it could mine again, it only netted 20 ore (\u003Cimg alt=\u0022;.;\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E). The lander had plenty of fuel left over, and had boatloads of TWR, so I added more ore tanks. However, this version won\u0027t get into orbit now. So I decided to post here for any advice related to Vall mining: If I should go smaller, or bigger, or change the engines, or anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is a screenshot of the lander I am using:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022uIhG9Tz.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uIhG9Tz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny suggestions?

Efficiency of rocket-SSTO designs depends a lot on keeping the weight down and the Isp up. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDeciding whether or not to keep the ISRU converter on the craft is a big decision, and affects what you may find fun (or not). \u00A0If you can figure out a way to not carry around that extra dead weight, it would help a lot. \u00A0If you want to convert the ore to fuel in orbit, the most flexible setup would be to have one ISRU unit on the surface, and another unit in orbit - that way, you can top up fuel tanks at both ends, and make sure they\u0027re only sized large enough for a one-way trip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou may also want to do some number crunching and see whether it makes sense to either go the full LV-N route, or maybe do a hybrid ship with LV-N main drives, then some Poodles or Terriers. \u00A0The LFO engines which kick in only when initially lifting off of Vall when you\u0027re fully laden.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HMIC","CreatedById":138981,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-28T06:30:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/161505-ultimate-steve/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022161505\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/161505-ultimate-steve/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Ultimate Steve\u003C/a\u003E Agree with what\u0027s been said so far. \u00A0My take is to have an ISRU converter tanker in low Vall orbit, that way your Vall miner would need very little dV to get into orbit and deliver this ore and fuel to the tanker. \u00A0From the tanker you can pick up the fuel you need and take it to the station. \u00A0OR!! Put your station on low Vall orbit and use this as the tanker. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDivide the responsibility of you mining operation by using various ships and give them specific roles. \u00A0The more you do in orbit, the less dV you\u0027ll need. So you can focus on your main concern which is the mining rig for Vall. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor Mun, I have a huge stationary tanker with an ISRU, fuel and ore tanks at 10km orbit (the lower the better). If you\u0027re in orbit and will not be required to move, dV is not a factor neither weight. You\u0027re not going to move,\u00A0so the storage part is complete in orbit. \u00A0The mining rig\u0027s objective is to deliver ore to the tanker at 10km. The Mun\u0027s gravity was giving me a hard time on ascent, so instead of making the mining rig with parts to refuel itself\u00A0which in turn would make it very heavy, \u00A0I divided this into two more ships and roles. \u00A0Made a ground mining rig and an ascent vehicle. \u00A0Since the ground mining rig will not be required to go to orbit now, you can make this a huge trailer mining truck and overload it with all the refueling parts, wheels and drills may you need, and have this monster resupply the ascent/descent vehicle when landed on the ground with fuel and ore by using a Claw. \u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI only use stations for science and housing kerbals\u00A0that need pickup to go home, arrival from kerbin\u00A0or land at Mun. \u00A0This is like your airport or train station hub. \u00A0If you want fuel and ore at your station, have it tranfered\u00A0from the 10km orbit up the station, dV and weight here are not huge factors, so hauling materials should not be a challenge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s about all I can spare for this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny other\u00A0questions or comments, fire away.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank327","CreatedById":115926,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-28T08:37:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne question I have about your miner is why do you have so many ore tanks on the same vehicle that has an ISRU converter? If I remember correctly, ore is twice as heavy as the fuel it will be turned into. So why not have a single ore tank and the rest be fuel tanks and do most of the converting on the surface of vall. You\u0027ll be able to ship more fuel and be less heavy and waste less dV getting into orbit with your payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother option as mentioned is using lots of ore tanks and putting the ISRU converter into orbit on the refueling station. Then you won\u0027t have to take the 4t converter to the surface of vall and back up again. But on relatively high dV moons like vall and even the mun I would prefer only shipping fuel and not raw ore from surface to orbit because you\u0027ll burn so much of it in transport. Shipping ore around on minmus or one of the smaller jool moons is much easier and much more profitable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually I think on vall it would be most profitable to divide the operation into three parts. First, a landed miner \u002B converter that doesn\u0027t go into orbit anymore. Secondly a fuel transport that takes the fuel from the miner and transports it to orbit. Thirdly an orbital station where you can store the fuel for use. Docking the fuel transport and the surface miner together is going to be the toughest part of the operation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-28T15:31:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222545297\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138286\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461832633\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022115926\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Frank327\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, Frank327 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne question I have about your miner is why do you have so many ore tanks on the same vehicle that has an ISRU converter?

Yes, ore weighs twice as much but each ore gives two fuel (or 0.9 fuel and 1.1 ox if you convert using the LF-Ox option).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore the only consideration is the weight of tanks, the weight of engines, the weight of additional items and the fuel/ox mix you need. Mining ore and converting in orbit is best if you want to ensure the best LF-Ox-monoprop ratios, since it\u0027s hard to optimise your system in advance without doing a ton of calculations to get the right mix of tanks. However it does mean that you have to ensure your carrier has enough fuel to get up to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222543994\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138286\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461786318\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022161505\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ultimate Steve\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 hours ago, Ultimate Steve said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is a screenshot of the lander I am using:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny suggestions?
