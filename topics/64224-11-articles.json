Rockets generally have an awful payload mass ratio because of the 6500m/s to reach even the lowest possible Kerbin orbit. For the Saturn V payload capacity (140 tonnes) I need a rocket that is physically a lot larger than the real Saturn V. This is probably going to mean that single-launch x-orbit-rendezvous missions will not be easily achievable in the early game, because the launch vehicles required will simply be too large. I\u0027ll probably end up having to use a Nova-style launch vehicle for an Apollo-style Mun mission (a Mun mission in New Horizons takes almost exactly the same amount of delta-v as it does in stock despite the changes to the planetary layout, so the same vehicle can be used for either). Interplanetary missions will be even more difficult, and will probably involve several launches to Kerbin orbit for assembling a crewed interplanetary transport.
