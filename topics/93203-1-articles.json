You\u0027ve got to give the craft fins or wings at the base to place its center of lift behind its center of mass, if you want it to fly straight. It needs pivotal fins (like the AV-R8) or an LV-T45 or other engine with thrust vectoring if you want to turn easily. SAS and RCS aren\u0027t very good for turning in atmosphere but they can get the job done, too. You could just add a reaction wheel under the pod. The command pod Mk 1 only gets 5 units of torque, and your rocket is too big and imbalanced for 5 units to handle the force of the wind buffeting that thing in low atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T23:51:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOthers have hit around the mark, but I don\u0027t think anyone has hit it dead on. What\u0027s happening is that your angle of attack is very large, meaning that the airflow over your rocket is more on the side than it is on the top of your rocket, meaning you are trying to fly a large board into the wind, instead of turning it sideways so that the thin part is into the wind. This increased drag is overcoming your SAS ability to compensate, and causing your rocket to flip.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ival70","CreatedById":75336,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T00:27:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you hit this on the head, Taki.
