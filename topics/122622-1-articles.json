But I just had a terrifying nightmare, and none of the details in it related to anything I have seen the day before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe dream started out with me apparently sitting on a deck of a tall ship out in the sea. I was looking straight ahead and see my mother in front of me, talking to a bunch of people, but at the same time, she was also sitting beside me on my right side and slightly out of view, in a different dress. For some reason, my mind register the scene in front of me was something akin to a picture naturally, and asked my mother who was right next to me \u0022when was this taken?\u0022. She told me \u0022it was this morning\u0022, and then goes off grilling me about how I never pay attention and remembering thing, while her hands gesture came into my field of view, breaking a part of the scene I see ahead, where I see blue-white light in hexagon cells projected on her hand and wrist. Then the whole scene is gone, and I see straight ahead of the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It was moving straight toward a series of tiny, tiny islands near the shore, and there were people just going about on it, apparently swimmer/ beach goers. My mind was blank at that time and was just trying to process what I am seeing. The ship didn\u0027t slow down. It start going straight over the first few islands with apparent ease while people runs away from it. But as it reaches the final island, the people there were lying down, apparently sleeping/sunbathing and wasn\u0027t noticing the ship. And it ploughed right into them. I remember the ship starting to rumble and tremble, with scream everywhere as I closed my eyes and some liquid spayed on my face before the ship comes to a complete stop. Only then I noticed how loud the ship\u0027s horn was, and I was terrified to open my eyes to see what was the aftermath of what happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I woke up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, dissecting the detail and thinking about it rationally, I know there are a lot of impossibilities to make it ever a real scene. But I can\u0027t figure out why the hell my mind was constructing those images. It has no relation to whatever I have experienced recently. Where did that come out from? How did I remember it?

Your human brain will then take these babblings and attempt to transcribe them into something it understands by assigning symbols to them (situations, objects, and actions).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E You *personally* know what these symbols represent to you, so it\u0027s often possible to assign meanings to them and puzzle out the message. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The key is that your interpretation is yours alone. You assign emotions to symbols that are unique to you in your situation, so nobody else can decode it for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So at the risk of sounding overly- guru-ey, this question is one that only you can answer and you *do* have the answer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E What are the major stressors in your life? How do you feel about the symbols in this dream? How do the feelings and symbols relate to the stressors? Once you sort that out, it\u0027s fairly easy to decode the message.

I had to face the reality of an impending death sentence while trying to defend my actions and the idea that Lincoln had really been acting tyrannically in court.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Being in a universe similar to Guardians of the Galaxy and helping track down a space pirate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Having my dad visit my college dorm, except I had slept in till 5pm and, feeling sweaty, was on my way to the pool to cool off despite the fact that my dorm room was mounted on a pole above a swamp like one of those houses in Louisiana. And at the end it started raining right when I was about to leave.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A really awesome future version of Kerbal Space Program with much better graphics and terrain generation. The KSC was built spanning a fjord with beautiful cliffs and waterfalls. Oh, except that wasn\u0027t actually the KSC, that was just some government building. The KSC proper was a winnebago parked a few blocks away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn conclusion, I\u0027ve found that dreams aren\u0027t so much related to what you were doing that same day as prior experiences in general, particularly topics about which you\u0027ve thought a lot, even if they\u0027re not things you did in real life. I\u0027ve watched Guardians of the Galaxy multiple times, I\u0027ve played a lot of KSP, and I actually was feeling sweaty this morning when I woke up (that one was from today). I\u0027m not so sure about the John Wilkes Booth dream, but I suppose I do play Devil\u0027s Advocate a lot so maybe I was trying to challenge myself.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-09T17:11:04Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2015 05:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by parameciumkid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
