Sometimes when I click \u0022Revert to launch\u0022 the launch tower is placed right next to the ship being launched. This is ok for small vessels but often impinges on larger ones. There is no option to reposition the launch tower (that i have found) so the only cure is to revert to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and then launch again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is not a game breaker but is a quality of life issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
