I, too, used to be a major mod fetisher. However, until the core game stabilizes somewhat, I\u0027ve cut way back on mod usage because they have a very strong tendency to be save-killers when the game updates. At least for mods that add parts. Those that are just instrumentation usually aren\u0027t a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, a game update often requires some sort of compatibility update to the mods. Sometimes this is more of a big deal than others but that\u0027s a crapshoot. It often happens that 1 or 2 mods you\u0027ve built many ships around never gets updated at all and so kills your save, or gets updated long afterwards, and meanwhile you can\u0027t play that save. Sometimes, even if older versions of the mod still work by themselves, they will cause problems with other mods that were updated, so you can no longer use both at once. The longer a mod has been around, the more likely it is that its creator has become bored with KSP or had some real-life issue come up, so the greater chance of no or a delayed updated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, sometimes modders, while their doing the compatibility update anyway, introduce save-breaking changes to their mods, deleting parts you\u0027ve build your empire around. Or they might do a major \u0022rebalancing\u0022 of stats, so now you\u0027ve got ships in space that can no longer function as designed. This is more likely to happen with relatively new mods that haven\u0027t settled down yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, at the bottom line, you can\u0027t really trust any mod to survive a game update intact. The more mods you use, especially part mods, the more likely it is your save will get broken. This is a real bummer if you had big, long-term plans and put a lot of work into them, relying heavily on mods, and then it\u0027s all gone. Of course, if you know this is possible and accept that risk, easy come, easy go. But it\u0027s a real nasty surprise if you\u0027re not expecting it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s my caveat. I love mods and wish many of them were stock. But these days I mostly do stock-only with just a few part mods that I think are necessary to keep the game interesting for me. But I pick these carefully based on what I\u0027ve seen of the authors. I want folks I think will stay the course for at least the foreseeable future, and who have a proven record of rapid update turnarounds without introducing game-breakers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RSF77","CreatedById":88474,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-07T04:05:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI managed to have these and still keep KSP relatively stable (maybe one crash in 4-5 hours of play, provided I don\u0027t have any other programs open like firefox etc) with only 2GB of RAM and texture reduction on everything possible:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToolbar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAction Group Manager\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAKSTechnologies (some guns)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB9 Aerospace\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoulder Co active texture compression\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDMTanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenesisRage minimum ambience plugin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHGR homegrown rocket parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Joint Reinforcement\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKlockeed Martin smart parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKommit Nucleonics atomic engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSPX\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKW Rocketry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMagic Smoke Industries robotic parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModular Fuel Tanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENothkeSerCom \u0022equipment\u0022 bays\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENovapunch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProcedural Wings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESHMods (A few extra parts I liked and an interior space for the mk2 cockpit that doesn\u0027t have one)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd about 20-25 custom parts I\u0027ve made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVarious plugins and requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll on 2GB of RAM... total system RAM not just for KSP.
