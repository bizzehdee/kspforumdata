I think that in particular it makes a lot of sense to treat CSS as a sort of clearinghouse of science reports. We collect and collate, and if we reach complete reporting for a given mod then we can contact upstream about adding our reports to their next release. Whether they do or not, CSS has still added to the community. With an eye towards this it seems to make sense to add support for currently maintained mods that support biomes, but don\u0027t have a full set of reports yet. Obviously starting with the most popular, and moving to others as time/inclination allows. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, that\u0027s my two cents worth. I really just wanted to start a dialog and get a feel for what we all see CSS moving toward in the future.
