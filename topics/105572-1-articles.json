I also need to be zoomed out to see the effect of the manoeuvre on my final orbit. I need to see zoomed-in and -out views simultaneously. Zooming in and out, I find it hard to follow the effect it\u0027s having, especially when it\u0027s sometimes quite small."},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T09:23:35Z","Content":"^This. Having a zool in on your maneuver node while the main map is zommed out would be great."}]}
