When I picked up this game pre-orbital-map, it took me about 3 days to figure out orbital speeds and trajectories. As soon as I completed my first successful orbit (which required leaving your craft in flight for about an hour to make sure its perigee wasn\\\u0027t in the atmosphere (no time-warp yet!)), I was completely hooked. To this day, I think the only game I have more hours into is Diablo II, and I played that for \u003Cem\u003Eyears\u003C/em\u003E, and I\\\u0027m willing to bet, in about 6 more months, KSP will surpass that as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Buzz Lovell","CreatedById":17080,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-23T13:56:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022norcalairman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022norcalairman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Sunday night, my friend sent me an email about KSP.
