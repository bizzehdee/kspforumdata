I\u0027ve been toying with designs and brainstorming a bit while dealing with some other projects in KSP, but I figured I\u0027d put it together and get it up there this afternoon in honor of the Curiosity rover landing on Mars in a few hours. I didn\u0027t want to do it in the same ho-hum fashion most rockets are done, so I came up with a design for a skycrane style drop-off and set out to deliver the rover to my Mun base near an arch. On a side note, this thing went entirely untested save for the fact that I had previously run a mission with a drop pod style vehicle, so I knew roughly how much the radial thrusters on the skycrane could hold, and how much fuel they needed to slow down. The only thing I really tested was making sure the skycrane decoupling and \u0022take off\u0022 went smoothly, and I did that on the launchpad. Anyway, onto the slideshow!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CZ5xL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CZ5xL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went with a Soyuz style launch vehicle from the KW Rocketry pack. The fairing is also from the KW Rocketry guys and houses the Gulliver rover - this thing is massive, but the payload only takes up about half of the vertical space of the fairings, but there were no options to use smaller walls. The second image is of the delivery vehicle making it\u0027s Trans-Munar Injection burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NVmHl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NVmHl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere we have Gulliver jettisoning its fairing capsule and activating the thrusters on the sky crane delivery module. I was landing on the dark side of the Mun, but thankfully the cart I used as the rover base came equipped with headlights, so I could see the ground approaching as I got close. It was still somewhat difficult, but I managed it on my first go. I didn\u0027t bother getting too close to my base (and the base itself is 3km away from the arch, which is why I decided to send a rover to them) as I wanted to test out the rover\u0027s stability. It\u0027s a bit top heavy and touchy, but I was comfortably rolling at 20m/s, at times getting up to 30m/s when I knew the ground was flat. Going up the edge of the crater I slowed to 10m/s and the rover handled it pretty well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NSIYO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NSIYO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s two photos of the sky crane ejection process. It decouples from the command pod and simultaneously activates four radial boosters which burn for 20 seconds, I got them from Captain Slug\u0027s Assorted Hardware and also used them on my drop pod style vehicle, which I\u0027m still working on, though have posted an album on reddit if you also visit there. It goes smoothly and gives you something interesting to look at as the only boosters that suited my needs in terms of strength and time were \u0022anti-roll\u0022 boosters, so they power at an angle and spin the sky crane away like a firework.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8vByP.png\u0022 alt=\u00228vByP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, a few photos just showing the progress of the trip to Methodios Base Alpha.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, it was a fun build and a fun flight.

The more people that watch, the more people we know are interested in space and science and might spark some interest in redoing the budget.

I\u0027m more of a fan of just having parts capable of doing a variety of things and putting them together in different configurations myself rather than having pre-built or modular stuff. I still take the parts from the Kosmos command pod and throw them on other craft, along with the stuff from the Thor and Odin landers from the NP pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the stuff for the base, I use Kosmos for it. The only other pack out there that you could really use for space station/base construction is the BACE pack, but I\u0027m more of a fan of the textures of Kosmos and the variety. It comes with a lot of parts, but the station body components are all under the scientific and utilities tab to make finding them easier. I normally rename all my folders when I download packs to work with a sorting system I have to make finding parts easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for launching and landing, I pretty much just throw it on top of a big rocket and tie it together with struts. I also take the time to calculate how much weight is on each side and do my best to balance, usually trying to get within .1 KMU of each other. Here\u0027s an album of two other things I\u0027ve built with Kosmos: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/Fry3Y#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/Fry3Y#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first three photos are of KLOSS IV (Kerbin Low-Orbit Space Station) and the last three are Nebo Orbiter which is circling Mun, so neither are equipped to land. Nebo is also using the centrifuge from the Deep Spack pack. In the case of landing Methodios on the Mun, it basically comes down to good balancing. I don\u0027t have any special kind of engine on it, it\u0027s just a 175 thrust engine from NP I believe, and I stuck two of the RCS blocks from Kosmos (normal RCS has a thrust of 1, the stubby ones from Kosmos are 3 I believe) on each of the long ends and landed it like I would anything else. Each side of the base has landing gear, so there\u0027s 4 legs in total. Nothing besides some good piloting and keeping it balanced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI put a bunch of extra fuel on my bases/orbiters/space stations because I like them to arrive at their destination with as much capability to move as possible, both RCS and liquid fuel, so I\u0027m allowed the luxury of an extremely slow descent in the case of the Munar base. I don\u0027t really have to worry about picking it up and moving it (though I could, I probably have enough fuel on board to get back into orbit around Kerbin and return to the Mun and land again), so I just take my time, keep it upright, leave RCS on and listen to some chill music.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wildkittyv1","CreatedById":30893,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-06T00:26:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI totally forgot I had a mediafire account already and I went ahead and uploaded the .craft file for Gulliver and the part.cfg for the smaller crew tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou still need the other mods to make the craft work, and I apologize if it\u0027s a lot but I enjoy experimenting with my builds and mixing and matching parts. It\u0027s a bit unstable at launch, but that\u0027s an issue with the 3m - 4x1m KW rocketry adapter and the engines - launch quickly or else it will break apart on the launch pad. If you take the engines off and go to the pad, you will see that it doesn\u0027t break apart, so it\u0027s not an issue with how I built the craft.

It\u0027s a standard rocket with enough fuel in the second stage to get the rover/sky crane setup to the Mun, establish orbit, and slow down to descend vertically. It has enough to also slow down during the vertical descent, which I used, and that\u0027s why the fairing ejection is vertical instead of horizontal - I dumped those at about 4km up, landed on a 1.2km high area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, after the fairings get ejected, you activate the retro thrusters and just slowly descend as you would with any other landing vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1tija.png\u0022 alt=\u00221tija.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe descent thrusters are the bigger ones on the outside. I was originally going to lower the craft and drop it, but it was too dark to really see, so I just touched down. After descending, activate the next stage and it simultaneously decouples the sky crane from the command pod and activates the smaller thrusters you see in the picture. Those bring the sky crane safely away from the command pod and you just drive around with it as usual.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not much different from a regular lander except that I put a decoupler on top of the command pod, attached a fuel tank to that, then attached two plane structural fuselages to mount the boosters on and give clearance past the rover. The thrusters that get activated along with the decoupling are SRBs, so once they\u0027re activated they burn for 20 seconds and give you plenty of time to get out of the way. I think they went up to like 5km or something like that before falling back down.
