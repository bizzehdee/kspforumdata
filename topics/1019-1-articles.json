(Clones are cheap but feeding them till they are old enough to be exploded launched into space is expensive.) When I land my crew module sometimes explodes for no apparent reason although the parachute deployed and slowed the module down to the usual 12m/s. It seems to happen when I land on the night side of Kerbal (or maybe just too far away from the launch pad).\n\nIs this a feature, a bug or am I missing something (like the landing area... ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif))?"},{"CreatedByName":"Darrknox","CreatedById":2513,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-25T19:03:30Z","Content":"Some areas on Kearth are instant splodes.
