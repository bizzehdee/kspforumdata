I\u0027d bet many of the most active members here have been playing for over a year and have mastered most of the challenges the game throws at the players. And now they approach the game thinking on new challenges. In the meantime, there are often threads in the gameplay forum about people who can\u0027t land in the Mun, or are running out of money - as well as a lot of people who don\u0027t want to do maths to play a videogame.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe answer to this is simple: difficulty sliders. And KSP can provide real difficulty sliders instead of \u0022play against an AI who cheats more or less depending on the difficulty\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, while I don\u0027t have a background in rocket engineering or space sciences in general, it seems that some of the demands of \u0022realism\u0022 are rather \u0022gameplay I like\u0022:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELife support:\u003C/strong\u003E LS isn\u0027t just a few new parts with snacks and other new resources which deplete over time - a clockdown timer, if you will. LS for a manned mission to Jool or Eeloo requires living space, serious radiation shielding and artificial gravity. The latter which is accomplished by spinning the ship against a counterweight such as an expended stage. And realism would also require tackling the radiation issue. The idea of a trip to Mars which would expose the crew to more than a year of radiation has been discarded by NASA because it would expose the astronauts to an unacceptable cancer risk. \u0022Total\u0022 realism would have to deal with it. Does a Duna manned mission end with Jeb undergoing cancer treatment?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESSTOs:\u003C/strong\u003E They would have to be impossible without Rapiers. Forget all the discussion about how jets are represented in the game. An aircraft that carries the weight of jet engines and fuel plus liquid fuel rockets and their fuel and achieves orbit without dropping anything is unrealistic. A spaceplane carried to the upper atmosphere by a carrier aircraft and refueled before injecting itself into orbit is, OTOH, more realistic, but also requires changes in the game as we can\u0027t currently fly a detachable spaceship while also returning the carrier aircraft to the airfield. Now, question, are players who like SSTOs and realism willing to forget all about non Rapier powered spaceplanes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECommunications:\u003C/strong\u003E Correct me if I\u0027m wrong, but my understanding is that NASA manages their interstellar probes from ground based communication facilities. Remotech might be fun, but my understanding is that it\u0027s not required for realism at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETimescale:\u003C/strong\u003E expending more than an hour of realtime in landing a spaceplane isn\u0027t fun. Heck, current 10 minutes long burns aren\u0027t fun and, specially regarding ions, they aren\u0027t realistic at all. Me thinks part of this should be handled by a \u0022Ion burn warp\u0022 or something that works in the background (as ion engines are supposed to burn for months) and some sort of pre-run of physics before a physics timewarp: basically, if your ship is sound and wouldn\u0027t break apart during a 10 minute burn, the game should calculate that before hand and let you do a 10x physics warp without tearing the ship apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOrbital construction:\u003C/strong\u003E part of what makes KSP fun for some people are the bizarre contraptions that can be put in orbit. A decent aerodynamic system, which is needed, will require fairings and cargo bays. Now, here\u0027s the catch: some things (rovers, bases, space stations) won\u0027t fit well inside fairings or cargo bays. That\u0027s why the ISS was assembled in orbit, why some habitats might be inflatable and why stuff like larger rovers could be shipped in parts and assembled in the ground. However, that requires a better docking system which doesn\u0027t wobble and some KAS/Infernal Robotics analog which allows in situ assembly and disassembly. On top, we have multiple launches. Some players might find launching a lot of standardized rockets which work perfectly over and over as something fun. Some other players do not. As Sid Meyer said \u0022a good videogame is a succession of interesting choices\u0022. Putting standardized rockets with standardized payloads in orbit isn\u0027t a succession of interesting choices. Maybe a \u0022skip to orbit\u0022 ala hyperedit would have to be added if the same kind of rocket was already put in orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKER, MJ and docking aids:\u003C/strong\u003E landing, docking and construction aren\u0027t done by eyeballing. Realism also require additional information, docking cameras and navball aids, landing and aerobreakes calculators, delta-v information and probably other aids I\u0027m forgetting right now. This actually makes the game easier and less daunting. New players would know from the beginning if the rocket they are making can make it to orbit or not without having to check the wiki and downloading mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPayload ratios:\u003C/strong\u003E KSP rockets, despite using heavier fuel tanks than real rockets and weaker engines, allow for a greater payload. Realism would need to cut the possible payload. Which means less stuff in orbit, which means less fun.
