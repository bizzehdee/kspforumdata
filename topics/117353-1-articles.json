The mass of it is the most important thing you want to know about it. You need to attach enough parachutes to it, so that you can land it safely. As FancyMouse says, you want to use the Claw part to attach your parachutes to the object. You also need a rocket to get it into space, but that should be straight forward for you by this stage.
