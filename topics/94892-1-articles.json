I setup a wide orbit comms system that always points to the active ship and the ships I send look at it with their long range systems. Then after my correction burns just prior to SOI change (from Kerbin to Kerbol) 2 of the 3 stopped reporting any orbital data...it all was just blank in the MechJeb displays. The third ship remains fine. I\u0027ve done an exhaustive check of the comms network and all appears fine...I\u0027ve tried \u0022active ship\u0022 pointing and specific ship pointing (multiple antennae on the relay) and nothing is helping. The fundamental issue is that those 2 ships which are no longer showing position/orbit data also act like they aren\u0027t in comms with Kerbin. It\u0027s like they don\u0027t know where they are. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt really looks like a non-RT issue since it\u0027s not an issue of just no comms...the ship doesn\u0027t seem to reflect that it\u0027s in orbit - but it clearly is. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have another test ship that is deep in space without comms and it still shows orbital data. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat ever happened to these two \u0022lost\u0022 ships is something I haven\u0027t seen before - and I\u0027m completely baffled because it seemingly random. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have experience with this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMod List (all as up to date as releases allow):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbalAlarmClock (3.1.1.0)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransferWindowPlanner (1.2.2.0)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScanSat (8.1)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E000_toolbar (1.7.8)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBetter Atmospheres texture pack\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActiveTextureManagement\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEVE 7-4-LR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDistant Object Enhancement (1.5.1)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETextureReplacer (2.1.2)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngineerRedux (0.6.2.11)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb2 (2.4.1.0)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFerramAerospace (0.14.5.1)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDockingPort Alignment Tool (???)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScienceAlert (1.8.2)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHyperEdit (1.3 for KSP 0.90)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemoteTech (1.5.1)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProcedural Fairlings (3.10)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help/guesses/hints are welcome. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers, mike\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-29T22:05:55Z\u0022 title=\u002212/29/2014 10:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by m_j_lyons\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Emore data\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
