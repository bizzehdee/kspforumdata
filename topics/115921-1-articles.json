You decide which shape your probe is to have (square, hexagonal, piano-shaped, you name it), and you decide how wide and tall it should be from the context menu. The top and bottom panel would then be usable for surface attatchment for science parts, fuel/RCS tanks, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a quick mockup of what I have in mind:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XzcBeJ1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XzcBeJ1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
