I don\u0027t know why but it just doesn\u0027t seem practical / feasible and kind of annoying to deal with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Allow the O2 candle to be a Tweakable setting. If it\u0027s adding weight to a pod I should have the option of throwing it out if I need to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3A) How would people feel about expanding this mod to include internal crew temperature, something I don\u0027t think has been tracked by any life support mod yet? It always did bother me that a manned capsule has zero energy demands despite all the electronics within that would be needed to remain operational, much less keep a Kerbal alive and warm. The only issue with this I can see is causing some problems with early game crew power demands before you unlock extra batteries, but this is assuming you use antenna transmissions, which you honestly really don\u0027t need to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3B) Internal temperature would be affected by outside temperature. Capsules are insulated so obviously it would take quite some time for external temperature to reach the inside (Apollo 13 went three days without heaters and was kept above freezing just by the body heat output of three men... albeit barely). Climate control would be a simple on/off toggle. Temperatures below the comfort level would require some amount of power to counteract, temperatures higher (ie: near the sun) would require far more power to reduce the temperature. Heat generated by the air conditioning could also be generated as \u0027WasteHeat\u0027 and used on Interstellar mod\u0027s radiators. If you need to save energy, you can turn off the climate control and leave your Kerbals in some discomfort for a while (though it\u0027d be nice if this had some impact in-game... the only thing I could think of is delayed crew reaction (ala RemoteTech\u0027s signal delay) but that might be \u0027too hardcore\u0027).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3C) Power could also be added to Kerbal EVA suits to operate climate control and their lights, though it\u0027s my understanding spacesuits don\u0027t really use heaters but instead use coolers because of the tight confines and high level of activity / exertion in them. Power would slowly trickle-charge from the craft\u0027s power stores, but would be one-way (ie: you can\u0027t charge your ship with your suit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) I think there should be a minute or so of \u0027leeway\u0027 when running out of O2 before Kerbals die. I accidentally misclicked and turned off O2 and they instantly all died which was fairly annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Kethane integration?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) In all honesty I do prefer the Ioncross method of CO2 / O2 handling, but Ioncross is no longer supported, has some broken features, and is missing critical things like real-time tracking of all vessels. This mod works, has real-time tracking and a nice (albeit pretty oversized) interface, and isn\u0027t TAC with its hideous and massive containers and food requirements, so I\u0027ll take this over that.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-02T00:05:07Z\u0022 title=\u002201/02/2014 12:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Frostiken\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-01T23:57:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can easily add electrical drain to a capsule with a generator that provides negative ElectricCharge\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frostiken","CreatedById":1837,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T00:00:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starwaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starwaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou can easily add electrical drain to a capsule with a generator that provides negative ElectricCharge\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking for something a little more dynamic than that though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brooklyn666","CreatedById":88321,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T00:06:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat about the possibility of resource transfer the same way fuel can currently be transferred in game?

Aside from having to use the much slower radiative cooling instead of atmospheric conduction, how would that seriously differ from how a conventional air conditioner heat exchanger works? Things that use freon as a coolant can go decades without needing to be recharged. An air conditioner only needs two outside things - an unbelievable amount of power and some sort of medium to discharge the excess heat.
