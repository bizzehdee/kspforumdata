As I\u0027m a big fan of skimping on thrust to allow for a high-efficiency setup, this sometimes have dire consequences: For example, when I am arriving at some foregn planet, the first thing I normally do is to lower apoapsis to a decent orbital insertion. I then place a maneuver node at the apoapsis for insertion. Too many times this has resulted in the burn time jumping just when I think I\u0027m starting the burn at the right moment, and with very little thrust applied way too late, this normally results in either a very inefficient insertion, or no insertion at all (flying by, leaving the SOI before I manage to turn around).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo today I simply don\u0027t trust the maneuver node burn time estimation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question then is: Seeing as I know the TWR of my ship, and I know the deltaV that I need to burn, is there a quick and dirty way of calculating how long the burn will be? It doesn\u0027t have to be acurate and account for increased TWR during, due to fuel being burnt. Just acurate enough to give a ballpark estimation so that I know if the ingame number is correct.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T12:08:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck out \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/18805-Can-someone-give-me-the-formula-for-burn-time-in-seconds-based-on-fuel-units-ISP?p=252635\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post252635\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis post for an in-depth explanation\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically you calculate the total burn time of your engine for the amount of dV you need then using the time to periapsis as your zero point divide your total burn time in half, at that gives you the amount time prior to your node in which you should start your burn, in this case your Periapsis. When your time to periapsis is that number execute your burn and you should be good to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother option is to perform a \u0022test burn\u0022 where, when you get close to your maneuver node (But still far enough away for it not to matter) you go full throttle (Or whatever throttle you will be using) for a moment then cut your engines to reset the burn time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T12:22:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should be able to calculate both the mass flow rate of propellant (given in engine stats in tons/sec) and the amount of propellant needed to produce the required dV (rocket equation).

Weight is trickier. You can get the *current* mass of the ship but as you burn fuel, your mass is dropping, so your TWR grows. Just look at stats of the Kickback SRB: Full - TWR 2.85. Empty: TWR 15.18. If you assume the burn doesn\u0027t use up any significant amount of fuel you can go with current mass.
