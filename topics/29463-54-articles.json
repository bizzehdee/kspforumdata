It could crew three, and was driven by two nuclear rockets. It could land on Duna without parachutes and had enough dV left to SSTO and return to Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had just recently discovered and started using mods, in particular the nice streamline fairings from KW. Now to fit those long nuclear rockets inside the fairing they would have to go under the lander, but to do a stable landing, they had to go on the sides. Infernal Robotics provided some nice hinges that allowed those rockets to stow under the lander for launching and fold out to the sides for landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was simply stunning to see the launch and deployment of this lander - ballet in action.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo when Jeb, Bill and Bob arrived at Duna - some two years after launch - those nuclear rockets wouldn\u0027t fire. I\u0027d forgotten the #@@#! fuel hose! The poor crew had to circle Duna for another year before they could return to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI immediately added and tested the offending fuel hoses, and also made a few other minor changes. I immediately sent Jeb, Bill and Bob on their way again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, they arrive back at Duna. They fire up the rockets, and - NOTHING! Those minor changes ended up cutting off the fuel hoses during the complicated unfolding of the rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI eventually did get a crew to Duna and back using this lander, but it wasn\u0027t Jeb, Bill and Bob. In fact, the crew that finally made the landing passed Jeb and co. returning to Kerbin on the next launch window to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still feel guilty for making Jeb and friends sit in a capsule for years and never actually getting them to Duna; but at least I got them home alive.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-13T12:14:43Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2014 12:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by boostme\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mistake Not\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6","CreatedById":81669,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-14T05:49:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom a while ago - my high-altitude Eve atmospheric explorer.

The probe, already suffering from a design flaw of fuel shortness, used about a third of its fuel entering a usable orbit. It soon became apparent of a much bigger flaw- the SCANSAT radar installed weighed much, much less than the single RTG on the other side. In other words, the probe would enter an uncontrolled spin whenever I throttled it up beyond about 30 percent. Even MechJeb couldn\u0027t get it under control, and I was forced to shunt it into a Laythe orbit to get any data at all from it. The probe did not have the fuel for a polar orbit, so it could only map the equator. A \u0022Jool Explorer II\u0022 is in the works, and I have plans to deorbit the Jool Explorer into Jool when it arrives, but it only has 31 units of fuel left to do so.

So I built a retarded mothership based off a design I had previously made in .23. It featured a central core with 4 nuclear engines and a Jumbo-64, an Apollo-style command module, and a single-Kerbal lander. It suffered from fuel shortages, and the lander touched down with hardly any fuel left. Jeb had to complete orbital insertion with his EVA pack. The mothership was nearly out of fuel due to my inefficient transfer (tried to not use MechJeb, failed miserably), so the command module boldly made the burn home, safely reaching Kerbin after a very stupid ordeal where I decoupled the command module by accident, leading to a reload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I made a space station, which got its solar panel (yes, only one) torn off by a poorly-built Progress freighter replica, made with HGR, that was making MechJeb go apesh*t.
