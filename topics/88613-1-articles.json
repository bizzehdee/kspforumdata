However, I was unable to grasp on one idea )or even a video game) for long enough to actually get it running. This happened for a variety of reasons, but I finally found the most important one: I was always running down the road alone. I had no motivation, no support, no sense of responsibility. This time, that I found KSP, I have decided to not let this happen again. This time, I\u0027ll make my ideas true.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, this is my first try: The KRASH Project. It is actually meant to be a variety of mods, whih will initially revolve around the main concept described to the name. It\u0027s gonna start with working out actual kinetic energy deconstruction and stop literally everything from exploding on contact, then start making things actually meant to explode (yes you missile lovers, I\u0027m looking at you), then branch to many different categories.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, I\u0027m not just presenting my ideas here. I\u0027m sure that there are other wanna-be modders out there, waiting for a way to fullfill their dream. We can get through this together. Or maybe you\u0027re just a veteran modder who gets intrigued by the ideas we will slowly present and develop here, and wants to lend a hand. Or even yet, you may be just a loyal space explorer, who wants to fill what he thinks of as gaps in the gameplay and brainstorm us with fresh ideas, or criticise constructively our ideas as they gradually come to life.

However, I\u0027ll publicly say this: that is just an array of progressive features, not all will be pulled of a tthe same time. Start off by disposing of parts without explosions, then geting good detaching, deformation, etc. We don\u0027t need to find the most efficient execution by the firs time too; sometimes, those things can -and should- work on a trial-and-error policy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit :whoops, I accidentally refused your request.

In all honesty, I think you are starting with the wrong foot here. I understand that you want to work in a team, I really do, but since you are so inexperienced (by your own admission), it\u0027s just going to be a waste of energies that will divert time from actual learning / working, and just give you more problems than you need to have while you are still trying to begin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModding this game is hard, because you work at a very low level. In fact, it is an absolute necessity that you know your way around C#, or at least any other object-oriented C-derivative language, if you are going to write even the smallest plugin (and judging from your post, you\u0027ll need to): long story short, you will have to study and learn to use some tools.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this stage, managing a team is just going to be a huge PITA: you\u0027ll need to define roles, find an agreement on the smallest details of all the work you are doing, and most importantly set up your workflow so that it allows you to work without stepping on each other\u0027s toes. This last point is going to be very hard if you are not comfortable with the git workflow on your own. Additionally, working with other beginners is not going to help you: you will both just inconvenience each other\u0027s learning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, my personal suggestion is to drop the \u0022team\u0022 idea: it\u0027s just going to be a huge overhead that solves a problem you don\u0027t have yet. Take a look at FAR, for example: it\u0027s one of the biggest mods here, and it has *one* developer, no team. B9 has just 3. I advice you to work on your own for a while until you are comfortable with the process, before you look into having a team.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-30T18:19:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree entirely with Ippo; he\u0027s made some excellent points, particularly about how to get started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy way of a little encouragement though, please let me recount my story in KSP modding so far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn June this year, I had never used Unity or GitHub, written a single line of C# (or anything other than some school level C), or made parts for a game of any kind. I thought programming was something I would never be able to do, and didn\u0027t have a brain wired the right way for it. With a little determination, help from the incredible community here, poking the assembly browser in visual studio, literally stacks of googling my way to Unity and KSP info, and 4 months later I\u0027ve written an entirely plugin for wheels, tracks, landing gear, landing legs and host of other things, as well as produced a load of new parts that it drives. You know what? Along the way, people have collected into a sort of team that each contribute with testing, texturing, model making; just about everything. It\u0027s really, really cool working with them, but would never have worked if I\u0027d gone straight out asking for that. I just didn\u0027t know enough to be able to do anything effectively, let alone steer a bunch of people.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy advice (if I may be so bold) would be to pick up the tools, get some learning done and start creating.
