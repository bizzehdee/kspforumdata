Have to be in low orbit to avoid the mesh hitting ground (though they\u0027d be set to diffuse after a certain distance to minimize out-range casualties), and need rapid updates of nearby satellites/ships to avoid hitting them. The up side is it would super heat the target way beyond re-entry heating to reduce any package into small enough debris that re-entry would deal with the rest (at Kerbin at any rate. Other planets are another matter! Duna\u0027s atmosphere would likely be too thin to absorb much so some small debris would get through)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe full constellation would likely be well over a hundred mini-sats, but only a group of the nearest ten would be needed per mesh instantiation. They\u0027d need a very good comms and detection network to plot the incoming weapons fire, but given that they\u0027d be pretty effective, and individually would be small target and difficult to lock on for counter attack. In close range attack however the individual weapons wouldn\u0027t pose much of a threat to any ship, and their armor is non-existent.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-24T18:14:36Z\u0022 title=\u002201/24/2014 06:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Patupi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nianor","CreatedById":85763,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-31T22:09:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mekan1k\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mekan1k\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is a good design you can think up for defending against a kinetic-kill orbit-ground projectile?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you want to protect a certain area?

Well, the SWARM likes orbital bombardment, and lazor targeting, so what we need is something to take out their ships (which act like kinetic-kill weapons due to their gravioli engine acceleration rates) as they are on inter let courses.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nianor","CreatedById":85763,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-01T22:02:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo defend with a craft that is in space, equip the targeted craft with a crapton of tiny SRBs with EVA seats and some sort of high power explosive on them. When the SWARM attacks, fire them all. It will appear, to their targeting scanners, like the ship turned into a small armada of ships. It will be nigh-impossible to pick out the right craft. And it also will destroy the SWARM ship if it picks the wrong one. To defend from the ground, if the SWARM have docking ports, dock a massive areobrake to them, or if you have KAS, attach it to their ship directly. If they enter the atmosphere, they will have a hard time gaining enough speed. They will also no longer have their thrusters aligned with the center of mass, and therefore lose control. If you need more practical solutions, respond.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-02T02:57:53Z\u0022 title=\u002202/02/2014 02:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by nianor\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
