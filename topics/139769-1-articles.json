I even downloaded KAS so as I could see if it was the wobble that was getting me, but it wasn\u0027t and now I dont know what to do. Every time I accelerate the ship starts spinning everywere. also ive made sure that the other engines are off, and I went through and tried all kinds of combinations of which reaction wheels should be on\u00A0so those cant be the problem. It does have the prograde and retrograde marker backwards dont know if thats related, anyways I\u0027ve now built two different designs and have the massive very expensive ships in LKO but am unable to take them anywhere at all. I can give the design if needed but it really simple, its just a poodle with a rocko\u00A0x200-32 then some expirements and I\u0027ve got the lander ready to attach but I really want to figure out how to steer the damn thing. any help is appreciated.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-14T21:16:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe won\u0027t be able to offer any help without seeing the craft.\u00A0 Could be any number of things.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA backward prograde/retrograde marker is usually an upside down probe core or you are controlling from a docking port somewhere instead of your intended module.\u00A0 Right click on the probe or command module you want to control from and click \u0022control from here\u0022.\u00A0 If that doesn\u0027t fix it, the probe may be on upside down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-14T21:18:49Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2016 09:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Venusgate","CreatedById":125730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-14T22:10:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout seeing anything, I have a suspicion your load isn\u0027t balanced, and you don\u0027t have enough SAS to keep things steady.

If not, remember that two parts will generally only connect at one point, so those couplers are probably only linked at one corner. That may be the source of your problem, because it will tend to flop around violently under any kind of acceleration. If you zoom in close and carefully increase the throttle, you\u0027ll probably see that the two tri-couplers are flexing through one another in flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe probe cores are another possible source of oscillation. It\u0027s a bit better, since they\u0027re centered, but they\u0027re also quite small compared to the rest of the stack, so they could also be a culprit. A set of struts bridging the gap might help that, too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the record, multi-docking is terribly tricky. If you don\u0027t have the alignment perfect, and I mean pixel-perfect, it won\u0027t link more than one of the ports. Even if it does, the docking ports get bugged half the time, so be sure you never want to undock again. You\u0027re almost always better off just using a Clamp-o-Tron Sr., or even just a regular C-o-T and a gentle hand on the throttle. Of course, there\u0027s also Kerbal Joint Reinforcement, which makes your rockets look and feel a lot more like professionally engineered spacecraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-17T04:54:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2016 04:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Aubri\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
