I think that would be a great idea for KSP. For example, what\u0027s the deal with Bill, Bob, and Jeb? What about the monolithis? There are several runes on Kerbal and some of the moons, How do they fit into the story? There a giant crater on Kerbal that must have gotten someone\u0027s attention. What\u0027s up with that. What about the island base and the other one that seems to be deserted except for the radar working. And the SSTV signal on Duna needs some explaining as well. This could be a way your could add a fourth dimension to the game besides just sandbox and career and funds.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-05T21:04:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDefinitely not very high on the priority list, but some sort of brief \u0027history\u0027 behind the other\u00A0(apparently) kerbal made sites would be a nice touch. \u00A0Not sure about the monoliths and crashed ufos etc though, I think they may be best just left a mystery\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GluttonyReaper","CreatedById":59429,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-05T21:04:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI personally like that there isn\u0027t really any set story in KSP, gives us room to make our own. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the SSTV signal, there is some kind of (never-implemented) story behind it:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/3vvjushy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pastebin.com/3vvjushy\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Spoilers, I guess?

They could add an option for Story. Also, I like the idea of \u0027cut scenes\u0027 and they could even use existing videos Squad have on YouTube. You\u0027re right about it not being for everyone. But, using the modes that currently exist aren\u0027t for everyone as it is. That\u0027s why there\u0027s a choice when you start a new game. Remember back in the day when you\u0027re only option for a new game was Sandbox mode? I\u0027m not saying this is something that needs to come out in 1.1 or even 1.x. It was planned by some of the developers very early on in the development of the game and was put on the back burner when it got as busy as it currently is.\u00A0But, I\u0027m just saying this is something that could add another dimension to the game and possibly attract new players and increase revenue for Squad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-06T20:33:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is going to sound a bit dumb but whether somebody would find\u00A0Story mode fun to play will probably depend on how much of an appetite they have for reading. The reason I say that is that KSP isn\u0027t particularly interactive. Outside of building and launching rockets and landing kerbals (or probes) in specific locations, there\u0027s not a lot the player can actually do to influence a story or move it forward. So a Story mode would probably need to be bit like an old style real-time strategy game, where you have discrete missions with cut scenes between them to tell the story. Cut scenes would be a lot of extra work for Squad, so a story mode is more likely to become a series of missions interspersed with chunks of text.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m honestly not sure how well it would work and I say this as somebody who\u0027s written a fairly extensive backstory for KSP which could probably be boiled down into a series of missions for an\u00A0in-game story, starting from sub-orbital flights out of\u00A0the\u00A0Tier 1 space centre (or conceivably, the Barn if that ever makes an appearance) and going all the way through to a very definite reason to do major interplanetary missions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-06T21:42:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not keen on the idea of an overall \u0027play through story/campaign mode\u0027 similar to what we get with CoD etc. (If that\u0027s why the OP is suggesting) as I think that could just be too limiting. \u00A0But I can see the value of a few short story type \u0027sets\u0027 of connected missions as linked tutorials.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-06T23:54:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel like this has come up and the general sense I got was that Squad was pretty happy to let players create their own stories.
