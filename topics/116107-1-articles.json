MechJeb crashed my rockets, if I fly them, they started to bounce and went on a endless spiral. I was like, \u0022what the hell? do I have to quit playing?\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then I started to read stuff in here about it. I found that for example, for airplanes which was my biggest problem to make them working efficiently on the old model, fly pretty much well now, I started doing cool things with simple plains that I could not do in the old model. In any case my biggest problem was making rockets fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be honest, after so many tries and building different rockets configurations, I found out that has nothing to do if my rockets were huge or small, it was all about TWR and lifting control surfaces. I hate putting wings on rockets, but, in the lower stages they help a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy trick for any rocket I do is to put control surfaces in several key points along the rocket to get more stability on the ascend. I use those wings that act like elevators (cant remember the name now but they can be used for tail fins on airplanes) I put 3 or 4 of them symmetrical on every lowest part of the rocket last stage. Lets say if you have a 3 stage rocket, you have 2 sets of control fins. SAS also helps a bit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also so started to use Kerbal Joint reinforcement mod too, just because I hate struts. Have in mind I did used struts in the old model but now, I want a rigid rocket that does not look like a spiderweb full of struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVelocity on ascent is key, if you go to fast you burn due heating or you never make to orbit due to drag and spending more fuel. Control your vertical velocity. Until you past over 15 to 20 km altitude try to stay in the 350/ms after that just punch it (still many times you do not need to go full throttle to get into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still use the trick 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00AA but in different altitudes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1Km, I give like a few touches to get the rocket inclined, not just much, like 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA. This avoid any booster or so to damage KSC. Half throttle or less depending on your TWR. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5km I give like more 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA, usually until I get into around 20km I try to avoid getting into the 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA degree angle (some people might disagree with this or even find that is less efficient) then after 30 to 40 km I start accelerating and lower my angle of attack, many times I do not even stop since I start turning to make circularization right on the ascend, or if I have lots of fuel to spare then I do a orbit nod and go from there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter so many frustrating attempts to put a rocket into orbit with the new aero model, I came to find out that is pretty much more easier now then it was when back in the time of: lauch, 10km, 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA, orbit almost no fuel lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes now I adapt old rocket configurations because I get into orbit with way too much fuel then before.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-26T14:58:12Z\u0022 title=\u002207/26/2015 02:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"longbyte1","CreatedById":17521,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T14:49:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis sounds like a nice question to put on \u003Ca href=\u0022http://gaming.stackexchange.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EArqade\u003C/a\u003E, and I\u0027m sure you will get some decent answers.
