Real motors used on launchers are not, for the most part, like KSP motors: they generally do not have throttle ability, and are not used to fine-tune the orbit. The booster delivers the spacecraft into an approximate orbit (which is generally pretty good: they can get within a few dozen m/s of the desired velocity), and then the spacecraft itself will do the fine-tuning with much smaller motors, making course corrections as needed. Most launchers will not put a satellite into a geostationary orbit: They will put the satellite into a highly elliptical geostationary transfer orbit and let the spacecraft maneuver itself into the final orbit. This is true of interplanetary launches as well: The launcher will get the spacecraft headed in approximately the right direction, but multiple course corrections will be needed during the cruise phase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow about launches like Curiosity\u0027s? Do you know if that was ever in any sort of orbit around Earth or did they launch it directly into an escape trajectory?

So the values that are currently the ones at level 0 is what they should be at all times but at the moment they can be set to be super overpowered by increasing the tech level up to 7.
