Whilst you do need to provide the source code, you are free to use any license that allows the viewing of source code. In particular, you could use, say, a CC BY-NC-ND license, which means that other people can only download and share your code \u003Cem\u003Ein its entirety\u003C/em\u003E as long as they credit you, and they cannot create any derivative works (i.e. nab pieces of the code for themselves), or use it commercially. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssentially, as Ted mentioned in one of his threads, the source code publishing is a protective measure. Even if someone publishes a completely bogus source code along with a virus, it is much easier for people to notice that said source code is not doing anything resembling what the plugin says it will do, than for people to spend a lot of time working out what just gave them the virus. People are not going to go to all the effort of coding a mod and \u003Cem\u003Ethen\u003C/em\u003E adding a virus to it - they will either just bung some random code/gibberish in, or they will go to a game which doesn\u0027t require code-publishing and have a lot more success with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, a few other points,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Magnet_man16\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Magnet_man16\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EThey say mod development is slow and not as many are being developed as they would like.
