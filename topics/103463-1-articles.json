(i know that buildings such as the Administration building, Mission control etc. were locked by default in Sandbox mode). \n\nWhat\u0027s even weirder is that i couldn\u0027t time warp and i couldn\u0027t go back to the main menu (well basically it froze again, and then again and again and again and i repeated the same process(close and open the game again)).\n\nI need help, has this ever happend to you people before and did you solve it?\n\nIf so, tell me why this happens and how to solve this.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-05T18:28:24Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2015 06:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Candlelight**"},{"CreatedByName":"GiantTank","CreatedById":113180,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T20:40:26Z","Content":"[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105651-KSC-Buildings-Lock-Up-Can-t-Click-on-Anything-Firing-Kerbal-Crashes-Game](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105651-KSC-Buildings-Lock-Up-Can-t-Click-on-Anything-Firing-Kerbal-Crashes-Game) \n\nIf you have fired a kerbal, try that.
