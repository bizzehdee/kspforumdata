Maybe they would be activated / highlighted by pressing Alt (or another key combination). I think it would speed up gameplay.. not having to move the mouse and click everything, constantly going from parts to the PM menu. Most OS and app menus use this system, it\u0027s very efficient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is what I\u0027m talking about:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022mjQhl.gif\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002247.06\u0022 height=\u0022184\u0022 width=\u0022391\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.stack.imgur.com/mjQhl.gif\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
