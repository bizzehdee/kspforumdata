Somehow though, I doubt it.\n\nI\u0027ve worked professionally with Canons since the 90s (still have my 35mm body... too sentimental to let it go), and you are correct that the earlier ones were atrocious for white balance. I was simply pointing out that virtually all cameras have their sensor issues.

I\u0027ve always shot the first photo with the white and grey white balance cards so I have my temperature, then the next photo without. I then use my photo of the cards to get my balance (usually in photoshop), and apply the adjustments to the subsequent ones (because I don\u0027t ever trust my digital cameras... a hold-over from my days of pretentiously working exclusively in black and white film).\n\nThat said, I would have liked it if someone took a photo of the rocket next to something called a \u0022ruler\u0022 which has things called \u0022measurements\u0022 on them so we\u0027d have an actual sense of scale. At 200 bucks for the large, a banana for comparison isn\u0027t going to cut it.
