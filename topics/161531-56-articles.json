I like this mod a lot. It enables me to build big starships and take them places. In a straight line. a 1000t starship does NOT like to turn. Why? Torque. What is torque? Force times distance. Distance isn\u0027t a problem - ship is big, I can put RCS ports far from the CoM... force, however... then I thought, \u0022wouldn\u0027t it be grand if I could get RCS ports that operate like thermal rockets and can route thermal power from my antimatter reactors to produce RCS thrust?\u003Cp\u003EI suppose though I could just clone the RCS stock part and have it consume chargedparticles as well as monopropellant and give it higher ISP and more thrust?

I know for sure I need to keep the WarpPlugin/Resources/ScienceDefs.cfg that defines the experiment and the WarpPlugin/Patches/science.cfg that adds the FNSeismicProbe module to the seismometer, but past that I don\u0027t know. I used a program to open interstellar.dll and saw that it contained a module related to impactors, but I don\u0027t know C# so I couldn\u0027t gather anything specific there, and even if I also include interstellar.dll with the two configs it still doesn\u0027t function. Also, there doesn\u0027t seem to be anywhere in the configs that actually removes the stock seismic experiment and replaces it with the defined Interstellar experiment.
