I was tired and so maybe I\u0027m just missing something obvious. I orbited the MobileLab and EVA\u0027d two kerbinauts into it, did some laboratory work and I couldn\u0027t figure out how to get them outta there. It\u0027s like it ate them, their little pictures don\u0027t show on the ship, right clicking the kerbal eater gave me nothing. I think this is a ploy to feed Kerbals to some psyhco machine. I had to get to sleep, so left it at that and went to bed. This ship wouldn\u0027t survive re-enty with that mammoth attached, so am I doing something wrong? Hep me please!
