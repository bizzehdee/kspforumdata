From here, experiments/data are some inputted into the lab (I assume by either right-clicking and hitting \u0022store experiments\u0022, or by having the Kerbal enter the lab, but clarification on this would be nice). The lab can then \u0022process\u0022 the data, which allows the player to get a certain bonus to the amount of science (how much?) for the given experiment/data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow then, along with the aforesaid questions...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Are there any limitations to what can be \u0022processed\u0022/Can anything that yields science be processed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Can the processing be done multiple times?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-If you land the lab, can experiments be recovered from it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechnicalK3rbal","CreatedById":86903,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-15T03:19:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnything that gives science can be processed any number of times, but it\u0027ll give less each time, and no, because the whole point of the lab is to not have to recover the experiments.

One, it reduces the amount of science lost due to transmission. If you turn in the experiment after analyzing it, you get the same amount you would without the analysis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second purpose is that it allows you to reuse the goo containers and material science labs. Without the lab, if you transmit the results of either of those, or take the results from the part, the part can\u0027t be reused.
