The central axis of the ship is held together with 3 of the standard size FusTek CBM docking ports, no struts or quantum struts. It\u0027s not very aerodynamic and I use FAR. Will this stand up to aerobraking?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I hear a 50km orbit is what I want to end up with. I would rather do the aerobraking gently over the course of several orbits than do it all at once. I\u0027m not that interested in saving fuel, just learning how to do it and what effects it has so I can plan to use it in the future. What\u0027s a good periapsis altitude to shoot for?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. At what point during the process, as my apoapsis comes down, should I start panicking? I mean, I want it to come down, but I\u0027d like to know in advance how much and how fast is good and how to recognize when things are going badly wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. The front part of the ship is a MapSat probe intended for Ike. It has about 2500 delta-V and needs to end up in a 185km polar orbit. Is it better to release this on the way in or after I\u0027ve achieved LDO with the mothership?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GJames","CreatedById":58866,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-30T16:46:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a pretty well put together craft there, quite a lot of RCS though! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I don\u0027t personally use FAR, but Duna\u0027s atmosphere is quite thin, especially up near 15km, so it should be fine (If anyone who does use FAR could elaborate that would be appreciated). \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I think for Duna you want to aim for about a 15km periapsis, though it does very much depend on your velocity as you arrive. 15km should get you at least in some kind of orbit, or very close to one so a tiny burn should be able to capture you. Once you\u0027ve done this adjust your periapsis to something between 30-40km, depending on how far you want to bring your orbit down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA 50km orbit is quite low, as Duna\u0027s atmosphere starts around 41km. When aiming for such a low orbit, it\u0027s usually best to do the last bit using only rockets, just to be on the safe side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. You should probably start panicking if you get captured before you\u0027ve reached your periapsis, but as it seems like you have a decent amount of fuel. you\u0027ll probably be okay as long as you don\u0027t get caught out by it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. 2500km/s dV is plenty, so you could release it after your in a stable orbit, but you could also release it a couple of weeks before you get there and give it a little boost so it gets there a few hours before the main craft. Up to you I suppose, first option is safer, second is a bit more interesting... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately there is no hard and fast rule to aerobraking so remember to quicksave first... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-30T16:50:04Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2013 04:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by GJames\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Richy teh space man","CreatedById":12511,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-30T16:48:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf your using mechjeb 2, then go to the landing autopilot and there\u0027s an option on there to show your predicted orbit after aerobraking. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to your questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 Should be, F5 and F9 if it doesn\u0027t work\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 See above on mechjeb 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 Just needs practice..

If you looked at the various launch vehicles shown in that album, you\u0027ll note they\u0027re all built like arrows, long and skinny with lots of tail feathers. This is pretty much a requirement for rocketry with FAR. Being so long, they have HUGE moments of inertia to pitch and yaw so until you ditch the ascent stage, you need LOTS of RCS to maneuver at all. This is especially true to aim prograde at the apoapsis burn when you\u0027re above the atmosphere and all the tail feathers become useless. I\u0027ve found through much trial and error that a good rule of thumb is that for each big stacked tank in the ascent stage, you need 4 RCS on each end of the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the bigger rockets in my pictures have 8 RCS on both ends. That requires a lot of RCS fuel, and the payloads needed some themselves for docking anyway. Thus, I need 2 RCS tanks, 1 on the ascent stage and 1 on the payload. I design my ascent stages to reach orbit with just a bit of dV to spare, so once I\u0027m up and stable I pump any remaining mono into the payload before staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe benefit of doing things this way is that you can reach LKO with rather less than 4000 dV on the ascent stage. But OTOH, the long tall rockets run you into the ceiling so your payloads have to be short, and also in fairings if they\u0027re too lumpy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-30T18:30:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry this: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alterbaron.github.io/ksp_aerocalc/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://alterbaron.github.io/ksp_aerocalc/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-30T19:03:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Johnno\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Johnno\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETry this: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alterbaron.github.io/ksp_aerocalc/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://alterbaron.github.io/ksp_aerocalc/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes that work with FAR or stock air?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-30T20:02:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EComing from Kerbin, a 13,000m pass at Duna will drop you into an orbit with a periapsis of about 40% of Ike\u0027s orbital altitude.
