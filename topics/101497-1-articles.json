After I manage to fix it, a few days lat4er it reoccurs. I have installed Astronomer\u0027s Visual Pack and followed the instructions to the letter, which instructs in what order to install the mods, including EVE city lights and clouds. I have the aurora working. In the clouds mod I see a second ghosted layer which seems like you are cross-eyed. They are awesome mods when working and I believe I did something wrong. I will reinstall Astronomer\u0027s Visual Pack and eve again to see if these items are fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
