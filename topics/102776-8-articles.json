Is it necessary for ATM to function or is just to finetune the interaction with NH to get better looking results?\n\nIt might be something to do with the way kopernicus utilises rings, but they appear really distorted with ATM, unlike how KopernicusTech has no issues. Took me a while to figure out what was happening before i added the fix. It\u0027s not the ideal solution, but optimisation is top of my to-do list for next update (I was more focused on getting planets terrain fixed and making it stable). At the moment with the fix ATM shouldn\u0027t be compressing any textures for my mod, which is not the most ideal situation as my mod is very hungry for RAM, in the next update, I\u0027m hoping to rearrange things to negate this and allow ATM to compress the texture maps too.\n\n[example of ring distortion](http://i.imgur.com/jGM6UZy.png)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m sorry, this is a noob question, but how does one get to aptur? Mechjebs\u0027s transfer calculater does not work with it, and i cannot do a normal transfer because of its inclination and proximity to kerbin.\n\nit\u0027s not too hard, i usually get the transfer for about 750 delta-v from a 100km kerbin orbit...easiest way to do it is wait till both kerbin and aptur are are their ap/peri then burn respectively to shift yourself into a encounter. At it\u0027s ap/peri, Aptur is at the same level as kerbin so if you time your maneuver correctly you don\u0027t even need an inclination change, as with most planets you just need that patience looking for the right window to burn...keep trying bro, you\u0027ll get it!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-21T09:20:01Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2015 09:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KillAshley**"},{"CreatedByName":"KillAshley","CreatedById":128696,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T08:08:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Titanus, what a big beautiful planet!
