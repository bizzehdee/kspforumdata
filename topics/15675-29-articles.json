Squad were trying very hard to get down to a month an update, but some of the code that has gone in has been very hard to get working and debugged and took longer than they wanted.\u003Cp\u003EI suspect that updates will become more frequent once all the underlying code is in and they are just adding gameplay and content - things like new solar systems, new planets, new missions and so on - and applying bug-fixes.

I hope we can get a first person view from their helmets so we can go on exploring other planets in first person, this would be more of an immersive gameplay experience, walking around looking for your landing site and trying to find your rockets again. This would be amazing because you now have to know precisely where you\u0027re landing, and you can\u0027t just land anywhere you want any more on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have to land where you set up base! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really think it would be for the best of the game if they take away the orbital view when you\u0027re landed and added a third person (close view) or made it first.
