It can be decreased slightly if you launch directly into rendezvous orbit. Then there is another mission that would be insane past Mun or Minmus, and it is completely based upon how much delta-v and accelleration the ship has. Brachistrone transfers are essentially point-and-click orbits. You keep accelerating halfway, then turn the other was any slow down. The transfer time is based upon how quickly your rocket accelerates and if it has to shutdown its engine partway to conserve Delta-V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be really cool to see someone do an Eve flyby or orbit without using the map view. They\u0027d probably need DistantObjectEnhancement so they could see it from a distance.
