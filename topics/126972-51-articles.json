Or my PC screwed up. Or Dropbox hiccuped or somesuch, because when I loaded up ye olde forgotten space program earlier this week\u00A0the Manganese 3 wasn\u0027t at the M\u00FCn. Neither was the Iron 2, which I found orbiting Kerbin.\u00A0\u0022Weird,\u0022 thought I, \u0022that I would have left this here.\u0022 I sent it to a nearby abandoned fuel depot, filled up its tanks, and then wondered where it came from. I was about 99% certain I had sent it to the M\u00FCn with the Mn-3, and it was in my notes as such, but ultimately I had to go back and check these mission reports\u00A0to be sure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s when I discovered the Mn-3 was gone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, I have no Kerbinly idea what in tarnation happened, but apparently the persistence files from where I launched the Mn-3, rendezvoused it with the Fe-2, sent both of them to the M\u00FCn, and then docked both with the Pequoni 2 never made it to Dropbox. Or got overwritten by something. Those missions were flown well _after_ the Vall landing, so it wasn\u0027t a matter of F5/F9 that killed them. They just disappeared.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t done anything since that mission that would have bene lost, so I launched another Mn-3, rendezvoused it with the actual Fe-2, Alt-F12 hyper-edited both to the M\u00FCn (the game or the universe cheated me, it\u0027s only fitting I cheat it back just a little bit),\u00A0and put them back where they belonged.\u00A0Or I started to. Once I had the Mn-3 docked to Pequoni 2, the Wiggles arrived. The same Wiggles that drove our merry band of kerbals off of\u00A0Kelgee station.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe good news? I know exactly why Kelgee and Pequoni were\u00A0acting up:\u00A0Persistent Rotation. The bad-ish news? I have a very good idea\u00A0why Persistent Rotation was doing it (confirmed through experimentation)\u00A0and I don\u0027t see a good way of fixing it. (It\u00A0appears that PR is trying to rotate each vessel by its Vessel ID, even when said vessels are docked to other, already rotating vessels... resulting in multiple parts of a compound craft attempting to rotate against itself.)\u00A0So I uninstalled it. Pequoni 2 and Kelgee are back to their normal, serene, non-twisty\u00A0selves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know when or why that behvaiour started, if it\u0027s a result of a change in KSP or not, but I have other fish to fry and it\u0027s really not that critical of a mod for me.

Anyway, the computer aboard the Sulphur 5 will be sending our mission reports from Vall. You should already be receiving the complete reports for the rest of the mission from the Jumble of Parts.

Probably also what caused ... this. We\u0027ll continue looking until we find him or run out of supplies. It\u0027s cold out here, I won\u0027t abandon a kerbal.

I\u0027ve provided as much information on these forgotten kerbals as I have. Talk again soon. Over.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRosuki and Macfred had been trading messages for several hours now. The distance between Jool and Kerbin was enough for a signal delay of about four minutes. Add in the distances between their communications satellites, the time it took for the ships at Jool to save and copy the messages, the delays while the Sulphur was out of satellite range, and other such vagaries of physics, and it was often more than fifteen minutes between messages. Fifteen grueling minutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRosuki had been elated to find her wayward team again; she was almost giddy when that first reply came in. That giddiness lasted until she pressed the play button and heard the news. Thomlock gone, zapped up by some mysterious energy beam. Lost without a trace, as Macfred had reminded her in every message.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then there were the \u0022forgotten\u0022 kerbals. She recognized a few names on the list, the crews one of their previous programs had sent to Eve and Duna. The others were completely unfamiliar, none of them part of Elite\u0027s old cell. They had sent a message to this base Macfred mentioned, the Edge of Infinity, but so far had received no response. Not surprising - sometimes the forgotten wish to stay forgotten.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack to Vall. It was dangerous for them to stay at this ice castle, another one of these bursts could occur at any moment. Who could blame them? This was Thomlock they were talking about, the famously dead kerbal that had trained most of their pilots, the kerbal who had designed the first aircraft to fly on Laythe. She probably would\u0027ve kept looking for him too, but from what Macfred had described of this energy beam there was little reason for them to continue and all the reason for them to leave. She was about to send the order to pull back when Hercas, their new chief radio operator, knocked on the radio shack door.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ma\u0027am, you asked me to inform you when we found Jonbald.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe glanced over her shoulder, headset held in her hands. \u0022Where is he?\u0022 She needed answers from Jonbald, and she needed them now. The events of the last two days were timed too well to be coincidence.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022He\u0027s in his office. Landed with two new kerbals just a few minutes ago. He sent for you, said something about preparing a launch.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood. Macfred could wait. He was a smart kerbal, capable enough to have continued on in the dark all these years, the loss of Thomlock not withstanding. She left the headset onto the radio and set off across the space center. Did she have a plan of attack? She knew the first question to ask, but how would he respond? And how would she respond to that? What if he ignored her question and smiled, as he usually did?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDespite having worked with Jonbald since her earliest days in the space program, he was still an unknown to her. Unreadable, unshakable, mysterious. All the strange things they universe had thrown at them, from the shadow corporations trying to replace their pilots with robots, to the malicious governments that sought to use them against their own people. And through all of it, Jonbald had presented himself in that same calm, cool, collected manner. Almost as though he expected everything and anything, greeting it with his smile and a nod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe had always responded to him with the same demeanor. Thought of him as a peer and as an elder to learn from. Perhaps that was her mistake, trusting that he would appreciate an equal. Or perhaps he was just oblivious to how the rest of the world saw him. No, this was no time to experiment with a different tactic. She burst through the Jonbald\u0027s office door and marched up to his desk, doing her best to appear angry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ah, Rosuki. Do come in, take a seat. I\u0027d like to introduce...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I know who they are. Wernher, Gene.\u0022 She paused to smile at her two familiar yet alien coworkers, seemingly reborn from the ashes of memory. It was amazing, really, and one of the completely unexplained phenomenon they had to live with, how these kept reappearing. She wondered briefly if Jonbald knew why, but that wasn\u0027t the question she intended to lead with. The anger returned to her face. \u0022Why did you block comms with the deep space crews?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022To protect you from them.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat... wasn\u0027t one of the answer she had played out in her head. \u0022What?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe smiled and raised his hand to stop her. \u0022Perhaps we should discuss this another time. As I was about to say, Gene and Wernher are to be the first crew of our new rocket, the Nickel. I had the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E prepare their craft before I left, and it should be nearly ready to go. If you would be so kind, please accompany them to the flight preparation room. It\u0027s quite a nice bird, I promise, and should resolve our little difficulty.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher perked up at that last word. \u0022Vaat little difficulty? If there is something gersplunkt ve need to...\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene interrupted. \u0022I still don\u0027t understand why you\u0027re sending me to space. Us to space. I\u0027m supposed to be in Mission Control. We have crews in the field, crews we need to bring home. He\u0027s supposed to be in the science hall. How can we do our jobs if we\u0027re in orbit?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey both railed on about these minutia, each debating why they needed to stay on the ground. Jonbald only smiled, his gaze never leaving Rosuki\u0027s. \u0022I think you\u0027ll find they remember more than you might expect, Miss Kerman.\u0022 Perhaps it was better to wait. To continue to play along with Jonbald\u0027s game, whatever it was. She smiled back, a so very fake gesture, and led her two old bosses to their new spaceship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWooden Nickel\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt its core the Nickel is a very simple spacecraft. Jonbald had cooked it up from older designs, designs recovered from the data stores \u00A0left on the M\u00FCn. The two-seat capsule rode atop a very simple two-stage launcher, the LV-12 Tango. Developed originally for the low-cost tourist market, the Nickel would be their resource-strapped agency\u0027s answer to sending crews to orbit. At least until such time as they could resume flying Titanium shuttles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs Jonbald requested, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E crews had set about preparing the first Nickel. The pieces of the craft were built by the time they arrived at the crashed UFO, assembled in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E before they reached the North Pole, and mated to the crawler before they made it back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Fully automated (again, its intended use was in the tourist industry), the Nickel would be more than capable of delivering its two passengers to any station this side of the M\u00FCn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf the two, Wernher had been the most difficult to prepare. He was insistent on wearing his eyeglasses, even in the capsule, which the pad technician Guenter would simply not allow. \u0022No, you will see what you see when you see it,\u0022 he would say, \u0022Guenter is always right, you will see.\u0022 Eventually he snapped Wernher\u0027s helmet on and smacked the top of it. \u0022Good luck, you need it.\u0022 Afterwards they were sealed in the capsule and the rocket began its slow trip to the launchpad. Rosuki slipped out and made her way to Mission Control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170508_0003_ni1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022601\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170508_0003_ni1.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170508_0010_ni1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022603\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170508_0010_ni1.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe craft was airborne sometime later. Rosuki had Mission Control running like a fine watch or a well-oiled metaphor; she was almost hesitant to turn it back over to Gene. Sure, he knew exactly what to do and when to do it, running missions as though programmed for it. Yet she had doubts his Mission Control had ever run as smoothly as her\u0027s was now.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKoffee sprayed into the air from one of the trenches as the first stage cutoff caught the booster officer off guard. The call of \u0022second stage ignition\u0022 came gurgling through the headset just a few moments later, followed by the subdued laughter of the other controllers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYep.

They made an adjustment to the ascent program, increasing the Ni-1\u0027s target apoapsis so that Transfer One would catch up to it. This mistake meant the rendezvous would be at night, not that they would have it any other way. Half of the interesting things in her space program had always taken place in the dark, as was only right and proper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRosuki could hear Wernher\u0027s voice in her left ear, the famous rocket scientist ecstatic over his first trip to space. \u0022Never had I dreamt I would swim amongst the starlit dust. Vundersh\u00F6ne.\u0022 She wondered what he was seeing, or if he was even seeing anything. With his eyesight as bad as it was and with his glasses stowed safely away it was hard to imagine. Couldn\u0027t be more than blurs, halos, smudges of light. Unless.... Knowing Wenher he had probably snuck an extra pair of spectacles into his flight suit. Contraband. She could ask, but why spoil the occasion?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene was handling the play-by-play, by far the most level-headed of the two. He wasn\u0027t beyond an occasional exclamation, offering an occasional \u0022wow\u0022 or a mysterious \u0022I should\u0027ve done this years ago.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTen minutes after reaching their zenith they performed their rendezvous burn with Transfer One. The second stage was spent, now discarded into a trajectory missing the station. With that done they turned final approach over to Transfer One and to Tetris, who was waiting at one the remote operator console aboard the station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170508_0023_ni1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022567\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170508_0023_ni1.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170508_0028_ni1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022601\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170508_0028_ni1.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs it turned out there was one small problem they had not anticipated: The Nickel was equipped only with the smaller size docking ports.
