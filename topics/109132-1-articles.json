It\u0027s the animation/event engine for EVAs that allows you to run events like becoming ragdoll, jumping, or even letting go of a ladder. I suggest looking at the source code of the [Follow Me](https://github.com/MarijnStevens/EvaFollower) mod. Even though the mod is from 0.25, the code still works though."},{"CreatedByName":"tg626","CreatedById":112361,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T14:49:00Z","Content":"Excellent!
