It\u0027s the animation/event engine for EVAs that allows you to run events like becoming ragdoll, jumping, or even letting go of a ladder. I suggest looking at the source code of the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/MarijnStevens/EvaFollower\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFollow Me\u003C/a\u003E mod.
