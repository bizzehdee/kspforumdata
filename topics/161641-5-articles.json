Seems like Squad updates semi-annually so probably then. Maybe Take Two will speed it up, probably so because they want that DLC to roll out as soon as possible. Probably going to price at $19.99 then roll out the micro-transactions.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile I won\u0027t call you a cheapskate (hell no point in not asking, because if TT breaks the agreement (if there is any written contract anyway), in which is totally able to do so, and I would think Squad would be powerless to enforce it, a lot more of these \u0027petitions\u0027 will spring up, from the ones who will get it free despite that they would gladly pay for the expansion.) if you really need a DLC that amounts to some historical parts, and what is basically challenge mode integration, then I think you reached your maximum amount of play time you can withstand (1.3 update was disastrous as retention update, as it basically added nothing for current KSP players that didn\u0027t need localization, and bug fixing isn\u0027t really a feature more than it is mandatory. Compared to 1.2 which added a huge feature that added dozens of hours of feautres). You really don\u0027t need the DLC because it won\u0027t be much, there are plenty of mods that can cover the historical parts. Squad is hyping it, especially the mission builder, but all I think it\u0027s just scenarios with an editor, it will probably lose it\u0027s novelty.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe\u0027ll have to see what the integration of KSP into TT will do to the game. Personally, I think the deal was the reason 1.3 was a \u0022localization\u0022 update because TT wouldn\u0027t accept KSP as an English only game, so Squad basically halted all features that speculated to be up coming, then they sold it off.\u00A0 Honestly, after the main developers left, I don\u0027t really have a strong attachment to it anymore, those developers gave me all of those hundreds of hours of fun time, but they are gone now, and I doubt TT is going to provide that same value. Personally, I think TT is going to hire on all the major modders, which will make them strain on updating their addons, slowly and graudally wither the modding scene away. Hopefully, I am wrong.

Compared to 1.2 which added a huge feature that added dozens of hours of feautres). You really don\u0027t need the DLC because it won\u0027t be much, there are plenty of mods that can cover the historical parts.

No company would have bought it at that moment for \u0027a good price\u0027 from SQUAD back then with FTE still in the picture and no foresight of it getting better. No company would want to buy it when it had \u0027open ends\u0027 that only brings work and trouble. So they first needed to ditch FTE and get a new port by a respectable company in the works. In the mean time KSP development went in to \u0027maintenance\u0027 and \u0027added resale value\u0027 (localization) mode so to make it, A. more attractive to TT, an B. to get as much money out of selling it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThese deals are not made in a few weeks time, the terms were probably set long ago, there just had to be some work to be done before they could make it happen.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother reason that might have contributed for SQUAD to sell the franchise is the vocal and demanding \u0027community\u0027 which needs/needed constant attention.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBest outcome for them is a entirely new game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot \u0027a\u0027 new game, \u0027many\u0027 new Kerbal franchise games, that\u0027s where the money is.
