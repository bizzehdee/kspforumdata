In my opinion (I\u0027d like to think it matters, I do science for a living after all), the science system is pretty flawed, and I can offer up some of my expertise to improve it in a mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo keep this short, we would need the following things to make this happen:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModeler/texturer to create scientific equipment parts (and a new lab).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomeone much more adept at coding than I, to be able to implement the system, as I can only do rudimentary coding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETesters as well!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you guys are interested, please reply below (and if you\u0027re able to help), and I\u0027ll type up some specifics and post it later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(to hint at what I\u0027m thinking about, is a modular science system, where a barebones lab is unlocked initially. As you tech up, you\u0027ll unlock new scientific equipment that you will then be able to outfit to your lab. more scientific equipment on your lab you lug around = increasing scientific value without returning to Kerbin. There will be much more to it that this though.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease reply if interested!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
