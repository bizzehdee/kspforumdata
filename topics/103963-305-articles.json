Earlier in late 2018 I released a rebuilt version that takes advantage of Kopernicus 1.5.1\u0027s \u0022Change My Kerbin\u0022 feature, which lets me use a different stock world as the template for the home world. When I do things this way, it preserves that world\u0027s easter eggs; you can find the Face on Homeworld Duna, or the cave on Homeworld Tylo, for instance.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I uncovered a frame rate problem with more complex craft, however; anything greater than 100 or so parts will cause a severe frame rate drop. The physics ticks become slower than a 1/4 second, and time slows down to two real-world seconds per game second.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E This didn\u0027t happen with previous versions of Alien Space Programs, and it also doesn\u0027t happen if I build the home world using the Kerbin template, use removeAllPQSMods = True, and build the home world from \u0027scratch,\u0027 using data from KittopiaTech. When I do this however, I can\u0027t add that world\u0027s easter eggs back except for monoliths.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **Here\u0027s where I ask about Scatterer**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I narrowed the frame rate problem down to Scatterer and no other add-on. When I remove Scatterer, I get the same frame rates regardless of how I build the home world. This includes adding \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E and a heavy particle count configuration like SVE. When I put Scatterer back though, the frame rate severely drops when I build the home world from a non-Kerbin template, and returns to normal when I build it from scratch. The frame rate drop ceases during on-rails time warp, either landed or in low orbit.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E What I want to know, is if I can change something in how I\u0027m building the home world that would avoid the Scatterer frame rate drop and still preserve that world\u0027s easter eggs.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **To reproduce the problem**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Since Scatterer\u0027s latest KSP release is 1.5.1, use KSP 1.5.1, Kopernicus 1.5.1-x (either -1 -2 or -3), and Alien Space Programs 1.5.1. Get the Scatterer release for KSP 1.5.1. Eve seems to be the easiest place to reproduce the problem, so set the home world to Eve and put a 100\u002B part craft on the runway or launch pad. On my Intel i4770 CPU plus GTX-1080 graphics I get a frame rate drop to below 15 FPS when I do this. To restore the frame rate to \u0027playable,\u0027 replace Eve.cfg with Eve.full-cfg from the [ASP 1.5.1 project site](https://github.com/GregroxMun/Alien-Space-Programs/tree/master/GameData/AlienSpacePrograms/Eve). You can remove and re-add Scatterer to test Eve.basic-cfg and Eve.full-cfg to observe the frame rate difference.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **Suggestions?**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Is there something I can do in my Kopernicus configuration to improve performance when Scatterer is used?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Part of my thought process is how the home world still needs to be named \u0022Kerbin\u0022 internally, at least at first, and use cbNameLater to rename it. It appears Scatterer keys its atmosphere settings on the cbNameLater value, but I wonder if it\u0027s trying to draw Kerbin\u0027s and Eve\u0027s atmospheres at the same time.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I also have a Scatterer patch file in ASP that renames any configuration for Kerbin to use \u0027Bin\u0027 instead, which is what non-homeworld Kerbin is called internally. Cheating a 100\u002B part craft to \u0027Bin\u0027 regardless of how \u0027Bin\u0027 is built gives me the same decent frame rate.\n\u003E \n\nCheck your log for issues, look in the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.

I had some extra planets and wanted \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E and scatterer to add the visual enhancements. Problem is, after installing scatterer, my frame rate tanked, even at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E scene, and I was stuck with a permanently yellow timer.

I\u0027d really like to give scatterer another chance, so if anyone can offer any suggestions I\u0027d be very grateful. The only weak spot on my system I think is the graphics card at the resolution I\u0027m running, but it\u0027s coping well with all the other mods installed.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks\n\u003E \n\nFirst off, that is quite a big resolution to run on a GTX 1050.  \n\nUnlike what [@Gameslinx](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/144828-gameslinx/) said, no a GTX 1050 is NOT enough to handle today\u0027s games at 3x1080p, unless you make some trade-offs, that is almost 4K right there. IMO you would be fine if you disable the ocean shader or lower its settings.  \n\nSecondly, a GPU not keeping up doesn\u0027t cause in-game time slowdown (yellow clock), that has to do with CPU or other bottleneck, I would suggest to check your log for any error spamming, I suspect you have a nullref spam and have the mod misconfigured or conflicting with another mod.

However I don\u0027t think the underlying issue is scatterer - more how the rebuild kerbin is applied. I noticed that it doesn\u0027t lag at night. Try timewarping to night - your FPS should jump right up.\n\u003E \n\nNo this is not ridiculous, 70% GPU usage at 4K with a GTX 1080 sounds exactly right. If your GPU is not pegged at 99% all the time then it\u0027s oversized for the task at hand. What is this night lag issue?
