It\u0027s a bug you have to work to exploit. Since KSP is not a competitive game against other players, there\u0027s no incentive to squash bugs that do not negatively effect gameplay. An exploit, by definition, is a circumvention of game rules to gain an upper hand on an opponent. Since KSP has no opponent (Well, I play adversarial kethane wars with my friend but that\u0027s about it, no orbital war like some people \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Ezekes . . .\u003C/span\u003E), there is technically nothing to really be gained. KSP is a game with a lot of roleplay opportunity, so the choice to use the technology (and KrakenDrives are some really precision engineered devices, I\u0027ve tried and struggled to make them) is entirely up to the individual and I personally believe that as long as the bug powering those drives does not interfere with normal, non-bug-exploiting gameplay, there is no reason or benefit to take the time to fix it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022megaprime13\u0022 data-cite=\u0022megaprime13\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOne does not simply,\u003Cp\u003ETame the Kraken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow many times has Squad tried and it still lives?
