Try removing KAS/KIS (\u003Cstrong\u003Ebackup\u003C/strong\u003E save, but also don\u0027t go to any vessels with parts added by those mods installed), and check the performance then. If the issue vanishes, then I suggest posting a report on the mod\u0027s forum page according to the author\u0027s reporting instructions (Following those instructions is extremely helpful to the mod authors and may get you support more quickly). If not, try to isolate the mod that may be causing the problem, otherwise there is not much that can be done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
