Or at least I\u0027m assuming this mod broke the rescue contracts... I\u0027m currently using mainly the mods quill18 is using in his newest let\u0027s play and everything worked fine before installing these: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5atq9K1.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/5atq9K1.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat sounds like a serious issue. As a matter of fact, I just experienced some myself, with KAX propellers not working and the fixed \u0022long-leg\u0022 landing gear resulting in my plane weirdly bouncing off the runway as if gravity was hacked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI currently have no idea what the problem is with either of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI checked the HRB again, but I found no problems at all and it was not changed in the last versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022long-leg\u0022 landing gear was not changed by me at all, neither was the KAX propeller (except for the unlocking tech).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould you upload a screenshot of your GameData folder and your ContractPacks folder?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you very much for the info on quills mod pack, I m very much looking forward to seeing him with with KSP!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rofltehcat","CreatedById":145224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T23:49:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGameData folder: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/EhdiBfB\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/EhdiBfB\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t have the contracts part of this mod installed, though it looks pretty nice.
