Leveraging heavy exploration into resource exploitation would be a good way to go about it. Course this approach would need some precedence and that\u0027d be hard to find, but its space exploration so duh.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yes, I have found myself advocating for trashing the Solar system because screw that nonsense. Or at the very least the Moon anyway. Natural heritage my foot, lets open up the Farside to Manifest destiny.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSame with asteroid exploration. Initial exploration could yield great scientific results, but explore far enough to find a (relatively) easy to mine source of rare elements, you pay for that heavy exploration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
