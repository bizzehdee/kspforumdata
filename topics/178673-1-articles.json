By a goddamn tad bit of twenty kilometers. Jebediah did not know what had caused it - a problem with the flight automation computer, or a problem with himself. Two and a half bottles of lager were not exactly the best breakfast for a reconnaissance pilot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLieutenant Jebediah Kerman coughed. There was blood. A broken rib - or two, or three. Doc would have a hard time stitching him up again, if he would ever be saved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DCrap.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe was supposed to land on the Derideaz Airfield, just south of the border, near Semigor. The northernmost tip of Taheireaz, the last bit of the free world, almost completely engulfed by the moloch of the Medwedian border barriers. He had clearly seen the barbed-wire fences, the minefields, the endless hangars, the tanktraps\u00A0and the watchtowers flashing below him in the last seconds before the crash. The tinnitus of the impact now made way to the distant ringing of alarm bells and barking of dogs. No doubt - you\u2019re in Medwedia, imperialist pig, ready to be liberated from your ungodly sins?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo, three minutes before they would find him. There seemed to be a helicopter up in the sky, he was not sure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPain. Goddamn pain. Jebediah\u2019s head was exploding. Throbbing pain. Somebody hammering on his head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe burning bush in the background duplicated itself. Everything was double. Jebediah threw up, with more blood.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPain. Pain and Blood. Darkness. The predatorial flapping of the helicopter rotor came closer and closer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLight. Men in white robes. Men in uniforms. A hospital corridor. A nurse setting up an IV drip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDarkness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA man in a dark suit, accompanied by two uniformed officers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DGood morning, Lieutenant ...Kerman.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DHe\u2019s not ready yet. Three more hours. Let\u2019s give him some more sedative.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DI will stay here and wait. Bring me a tea.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDarkness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe man, without the officers, sitting on a wooden stool to the right side of his bed. Jebediah did not recognize the old kerbal, whose hair and mustache were grey. An empty cup of tea was standing on the bedside table.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DGood evening. You have slept for six hours. Ten bones broken. We thought we would lose you. Doctor Soboth\u00A0thought so, to be honest. You crashed at an incredible speed, my friend. In fact, you have broken at least five different world records.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DWhere am I?\u201D - Jebediah found it incredibly hard to speak; the pain was almost unbearable. They had drugged him up; whatever they had given him was now wearing off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIn a safe place. Nobody will hurt you.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DWhere?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DThe situation is quite...erm...complicated, if you understand what I mean. I must disappoint you with the fact that the negotiations on your behalf have not started yet. You are presumed dead.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DPlease...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou are safe.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DWhere am I, for god\u2019s sake?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe old man folded a file he was holding and laid it on the table. He stood up and looked sternly at Jebediah.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DWelcome to the Medwedian Democratic Federation, Lieutenant Jebediah Kerman of the International Aerospace Peacekeeping Corps.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe was speaking with a slight rhotic and guttural accent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DHow do you know my name?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DWe have been collecting information on you since you were conscripted. We have pictures of you as a kid. We have copies of your preschool report card. We know everything about you, and everything means everything. We know that you like to visit the Mun, often spend months alone in a keostationary\u00A0centrifuge outfitted with nothing but basic life support and a decent supply of liquor, and last but not least - engage in covert reconnaissance missions when you are on Kerbin. You do it to find more excuses to drink. You are an alcoholic, a misanthrope\u00A0and a spy - what a funny combination...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe man laughed loudly and heartily. Something was telling Jebediah Kerman that he was getting into some serious trouble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DAnd now back on topic - I really must commend you on the high resolution of that camera. The silo caps of Facility 46 are clearly visible. Even a toddler will recognize nuclear missiles. Seems that you have done a good job for your government.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DWhat do you want from me? Who are you?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DLieutenant - please do not polemize with me.\u00A0All I want from you is to do another job, now\u00A0for us.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DAnother job? I presume that you have already destroyed the data I collected, and that your satellites are good enough to see our nuclear launch centers as clearly as we do yours...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DYou are misunderstanding me, Lieutenant Kerman. This job has nothing to do with missiles, at least not in the way you imagine. It\u2019s a space job. Space is your element, your natural habitat, am I correct? Space is the only place where nobody judges you for literally turning your blood into booze, where your siblings can not aim their watchful eyes at you, right?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DWhy should I?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe man pulled two small injection syringes out of his chest pocket and tightened his tie. Only now Jebediah noticed the restraints that held him in place in the\u00A0bed, tight belts immobilizing his arms, legs and head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DYou have the choice. Nobody is forcing you to do anything for us. However, remember that you are officially dead, the victim of a tragic accident. In my left hand, I am holding a syringe that contains painkillers and a drug that will guarantee you deep and comfortable sleep for at least two days while your wounds start to heal. The other syringe contains pure benzol. You will choke painfully, spending\u00A0the last thirty minutes of your life spitting out your lungs.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah did not say anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DGreat. I am your mission coordinator and superior officer for the duration of this enterprise. Colonel Herbert Olsen, Ministry of National Security of the Medwedian Democratic Federation.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DNice to meet you.\u201D - Jebediah\u2019s tone was undoubtedly sarcastic and full of despise. He was doing his best to provoke the colonel without openly enraging him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DNow, to the objective of the undertaking...\u201D - Olsen unfolded a large graphic. Jebediah immediately recognized it as a poorly photocopied excerpt from his own orbital mechanics textbook. Some annotations in Medwedian were scribbled all around the sheet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DLieutenant - are you familiar with the Kronos Maneuver?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DWhy?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Kronos Maneuver was a complex Oberth transfer devised by Jebediah\u2019s own physics professor, designed to fling a spacecraft quickly towards Jool, Sarnus or Urlum (or even into interstellar space); it involved performing a power burn while skipping on the outer edge of Kerbol\u2019s atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DYou will perform it, exactly in three weeks\u2019 time. According to the information avaliable to the Ministry and to the Medwedian\u00A0Administration of Cosmonautics, you are one of the three men in the world left who are able to pilot the Ikarus-3 spacecraft.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIkarus-3. The most secret and most dangerous vessel ever designed by Kerbalkind. The Medwedians had a good reason to get to the outer edge of the Kerbolar system as soon as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DWe have detected a strange anomaly in the close proximity of Jool. You will help us investigate\u00A0it. We need to get there before anybody else does. I can not tell you more at this moment, as I have not been fully briefed yet myself. The level of secrecy is higher than for any of your nuclear installations.\u00A0This might mean your death, Lieutenant. The offer of euthanasia still stands.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be continued...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-10-01T22:58:50Z\u0022 title=\u002210/01/2018 10:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 1, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by MedwedianPresident\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MedwedianPresident","CreatedById":12212,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-02T09:30:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFeel free to post your comments and improvement ideas.

Everything went silent. The color of the face of the Head Mission Director (Operations) was not the pale yet formidable green his subordinates were used to but an unusual medium red. Gene was the uncle of Jebediah Kerman.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DStand up.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene Kerman\u2019s was speaking calmly (like he always did when he was furious), and yet his voice sounded like thunder.

Everybody.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DWhat has happened, Mr. Kerman?\u201D - somebody courageous had dared to interrupt the silence before the storm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DWe\u2019re fired\u201D, said the Head Mission Director (Operations) calmly, \u201Call of us. This is the last order from the Director of the Space Program before he resigns.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA hearty murmur went through the majestic control hall. Kerbonauts died, even crashed in Medwedia, and every time, a funeral with weeping mothers and widows held at the space center paid by the Program closed the affair. Yes - it was Jebediah Kerman, the man who had stepped onto the Mun thirty and onto Duna fifteen years ago, but...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DNo, it\u2019s not what you think.

Do you think somebody who wants orbital laser cannons will suddenly give a new grant for an orbital greenhouse after inauguration?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DSo we are basically uneployed from today on, Director?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DYes.
