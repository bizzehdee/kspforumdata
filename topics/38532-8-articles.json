To the point (as I experienced earlier) that when you get to a couple hundred tons (payload and launch stages), having ASAS is moot because it doesn\u0027t apply near the control force needed to stay on course. It\u0027s literally the same as not having it at all.

What is now called SAS does not add torque, it merely uses the command pod/reaction wheel torque, along with RCS and aerodynamic control surfaces to cancel rotation around axes other than the axis upon which the player is trying to turn the vehicle.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of your post is correct, except for the last few sentence. The new piece that uses the skin of the old small ASAS module gives both SAS and torque.
