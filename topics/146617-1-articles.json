Task manager said the core was running at 0.77ghz at the time.\u00A0I mean, I know KSP isn\u0027t the best as far as making use of hardware goes but surely there is a way to make it make use of the CPU?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it\u0027s useful, I was flying the Ares 3A over \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E with no other ships nearby. Anti aliasing on 4x, texture and render quality on full as well as aero FX on full. Physics time per frame is set to 0.03.\u00A0\u00A0I also have scattered installed.
