Just be sure to check your staging because the game will likely insert the clamps in the wrong place!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, of course, you can always clamp BOTH the main rocket and the boosters if you have room - advisable is your boosters are themselves very heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally, though, this is all good advice.
