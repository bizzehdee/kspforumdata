I have tried to make a rover, by using the first rover wheel you can get and pretty much taping 6 of them to an inline mk. 1 cockpit, with solar panels all over. This was a poor idea, as it seems almost every time i hit a slope about as steep as the grass around the runway, going any faster than 10 m/s, usually a wheel will explode, soon leaving me with no other choice but to start again. any suggestions are appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-21T05:03:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving to Gameplay Questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AeroGav","CreatedById":152027,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-21T05:34:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfor 400km an airplane would be better, \u00A0but i won\u0027t accept these contracts at all if they require me to fly beyond my own continent - not time efficient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn engineer kerbal can mend broken wheels, but the basic one is very fragile. \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0Hardest thing is not having them tip over, getting CG low enough usually means abandoning cockpits for structural panels and command chairs. \u00A0 \u00A0I had some success with one built like a Tesla, \u00A0with batteries and RTGs under the floor but protected by a metal plate (keeps cg low).

Just make sure to drop the rover from a low altitude, at low speed, onto flat terrain or a bottom of a valley, and make a few circles around the site until it stops.
