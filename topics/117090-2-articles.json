RCS thrusters are integrated into command pods, so there is another 4 parts saved. Command pods also have integrated static solar panels and battery capacity - more parts saved. Engine clusters are...well a single part, so there is 2-11 parts saved depending upon engine. Decouplers are integrated into command pods and/or fuel sections, so there are more parts saved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, a mun-capable 2-stage lander using these parts is 6 total parts (\u0026gt;1000dv descent stage, \u0026gt;1200dv ascent stage). A single-stage mun capable lander can be made in 4 parts (take out the ascent engine and swap the main tank type, remove half-height filler tank)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is, for a 2-stage lander: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Docking Port\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Command Pod (and ascent fuel tanks, RCS ports, and ascent stage decoupler)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Ascent engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Descent fuel tanks (and landing legs, possibly landing lights as well.. concept WIP)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Half-height interior filler tank for extra capacity on descent stage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Descent engine cluster\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompared to the stock example landers, that is like a 30\u002B part reduction (not sure of their part numbers off the top of my head, but they are ridiculous for a simple lander).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fuel tanks actually will have several integrated modules that may be swapped in the VAB (in the render above) (using mesh-swapping plugin). Currently those are Landing Legs (light or heavy, depending on tank size), Monopropellant tanks, and Deployable Solar panels. Planned for inclusion is an RTG/Battery combo, and perhaps a secondary RCS quad (and/or other ideas if any come up).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor SC-B (Orion) Parts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking Port has integrated parachute (1 part saved)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommand pod has integrated decoupler and heat-shield (2 parts saved). Also integrated RCS, though not strictly needed (optionally 4 parts saved)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EService module has integrated RCS, solar panels, fairings, and engines (11 parts saved)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EICPS is fuel tanks \u002B engine (1 part saved)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn example orbiter using the SC-B could be as low as 3 parts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Docking Port/parachute combo\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Command Module\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Service Module (fuel, rcs, solar, batteries, main engines)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. (optional) ICPS - range extender (allows for transfer to Mun or Minmus)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, compare that to the 30\u002B part count stock example solution. I would consider that quite a savings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeries-C Parts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommand module has integrated docking port, lights, transmitter, and RCS (6 parts saved)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EService Module has integrated rcs (2 parts saved)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding Module has integrated landing legs, engines, and fuel capacity (3-8 parts saved depending upon how you look at it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe entire reason I started making parts in the first place was to clean up the 40\u002B part contraptions I was constantly making for simple jobs such as crewed orbiters or simple landers. I was quite sick of my stations and bases lagging in the yellow/red when I had a ship or two docked at them. Now I can save the part-count to be used for the stations and bases themselves rather than the ships docked/landed at them. I had previously used part-welding as a fix for these problems but found far too many limitations (e.g. with multiple solar panels or landing legs, or even engines); and the fact that it has not officially been updated to 1.x has only pushed my development harder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdmittedly, some of these parts/series have limited application outside of their intended use. But if they can fulfill their intended use while freeing up part count for other more specialized designs and uses; I consider that a net-win.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T19:06:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shadowmage\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Shadowmage\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E*In-depth reply*\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see, I didn\u0027t realize all those parts were integrated.

Do they work out well enough for designs you have attempted?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking about increasing the base mass for all the command pods slightly (they have a lot of integrated stuff that must be accounted for), at the same time I would \u0027correct\u0027 the mass ratios on the fuel tanks. Currently they are using the same 85% fuel ratio as stock tanks; however, they have less wasted space compared to a stock cylindrical tank, so I will probably be increasing them to a 95%\u002B fuel ratio with an additional static/preset dry-mass for the structure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo tank mass would be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eset mass for structure for that size (more for larger tanks)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5% of \u0027potential fuel\u0027 (by volume) will be used as dry mass for the tank skins/etc. (at 1m^3 of fuel = 1t)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe remaining 95% of potential fuel will be actual fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, I have considered setting them up as if they were a solid tank and ignoring the actual geometry of the model; this would remove the rift/gap between the fuel sections and the cargo sections regarding capacity. I would take the volume of the frame (as if it was solid), and use the standard stock 85% fuel/mass ratio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill have to do some testing on my part-setup spreadsheets to see how these changes would effect the overall balance.

At least that is the \u0027plan\u0027 so far; things may take longer than that, and I tend to get distracted by other projects on occasion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill leave you all with this teaser:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(didn\u0027t want to get too involved this week, so decided to bash out a part that I\u0027ve been wanting to get done for awhile; only took 2 1/2 days for modeling and texturing... very fast for me)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KJOthfJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KJOthfJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"riocrokite","CreatedById":129319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T06:44:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Esuper cool \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"drtedastro","CreatedById":70911,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T07:39:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThose are looking GREAT.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook forward to having those to work with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MinimumSky5","CreatedById":115138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T15:57:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m already planning lander designs with these, I cannot wait for the release!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VenomousRequiem","CreatedById":137373,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T16:47:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MinimumSky5\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MinimumSky5\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m already planning lander designs with these, I cannot wait for the release!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it by chance similar to Altair? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MinimumSky5","CreatedById":115138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T19:59:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESimilar, but as I play with New Horizons, I need a craft with approx. 4km/s to go to the Mun and back, which basically requires the Dune Explorer from Scott Manley\u0027s videos!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SuccinctLemon","CreatedById":147644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T09:37:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks very nice.
