RCS thrusters are integrated into command pods, so there is another 4 parts saved. Command pods also have integrated static solar panels and battery capacity - more parts saved. Engine clusters are...well a single part, so there is 2-11 parts saved depending upon engine. Decouplers are integrated into command pods and/or fuel sections, so there are more parts saved.\n\nBasically, a mun-capable 2-stage lander using these parts is 6 total parts (\u003E1000dv descent stage, \u003E1200dv ascent stage). A single-stage mun capable lander can be made in 4 parts (take out the ascent engine and swap the main tank type, remove half-height filler tank)\n\nThat is, for a 2-stage lander: \n\n1. Docking Port\n\n2. Command Pod (and ascent fuel tanks, RCS ports, and ascent stage decoupler)\n\n3. Ascent engine\n\n4. Descent fuel tanks (and landing legs, possibly landing lights as well.. concept WIP)\n\n5. Half-height interior filler tank for extra capacity on descent stage\n\n6. Descent engine cluster\n\nCompared to the stock example landers, that is like a 30\u002B part reduction (not sure of their part numbers off the top of my head, but they are ridiculous for a simple lander).\n\nThe fuel tanks actually will have several integrated modules that may be swapped in the VAB (in the render above) (using mesh-swapping plugin). Currently those are Landing Legs (light or heavy, depending on tank size), Monopropellant tanks, and Deployable Solar panels. Planned for inclusion is an RTG/Battery combo, and perhaps a secondary RCS quad (and/or other ideas if any come up).\n\nFor SC-B (Orion) Parts:\n\nDocking Port has integrated parachute (1 part saved)\n\nCommand pod has integrated decoupler and heat-shield (2 parts saved). Also integrated RCS, though not strictly needed (optionally 4 parts saved)\n\nService module has integrated RCS, solar panels, fairings, and engines (11 parts saved)\n\nICPS is fuel tanks \u002B engine (1 part saved)\n\nAn example orbiter using the SC-B could be as low as 3 parts:\n\n1. Docking Port/parachute combo\n\n2. Command Module\n\n3. Service Module (fuel, rcs, solar, batteries, main engines)\n\n4. (optional) ICPS - range extender (allows for transfer to Mun or Minmus)\n\nAgain, compare that to the 30\u002B part count stock example solution. I would consider that quite a savings.\n\nSeries-C Parts:\n\nCommand module has integrated docking port, lights, transmitter, and RCS (6 parts saved)\n\nService Module has integrated rcs (2 parts saved)\n\nLanding Module has integrated landing legs, engines, and fuel capacity (3-8 parts saved depending upon how you look at it)\n\nThe entire reason I started making parts in the first place was to clean up the 40\u002B part contraptions I was constantly making for simple jobs such as crewed orbiters or simple landers. I was quite sick of my stations and bases lagging in the yellow/red when I had a ship or two docked at them. Now I can save the part-count to be used for the stations and bases themselves rather than the ships docked/landed at them. I had previously used part-welding as a fix for these problems but found far too many limitations (e.g. with multiple solar panels or landing legs, or even engines); and the fact that it has not officially been updated to 1.x has only pushed my development harder.\n\nAdmittedly, some of these parts/series have limited application outside of their intended use. But if they can fulfill their intended use while freeing up part count for other more specialized designs and uses; I consider that a net-win."},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T19:06:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \\*In-depth reply\\*\n\nI see, I didn\u0027t realize all those parts were integrated.

Should I include an optional mesh-switch variant for paneling?\n\n![xvxDZhH.png](http://i.imgur.com/xvxDZhH.png)\n\nAnd the most exciting bit... (for me anyway..)...\n\nEarly concept work on a \u0027skycrane\u0027 module. These will be half-height sections with deployable engines. So you could mount these above a payload, use them to drop rovers, whatever. They will be of the same width/length as the other fuel-sections, so they should look okay while in use. These will also include some small\u0027ish fuel tanks for some integrated fuel capacity (to take up whatever space is not being used by the engines).\n\nThis is a -very- early concept... I\u0027m still working out how things will fit, how they will be animated, etc. The current geometry will -not- be used (aside from the engines), I am just slapping bits together at the moment to see what looks good; will be reworking the geometry after I figure out what it should look like/what the mechanics will be for the animation.\n\n![FazvdX9.png](http://i.imgur.com/FazvdX9.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"V8jester","CreatedById":136093,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T18:25:02Z","Content":"This is all really looking great!"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwiak","CreatedById":82796,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T16:49:19Z","Content":"Nice pack, like its industrial look."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T17:07:21Z","Content":"Thanks for the support guys.\n\nI\u0027m looking to get a final(?) private testing release out sometime this weekend after I clean up/finish up a few things (models/plugins) and do another balancing pass.\n\nIf all goes well I -might- be able to have public beta testing releases available in a week or two (will be waiting until I return from vacation, so 24th or so). Initial public test releases will have unfinished textures for many parts (texturing takes me forever). There are also a few planned parts that will not be in the initial releases (as they are only in the planning stage; trying to hold off on starting any new stuff until the existing parts are finished or at least released).\n\nFor the testers:\n\nHow do you guys feel about the current mass/fuel balancing on the lander parts? Do they work out well enough for designs you have attempted?\n\nI\u0027m thinking about increasing the base mass for all the command pods slightly (they have a lot of integrated stuff that must be accounted for), at the same time I would \u0027correct\u0027 the mass ratios on the fuel tanks. Currently they are using the same 85% fuel ratio as stock tanks; however, they have less wasted space compared to a stock cylindrical tank, so I will probably be increasing them to a 95%\u002B fuel ratio with an additional static/preset dry-mass for the structure.\n\nSo tank mass would be:\n\nset mass for structure for that size (more for larger tanks)\n\n5% of \u0027potential fuel\u0027 (by volume) will be used as dry mass for the tank skins/etc. (at 1m^3 of fuel = 1t)\n\nthe remaining 95% of potential fuel will be actual fuel.\n\nEdit:\n\nAlternatively, I have considered setting them up as if they were a solid tank and ignoring the actual geometry of the model; this would remove the rift/gap between the fuel sections and the cargo sections regarding capacity. I would take the volume of the frame (as if it was solid), and use the standard stock 85% fuel/mass ratio.\n\nWill have to do some testing on my part-setup spreadsheets to see how these changes would effect the overall balance. Trying to make things easily usable without making them blatantly overpowered.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-14T17:16:39Z\u0022 title=\u002208/14/2015 05:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"VenomousRequiem","CreatedById":137373,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T18:46:54Z","Content":"Oh!
