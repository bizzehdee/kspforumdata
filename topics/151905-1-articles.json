We had an enjoyable chat about the operation and comparing WWII paratroop operations to the \u00A0much more precise (and far smaller) Airborne ops we conducted in Bosnia in the early \u002790\u0027s. It was also interesting because he fought over the same ground I had; 50 years apart.

He still had the gleam in his eye and the sharp whipcrack manner of an NCO. We both held the same rank - Sergeant - though I would not for a moment consider myself anywhere near his equal in terms of our respective action. We had a lovely chat until his wife led him away to join the Veteran\u0027s Parade.
