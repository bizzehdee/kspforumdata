Things now are much more dire. A unknown tonnage E class Asteroid is on its way to Kerbin and this time I need to stop it from crashing into the planet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo that end I built a tug to pull the asteroid rather than push it. My question is do the engines need a clearance for the exhaust and if so how much? I have 3 main engines and their rocket flare at full thrust will be burning holes in the asteroid, if that was possible. I don\u0027t want to make the chain with the claw any longer to preserve its stability. If I have to I guess I can add another huge fuel can to the middle part of the ship and that should give the room I need. But before I bother with that I would like to know how close is too close in terms of engines flares on a tug.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-21T12:38:06Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2014 12:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Stickyhammy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T18:19:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, if you have something too close behind the engines you\u0027ll get no thrust.

You don\u0027t want to have all the hassle of flying out to the asteroid only to discover you get no thrust once you latch on (or worse, unbalanced thrust, because the asteroid is uneven and blocks engines only on one side). This is one of my class E pullers that I tested by removing the claw, replacing it with a large flat plate and taking most of the fuel out to get the TWR above 1.

View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trusses (and the probe core/RCS tank/size adapter they connect to) gave too much wobble when trying to turn the asteroid with RCS so I\u0027ve braced them with more trusses and struts in later versions. Also, it makes sense to set up an action group to toggle the gimbals on the engines as, when you are flying to the asteroid the gimbals should work as the engines should still be behind the centre of mass but when you grab hold of any decent sized asteroid the center of mass will move behind the engines and SAS will use the gimbals wrong and cause you serious stability issues while towing...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RidingTheFlow","CreatedById":111197,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T20:45:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tery215\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tery215\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBecause the jet of spent rocket fuel is on collision with a part attached to the engine..?\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know how far away it needs to be either.

If your rocket exhaust impacts your ship (or anything attached to it), you will get net zero thrust, because all engine exhaust will slow down your ship (on impacting) exactly cancelling out acceleration (on leaving nozzle).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is actually what will happen in reality. Otherwise it would be very easy to create \u0022reactionless drive\u0022 which allows to fly without actually expelling any exhaust - note that with external heating (like nuclear thermal rocket) this would\u0027ve allowed to produce thrust without actually spending any reaction fluid (since you could\u0027ve just capture exhaust, re-heat it and repeat). But newton third law won\u0027t allow for that - if you want to accelerate, you need to accelerate something in opposite direction (and leave it untouched afterwards).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are some mods that allow thrust balancing, to make summary thrust vector to go exactly through centre of mass. So you can attach several engines to the asteroid, just roughly on same side and in same direction - and plugin will set individual thrusts so asteroid won\u0027t rotate.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-20T20:59:30Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2014 08:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by RidingTheFlow\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T21:35:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could angle your engines outward by 15 degrees or so and still get cos(15) = 96.6% of your thrust to the rear.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RidingTheFlow","CreatedById":111197,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T21:43:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think with class E it will require very long boom/truss though, because asteroid will have to be placed far behind enough for exhaust to clear the sides and E class is so big.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T23:24:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI recall a rough guide on exhaust clearance is something like 2x or 2.5x the length of the plume, starting from the engine nozzle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also turn them slightly outward (as suggested).
