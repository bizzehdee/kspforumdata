I am curious why this is though? In my reading I\u0027ve come up with two theories:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) The sudden loss of fluid pressure inside one or both of the turbopumps would cause cavitation that could damage or destroy the pumps\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Since the cryogenic fuels were circulated through multiple heat exchangers to heat the fuel and cool the engine, before reaching combustion, that a sudden loss of fuel would result in abrupt loss of cooling while the combustion was still occurring, thus damaging or destroying the uncooled components.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre either of these even close to being true?

(This was actually specifically called out in the Rogers Commission report on the Challenger disaster as further evidence that the SSMEs were not the point of failure, as all three showed the sort of nozzle burns that were to be expected from oxygen-rich shutdowns. That came due to the LOX tank in the external tank being the upper tank, with the longer line supplying it to the engines, so when the ET disintegrated, the LOX supply in the plumbing lasted longer than the LH2 supply.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you ablate the nozzles enough, you\u0027ll get a burn-through structural failure, which is a Bad Thing (it can result in Rapid Unplanned Disassembly) even in an expendable engine. This is why just about all rocket designs have included low-level sensors in both the fuel and oxidizer tanks which would, when a certain number of them simultaneously indicated a low-level condition, initiate a controlled shutdown of the engines; it meant that shutdown would not come due to starvation of one propellant or the other and result in a loss of regenerative cooling of the nozzle and potential burn-through. With the SSMEs designed to fly 20-30 times, this clearly becomes even more important than it is in a simple pressure-fed expendable engine, as damage suffered in one flight may result in failure on a later flight; between that and the various turbopump issues (cavitation when pressure gets too low, loss of lubrication from loss of the pumped fluid, and overspeeding due to loss of resistance of the pumped fluid), a controlled shutdown with significant residual propellant remaining was the safest option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Interesting note: it\u0027s not just the turbopumps on rockets that use the fluid that they pump to restrict their speed and provide lubrication. The in-tank electric fuel pumps on modern cars are designed to use the gasoline they pump into the fuel lines to both keep the pump from overheating, and to lubricate it so that the bearings don\u0027t fail. Thus, it\u0027s really a bad idea to let your car run out of gas, because it may do some damage to the fuel pump... and refilling the fuel lines when you try restarting it after getting fuel in the tank almost certainly will. It won\u0027t *break* it, not the first time, but it can make it weaker, and more likely to eventually fail.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Westi29","CreatedById":80595,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T22:37:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the SSME\u0027s have a really interesting design in that their inner cones have hundreds of micro tubes carrying the fuel into the center, where it is sprayed out. Basically, the fuel travels along tiny pipes on the inside edge of the rocket nozzle and the heat of the rocket exhaust combusts the fuel. So if the rockets were to run dry, they would have destroyed the cones as the liquid fuel kep the engines intact in the first place. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine if the combustion in your car was caused by lining the hottest parts of the engine with fuel lines to cool it, and if you ran it dry the fuel lines would cease to cool the engine and everybody has a bad day. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Ssme_schematic.svg\u0022 alt=\u0022Ssme_schematic.svg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022RS-25 schematic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA functional diagram showing the flow of propellant through an RS-25 engine.
