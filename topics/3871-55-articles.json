When you do end up updating the file structure of the download for .20.x, can you also edit either the amount of fuel contained in the 3.75 meter tanks or the rate at which the 5x Bearcat engine burns fuel? It is far and away overpowered at this point, as I can complete my gravity turn with just my first stage when using 1 full-size and 1 half-size 3.75 meter tank from this pack along with the engine, pretty much regardless of payload.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emost certianly not the case, nearly all engines in NP are, in fact, underpowered...well, compared to KW anyways, Im using them as gap fillers mainly, youre payload is probably too light, 3.75m and 5m engine and fuel tanks are there for the rather heavy payloads, anything below 50 tons for a 3.75m launcher is pretty ridicoules...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Virtualgenius","CreatedById":67644,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-07T07:05:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny news on this or do i write this mod off\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HGGundamReviews","CreatedById":57099,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-07T19:40:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELast I heard they were having to rebuild all the models for this pack.
