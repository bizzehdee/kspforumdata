Quite the opposite actually. While the methodology may seem simple, the actual process requires quite a bit of energy. In terms of kJ/mol (kilojoules per mole), thermite releases about 850 kJ/mol. Removing an electron from Neon requires about 2000 kJ/mol. Helium and neon for no known stable compounds. They retain their electrons to a rather extreme extent. I\u0027ve seen He\u002B and He2\u002B tossed around in coursework examples, but those are strictly for number crunching. In so many words, it just doesn\u0027t happen. Argon compounds have been observed under extremely controlled conditions, but they do not occur naturally (that we know of anyway). It would also be worthwhile to note that virtually every case of a noble gas forming something almost always involves fluorine. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/vtWp45Eewtw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFluorine very aggressively strips electrons from other elements/compounds/whatever-is-around-it.\u003C/a\u003E (Please note as well that I\u0027m talking about fluorine and NOT fluoride. One obliterates and the other fights cavities.) It\u0027s a pretty weird and unique element, allowing it to bond with other elements that would typically never bond with anything else. Why mention the bonding? Things like fluorine reduce the amount of external energy input required to strip an electron. If we\u0027re going to do it using a photons, we\u0027ll need to create the same extreme conditions using just light. The energy requirements are a bit... intense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink of this stuff like a complimentary system. When we put energy in, the additional energy needs to translate either into the system or to its surroundings. When we remove an electron from a system, if it has nothing from which to gain the electron lost, it\u0027s kind of on its own in a quasi-stable state. However, if we add an electron, the system can readily eject that electron if there\u0027s too much energy in the system. The positive charge exerted by the nucleus would be unable to successfully hold onto the introduced electron. With such a weak grip, the electron will be lost. All of these elements want to stay in the most stable state possible relative to their surroundings. Remove an electron, and it\u0027ll hold onto the others more tightly. Add an electron, and it\u0027ll interact with the other electrons (causing the electron cloud to expand) and nucleus from its own separate orbital. (Look up s, p, d, and f orbitals. It\u0027ll either confuse you more or help you understand better.) Generally, all atoms want some sense of a completed orbital shell. If we have just one electron in its own orbital, the system would become more stable if it got rid of the additional electron. In something like a noble gas, the amount of energy from intermolecular forces and repulsion would exceed the energy required to retain the electron. Thus, it gets ejected from out system. Similarly, this is why things in the first group in the periodic table form cations. There\u0027s a lone electron in its own orbital.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you look in a reference table such as the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, there are actual values for all of this and so much more. Is it possible? Absolutely! Is it practically feasible? Sweet Jesus no! HOWEVER! When we start getting into the heavier elements, the sheer mass and charge of the native element may be able to retain an additional electron. Given a huge charge and a whole lot of electrons, the impact from a single additional electron would be substantially less than if we added an electron to a lighter element. The same goes for removing an electron as well. This is why Xenon is kind of an ideal candidate for such things. Radon would be an even better candidate, but it makes the Geiger counter go tickety-tick-tick. Also, there\u0027s less of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEh. I\u0027m only partially satisfied with this explanation. Let me know if you want more elaboration/clarification.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
