It should stay multiple parts like the original and just be adjusted for the 1.0.2 physics and aero. Not all changed up. The boosters i agree with. The new ones are good but the old decoupler for them works just fine. Why change it? Whatever you did to the model for the Shuttle broke it. Now it has collision issues with its self."},{"CreatedByName":"iDisOrder","CreatedById":143952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T18:33:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Its worse now more than ever in my opinion.

Mike I recommend using TAC fuel balancer to dump the excess monopropellent instead of the valve.\n\nADDON\n\nThe double parts is completely expected, the stock craft isn\u0027t working.

Your a tough critic.
