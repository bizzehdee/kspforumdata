Have you ever tried climbing over a seemingly fine ladder intersection only to have your Kerbal utterly confused?\n\nThat is a nice idea, and I hope it works out that way. But I have a feeling the animation will transition from \u0022on ladder\u0022 to attempting to step up/down to the next ladder, and poor Kerbal falls off, anyway. But, when you see while building a craft, that the ladder junctions are coming together at difficult angles and might not work smoothly, it will be possible to use objects as steps and ledges, between the ladders ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T02:11:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Down-under [Oceania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceania). ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nThere goes my hopes of another guy who knows about the book..."}]}
