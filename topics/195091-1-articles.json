I dug through old records of mine and recently realized i have bought over 125 Copies of the game! 4 for myself, PC and consoles, and 122 for the Community. I hope that all those i helped acquire the game found as much, if not more, enjoyment than I have in this game.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 In closing, I would like to say Tank you, and keep up the great work!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n-LexingtonDelta\n\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-27T19:08:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to Kerbal Network.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for contributing to the community!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
