I stop by my space station, put all this data in the lab, begin processing it... Wow ! Too much data, lab cant process all of it. I would like to be able to let the unprocessed data in the lab, and take the processed data back on Kerbin to get the immediate science out of it, without having to wait years \u0026 years for the mobile processing lab to process it. Is there (or could somebody make) a mod which would allow me to choose which science data i take from the lab ?\n\nThe second one would (i think) be more complicated to implement... But it would make carreer mode really great.\n\nI would like to be able to create my own contracts in-game. Something like that : a new tab in the contract building, where i can set my own goals, like \u0022land on duna, land on ike, return to kerbin\u0022 and the game creates a new contract asking this, with an auto-calculated budget for this (no science or rep). With this i can still setup my own goals while having to care for funds (and dont have to reject a hundred random contracts until the one i need comes).\n\nSorry if it is not understandable (english is not my mother tongue). Please let me know, so that i can explain better.\n\nThanks for reading."},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T10:21:23Z","Content":"Not sure about the first one...but for the second one, it is somewhat possible with [Contract Configurator 2](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101604-1-0-2-Contract-Configurator-v1-4-2-2015-06-18), which does allow quite deep contract creation. Though it require you to learn its syntax for writing config files (which is really simple and require no modding knowledge, just basic logic). I am not sure if anyone has designed a GUI to use CC2 in game though."}]}
