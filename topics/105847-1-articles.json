Beyond that nothing exists in the stock game."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T01:28:33Z","Content":"Yeah, struts are your only option in stock. The lego like construction is a hallmark of KSP that will likely never change. If you want solid pieces, the Ubiozur welder or Procedural Wings (as mentioned) are you alternatives.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T02:22:18Z","Content":"While procedural wing add-ons do provide finer control over the size and shape of the wing, one disadvantage of any monolithic wing system is the lack of resilience against in-flight failures.\n\nIf a one-piece wing is struck by tiny piece of debris, the entire wing is considered destroyed, and your craft is doomed. On the other hand, a wing built up of multiple segments is a more robust design because debris impact would only destroy the specific segments that were struck, while hopefully leaving behind enough wing area to allow you to limp home\\*.\n\n\\*In [the 1983 Negev mid-air collision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Negev_mid-air_collision) incident, an Israeli F-15D collided with another aircraft during a training exercise and lost a significant part of its right wing, but the pilot managed to land the plane safely using the remaining remnants of said wing and various control surfaces."}]}
