I ran across this shortly after I started playing if I recall correctly... Probably version .22, maybe .23. I remember that I just randomly sent a probe down from an orbiting ship and saw this pass under me -- I tried to land near it but I had shoddily designed the probe being pretty new and it crashed. I\u0027ve never been able to run across it again, and naturally I wasn\u0027t paying very close attention to the map. It keeps periodically coming back to mind, I\u0027m curious if anyone else has seen this or knows anything about it? Is it a random bug that I\u0027ll never see again, an unspoken easter egg, what? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP2014-01-0100-19-56-58-1.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP2014-01-0100-19-56-58-1.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Answered, although not quite the answer I was hoping for.
