Upon entering the building to pick up more contracts, I\u0027m still limited to two. Upon a scene change, the mission control has reverted to its tier 1 model and I can buy the upgrade again, deducting the cost from my funds a second time, but the upgrade still doesn\u0027t stick with the same results as before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, selecting buildings is very difficult. They aren\u0027t highlighted correctly and it\u0027s hard to find just the right place to click to get into them.

It\u0027s possible that something is corrupting or overwriting the save file and causing it to revert the changes or simply not save them in the first place.
