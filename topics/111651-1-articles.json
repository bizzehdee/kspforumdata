Upon entering the building to pick up more contracts, I\u0027m still limited to two. Upon a scene change, the mission control has reverted to its tier 1 model and I can buy the upgrade again, deducting the cost from my funds a second time, but the upgrade still doesn\u0027t stick with the same results as before.\n\nAdditionally, selecting buildings is very difficult. They aren\u0027t highlighted correctly and it\u0027s hard to find just the right place to click to get into them. I encountered this bug before, but I thought it was due to Kerbin-Side which I\u0027ve since removed, but the problem has persisted.\n\nIs this a known issue with a particular mod?\n\nThese are the mods I currently have installed:\n\nFilter Extensions\n\nToolbar\n\nEVE\n\nContract Configurator\n\nCustom Barn Kit\n\nEngineLight\n\nRPM\n\nKerbal Joint Reinforcement\n\nKerbol Plus\n\nKER\n\nKSP-AVC\n\nMechJeb\n\nDocking Port Alignment Indicator\n\nPilot Assistant\n\nPlanet Shine\n\nTexture Replacer\n\nVen\u0027s Stock Revamp\n\nVessel View\n\n(give or take, I\u0027m on my laptop which has a similar but not quite the same install as my gaming desktop so I\u0027m doing this partially from memory)\n\nAnyways, has anyone else experienced this issue and found a solution?"},{"CreatedByName":"ExEvolution","CreatedById":93868,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T20:01:33Z","Content":"I hear this is a problem with the x64 executable on Windows"},{"CreatedByName":"TheMoonRover","CreatedById":136199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T20:20:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I hear this is a problem with the x64 executable on Windows\n\n...which was not released for 1.0.x so cannot be the issue.\n\nWith the Windows 64-bit version of 0.90, the buildings had the tier three model from the start but only functioned as tier 1 buildings, with no option to upgrade. That is slightly different to the issue reported here. But that would indeed have been the prime suspect before 1.0 hit.\n\nDo any of those mods store data in your save file, or mess around with it in any way? It\u0027s possible that something is corrupting or overwriting the save file and causing it to revert the changes or simply not save them in the first place. Any building related mods would also be suspect, but I don\u0027t see any on that list. (What is custom barn kit?)\n\nAre any of the mods outdated?\n\nBecause it\u0027s specifically mission control, try removing contract configurator. (back up your save file first)\n\nIf that doesn\u0027t fix it, try removing mods until it works. Then you can narrow it down to a single mod.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-01T20:25:53Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2015 08:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheMoonRover**"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T23:10:31Z","Content":"I\u0027m not using 64-bit and I created a new career and made sure all my mods were updated before I started. I\u0027m not sure if the other buildings exhibit the same issue as well, I quit for the night when I noticed the issue twice (I deleted the game I saw it initially on and removed Kerbin-Side since I suspected that might be causing it) but the new career exhibited the same issue.\n\n[Custom Barn Kit](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121100-1-0-x-Custom-Barn-Kit-1-1-0-%28May-26%29-No-instruction-leaflet-edition) is a mod by Sarbian that lets you change the upgradeable building parameters (i.e. cost, what unlocks when) so that could be another possible culprit, although I didn\u0027t see anyone reporting any issues like I was seeing on the thread for it. I\u0027ll start by removing that next."}]}
