And if that is the case, then sal\u0027s comments about resource gathering in RTS games really does seem to apply: \u0022Gather\u0022 is usually not really very inspired, it simply means clicking the \u0022gather\u0022 button and waiting. But it\u0027s not worth Squad\u0027s time to implement all of this simply for the player to click a dialog box. (Which, again, is exactly the problem with science at the moment).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor resources to introduce fun and interesting gameplay, it needs to be a different kind of mechanic. But no-one has, as yet, come up with what that might involve. I mean both the abstract concept and the details of how it would be implemented, so that we see what makes it fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think KerbMav\u0027s comment from page one is a critical piece of this: In order for resources to \u0022work\u0022, we might need ships to be able to do stuff when they\u0027re not focused, and even in rails warp. But if we \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E enable gathering during warp, then again, the mechanic hasn\u0027t changed much. Click dialog box, wait, turn on rails warp so you don\u0027t have to wait as long. It may be a necessary change, but it\u0027s not sufficient. There needs to be a counterbalancing mechanic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother approach would be to make gathering itself somehow fun. I\u0027m not sure what this might entail. Simply driving a rover around looking for where resources might be isn\u0027t really fun, it\u0027s just a tedious exercise in chance. There needs to be some kind of directed, clear challenge to the player. And again, I\u0027ve yet to see anyone provide a detailed description of an idea that might achieve something like this.

Especially considering ISRU is the direction NASA is moving with in their own reference mission plans for Mars and Calliston (yes, Callisto- the moon of Jupiter. I was just reading a Design Reference Mission for Callisto created by NASA just a little while ago. Admittedly, its timeframe, which will probably be subject to delay, was 2045-2050...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing about Resources, is that it is an entirely optional feature. If players don\u0027t want to use it, they can get along without it...

A much better system would be something more similar to KSP-Interstellar, or even Kethane (I prefer Interstellar hands-down). Something with complexity, *gasp* realism (this would make it much easier to figure out what planets/moons should have what resources- for instance regolith you could electrolyze for Oxidizer on the Mun or Ike...), and most importantly, variability...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is, a *GOOD* implementation wouldn\u0027t have had the same resources on every planet, like that chart suggested. Rather, each planet/mmon would need to be unique, with its own challenges to exploitation... To make a comparison, the excellent ISRU system in place in KSP-Interstellar doesn\u0027t have any source of hydrogen (LiquidFuel) available on Ike. In fact, the only resources you can produce there are Alumina, Oxidizer, and fission reactor fuels. To get LiquidFuel to burn with the Oxidizer, you need to produce it elsewhere and ship it elsewhere... Or Jool, for example, is a gas giant with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere. But to profitably harvest hydrogen from it, you need to find a cost-effective way to overcome its gravity well and make it back to orbit (operating Thermal Turbojet spaceplanes in its atmosphere, powered by Thermal Receivers, heated by beamed Phased Beam Microwave Power, from large fusion power plants on Laythe, that operate off elements in its oceans are one effective method...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, there needs to be challenge and complexity to the resource system. Add In-Situ Resource Utilization, by all means, but make it COMPLEX and CHALLENGING- those are the things that make this game fun. KSP is *NOT* a game for the instant-gratification seekers among us, and it wouldn\u0027t be interesting to implement a system where all you have to do is sit and mine. Put only certain resources on certain planets. Make the players have to locate them (perhaps a system where they can only be detected by taking surface samples- or would that be too hardcore?)

It\u0027s not like you\u0027re going to have a Kerbal get out with a shovel and physically start digging through the ground (while that might actually be fun, it would completely break immersion- and be very hard to code the terrain being alterable...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat makes a Resource-gathering system (ISRU- to use the abbreviation used by NASA) fun and interesting is the engineering challenges you build into it. It should be an engineering challenge- not some sort of piloting challenge...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s much like building a rocket that gets into orbit- it\u0027s not easy, and a lot of thought goes into it- therefore making it challenging... The same needs to be part of any ISRU system...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow? Well, let\u0027s say that you find ice deposits on some planet or moon (for starters, they need to make it so you have to FIND randomly-generated resources. That should be the FIRST challenge. They shouldn\u0027t be in the same place every game, or everywhere. Kethane\u0027s scanning system, while tedious as it doesn\u0027t play well with higher time-warps, is the best idea of that mod...) And yes, *ICE*, not \u0022Zenonium\u0022 or some silly thing like that. Immersion adds to the fun and suspension of disbelief...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second challenge should be that the parts to harvest resources in the first place are HEAVY. And specialized. Meaning that it\u0027s a challenge just to get the right drill and electrolyzer to that moon with ice in the first place- creating incentive to build heavier lifters (not easy) and whatnot...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third challenge needs to be operating the equipment in the first place. For instance, ice should mainly only be found on planets and moons that are far from the Sun (the closest locations to Kerbol might be a few craters on the Mun\u0027s poles, or at low concentrations on Minmus- much like in KSP Interstellar), though even that should not be an absolute- NASA recently found evidence of ice in permanently dark polar craters on MERCURY. So there should always be a chance of finding it somewhere unusual- which unpredictability would add to the fun and create a REAL feeling of exploration...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/messenger/media/PressConf20121129.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/messenger/media/PressConf20121129.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, back to the ice. Solar panels don\u0027t work well when you get far away from the Sun (a proper inverse-square rule should probably be implemented before ISRU- making solar panels even weaker further from Kerbol...) So you would need a LOT of them to melt\u002Belectrolyze large amounts of water-ice on an icy moon of Jool or Gas Giant #2 (whenever it\u0027s released), for instance. An alternative could be a fission nuclear power (NASA is looking at using them on Callisto and Mars for ISRU, why can\u0027t KSP?), but that could pose its own engineering challenged such as a heat radiation system (like in KSP Interstellar).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, it probably sounds like I\u0027m talking about a KSP Interstellar clone, with a detection system from Kethane, but I\u0027m \u003Cstrong\u003ENOT\u003C/strong\u003E (though both mods have good ideas to lend). Here\u0027s where things get a bit more interesting... Resources would need to have real relevance to the Science/Reputation system to be fun. I don\u0027t just mean it takes a certain amount of Science to get the parts. Resources should be a SOURCE of Science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is, the Science Points costs should all be increased (effectively nerfing the existing sources- but actually nerfing them would require a lot more effort I suspect...), and there should be BIG rewards in Science and Reputation Points for discovering a resource in the first place- especially any form of water or ice (after all, the search for water has been a \u003Cstrong\u003Ebig\u003C/strong\u003E part of NASA\u0027s exploration missions over the past decade- and we\u0027ve found a surprisingly large amount of it in an awful lot of places we didn\u0027t expect...) That would make the Science system feel a little more relevant and interesting, and allow the player to relate KSP to REAL space programs if they were searching for REAL resources... (such as water-ice, methane/CO2-ice, rocks containing bubbles of Xenon like on the Moon, oxygen in atmospheres, and alumina in regoliths...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere should be specific parts to detect the resources, of course, and the first tier of rewards should be achievable using probes (like the probes that have discovered all water-ice in the solar system so far in real life). but the biggest rewards should come from taking ACTUAL SAMPLES of a resource- whether through soil/water samples (currently implemented) or through atmospheric samples for atmospheric resources (new action/feature). Early on, the most interesting thing about resources should be simply finding them, as it should yield big Science and Reputation rewards...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next interesting thing about resources should be figuring out ways to use them. There would need to be some diversification of engines, for instance, to include at the least some type of solid-liquid hybrid rocket with intermediate performance characteristics (there are \u003Cstrong\u003Eseveral\u003C/strong\u003E resources in the real solar system that can be burned in solid powders, Alumina from the Moon only being the most prominent...), and some resources that are only really useful in their raw form as reactant mass for thermal rockets (like ammonia- though it could also be useful to make Hydrazine) or in alternative ion engines (Argon, CO2, and N2), but can be refined into other resources (like CO2 into Kerosene in combination with H2 via the Fischer-Tropsch Cycle, or into methane via the Sabatier reaction). Here, they could take a page out of the book of KSP-Interstellar, with its diverse resources and ways of using them... The key is, though, not every resource should be useful for everything, but every resource should have multiple uses...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it sounds like I\u0027m describing a huge encyclopedia of resources- but that should be half the fun. Complexity and (limited) realism should be one of the draws of the system- players should feel a bit like a chemical engineer trying to figure out how to make useful rocket fuel out of local resources, rather than just a Kethane-style \u0022land and refine\u0022 system... This would make ISRU a whole complex part of ISRU that players would have to set aside some considerable time to learn to do properly if they wanted to make use of it, much like spaceplanes (most players start with rockets, and learn spaceplanes much later) or learning how to build modular bases off-planet (something *I* still haven\u0027t learned, even with a huge fleet currently en-route to Duna to do precisely that...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, have the player go through a phase of locating water and other resources in the solar system as an important source of science. Make visiting and obtaining samples of the resources the second step. Make the third step (perhaps only unlockable after a sample of a given resource has been returned to Kerbin- though perhaps probes could somehow be allowed to gather and return samples- though this would make Kerbals even more useless...) actually figuring out how to use the resources. Make this challenging and complex (and not as mundane as processing \u0022Dirt\u0022- make players work with real substrates, like CO2, ammonia, water, methane, hydrogen, and nitrogen), and give rewards in Science and Reputation for developing successful ISRU systems, and you\u0027ll have a system that\u0027s sure to engage interested players for days of gameplay...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if you don\u0027t like the system? Find it too complex or boring? The beauty is that you don\u0027t have to use it- it would be completely optional; as there are plenty of other ways to obtain Science (and will be for Reputation, I\u0027m sure), and you can always just keep relying of fuel tankers or mammoth vessels with staging, like you would have had to do otherwise if you hadn\u0027t had the system as an option to play around with...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this post has been long enough, so I\u0027m just going to end it here, instead of addressing the rest of your post, allmhuran\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-24T12:56:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll this about how a Resources system *SHOULD* be done.

And I would enjoy doing it too... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Haha, reading all this, maybe I should have been a Systems Engineer instead of a Biologist...)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-24T15:19:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m not sure I\u0027d like the system to be that complex, I certainly don\u0027t want to be hauling puzzle pieces around the system just to produce a bit of fuel. Might just be easier to have water be the discoverable resource to harvest, which can then be processed into hydrogen and oxygen for liquid fuel and oxidizer, or processed into hydrogen peroxide for monopropellant.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHydrogen Peroxide is indeed used as a low-efficiency RCS propellent in the real world. It could be in the game as well...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA big part of what I was trying to get at is that some resources could be a lot easier to make with ISRU than others, thus putting a premium on those that are difficult to manufacture, and rewarding players who go through the extra effort to make the harder-to-get stuff...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would be fun *AND* realistic. For instance, Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) is rather easy to make- but Hydrazine (N2H4) is a more efficient RCS propellent. However, Hydrazine requires an extra step- combining Hydrogen Peroxide with Ammonia- making it a 3rd level product made out of two 2nd-level products (Ammonia, like Hydrogen Peroxide, isn\u0027t exactly likely to be found lying around many places- except Eve...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, players could get as in-depth or simple as they wanted with ISRU. If they just wanted to find ice and electrolyze it for LH2-LOX rocket fuel, for instance, then fine. But if they wanted to go through the complex steps of making Hydrazine or Kerosene on-site, then there could be benefits to match.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing that would also be useful, of course, to really make ISRU shine, would be a greater variety of fuels and propellents- so you can have \u0022premium\u0022 fuels that are more difficult to make, like Kerosene, but have benefits (Kerosene, for instance, is much denser than LH2- so you can pack a lot more propellent mass, and thus Delta-V, into a given sized/mass fuel can... but it gets less ISP than LH2 when burned wit LOX.) Rather than needing to introduce entirely new parts for the different fuels and such, most of these could be handled with tweakables- much like RealFuels mod currently does with selecting a fuel can to carry Kerosene/LOX vs. LH2/LOX...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere I go mentioning another mod though... It\u0027s no coincidence that modders have chosen some of the best ideas to implement, however- otherwise why would they have bothered with the effort?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt may be an ideological difference between us here, in that I\u0027m not really all that interested in resource harvesting being a scavenger hunt and chemistry minigame; I\u0027d prefer it to just be a method to replenish ships at faraway destinations in exchange for some infrastructure deployment. I see where you\u0027re coming from about having resource discovery and harvesting being more of a puzzle than a simple mechanic, it just doesn\u0027t appeal to me like it does to you (and some others in the thread).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you wanted to make use of ISRU (rather than ignore it), but wanted a more hands-off approach, there would be a solution for that too... Spend a lot of time/effort scouting out a location with multiple useful resources, and build a single integrated (with docking ports in stock, or KAS with mods) ground base that can process all these different resources in one place. If you can find such an ideal location, of course- one might not exist in your save. If not, you could always build a single orbital station somewhere like the Jool system, with all the needed refineries, and just transport various raw materials to it (from the different moons) to make what you need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, like I said, part of the fun/complexity would be that there would usually be an \u0022easy solution\u0022 and an \u0022efficient/best solution\u0022- with the latter requiring a lot more effort on the player\u0027s part, but getting you more useful fuels, or higher production rates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn ISRU, there\u0027s always a simple way to brute-force it, and a complex way to be efficient. Need lots of fuel for propellent, and O2 for life support and Oxidizer, on Duna, for instance? You *could* set up a simple brute-force station with a lot of power to simply mine lots of water-ice, and simply electrolyze it to get all the H2 and O2 you could ever want, for low-density, high-ISP chemical propellent (though you might have to cryogenically store it in real life, I doubt this would ever be added in-game, even though it would just be a matter of costing EC/s...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*OR* you could take the same H2 and O2, and combine it with CO2 harvested from the atmosphere in the Sabatier Reaction to make methane (CH4- which can pack more densely into fuel cans than H2) and more water (H2O- which you can electrolyze for more H2 and O2).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*OR* if you\u0027re REALLY ambitious, you could combine the H2 with CO2 in the Reverse Water Gas Shift Reaction to get H2O and CO, and then combine the CO with H2 in the Fischer-Tropsch Reaction to make Kerosene (6-12 Carbon hydrocarbon mixture), which can be packed even more densely into fuel cans for even more Delta-V, but lower ISP...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sky and your imagination (and your available equipment/storage space) is the limit with In Situ Resource Utilization! It\u0027s an end-game feature that could be expanded as long and as far as the devs want (all the way to making plastics with the Fischer-Tropsch Reaction for a very different type of resource harvesting: greenhouses for life-support...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, it would have to start simple. But it\u0027s one of those features that could be expanded and expanded and expanded upon whenever the devs got bored with other stuff, if ISRU turned out to be a hit with players... And if not, it could always be a nice supplemental feature that nobody would really have to use if they didn\u0027t want to...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve said quite enough for a while, so let me wind up by saying I truly hope the devs re-consider adding \u0022Resources\u0022 (ISRU) some day soon... I just hope it\u0027ll get a chance to shine someday- though of course not until other \u0022more important\u0022 things are improved (like improved aerodynamics, Career Mode, and at the least diversifying the fuels a bit more- so you can choose to use Kerosene/LOX vs. CH4/LOX vs. LH2/LOX with tweakables at the very least...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-24T15:25:14Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2014 03:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
