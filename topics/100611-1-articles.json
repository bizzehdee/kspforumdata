Each with more or less their own agenda.\n\nSince I neither have the programming or artistic talent,not the money to fund this.\n\nAlpha 66 is an RTS following the base building concept put forward by the classics of C\u0026C \u0026 limited unit caps of Ground Control.\n\nFor the human factions building bases \u0026 maintaining a population will be the order of business.\n\nWhile the alien factions will have to deal with limited troops send down from a mothership in orbit.\n\nThe different factions will be described in detail later,but I\u0027m going to use examples of existing factions in other games to try \u0026 explain their reasoning.\n\nI\u0027m sharing it here,if someone picks it up (please do \u0026 please mention me),I will expand the lore ect... over the coming weeks,16 years are hard to condense into a single post.\n\nPrelude\n\nIt\u0027s the 37\u0027th century. A 1000 years have passed since the Merkath crusade swept through our galaxy wiping out all live.\n\nAs predicted the radiation from the Energicium deposits on Alpha 66 blinded the Merkath life detect sensors, allowing 10 million humans to be \n\nthe first beings to ever survive a crusade.\n\nHowever things didn\u0027t go as plan,communications between the 5 stasis facilities has been interrupted, you are in command of 1.\n\nThings for the Merkath haven\u0027t gone on as planned either, a 1000 years ago on the home of some bipedal species something happened.\n\nAnd the tribesmen,the slaves that operated the crusades extermination machines rebelled,for the first time ever a crusade will fail. \n\nHistory\n\n \\*one billion years ago\n\n -Alusians evolved on Krepallis IV\n\n -Alusians explore \u0026 colonize the Milky Way galaxy\n\n -13th Merkath crusade \n\n -Alusians gone extinct\n\n \\*2th half 21th century\n\n -Pulse-jump drive allow humanity to travel at FTL speeds\n\n -United Earth Nations founded to represent humanity in event of first contact\n\n \\*22th century\n\n -Mass scale colonisation Sol system finished\n\n -First exo-solar colonies founded\n\n -Energy to matter conversion invented\n\n \\*23th century\n\n -Mass exploration of the galaxy\n\n -Charting of Alpha Star cluster\n\n -Alpha 66 discovered\n\n -Energicium discovered on ALpha 66\n\n -First use recorded of build paste \u0026 fuel cells\n\n \\*24th century\n\n -Alpha 66 colonized\n\n -Survey of the galaxy reveal no other civilization beyond our own\n\n -Terran federation established\n\n \\*26th century\n\n -Ruins of the Alusians discoverd on Krepallis IV\n\n \\*27th century\n\n -14th Mertkath crusade\n\n \\*28th century\n\n -Predicted reawakening of humans in stasis on Alpha 66\n\n \\*37th \n\n -Actual reawakening of humans in stasis on Alpha 66\n\nTechnology \u0026 items\n\n Pulse-jump\n\n Way of travelling faster then light\n\n Fuel-Cells\n\n Containers that contain a semi-fluid,semi-solid fuel\n\n Buildpaste\n\n Substance used by humans to build structures \u0026 vehicles,can be \u0027transmuted\u0027 in materials desired\n\n Energicium Crystal\n\n Found on Alpha 66,emits unknown radiation (harmless to lifeforms),grows by absorbing em radiation \u0026 turning it into matter\n\nRaces\n\nHumans\n\n Place of origin:Earth\n\n Average Height: -\n\n Average lifespan: 90-120 standard years\n\n Type: humanoid\n\n Status: alive, survived 14th crusade\n\nAlusians\n\n Place of origin: Krepallis IV\n\n Average Height: -\n\n Average lifespan: 70-90 standard years\n\n Type: humanoid\n\n Status: wiped out 13th crusade\n\nMerkath\n\n Place of origin: Merkathi Prime (Merkath\u0027s prison galaxy)\n\n Average height: -\n\n Average lifespan: 25-40/100-125 standard years\n\n Type: humanoid\n\n Status: alive\n\nPlasma-Worm(Merkath \u0026 Terra race)\n\n Place of origin:unknown\n\n Average length: 10.000 km\n\n Average lifespan: unknown (although at least 14 billion standard years)\n\n Type: hydrogen plasma based lifeform\n\n Status: alive\n\nFactions\n\n\\*Uniteds (U.E.N.)\n\n The uniteds wish to reestablish the Terran Federation \u0026 democracy,their military units are best compared to the GDI out of C\u0026C (visually) \n\n\\*Energicum Corp\n\n The largest mining consortium on Alpha 66,they want to reastablish human dominance over the galaxy but would rather see CEO\u0027s instead of politicians in charge\n\n Best compared to the caldari from the MMO (politically) and the Ordos from Dune (military)\n\n\\*The Mercs\n\n Only instrested in one thing,money and who pays the most money.\n\n\\*The protectared of Messar\n\n Often called the gypsies of space,although they find this offensive,the people who often the teachings of Messar are nomads that wander the galaxy.\n\n Their bases consist out of mobile structures.\n\n\\*The Hive\n\n Former top sciencetists who believe that the 14th Crusade was a sign that humanity must evolve.\n\n You can compare them best to the Zerg form Starcraft meet the Borg from Star Trek\n\n\\*14th Crusade\n\n Without their slaves,the leaders of the 14th crusade have turned to the forbidden technologies to continue thier quest,to wipe out all multicellular live in\n\n our universe.

Crusades war machine work\n\nI should clarify maybe about ageing units/unit cap\n\nThe human factions don\u0027t have a unit cap but their units age, and become less efficient over time.The united faction can for instance retire older units and temporary pass the experience of the retired unit to new ones trained build.\n\nI will discuss the concept further in a game mechanics post.\n\nThe Merkath have a unit cap,you will be able to produce new units on the motherships,but not infinite\n\nThe crusader has 2 handicaps that are part of the upcoming lore\n\nThe tribes are more guerilla sneak \u0026 ambush but more about that later\n\nAs for the crusades goal,there out to kill all live whether its human,animal or plant, their reasoning is part of the lore I\u0027m still writing down
