They\u0027re getting ridiculous:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP 1.1 likes to parse all the save files in your folder in order to display information like budget, date, flights reputation etc. Now, if you play career for a certain time your save file gets really big. Like 8\u002BMB. If you have a lot of backups, like I do, then you run into 190\u002B files having that size. In that case KSP just needs ages to load the loading screen in which you can choose the file to load. That\u0027s a no-go in my eyes. KSP 1.0.5 simply listed the file names and everything was fast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo put that on a scale: With my quadcore 3.5 GHz machine it takes the program approximately 10 seconds to parse 10 savefiles of 8MB each (from hitting \u0022Load Save\u0022 to getting the response in terms of a list).
