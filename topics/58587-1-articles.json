I know, sounds silly, but try it. Just build the first in the series of rockets you want, then, what ever location you want to be the cut off point for a section, break it off at the proper decoupler \u0026lt;taking the decoupler WITH that section you just cut off\u0026gt; and drop it into the subassembly thingy. Then do this again with the next section and so on, OR, you could do like me, build the whole thing, then break the rocket off at the upper most decoupler right below the uh payload \u0026lt;be it a lander, a probe, a satellite or what ever it may be\u0026gt; and call the entire thing below that junction the subassembly. Seems to work for me. hope that helped\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"biohazard15","CreatedById":91655,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T09:09:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBuild your launcher from top to bottom (so the root part is on top and has a free attachment node), save it as subassembly (select a root part), then attach it to the bottom of your payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr vice versa - save your payload as subassembly, then attach it to prebuilt launcher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for staging - you have to manually rearrange, then check, then double-check it every time.

All you need to stick to then is to use the same \u0022interface\u0022 to stick the launcher and payload together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy approach was the opposite - I had launchers saved as ships, and payloads as subassemblies. My reason was that I had way more payloads than launchers and it made my ships folder less cluttered. It also allowed me to combine multiple smaller payloads on one lifter. I could also stick my payloads to planes if I wanted but I never did that. This approach required me to always build the payload bottom up, i.e. start at the point which will attach to the launcher.
