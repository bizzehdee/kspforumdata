I\u0027ve identified, fixed and given a full explanation. Down to one stupid little thing. So frustrating! It\u0027s fixed; now moving on. The dust works in the configs again. I had added a FIFO buffer into the dust, which takes away the sudden changes when the biome switches, as well as adding fixes for the dust camera making the dust look washed out and white. Ignore the commenting out of the KSPField\u0027s in the dust module; I was trying to narrow down what was causing the reflection error, which I was successful at in the end. I also found numerous bits I must have added in which weren\u0027t working as (presumably originally) expected, and have removed them. I can\u0027t see what effect the variance stuff is having, other than washing out the dust again?\u003Cp\u003EAnd the step size thing is making no sense; what\u0027s that about? Be very, very careful if you\u0027re trying to change the step size of the sliders. There\u0027s some interaction with action groups that may lead to some unexpected consequences without further checking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI totally missed that post, and so now I\u0027m dealing with a compromise fix between the two \u0022fixes\u0022 we both did, independently during the crisis the other day, that is giving me nullrefs that I cannot trace for some errant reason. The trouble I had, which led me to committing changes that fixed things back to how they should have been, was due to the fact that you \u003Cem\u003Edid\u003C/em\u003E commit a change that included what appeared, at the time, to be like doing an ice-pick lobotomy on it. (Which, by the way, is incredibly easy to perform. If anyone wants a lobotomy, I\u0027d be happy to experiment on them in my home. No guarantees over survival of the victim... err subject.) Anyway, that\u0027s all great. I just need to get a hold of that state of the source to work with so I can try to re-add my color variance to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, I totally don\u0027t understand what you\u0027re trying to do with the dust size. The reason it\u0027s set with respect to \u0022tweakScaleCorrector\u0022 is because it\u0027s supposed to scale with the size of the part. It\u0027s not clamped to an adjustable maximum because I wanted to make sure that there \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E a maximum that it could ever reach so we don\u0027t get rocket-booster-sized dust when TS reports an extreme scale value and sets our variable way too high. I already have the tweakScaleCorrector set to 1 if the part reports that it is a repulsor, since KFRepulsor doesn\u0027t use tweakScaleCorrector for anything, but setting that variable to 1 from the KFModuleWheel class as well completely circumvents any interaction with the TweakScale mod. Besides, the variable in the dust module that sets itself from tweakScaleCorrector (and is also named the same, which was only confusing for a few days when I first implemented that) automatically defaults to 1 before searching for any other value. Besides all that, when you renamed that variable to scaleCorrector (or something like that) it never got changed in the rest of the calculations and so you\u0027d be left with it trying to multiply it\u0027s values by a nonexistent variable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the slider for dust size and whatnot, I did that a long time ago so I could understand the different variables and what they did. That\u0027s how I got the information for the summaries about what represents what. I\u0027m curious though... what does FIFO stand for?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: just watched the video... adding a slider to the GUI was totally \u003Cem\u003Enot \u003C/em\u003Ewhat I\u0027d done before. That\u0027s awesome. That adds the possibility of all owing the end user to also limit the dust activity for more refined performance control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and I forgot to talk about the other slider. So, I\u0027ve tested that system a LOT and it seems to work without issue. I made a number of modifications to the current set of action group related methods and it\u0027s all quite stable. Basically, this lets you set the amount that will be added/subtracted from the ride height with every hit of the action group and/or when you side it with the ride-height slider (though, now that I talk about it here, I think I\u0027ll remove the change to the slider itself. \u003Cem\u003EThat\u003C/em\u003E could get awkward.) I\u0027ve already added clamps to the values so that if you\u0027re at, say rideHeight of 12, and pick an interval of 20, then it will try to increment the value by -20 and will clamp that value to the minimum (which is zero). Same with the maximum of course. I\u0027ve fully integrated this into the repulsors and the wheels/tracks along with all the \u0022apply\u0022 methods for both \u0022apply to all\u0022 and \u0022apply only to a single part\u0022 situations. This means it also works when using action groups to apply the settings across all wheels. However, to make things even easier to work with, it also checks the slider value on the update method and sets the new value for the action groups and slider on that update interval so that everything stays updated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I realize there\u0027s a lot that could go wrong in there, but I\u0027ve tested it thoroughly (at least, I hope I have) and it all seems stable at the moment. However, now that I may have a working example of a GUI slider in action, I may remove all of that from there and make it into a KFPersistenceNanager variable with a slider which will then apply to all action-group related activity, but leaving the standard ride-height slider interval completely untouched. This seems like a better way to do it overall, reducing the number of sliders on each part\u0027s context menu.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe whole feature was created simply so I could make each press of the action group I set for \u0022increase height\u0022 to increase by a larger or smaller number than the default \u002B/- 5. I\u0027ve also added preset levels for action groups, though I\u0027m nowhere near being able to create user-specified presets like we can do in IR.

I have \u003Cem\u003Eno clue\u003C/em\u003E how that became constant, because I know for a fact that no field should ever be constant. I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s a left over situation from before it was a field at all. I made that a field when I discovered one of the other devs (probably you) had experimented with a different effect model. The only part which makes use of that field right now is the Mole track, due to it\u0027s massive size I set it to use the medium effect instead of the standard light effect. I really have no idea if it has any affect on the final output of the particles though. It was an experiment I never tested fully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so we need to get our code synced up again.

If someone is having issues with lag due to a part like a repulsor, then updates the plugin with the fix, the parts seem to get updated with the new state of things when they are initialized and the game is back to normal more or less.

My recent commit won\u0027t be entirely stable in that area, but it\u0027s not going to hurt anything.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m starting to breathe again now that I\u0027ve got everything merged up and I just committed what I have right now. I\u0027ve totally deprecated the unnecessary variable that simply stated whether or not the dust was activated in the KFDustFX module. That one was left over from when I was converting from CollisionFX in which there were parts of the module that would work even if the dust itself was not activated. I forget now what it was called, but it\u0027s gone now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI need to take a nap now. I\u0027m exhausted after all that work to get things back in order again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I said, they will make legends out of days like these one day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, love the tests being done with maxRPM. I never tried setting it to anything insane like 40k. Must have been rather entertaining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: One thing I\u0027ve discovered from all of my testing and whatnot is that totally \u0022breaking\u0022 a save is actually quite difficult. Granted, I\u0027ve never tried any of this with a career save, but I\u0027ve been running the same persistence since KSP version 0.23.5 without issue. Yes, I\u0027ve had to manually edit a few things to keep everyone happy in it, and I recently added Val into it by starting a second save and copying over the necessary data from the roster, but nother was every \u0022broken\u0022 by any of this stuff. If someone is having issues with lag due to a part like a repulsor, then updates the plugin with the fix, the parts seem to get updated with the new state of things when they are initialized and the game is back to normal more or less. What mostly contributes to \u0022broken\u0022 saves is when a bug like this is encountered and the user simply deletes the entire mod, parts and all. \u003Cem\u003EThen\u003C/em\u003E things start to legitimately break.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s been a trying few days, hasn\u0027t it!

I must say the behavior is very realistic. It slides when turning at high speed, jumps etc. \u003Cp\u003EFew problems are there, anyways. WHen climbing steep slopes the suspension is always compressed 100%. ALso, it is quite easy to compress 100% during rapid movements etc. Maybe you can make its stiffness nonlinear, increasing near full compression?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main problem is how it hadles small steps. Get long tank tracks, scale them up 50%, go to Island runway and try to drive over those building remains. Despite tracks being large enough they simply bump into those blocks. I don\u0027t know how to simulate it, but this problem deserves fixing. With KerbalKonstructs such objects become common.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreat to hear! No dice with adaptive springs I\u0027m afraid. To update that, you either need to disable the collider or have it leave contact with anything, either of which isn\u0027t practical. The wheel colliders are what they are, and that\u0027s that I\u0027m afraid. Something I would love to have more control over, but there it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know exactly what you mean, and it\u0027s a tricky problem to tackle. It\u0027s mostly, again, a wheel collider limitation. They\u0027re only one dimensional raycasts designed for arcade driving games (IMHO), so put them in a situation outside that and the simulation starts to break down, which is a shame. There are limits to how far you can bodge things :/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sashan","CreatedById":98897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T21:48:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, there should be some way around that...
