I\u0027m nearly finished with an IVA, but part of the pod that matches the IVA can be seen shaking separately when there is a lot of turbulence or jostling. \n\nThe offender:\n\n-Kinda hard to see, but the thin white line at the top of the grey bar is what is bouncing around. It is part of the mesh on the outside (see picture below).\n\n![a9ZmiRc.png](http://i.imgur.com/a9ZmiRc.png)\n\nWhat it looks like from the outside:\n\nThe grey piece along the canopy there is what I\u0027m referring to. The whole frame for the glass is a separate object, so is there a tag or something in Unity that I could apply to it?\n\n![gKsZKmuh.png](http://i.imgur.com/gKsZKmuh.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-10T06:34:48Z\u0022 title=\u002203/10/2015 06:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Quiznos323**"},{"CreatedByName":"McPoisoned","CreatedById":138265,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T08:08:39Z","Content":"How about replacing the parts of the cockpit that shake and anoy you with an actual color and not a transparent window?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-10T08:11:09Z\u0022 title=\u002203/10/2015 08:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by McPoisoned**"},{"CreatedByName":"Quiznos323","CreatedById":114900,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T08:31:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E How about replacing the parts of the cockpit that shake and anoy you with an actual color and not a transparent window?\n\nHm, I\u0027m not sure what you mean.
