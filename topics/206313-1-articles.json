It\u0027s tricky, though. You have to pass very low because the air there is thin. Afterwards you\u0027ll need to do another burn to get the low point of your orbit back up out of the atmosphere.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WebAdmin","CreatedById":218492,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-07T23:36:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHm that would be hard to accomplish, since I would some how need to reach Duna first.

You have to determine both a place in the orbit and for how long to burn.
