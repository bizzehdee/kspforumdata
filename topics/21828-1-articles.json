One day, a measly store clerk. But then I heard of the KSP. The wonders rockets, bases on places further away than anyone could imagine. I had to join, right? This is my tale, the story of Fredwick Kerman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter months of vigorous training, my supervisors began to watch me. I didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t see it at first, but slowly my assignments and workouts got tougher and tougher, and more and more quit. By the end of it, only nine were left. We were assigned different tasks; I was to be part of B group, and fly a cargo ship to Minmus Base Alpha. I was happy to get an assignment, and everyone B group was too. Dangel and Kerwich, they called themselves. It turned out our hope was to be lost. In the forty years since the dawn of the KSP, getting to Minmus had become routine. It was still exciting, and we were all happy. Our real job was unloading and staying at the base as EVA officials. Minmus Base Alpha turned out to be a relaxing place. EVAs in the low gravity were easy and fun, so we all were happy. After three months, we got the message to go to Space Station Omega, and report for a new mission. Details were scarce.
