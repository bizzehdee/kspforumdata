For example imagine the digit 0.9 as a cause and 1 as the first cause (Prime Mover) if you add all the 0.9\u0027 together then Aristotle believes you get 1. However 0.9 recurring will not reach 1 no matter how many 9 you add. Just like this no matter how far back you go in causes you will never reach the first cause. So then if this is true then Aristotle has not solved his problem of infinite regression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm i right or have i misunderstood something? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry if you can\u0027t under stand what i am trying to say, it is difficult for me to put this in words.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-07T17:45:04Z\u0022 title=\u002210/07/2014 05:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by worir4\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-07T22:11:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIIRC 0.9999...recurring = 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut anyway what do these numbers have to do with an infinite \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Eregression\u003C/span\u003E regress of causality?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-08T13:32:41Z\u0022 title=\u002210/08/2014 01:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Cpt.
