But if you even turn on one engine, even at 0% throttle, it begins intense stuttering. Right click and wiggle mouse to notice. Turning off the engine(s) will resolve the problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/fhau3lhovagb2xf/KB-52%201_7_3_2594%20x108%208_3.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/fhau3lhovagb2xf/KB-52 1_7_3_2594 x108 8_3.craft?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a version of the craft with rotary stuff on the front.

But I thought I would bring it up so it might get fixed later. Unless this is just something on my end or I\u0027m missing something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis also stuttered before the expansions were installed for me. Previous versions of the game stuttered just on the runway with nothing running or in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E. Although making a new save got rid of stutter in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E while not activating settings on parts and the auto stutter on the runway was gotten rid of prior to activating an engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone get the engine stutter in the current game?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I took off all of the engines and slaped a single one on and it goes away. I think this is from parts count. My question is why does this happen with a single rapier engine with 0% thrust, but not a bunch of rotary blades rotating?! I\u0027m assuming it\u0027s the garbage collector, but why with the rapiers and no the rotary blades? Can this be fixed? Is there anything I can do on my end besides reduce parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote: At full 688 parts, with no stutter the game goes at about 5 second real life per in game second. What I assume is FPS lag. With the stutter it takes approximately 15 seconds in real life per in game second. That means a total of 10 seconds of stutter. It, from previous observations, stuttered 5 times in an in game second for me. That means 2 seconds per stutter basically. Just from turning on one rapier with 0% throttle on the runway. That when off produces no stutter and normal 5 second lagginess.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust replaced the engines with new parts form the fresh game. Didn\u0027t resolve it. So, it may still be a thing. The craft file is originally from an older version. Or before I installed the expansions. I\u0027m not sure when I last rebuilt it completely. I have done partial rebuilds in 1.7.3 though. So, the engines were possibly already the newest rendition. The engines are the most likely thing in my build to be swapped out. It\u0027s designed to make this as fast and easy as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEdit: I was hoping 1.8 would fix this problem but it doesn\u0027t. It stills stuttered just the same. It\u0027s something to do with engines.

Since it only happens on old engines I was hoping this was fixable. It does not seem to effect rotors and new air based solutions. Could the redo they old engines to remove this stutter problem?!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: It seems this does not happen in orbit either. So, it\u0027s related to lots of engines in an atmosphere regardless of if they have throttle but if even one is on it happens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also added all nose cones but one engine so the parts count was the same and it did reduce the lag problem.

But there is still something about older engines that cause a 1 second stutter per second potentially at higher part counts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit2: Nvm, it does happen in orbit. It does not stutter in air breathing mode in orbit with 0% throttle. But does in closed cycle...
