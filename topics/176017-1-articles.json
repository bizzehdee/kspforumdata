I was almost always sitting at the computer while I drove.\u00A0I used MechJeb to hold speed and heading, but not anything else. I did have a MechJeb part on here, so I guess this will qualify as Modded even though I didn\u0027t mean it to be and all other parts and physics are stock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve never spent any time on the surface of Kerbin besides launching and landing craft, so this was definitely new for me. Travelling across the land wasn\u0027t actually as bad as I thought; I quicksaved ~250 times, while only loading a few dozen.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe route I took stayed entirely between 45N and 45S, so I had to cross water 7 times, and mountains 3 times. I averaged 25-30 m/s on land, though got up to 70 on some slopes. I could get 25 m/s on water at full throttle, but could get 20 m/s for two thirds the fuel so I did that. I still had to refuel once, which further made me hate the mini-converter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, pics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00220QOUXRv.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022575\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/0QOUXRv.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe route. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E is the cluster of two flags above and to the right of the crater, on the other side of Kerbin.\u00A0I went over Booster Bay down the peninsula on the other side, then hopped across two islands to the next continent. Driving across that took ages, but there were mountain crossings I set up which helped the boredom. Then I drove down the peninsula to 42S, then came up it, which you can see in the front. Two more Ocean crossings\u00A0got me to the Desert continent, and another returned me back to Kafrica and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Ignore the HyperEdit icon, I didn\u0027t use it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022O0c4WeX.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022575\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/O0c4WeX.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe craft. Looking back, I probably could have replaced the mining section with fuel and removed the need to refuel, but that\u0027s fine. I spent 10 days mining in one location, which definitely slowed me down. Overall, it was a good craft, though, and I\u0027m proud of it. Hopefully this is enough documentation, and will post about this in the main Elkano thread once approved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFull Album:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/gallery/4Cbik8Z\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/gallery/4Cbik8Z\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-06-19T16:55:28Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2018 04:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by EndIris\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAlbum Link\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
