Could you guys take a moment out from building awesome aircraft and explain what your flight profile is like now.\n\nCheck the captions on the Imgur album; I describe the profile for that ship there.\n\nIn general, though: after take off, settle into a climb of sufficient steepness that, although you continue accelerating, will not take you above Mach 3 (roughly 900m/s) until you\u0027re over 20,000m. Gradually flatten off your climb as you go; you want to build as much speed as possible, but you need to stay above the speed/altitude BBQ curve.\n\nOnce you\u0027re over 20,000m, you can pile on the speed as you slowly climb to about 25,000m, at which point your jets will start losing thrust and your speed will begin to drop. Kick in the rockets immediately; you\u0027ll lose too much speed if you try to maximise jet altitude. Keep it pointed close to prograde during the rocket burn; upper-altitude drag is minimal in stock, so a long coast to apoapsis isn\u0027t a problem.\n\nFor reentry, it\u0027s once again about that speed/altitude BBQ curve. You have to wash off the speed before you drop below the altitude at which that speed is survivable. You don\u0027t need airbrakes; just come down with a 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 AoA and a few S-turns and you\u0027ll be fine.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T09:47:06Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 09:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound**"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T09:52:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Check the captions on the Imgur album; I describe the profile for that ship there. snip\\*\n\nI noticed the album comments just after I posted.
