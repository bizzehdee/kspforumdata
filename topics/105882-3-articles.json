Gradually flatten off your climb as you go; you want to build as much speed as possible, but you need to stay above the speed/altitude BBQ curve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027re over 20,000m, you can pile on the speed as you slowly climb to about 25,000m, at which point your jets will start losing thrust and your speed will begin to drop. Kick in the rockets immediately; you\u0027ll lose too much speed if you try to maximise jet altitude. Keep it pointed close to prograde during the rocket burn; upper-altitude drag is minimal in stock, so a long coast to apoapsis isn\u0027t a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor reentry, it\u0027s once again about that speed/altitude BBQ curve.
