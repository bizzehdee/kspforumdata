I\u0027ve done moderately successful mods for Skyrim and Morrowind before, so I have the general know how to get a project started and to see it through to the end. However, I\u0027ve always been troubled by what exactly TO mod for KSP. While I could do a parts mod, I found during my stints with those other games that the modeling process took up a disproportionate amount of my free time (and their communities were not the greatest, as I had great trouble with the conversion process and most would not actually help me and instead would just blindly refer me to tutorials I had already read) so I\u0027ve been hesitant to do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I decided to start thinking about what else I could do. And thats when it came to me that I could do something that I have, honestly been wishing someone would do for a while now. As I\u0027ve been playing KSP more and more and my missions and spacecraft become more sophisticated, the more I\u0027m beginning to run into that wall where you go somewhere, and you just have nothing to do other than to pretend you\u0027re doing something. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my time playing this game, I have seen several people start up projects that seemed promising for providing that essential \u0022Stuff to Do!\u0022 that stock KSP lacks, but never get off the ground or go somewhere and then end up in the \u0022What could have been\u0022 pile. The Geology mod was a notable example. At the same time, there are a couple of mods, Interstellar being the biggest example, that provide some awesome experiments that you can do but require either utilizing the entire mod or stripping the mod to just get the science parts, which can be a bit of a hassle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the mod I propose to do is essentially a complete overhaul of the Science system, bringing all of these great ideas that have cropped up over the years under one roof along with several of my own to create a the quintessential science mod. But whats included in that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first thing to do, and one that I think will be the first goal just to get my feet wet, will be to introduce a TON (in the order of hundreds) of experiments. Naturally, introducing such a large amount of experiments might require a lot of parts, and potentially a lot of bloat. So my idea is to condense it by making so that the actual science parts that end up being included are more general parts that can perform a wide variety of experiments. The same thermometer part might be able to perform 3 or 4 different experiments. The same Gravioli experiment could do up to 10 different experiments, and so on and so forth. If possible, what experiments the parts can perform will be locked to the tech tree, so that as you progress you\u0027ll unlock different experiment parts and new experiments for the ones you already have. Something I want to look into is experiments that take time to complete, possibly based off of the Research option for the science lab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point of this is to support a wider variety of mission types to a much larger variety of areas and situations, and more importantly, provide a reason to revisit areas even with the same experiment parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat will come along with this (and more than likely afterwords) will be a re-balance of the tech tree, because obviously that will have to be done to support the quantity of experiments being introduced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, is an overhaul of how the Report experiment works for both IVA and EVA, as well as for Probes. I want to introduce a wider variety of situations for these reports to be taken in. Hitting Mach 1 for the first time. Flying an open spacecraft on an airless world. Airbraking in a gas giant versus a gentle dip into the atmosphere. Being at the rim of a crater versus the epicenter. And so on. Realizing this part will likely require coding, which is something I\u0027ll have to learn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that comes the part that I know will require extensive coding, and that is the overhaul for Surface sampling (which in turn will likely also be an overhaul of how biomes work). My idea for this has been that:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Surface samples should have weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Their values should randomized, and even more preferably determined by a much more in-depth \u0022biome map\u0022 for samples. Essentially, you should have to search for valuable samples to bring home. Every surface sample will have some value, but you will have to search the area you are in to find more valuable ones. There will be certain areas of any given world that might not have any valuable samples. Some areas might have super valuable samples. The thing is, you can\u0027t make it so you can sit in one spot and just repeatedly click collect until you get a good one. But you also can\u0027t make the \u0022map\u0022 for samples so well defined that you can cover a circle around 10m of your landing craft and end up with a 100 different samples.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the idea then is to make it so that each variety of sample (from the practically worthless to the ultra rare) takes up a certain portion of the \u0022map\u0022 that can translate to a very massive area for worthless samples (which will likely be present everywhere you go regardless, filling in the voids between the more valuable samples) and to a very specific 2-3m area for the ultra rare samples.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiving a point to exploration without it being a grind is the key point. (and lets face it, if this is too grindy for you then you aren\u0027t likely bothering with science anyway)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn doing this, I also hope to change how biomes work. The \u0022East Crater\u0022, instead of being a homogeneous area, would be an area that would produce a wide variety of results for experiments based on where exactly you are within the biome\u0027s area. The rim of the East Crater would produce different results compared to the epicenter. Some results will be slightly different. Others would be vastly different. And so on, for the different areas that may be present within the biome itself. Again, the point is to give a point to exploration and stop the current trend where you land in one spot and that covers the entire area. As such, different biomes will be more or less valuable than others. Mun\u0027s Midlands will be pretty basic. The Canyon will be fairly valuable. The Poles a lot more valuable. Areas with anomalies (which I intend to make their own mini-biomes) will be super valuable, but only for a few experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlong this same line will be more experiments, but this time ones that require extensive coding. Things like my own take on Seismic experiments (Such as impactors, or readings that require multiple seismometers in a variety of locations such as seen in Interstellar, except more indepth), experiments that require specific situations or multiple copies spread out (again based on Seismic experiments), as well as experiments for craft development, among other things. Think Graphotron, except extended to do even more real science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo thats my idea, as it stands in my head right now. What I would like is just some opinions from the community on whether or not this is something that\u0027s wanted, as well as what else you think might go well along these lines. I do realize that this is quite a bit to lay out without having even begun any work, however I do want to reassure anyone whose concerned about that (and I know there will be some who will be piping up with this issue) that I do know what I\u0027m doing when laying this out like this. I have taken up and completed mods of this general scope before and worked on mods that were of an even larger scope, so long story short, I am prepared.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T03:12:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile I personally would not do this, I think by now it\u0027s mostly due to the fact that I\u0027m old and stodgy in my ways.

And with these sorts of \u0022complicated\u0022 experiments I fully intend for it to be as smooth a procedure to do. Interstellar does its seismic experiment by requiring a siesmometer on the surface and set to a certain mode (I forget what the phrasing was) and then all you have to do is impact the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy version will be almost the exact same, but expanded to include full body readings (requiring multiple copies of the device spread out around the entire body) as well as partial body readings and even biome specific readings. Essentially the idea is that its really up to the player on how far you want to take it. YOu can land the device and just crash something into the surface with science increasing the closer you crash to the experiment, or you can go bigger and take a measure of the entire body. May be multiple impacts will give you more data. And so on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe that any game when it comes to how \u0022complex\u0022 it is should largely depend on how deep the player wants their game to be. It should be complex enough that those who like to crunch numbers and really grind out the most points can do so, while at the same time being intuitive and simple enough that a player who just wants to fly can do a simple experiment and be done with it. Balance wise, the simple route wouldn\u0027t give you a big boost, but would still be a viable option (with the increased amount of experiments that will be available in even the simplest of landers, there\u0027s still a lot of science to gather whether you go complex or just go through it), and the complex route would take a bit of effort to accomplish, but give a significant boost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAutomation would be a big part of it, and I think for the more complex experiments, like the ever present Seismic example, there shouldn\u0027t have to be any right clicking or really even any tedium on the players part other than fulfilling the experiments requirements. So, you land your seismometer and its ready to go. Just crash something into the surface, or, time warp a bit and get a reading of the natural activity. This could even be expanded to where experiments are constantly flinging reports regardless of whether you are there or not. So you land the same device and leave it. Then later you start crashing stuff into the surface. That same seismometer should still be feeding data, and combining with any other devices that have been landed since. For players with RT2, this could be expanded to where the device needs to be attached to a probe and connected and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd even for simple experiments, automation would really be ideal, especially for Manned missions. Kerbals are more than just monkeys after all, let them do something. Things like EVA/IVA reports should collected periodically in any given biome and collected when transferring from one biome to the next. Surface samples would require player input, but considering the massive potential samples would have with this mod, that does balance out. After all, the point is to make it so there are actually things to do once you go somewhere. Finding the awesome samples is the simplest way to encourage long term activity on the surface of any particular body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also feel I should clarify with the whole \u0022100 experiments\u0022 bit. In reality, I most likely won\u0027t have this amount of experiments initially, though I think in the end the amount of possible experiments will total this number. In reality, any initial release would likely just be an enhancement to the stock experiments, with additions here and there. The key point of an initial release at this time will just be a proof of concept for experiments that take time to complete as well as unlockable experiments via the tech tree. With just plain KSP code, most of the initial experiments will just be extra flavor rather than actual gameplay elements. As time goes on, the experiments will get deeper and may require new, specific parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is a fantastic idea.

I also have an idea on the backburner for a tech tree overhaul that follows a more realistic progression, that simplistically can\u0027t even be explained properly because it would be such an indepth tree. I actually typed out the progression from start to finish and it was over 20000 characters according to the text editor here. Essentially it was flight first with progression that focused on \u0022eras\u0022 in aeronautical and astronautical engineering, with transition periods and a choice to either continue aeronautics up to a certain point or push on with rocketry, go manned or unmanned, go for spaceplanes or continued capsule development, etc etc. Instead of parts being spread out willy nilly, the idea would be that you\u0027d unlock the parts to create a certain kind of rocket and then the parts to unlock a certain kind of spacecraft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It goes a little more indepth, but the idea was to prevent a situation where you\u0027d have to do a Gemini flight to figure out how to make the Titan rocket that, in real life, launched the Gemini spacecraft. So if you had something like FASA installed, you\u0027d unlock a node and you\u0027d get everything to make the Titan ICBM, and then after that you\u0027d get another node and you\u0027d get everything to create the Gemini Spacecraft. The reasoning being that in real life, we didn\u0027t piece together spacecraft hodgepodge, but instead built what we needed to get the mission done. My idea was to keep it as open as possible so it could support anything from a 100% stock install to a 70\u002B mod install.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also included a contract overhaul that would be paired with it. During the flight engineering portion, progression would be provided almost 100% by contracts (because in real life, aircraft were not developed for purely scientific pursuits. So progression came from being paid to go faster and higher) which would wind down as science comes more to the fore front through the rocketry and spaceflight eras (and the transitional eras in between) and then snaps back to a 50/50 once commercialization comes into play. I might take what I have typed up and upload it somewhere. I think its a very interesting read even though its a gigantohuge wall of text.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd as for your advice, I completely understand, and I\u0027m eventually going to do it regardless. I just wanted to gauge how people would react to such a mod, and also crowd source some other ideas to go along with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CobaltWolf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CobaltWolf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, I certainly plan on releasing more science experiments as time goes on.

Perhaps such an overhaul as this could work by granting engineering points both automatically and for accomplishing specific feats. Bonus points could also be derived from direct collection. Testing rockets should be a thing, I think, and perhaps most parts can have their own little \u0022engineering experiments\u0022 that measure how they\u0027re handling the situation they\u0027re in. After all, and especially in the early days, rockets had all kinds of sensors on them to measure what was going on as they were operating. And of course, this system should be completely automatic (because that\u0027d be too much to ask anybody to do during a launch). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, specific feats like breaking the sound barrier, surviving reentry, etc etc could give solid moderately large boosts once you accomplish them, while non-specific feats like basic altitude and speed progression give smaller boosts as you go. At the same time, going far and beyond the basic and expected feats at whatever point in the game you\u0027re at providing larger boosts than if you accomplished them when you were expected. Landing on the Mun when you\u0027re still in the Flight Era, or accomplishing an Eve Flyby when you\u0027re still doing Gemini, etc etc. All in an effort to still reward those KSP wiz\u0027s who can go farther with less, but without alienating those who can\u0027t or don\u0027t even know how to play the game at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new science system would run side by side with this. Initial starts would just be the Crew/EVA reports and may be some very basic experiments like temperature and air pressure (which would be present automatically in cockpits as well as available as external parts). As you progress down this side, you\u0027ll start to see more in-depth atmospheric specific experiments become available. Then once you reach the spacecraft era, space specific experiments start to become available and so on and so forth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps the science tree could be split into several branches representing various scientific fields. Atmospheric science would be the basic one you start with.

And I can definitely admit that I came at it from the perspective of someone who almost never uses 100% stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea, which I do touch upon a little bit in there I think, was to re-purpose a lot of stock parts to fill in the gaps, with possible tweakscale integration to help keep the part count low. The way stock is, doing it this way wouln\u0027t look too out of place. Ideally, I think we could get away with almost no actual new parts being added. The only exception would be the flight part. This part of the game would require quite a few parts to really flesh it out well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I think given the current non-focus on aircraft KSP has in general (even with Squads plane focused updates as of late) I think its acceptable to not flesh this era out for stock players. Most 100% stock players I see typically don\u0027t do spaceplanes, and if they are, its never something that isn\u0027t meant to even reach Mach 1 if its an actual aircraft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter all, my intent is to never alienate any particular playstyle. While my system would introduce flight first, I don\u0027t thing it would be a good idea to force people to have to sludge through it if they just want to get to the rockets. Those that would install the likes of Firespitter are going to want to go through a really fleshed out flight first anyway, while those who won\u0027t more than likely would just as soon cheat their way past the flight era than actually play it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for contracts, my ideas mostly just went as far as integrating much of whats already been done with that system by other modders. Beyond restructuring the system so that it plays off the tech tree and makes it make a bit more sense (IE, kill the rather silly part test contracts altogether, and replace them with the Milestone \u0026gt; Culmination system along with general contracts for specific parameters, like Mach 1 for 5 minutes, Mach 6 and survive, etc) I haven\u0027t had much of an idea of how to overhaul the system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssentially progression in my system would work in 2 ways, basically depending on whether or not you go with a fleshed out Flight era. With a fleshed out flight era, the the start and early game becomes specifically about engineering. Creating planes, testing them, pushing the envelope. I just had a thought, as this could actually be heavily expanded if contracts were reconfigured to ask for specific plane configurations. Like planes with specific wing profles, different lengths, engine types, etc etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, once you start to see rockets, progression keeps going based on engineering. Creating rockets, testing them, and pushing what can be done. Then as time goes on, you progress into the scientific side of things, with science becoming more of the focus. More time goes on, commercialization becomes a thing, and engineering sees a greater focus again, this time with things like spaceplanes (the essential \u0022rocket/plane hybrid\u0022 point) and tourism and colonization capabilities needing to be tested. Time goes on, science comes back to the forefront. More time, engineering as you start to go interstellar. And so on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the flip side, for those who don\u0027t decide to flesh out flight, progression goes as normal, but the game doesn\u0027t become \u0022difficult\u0022 until you hit rocketry, and progression goes as above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, just to note, I am going to start work on this relatively soon.
