here\u0027s what I\u0027ve got:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI finally decided to try out a space plane.\u00A0 I\u0027m in Sandbox mode but I don\u0027t like the concept of the Rapier (one engine for both L\u002BO and airbreathing) so I committed to not using it.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI designed a plane using the MK2 body, a pair of Whiplash Jet engines and a pair of Spike Rocket engines.\u00A0 My main lift is provided by the Big Delta wings because for some reason when I try to build a wing by hand, I get a lot of flopping up and down so I\u0027m trying to find something that will give enough lift on its own.\u00A0 I was able to consistently limp this up into orbit with about 350 m/s to spare for things like rendezvous with my space station, and deorbiting.\u00A0 Sadly I rarely had the fuel to deorbit after a rendezvous unless I refueled at the station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had a mission I wanted to fly that I knew I needed some extra Detla V to use once I got up there so I had the idea to add drop tanks with liquid fuel.\u00A0 I used Decouplers to stick two Mk1 tanks with nose cones under the wings and then fuel lines to connect them to the engines.\u00A0 This was supposed to get me enough extra fuel to get up and start my acceleration run without using any of my onboard fuel.\u00A0 The plan was to take off, get up to 4km in altitude, drop the tanks and then ramp into space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat happened was this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI got up to about 270 m/s and then the plane stopped accelerating.\u00A0 I dropped my tanks and was able to get up to 310 m/s or so\u00A0 and then I hit an acceleration wall.\u00A0 If I dove, I could maybe push it up to 350 m/s and again, a wall.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I sort of fixed this by moving the drop tanks to under the main body and changing to Mk0 tanks (plus I\u0027m tight on space down there on the run way).\u00A0 This seemed to half cure the problem because now I could get up to around 320 m/s around 4km of altitude and my acceleration drops off.\u00A0 I drop the tanks, dive a bit and eventually ramp back put to an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E of 7 degrees or so and make my run at space.\u00A0 But it also doesn\u0027t seem to work well because I\u0027m not getting to space with that much spare \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E either.\u00A0 The tanks don\u0027t seem to be helping me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion 1: Do the radial decouplers create extra drag even once you\u0027ve detached the tanks?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom there I\u0027m still figuring out my whole profile\u00A0 to space.\u00A0 Before I started to play with the tanks I could set \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E to around 5 degrees and just fly up, changing from Whiplashes to Spikes around 18km in altitude when the acceleration started to drop off and the plane slowed.\u00A0 Now that I\u0027m using the tanks it\u0027s harder.\u00A0 It feels like once I start to slow my acceleration (not my speed, that caps or constantly increases even slowly), I lose my ability to punch into the 400 m/s range.\u00A0 Is the extra drag from the tanks at speeds under 300 m/s making it too hard to get past the sound barrier?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion 2:\u00A0 Is constant acceleration crucial for the Whiplash engines?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m thinking but frankly don\u0027t have the energy to experiment that I need to drop the tanks before I hit 300 m/s and the drag really becomes, well, a drag.\u00A0 So my profile would be to take off, position my flight to my desired orbital inclination, point up, and hit the gas.\u00A0 Once I see the thrust on the engines start to go down, ditch the tanks and minimize my drag profile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis whole thing came too because rather than design a new space plane (which I\u0027m trying to use more and more rather than rockets because they\u0027re re-usable), I just kept tweeking an imperfect design.\u00A0 Moving wings, adding drop tanks, etc.\u00A0 On the one hand, my frustration came because I\u0027d been using this plane to go up to the station consistently, and then swapping out the extra passenger cabin for more cargo space, or fuel.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion 3:\u00A0 Am I the only person who refuses to give up on a design just because it fails and instead keep trying to tweek it better?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-08T14:33:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote
