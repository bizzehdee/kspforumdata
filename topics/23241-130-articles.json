It\u0027s entirely possible to make nice looking \u0022bulges\u0022 with 1.25m cylinders and existing endpieces, which I did on Strugatsky sample craft, I think. It\u0027s also impossible to make a \u0022bulge\u0022 part with integrated wheels at the moment: as KSP has no proper mirroring, so only way to make that work is using two separate manually mirrored part types (in which case you won\u0027t even be able to perfectly align the wheels).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UM2MEo4.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UM2MEo4m.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UM2MEo4m.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022British_Rover\u0022 data-cite=\u0022British_Rover\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERandom question. \u003Cp\u003EIf I am not using FAR does it matter what which of the B9 intakes I use for a large cargo carrying SSTO?
