Last night, I got the SpaceX Rockets parts package, and did some testing. They were good. So, I launched a Dragon V2 to the Mun. And I landed in a double crater. Got out, planted a flag, took some screenshots, and took off during an eclipse. I got out of the Mun\u0027s SOI, but after completing another Kerbin orbit, I was on a trajectory to have a polar impact on the Mun. So, I boosted my periapsis fro. 1.8km to 10km, and then slowed down when I was there. I tried landing, but when I landed, I slid too far, so just took off again. And returned to Kerbin orbit, for good this time. One more orbit, and I landed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVIDEO:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/y399IrPkS9g?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"}]}
