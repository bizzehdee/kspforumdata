The stage atop is only freed when the fairings are decoupled. The \u0022decoupler\u0022 in the IA is a fake, just so it doesn\u0027t confuse MJ/KER, and doesn\u0027t do anything. So, here\u0027s how you use it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuild your stage. Add an interstage adapter, and attach its topmost (floating) node to the bottom of the stage. Resize IA to fit (width, node height, top width). Attach fairing sides. That will leave a decoupler for the IA, and 4x decouplers for the fairings (2x if using the 2-side IA), in your staging list. The fairing decouplers are what actually decouples the payload/upper stage. For best ease of use, put all 5 (or 3) decouplers in a single stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EANWRocketMan: I can add UH-25, sure.
