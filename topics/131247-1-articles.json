Once you have landed, make sure you are returning to space center and not reverting to launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Also make sure that u have enough Kerbals hired. (Not sure if this could cause this but should just be safe)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Make sure that you are not mistaking debree on the runway with the actual vessle. (Ex. If u launch a rocket using launch clamps, they will remain on the pad after launch, becoming a peice of the rocket you must recover to clear the pad)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. FYI. The runway on the island in KSP counts as the main runway, so if you have a plane there it will force you to recover it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry I couldn\u0027t help more.
