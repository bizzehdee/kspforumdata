Using Modue Manager 1.5.7 (from the asteroid cities zip), KSP .23.5, standalone version (that is, not the steam version) x64.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo reproduce the issue, I built a very small craft with the Philly Asteroid Analyzer and used hyperedit and short-range manuvering to position the craft nearby. I then armed the PAA, and attempted to dock with the asteroid. The PAA did not engage when in contact with the asteroid. I repeated this test about twenty times with different angles, speeds, and rotations with no change in behavior.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditional notes: The PAA appeared to enter an odd state: as soon as I armed the claw, the option to \u0022release\u0022 and \u0022analyze\u0022 appeared on the context menu for the claw, despite the claw not having anything engaged. The option to \u0022free piviot\u0022 was also present, but did not appear to do anything initially.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was able to verify that asteroids contain 1000 water by default.

First of all, thanks for all the feedback. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, some thoughts: a) I\u0027ll go and fix the conversion so that it does not generate any additional mass. I\u0027ll also make sure that scanning does not increase the mass of the asteroid (I did not care for this in this initial release). So there will be no \u0022magic\u0022 resource creation. I might also write ym onw resource module to compensate for ModuleGenerator\u0027s crappyness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever,... this mod should be fun to play with so I will not implement a slow resource generation scheme (even if its more realistic) to mimic real systems. Why not? I think its useless to force people to time warp for minutes just to fill a tank. I hate resource systems that make me do that. I believe eveyone knows how to time warp, so there is no challenge or fun in that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I don\u0027t want to implement a system that works while the ship is not focused (e.g., greenhouse that produces exactly the amount of food for the kerbals onboard). It would be cool but it is too complicated. There are too many unknowns. Is there electricity while the ship is not focused? Is it in the shadow? How many kerbals are consuming resources? Are any containers full? ... You have to simulate the whole vessel and its environment.

I use TAC LS so the fact that I can so the asteroids for that is nice and make the missions to them more... versatile? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the fact you are creating things we can use to do something on/with the asteroid. Be that resource conversation, sure that is cool, but like you say I don\u0027t want to micromanage them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright typing this has made me want to test it out, less sleep, more KSP!
