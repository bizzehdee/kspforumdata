That\u0027s easy, unlock science lab and thermometers and go biome hopping. Hell, you don\u0027t even need to fly - plant some wheels onto that mobile lab, put a scientists into it and visit all sections of the KSP, collecting data and resetting experiments every time (scientist can do that). Then you can visit grasslands and shores. There\u0027s some tundra bit just northwest of the KSP. By the mountains there\u0027s highlands and mountain biome.
