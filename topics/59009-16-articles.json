My current method requires passing information back and forth between several parameters and constantly tracking their states. It will be much easier to make the two orbital parameter children of the main long-orbit parameter. The main parameter will then only have to wait until the two orbital parameters are met before starting its timer; it won\u0027t need to track any vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe two orbital parameters can also be improved to make it so they won\u0027t lock one vessel into being tracked. Any vessel that meets the requirements should mark the parameter as complete, you could even have one vessel meet the inclination and one meet the eccentricity requirement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also realized that contract overcrowding is a real problem, and one that we probably can\u0027t do anything about. So I\u0027m going to consolidate the three regular survey contracts (orbital, ground, biological) into one contract with three different types. Then maybe allow just two of those at a time. I might also get rid of the basic collect science contracts all together, the survey contracts basically fill the same role anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a whole host of other changes that I\u0027m working on to make the anomaly scanner and anomaly contracts use less redundant code. And I might finally get around to overhauling how the asteroid science collection works, Squad added some new GameEvents in 0.24 which make these changes much simpler. So I\u0027m not sure when I\u0027ll actually be able to update, but it shouldn\u0027t be too long.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Patrick Kerbivan","CreatedById":114804,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-22T01:46:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DMagic\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DMagic\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere is a whole host of other changes that I\u0027m working on...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep up the good work!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wren","CreatedById":99277,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-22T01:52:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis mod is pretty nifty.

Any active contracts from the last version will be removed (without any contract penalties), stock contracts and contracts from other mods will not be affected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe basic collect a specific science result contract has been removed, it\u0027s function is essentially filled by the survey contracts. The three survey type contracts (orbital, surface, biological) have been consolidated into one that can give any of the three types. These have been altered too. The orbital surveys never ask for specific biomes, but they do require that the science returned be worth something. Ground surveys ask for biomes if applicable and all experiments will be for the same biome. So you might get a contract to study the Mun\u0027s surface with all of the parameters asking for results from the canyons, or some other biome; if the experiment isn\u0027t biome sensitive then it will work anywhere. These also require that the science returned be worth something. The biological surveys are a mix of the two; any surface experiments will ask for the same biome, but orbital experiments won\u0027t, and the science returned doesn\u0027t have to be worth anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe asteroid surveys are largely unchanged, but the method used to detect successful collection of data is improved, and will display an on-screen message. There are also contract notes making it explicit that only DMagic parts can be used for these contracts, i.e. only the Universal Storage versions of the mystery goo or the accelerometer can be used to collect asteroid science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnomaly contracts also have an improved method for detection of data collection and their distance constraints have been significantly loosened. It should be much easier to collect data from orbit for these contracts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe magnetic survey contracts have a much improved method for tracking suitable vessels around the target planet. Multiple vessels can be used to carry out the contract, and as long as the both of the orbital parameters are satisfied at all times you can switch out old vessels with new ones, dock, undock, use decouplers, etc...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere has also been a total overhaul of how the asteroid science collection works (independent of the asteroid contracts), most of which was discussed way back here. Some new GameEvents added in 0.24 have made this much more feasible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are two basic aspects to these changes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne is that asteroids are assigned a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_spectral_types\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Espectral type\u003C/a\u003E randomly when they are \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/DMagic1/Orbital-Science/blob/master/Source/DMAsteroidScience.cs#L115-L126\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Efirst loaded\u003C/a\u003E (if anyone comes up with a better method of doing this, that could be read easily by other mods it would be great). Science results are now given based on these spectral types, there are nine, rather than the asteroid size class. This makes much more sense for most of the science experiments I have, and the science defs have been updated to reflect this change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other change is that there is now a much more robust method for tracking asteroid science results and allowing for repeated experiments from different asteroids of the same spectral type. Now you can collect multiple results from different asteroids of the same type and their worth will gradually diminish. Everything is updated whenever science results are transmitted or recovered so it is mostly transparent to the user.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere have been a few other changes, mostly non-user end stuff.
