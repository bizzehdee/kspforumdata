The challenge is simple. Make an Ion Rocket that can get to orbit. If that is impossible than you can take the easier challenges. Ion rover and ion plane.\n\nDue to my sudden relization that it is not possible to launch from kerbin ( thanks guys ) you can do it on the mun, hyper edit to it, legit, Just launch there. However rovers and planes still on kerbin until further notice.\n\nRules \n\nno cheating (duh)\n\nno mods that help ion engines.\n\nEverything is rated by speed or/and speed.\n\nno rover wheels \n\nIon Rocket\n\nIon Plane\n\nIon rover\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-14T03:43:19Z\u0022 title=\u002208/14/2015 03:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Spacetraindriver**"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T04:22:56Z","Content":"This isn\u0027t possible on Kerbin.
