I made LARGE Constructions and managed to \u0022Weld\u0022 Parts with the Welding Mod. I managed to simplify the Parts and made them Scaleable with Tweak-Scale, so the Game hadn\u0027t to load Three different Parts, when One is enough. Why did i mention that? Because when I had done all the Above and sat on the Mun, planning my Base, it became a Philosphy Problem!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. The Surfaces are looking Ugly, when Scaling Parts too big\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. There are (Sometime very tiny) Gaps between some Parts, when constructing\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. So you have a Base of, let\u0027s estimate, 50 welded Parts, a really large Construction. But what now ?!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor me, Number 3 was the biggest Problem! The Kerbals can\u0027t (without cheating) remove the Helmet, so they walk (In my Case) through Corridors, up Ramps, through Airlocks, and that\u0027s all. Yes, all!

Someone has to create \u0022Useful\u0022 Equipment, for example Seats, which count for a Base/Station/Science and so on for the Career System, or Equipment which gives Bonus for Mining/Steering/whatever, you know what I mean. In the Moment, the Equipment is only a toy. Don\u0027t misunderstand me, I appreciate the Work and the Knowledge of the Creators and love their Mods, but a bit more \u0022usefulness\u0022 for the advanced Players would be nice. To compare, think at Lego. With 3 or 4 Years, Lego Junior was Fine, but with 6,7,8 Years, Lego Technic becomes more interesting and you want to do more with the Parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. A Texture Beautification\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Rework of the Parts, for Example the Airlock. When Scaling to very Large Proportions, the difference between the inner Surface of the Airlock and the Mun\u0027s Surface (for Example) becomes too big. Yes, you can use others Parts, for example the Stock Plate, to compensate, but it looks ugly. Also, the Switch for the Airlock Cycle looks and seems \u0022Too high\u0022 at the Wall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, Yes, I know, these are all Minor Problems, but when I tried to work up the Mods, it seems in the sum too much work for me alone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, nobody wrote here for years, so i thought the Mod is Dead and gave up Hope, because some parts feel not finalized.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIf there\u0027s someone who is willing to revive these mods (and I think of ALL of the above!!!), I can offer my help with scaling and scripting and I would also diving in Module-Scripting, because in RL my work is similar and I think we can manage this. So message me, if you\u0027re interested, even if you only want ONE of the above to be Improved!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can offer a private Teampeak Server, experience in playing Games, Unix, Linux and 45 Years of Life Experience and Leading Teams.
