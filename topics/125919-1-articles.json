So how much delta v is required from LKO to LEO (low Eeloo orbit) and back? Is 10kdv enough? (This does not include the lander\u0026#39;s dv, so the 10k would only be used from LKO to LEO and back.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-19T18:50:34Z\u0022 title=\u002211/19/2015 06:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by A35K\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T18:43:56Z","Content":"\nMy favorite tool is this one:\u003Cbr\u003E\n[url]http://ksp.olex.biz[/url]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;ll assume that you\u0026#39;re starting in LKO, and also that when you return home you can aerobrake and land so that you don\u0026#39;t need any dV upon Kerbin arrival.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nStep 1: Find ejection dV to go to Eeloo.
