requiring basically the same number of flights to design the rocket as the big boys.\u00A0 The Delta-II was able to scale itself by adding various numbers of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E boosters (\u0022more boosters\u0022) and the Delta-Heavy and Falcon-Heavy \u0022simply\u0022 combine boosters to build a vastly larger rocket.\u00A0 These are then more efficient and can lob large numbers of \u0022stratolaunch sized\u0022 satellites into orbit even more efficiently than a small stratolaunch rocket even with it\u0027s 50% efficiency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that how this thing gets to Mars is only one of Elon Musk\u0027s concerns.\u00A0 Recovery is a particular bugaboo of his, and it isn\u0027t clear that spacex could use current recovery methods to recover Falcon Air.\u00A0 But the real reason Spacex still exists at all is the CRS program.\u00A0 CRS requires 2-3 tons of cargo and is delivered by a 2 ton dragon capsule.\u00A0 If Spacex was tied to Falcon air and couldn\u0027t cut the dragon down to fit the falcon air payload requirements, spacex would go bankrupt.\u00A0 Just from memory, CRS is one of the lightest LEO payloads falcon 9 carries (excluding multiple launches),\u00A0 and I don\u0027t see how they could afford to justify falcon air without CRS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are\u00A0baseless accusations. \u00A0The Delta II had a MAXIMUM payload of 6,100 kg with a full booster array. \u00A0The Falcon Air, launched from the Roc, would have been able to carry\u00A06 tons without any modifications (that\u0027s BEFORE you account for engine-upgrades to the Merlin since Falcon 9 v1.0, now making it one of the best Kero/LOX engines in the world). \u00A0Size is clearly not an issue here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCRS requires 4-5 tons of mass to LEO. \u00A0Falcon Air could deliver 6. \u00A0Payload capacity is just a straw-man here, and for the record, SpaceX has a MASSIVE back-log of pre-ordered commercial launches: they are hardly at risk of going bankrupt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hate to say it and don\u0027t mean to sound mean or rude, but your entire argument here boils down to \u0022it can\u0027t launch enough payload\u0022 with some mild hating on SpaceX sprinkled in. \u00A0But, with a payload-capacity that EXCEEDS the Delta 2 in any of its\u00A0configurations, despite that being the rocket you point to as a contrast, your

it\u0027s all tankage and fuel. \u00A0(And setting aside that the mass savings from a smaller first stage are partially offset by the mass increases in all stages to allow for horizontal carry and to

about the costs, particularly the elephant in the room - the launching aircraft. \u00A0(Estimated at $300 million six years ago for Stratolaunch, almost certainly much higher than that in reality.) \u00A0That\u0027s long been the basic economic problem for air launch systems, the economics only make sense if you\u0027re launching a significant number of payloads. \u00A0Otherwise, you end up with Pegasus, one of the more expensive civilian launchers rather than being one of the cheapest. \u00A0(Another part of this is because air launch doesn\u0027t save any man hours in the launch campaign, in fact it adds to them.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst Stage mass is NOT cheap. \u00A0Mostly because it\u0027s not just all \u0022tankage and fuel\u0022 here- you also need additional engines and turbopumps- which are the single most difficult, failure-prone, and expensive part of a rocket to manufacture...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6 engines instead of 9 reduces the chance of launch-failure. \u00A0Using a tried-and-true jet engine on a plane body that while large, let\u0027s be honest here, really isn\u0027t that revolutionary also means the carrier plane itself really doesn\u0027t have much chance of failure. \u00A0The most difficult aspect here BY \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E is the actual air-launch itself: the process of\u00A0decoupling a plane and a rocket in the air, and firing the rocket off without\u00A0crashing into\u00A0the plane or a failure of the rocket engines to ignite...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the $300 million, that\u0027s\u00A0about what SpaceX spent developing the Falcon 9 v1.0 (before the later upgrades and reusability-testing), a cost thst simply knocked the socks off any of their competitors (which typically spend 3-4x that much for a comparable rocket). \u00A0It\u0027s not really that much money in R\u0026amp;D costs at all. \u00A0If Paul Allen is not fudging his figures here at all then that\u0027s a BARGAIN for the cost of developing one half of a\u00A0launch system- and even cheaper compared to R\u0026amp;D costs for most large commercial passenger or cargo jets...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, $300 million for the plane and another $300\u00A0million for a Falcon Air rocket (maybe less- since SpaceX already has a mature design for the Merlin engine). \u00A0That\u0027s still only $600 million for a 6 ton to LEO rocket- still less than the maybe $750\u00A0million to $1 billion pricetag that a comparable payload-capacity would cost for a more traditional rocket...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s more, half of those R\u0026amp;D costs are already SUNK- meaning that Stratolaunch won\u0027t be able to take back all the spending they\u0027ve done\u00A0on the Roc no matter what happens from here on out. \u00A0So only $300 million more to develop a rocket in the 6 ton payload range is a great bargain, and they would be stupid not to take therm up on the offer if SpaceX came back to them and offered to develop them a Falcon Air (with further launches provided at a much lower price)\u00A0for $300 million...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd SpaceX would be even dumber not to make such an offer in the first place, as they get the R\u0026amp;D money no matter whether the Falcon Air finds a market or not. \u00A0If they could develop a Falcon 9 v1.0 for $300 million from scratch, they could certainly build a Falcon Air with only 6 engines\u00A0for less than that- and the experience working with the unusual aerodynamic regime\u00A0of air-launch would probably also be beneficial to their later developing a landing-system for the ITS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpaceX could PROBABLY even experiment with building a 2-engine rocket based on their upcoming Raptor Meth/LOX engine design instead: which would be lighter and have a higher payload-capacity due to the higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E (334/361 seconds SL/Vac for the Raptor vs. 282/311 seconds for the Merlin), higher initial thrust (6,100 kN vs. 5070 kN), deeper throttling (down to 20% vs. A minimum of 60%), and even a higher expected Thrust--Weight-Ratio for the Raptor than the Merlin,\u00A0which might equate to lower engine-mass despite the increased thrust...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that the Raptor\u0027s higher chamber-pressure means they could equip an even higher expansion-ratio nozzle for air-launch to the\u00A0Raptor than the Merlin (the ability to use higher expansion-ratio nozzles is one of the PRIMARY advantages of air-launch, even Elon Musk has noted this despite his criticism of the concept). \u00A0And, it\u00A0would be a great opportunity for SpaceX to flight-test their Raptor engine WITHOUT needing to throw out a perfectly good Falcon 9 configuration to replace it with one based on the Raptor instead of the Merlin...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUltimately, I believe the Roc will fail, but not because of any inherent weakness of the Stratolaunch plan- simply because SpaceX, the only company that could make this work, is simply too reluctant to work on the development of an air-launched rocket: which is ironic for a company thst seems so remarkably audacious the rest of the time...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegards,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNorthstar\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium

design\u00A0would cost more-\u00A0simply finishing the system already $300 million down is the cheaper option as it costs just $250 million, not $450 million (so you save $200 million). \u00A0Starting over would be an example of the Sunk Cost Fallacy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fallacy actually SUPPORTS my point here, as finishing the Roc is a cheaper option than starting on a new launch system from start to finish, regardless of how much money has already been sunk into the project- at this point it is cheaper to proceed than to start over with a new project.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPut a different way, the costs of developing the Roc have already been spent, so that carrier plane is essentially \u0022free\u0022 from a standpoint of future decision-making as no course of action will change that cost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd, it will be cheaper to develop and build/operate an air-launched rocket to be released by the Roc due to the smaller size needed to attain orbit than a ground-launched rocket with the same payload-capacity. \u00A0The disadvantage of an air-launched rocket over a ground-launched one is the R\u0026amp;D costs of developing the carrier-plane: but the carrier plane has already been developed, so those costs can be forgotten- and going forward it\u0027s cheaper to\u00A0develop an air-launched rocket for the Roc than to develop a ground-launched rocket (as bigger rockets are more expensive to debelop). Already expended R\u0026amp;D costs don\u0027t matter- only the remaining costs to project completion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou don\u0027t seem to understand the meaning of the fallacy, as it actually supports my point, and by bringing it up you have actually given me ammunition to use against you, since it illustrates\u00A0why I am right:\u00A0given that building an air-launch rocket for the Roc is the cheapest option going forward;\u00A0any past costs are already \u0022sunk\u0022 and it would be an example of the fallacy to incorporate them in determining the cheapest option going forward...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Loss_aversion_and_the_sunk_cost_fallacy\u0022 rel=\u0022external
