I\u0027d add that the absolute safest place to put your single MechJeb is somewhere where you never decouple it from the main vessel. That way, MechJeb activation should never even try to run. This way, you will sadly loose any MechJeb functionality in your decoupled vessels. Personally, I can live with that, since my plugin is all about the challenge and the very punishing and exhilarating possibility of complete fantastic failure. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003ERemoteTech 0,4 status update:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ashrutoraman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ashrutoraman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...here\u0027s my mission plan[, it does] not work cause of loosing stages on lander...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZools method is a planned feature for 0,4.
