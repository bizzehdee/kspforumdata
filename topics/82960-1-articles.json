Spend maybe 20 more hours in stock before getting mods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, things you should know. How to install them. Look it up on youtube. Most of them you just drop the gamedata folder into the gamedata directory in your KSP win folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods are definitly worth it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest mods for new mod users would probably be some part packs, such as KW rocketry, and maybe B9 (update in the works) and similar stuff. As for plugins, I would reccomend any visual mods you want. Up to your descretion, and your computer limitations. Editing extensions is good also, makes building easier. Also, RCS Building aid. This really helps with RCS placement for craft that plan to dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums, by the way!

I recommend using his \u0022Current Release.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion, KSP is all about setting goals for yourself, like building the stations and base(s) you mentioned and landing on celestial bodies. I think that the stock game has a lot to offer on this front, and mods are mostly about adding realism (improved aerodynamics modeling, realistic scale) or filling in gaps in the stock game (resource gathering, more parts, data readouts, better IVA, autopilot, visuals). If you\u0027re going to start adding mods, I suggest considering what you think the stock game lacks the most and filling in that gap. For me, it was clouds and related effects. Mods have their own bugs and come with greater memory usage, though, so keep in mind that you will probably encounter some issues that are no fault of Squad\u0027s.

Autopilot mods, such as Mechjeb, tend to be quite divisive; people tend to either love them or loathe them, and you can find loads of threads arguing one way and the other if you are interested enough to search.
