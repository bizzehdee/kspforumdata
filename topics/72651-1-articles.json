The result of this is to put you in a parking orbit at about 75km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you add 950 m/s for Kerbin escape, the result would be to put you in an orbit very similar to Kerbin\u0027s orbit around the sun - depending on the direction you left, see below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf instead you had added 1030 m/s from your 75km orbit, you would have added enough to get to Eve (because to get to Eve, you clearly need to escape Kerbin first! So you add the 80 onto the 950)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I wonder if understanding the chart itself isn\u0027t where your confusion lies, but rather, understanding when to begin your burn from LKO in order to get to Eve. So let me try to explain that too. Eve is at a lower altitude than Kerbin, so you\u0027re going to need to reduce your solar velocity. This will leave you with your apoapsis near Kerbin (because that\u0027s where you left from), and your periapsis at Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, you want to leave Kerbin going slower around the sun than Kerbin does. Which means that when you leave Kerbin, it should be \u0022getting away from you\u0022. Which means that you want to head away from Kerbin in a solar retrograde direction. By this I don\u0027t mean that your orbit will be opposite to Kerbin\u0027s. I just mean that relative to Kerbin, you want to be heading off in the opposite direction to it. You won\u0027t be going \u0022backwards around the sun\u0022, you\u0027ll just be going forwards slower than Kerbin is, because you spent about 1000 m/s slowing down your solar orbit when you left Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to do this, you want to start your burn on the sunny side of Kerbin, some time in the morning. If you leave on the dark side of Kerbin, say, 9pm, then your ejection angle will send you out ahead of Kerbin\u0027s solar orbit, which will take you higher, to Duna for example. If you leave so that your escape is radial in or radial out then your solar velocity will barely have changed at all and it will cost you a fantastically large amount of delta V to get anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously trying to explain this without any visual aids is not easy, so despite your \u0022without vids\u0022 request, I do have an in-depth video on escape trajectories and gravity slingshots that might make things a LOT clearer:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/utpzQfDdUJs?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-18T14:22:35Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2014 02:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"voneiden","CreatedById":38803,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-19T10:27:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EConsider taking a look at the illustrated tutorial in my signature.
