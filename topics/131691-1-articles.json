Is there something I misunderstand about orbital physics or is KSP just bending the laws of phisycs To decrease game difficulty a bit?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-08T23:22:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbin doesn\u0027t have the same mass as Earth.

It has the same surface gravity. Since the radius is about 10 times smaller, it means the mass needs to be about 100 times smaller than that of Earth to maintain the same surface gravity. So for LKO vs LEO, the GM/r is about 10 times less, which means that Kerbin\u0027s orbital velocity is about a third of Earth\u0027s.
