I developed it to lift heavy payloads into orbit. It uses slack tank asparagus staging and has an increasing TWR because of this. To fly it, make sure to watch the fuel gauges of the orange tanks by right clicking on them. Wait for the gauge to hit 0.0 and then eject and click on the next tank in line. Once all of the orange tanks are depleted, start your gravity turn and throttle down to 3/4 or less depending on the weight on your payload. Now you can watch the engine fuel gauge as you normally would and hit each stage as the engines flame out. If you experience structural failure at the decoupler, reinforce the coupler to the tanks and also be sure to attach struts to your payload as well. Only attach struts from the payload to the tops of the nose cones and not the orange tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis lifter has been tested up to 200 tons of payload. At 250 tons I was having trouble, so that\u0027s your benchmark. The craft in the picture below is 144.55 tons and the Leviathan gets it into orbit with no problem and with fuel to spare. This is a one size fits all design for a single attachment point.

The decouplers on the bottom are hiding the engines. This method allows for better stability on the launch pad when you put a heavy craft on top of it. On the bottom of those decouplers is a metal plate that attaches to the launch clamps. When you go to launch a craft with it. The decouplers will detach and the lifter will slide out of the fairings. Everything looks the way it should here, there\u0027s the right part count and everything so you should be good. When you first launch, you want to hit the space bar again after the launch because there will be an empty sage in between the next stage. After that, watch the fuel of the orange tanks by right clicking on them. When the meter hits 0, hit the space bar for the next set and right click to watch the fuel again. You only have to do this for the orange tanks. I usually don\u0027t start a gravity turn with it until the all of the orange tanks have depleted.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rosco P.
