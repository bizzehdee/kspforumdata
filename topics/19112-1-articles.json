It seemed like you could do that as close to the surface as you dared in the orbits of the Mun and Minmus, but could you do that around Kerbin?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe wheels in my mind turned: more than messing around with gliders, this is a challenge worth finding out about, just to see if it\u0027s even possible: is it possible to approach fast enough to pull off an orbital dive into and out of Kerbin without flying apart or being unable to return by way of atmospheric drag?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to find out, and I invite you to find out with me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rules of this challenge are simple: get into an elliptical orbit around Kerbin, put your periapsis as close to the surface of the planet as you dare, and hang on tight. Dive out of the heavens, \u003Cem\u003Einto the planet\u0027s atmosphere\u003C/em\u003E, then tear back into space. You have to pull off an orbit after this move to prove you\u0027ve survived. If you fly apart, cannot return or otherwise can\u0027t continue into an orbit from which you can land your ship, it doesn\u0027t qualify. You have to launch, do your diving orbit, climb back out of the atmosphere, then land safely. No parts of the craft may decouple during the dive orbit, nor the second exit unless it\u0027s specifically for landing later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecord photos of your ship, the more the better. Please try to record your flight at apogee, in the dive, afterwards and at landing. Anyone who can record a video is free to do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe goal is to see how close to the ground or the water\u0027s surface you can get without crashing, and how fast you can do your flyby, becoming the fastest atmospheric vehicle to ever cut the air of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll keep the score for two different classes: spaceplanes and rockets, obviously. These classes will be further split into two other classes: Stock (all stock parts) and Modified (mod pack parts are allowed).
