It will be used in Chang\u0027e 5 on the orbiting craft for entering lunar orbit burn, various orbit tweaks, rendezvous and exiting orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy am I talking about this now you ask, well something coincidental I noticed was that both Chang\u0027e 5 and the Shenzhou spacecraft weigh 8 tonnes, both are in the throwing range of the LM-5 to circumlunar, infact it has been discussed many times the possibility of a Zond-esqe Shenzhou mission. But if they both weigh 8 tonnes then assuming the Shezhou had this engine and the fuel... the shenzhou could be put into lunar orbit and return to earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I\u0027m calling it, 1st July 2021, why that date? It\u0027s the 100th anniversary of the CCP, what is more prestigious, grandiose for such a massive occasion then a manned lunar orbiting mission (well maybe the landing but that will take time \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xenomorph555","CreatedById":103080,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T01:54:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay lets look at feasibility:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.thespacereview.com/archive/2544b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222544b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere we have Chang\u0027e 5, as you can see the propulsion system (in the orbiter module) is basically 4 large spherical fuel tanks and the large center engine. The fuel will likely be UDMH\u002BN2O4. Moving on...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.astronautix.com/graphics/s/soyuztm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022soyuztm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere we have the service module of a Soyuz (due to secrecy there are no images of what a Shenzhou service module looks like so we can only assume it is similar to the Soyuz). In the service module at the back behind life support we can again see 4 spherical tanks of about the same size with a very small engine in the middle (it should be noted the Shenzhou has 4 engines instead of one but they are all incredibly low power). Although quite vague it is believed the Soyuz runs on H2O2 however these 4 tanks should be suitable for UDMH and N2O2. I believe assuming the Shenzhou also uses a similar quad sphere tank system, they could be converted to UDMH\u002BN2O2 and the regular engines could be replaced with the Chang\u0027e 5 engine. More fuel may need to be added but overall this would be a minor change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a fuel swap, engine swap, heat shield reinforcement and added high gain antennas for deep space communication I believe the Shenzhou could be modified to fly in lunar orbit aboard a LM-5 in 2021!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
