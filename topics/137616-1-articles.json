I haven\u0027t played since mid 2014 but I played a whole lot and did most of the advanced things you could do in the game at that time. This morning I installed a bunch of mods, CKAN says no conflicts, and the game loads ok. Memory usage is too high and the game stutters (just like it used to, but even worse) despite my system being ridiculously powerful and with tons of free resources, but I\u0027ve literally spent all morning trying to launch a basic rocket and nothing works. The rocket fires, goes between 5 and 50 feet, and turns off and falls back to earth. No log errors until it crashes, and it happens in manual mode or with Mechjeb on autopilot. Any idea why this might be happening? I\u0027ve finally given up trying to figure out why. Fuel lines don\u0027t affect it, amount of thrust doesn\u0027t affect it, struts don\u0027t affect it -- indeed I can\u0027t even find out why the engine is turning off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, and this isn\u0027t directly related, but what mods are the worst at causing this horrific stuttering?
