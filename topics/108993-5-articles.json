That will get rid of the ugly clipping we have right now. The stats definitely need tweaking, I agree with you there.\n\u003E \n\u003E I want to make separate docking and non docking versons of the chute, so that you aren\u0027t getting docking technology earlier in the tree than you are meant to. I can add an extra .cfg to make a copy of the Non docking version be probe controlled, but it will get added to the extras DL. I want to make sure to keep the main mod fairly small, this helps avoids part bloat and still gives everyone what they want. For example, while it\u0027s a cool idea, how often will people use this pod without crew? Even in a campaign that is RP focused it won\u0027t be too many flights. So that\u0027s just one of the things I have to weigh in when I decide what goes into the primary DL.\n\nI hear you on keeping the parts low, etc. And thanks for all you are working with here, this is my go-to pod for most manned flights right now.

Quick and dirty you determine the mass based on the average density of real world spacecraft or other vehicles made out of similar materials and the volume of the pods conical shape\n\nB. I worked out a formula in the tantares thread but I\u0027m on a phone so digging it up and pasting here isn\u0027t easy but the gist of it is. First you determine the mass for batteries reaction wheels and mono prop tanks based on the mass ratios of their dedicated part equivalents. Second add 0.1 mass if a part is commandable at all and an additional 0.1 for each level of sas the part provides. Third add 0.25 per seat (unless you can give me a better reason they should weigh more other than \u0022but-but... Stock...\u0022). And finally take this total and multiply it by 1.5 if this part is intended to survive reentry. Tada you have an op mod part but don\u0027t feel bad it\u0027s squads fault for not overhauling the balance of crew parts like they should have for 1.0 and at least this part was made folowing a set of rules instead of randomly picking numbers like how some squad pods feel. which means if you apply these same rules to other pods you can bring peace and balance and consistency to the universe. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"veryinky","CreatedById":71372,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T09:14:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Third add 0.25 per seat (unless you can give me a better reason they should weigh more other than \u0022but-but...

I guess you could head cannon it as hydrazine reacting with some kind of oxidizer that\u0027s inside the cell. Either way it\u0027s intended as an early game alternative to solar panels. \n\nThe idea is to remove it from the service module, although I am worried about people not being able to click on it and action groups are stupidly not available in the early career. (The new service module has no doors just a hollow back end) I may put it to a vote to see if I should make it a stand alone part or not. If not this asset can still be used, I\u0027ll just add it to the inside of the service module. \n\nThe foil not being stock-alike doesn\u0027t bother me too much.
