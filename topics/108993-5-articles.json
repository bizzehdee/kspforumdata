I can add an extra .cfg to make a copy of the Non docking version be probe controlled, but it will get added to the extras DL. I want to make sure to keep the main mod fairly small, this helps avoids part bloat and still gives everyone what they want. For example, while it\u0027s a cool idea, how often will people use this pod without crew? Even in a campaign that is RP focused it won\u0027t be too many flights.

Quick and dirty you determine the mass based on the average density of real world spacecraft or other vehicles made out of similar materials and the volume of the pods conical shape\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB. I worked out a formula in the tantares thread but I\u0027m on a phone so digging it up and pasting here isn\u0027t easy but the gist of it is. First you determine the mass for batteries reaction wheels and mono prop tanks based on the mass ratios of their dedicated part equivalents. Second add 0.1 mass if a part is commandable at all and an additional 0.1 for each level of sas the part provides. Third add 0.25 per seat (unless you can give me a better reason they should weigh more other than \u0022but-but... Stock...\u0022). And finally take this total and multiply it by 1.5 if this part is intended to survive reentry.
