Logistically, it was probably easy: get carrier group into designated area, wait, catch. But how much it will cost to ULA? Another thing is, how big is \u0022pretty big\u0022? I would expect maybe 100-200 kg capsule with microfilms in it. But the engine? It\u0027s supposed to replace RD-180, which weighs more than 5 tonnes. they may cut the mass somewhat, but they will have to add to it as well: shielding (jettisoned?), parachute containers, telemetry and control equipment, support struts for all of the above - so it may result in even higher mass. Catching it will be tricky, you\u0027re not supposed to suddenly add 5 tonnes to helicopter mid-flight.
