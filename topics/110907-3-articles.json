I think the problem with mods for me is that they seem to fall into two categories, they either try to add to the game or make it easier. If there was a mod such as \u0022SciFi 2525\u0022 that was old-school science fiction in spirit (think lush jungles on Eve, marooned obsolete self-conscience robots on Moho, and insanely massive but simple FTL ships that have brains and spines) then I would be all about it. A few carnivorous plants and rudimentary ray guns for self protection would be a nice touch. That is to say, make a mod that significantly CHANGES the game and you would have my interest.
