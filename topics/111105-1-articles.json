The only thing changing is the direction the arrow is being drawn in.\n\n    Vector3 dir = Vector3.ProjectOnPlane(thisVessel.srf_velocity, planetUp).normalized;if (pointer == null)    pointer = ArrowPointer.Create(thisVessel.rootPart.transform, Vector3.zero, dir, 100, Color.red, true);else    pointer.Direction = dir;\n\nIf I spin a vessel in a circle (Aeris 3A on the grass next to the runway) running the above code, between a heading of 30 and 150 the pointer will not be visible.\n\nAnyone know why this might be?"}]}
