Then afterwards we will start hauling stations and other structures to dedicated points in the system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERandom reporter 2: Will the tickets be expensive on the grand tour?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVaquez: Depends.

Lets start this off quickly. Random Reporter #4, what is your question?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERandom Reporter 4: I have heard rumors that both companies will be using Dragon-class space-craft to act as liferafts and landing vehicles.

Our pilot and head engineer got merged with a combat smart-AI, and now keeps building things like that. To be honest. it is the most sane thing that he has ever built, although it seems bigger on the inside....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELegs: Back to the question, The Craft in the middle is our Dragon, specifically The LazTek Dragon MK 3. We have designed specialized platforms to allow it to be a surface-to-orbit transport for munar and minnimus-ar journies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVaquez: And we are using the CBBP Dragon-class Rider Command Vehicle, for use as an escape pod, transport vessel, and all-purpose vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERandom Reporter 5: Mr.... Uh... Legs! Can you comment on what new stations and components you will be feilding? What changes will you make to keep threats, such as the SWARM, at bay?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELegs: We will be modifying out station with cloaking \u0027Jammer\u0027 devices, making them hard to detect via the sensors that the SWARM seems to be using. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERandom Reporter 5: Will these new stations be armed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELegs: We are currently designing a lazor platform and missile platform that we will be able to use to protect ourselves when in orbit from a variety of threats. So yes, it will be armed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERandom Reporter 5: Will all ships be armed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKirlak: Until the SWARM is a negligible threat, yes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVaquez: What the commander said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/L1oZ6rp.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022L1oZ6rp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Sound of a phone ringing*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKirlak: Hello?....
