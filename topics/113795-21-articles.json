I recommend using a soft touch when flying them at low altitudes (under 5k). Pilot assistant\u0027s throttle control is very helpful. I put fuel in both the tank and the wings.

This variant is more acrobatic and can/will stall if you go above an AOA of 75. It\u0027s capable of really weird and fun stunts, at the expense of burning speed. The cockpit is angled downwards, so there\u0027s more drag and the navball is a bit off. This gives a great IVA view though, and it\u0027s really cool for dogfighting in the IVA view.

The plane will also snap in two at low altitudes (below 5000) if you do this. The real Russian planes do this, but it leaves them sitting ducks for a bit while they pick up speed.
