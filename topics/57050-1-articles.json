Which gauge controls when the parachute semi deploys and which one controls when it fully deploys? By gauge I\u0027m talking about the bar which has a height on and a pressure gauge on when you select the parachute, just incase you didn\u0027t know what I was talking about! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJacob\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T16:55:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPressure controls initial deployment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAltitude controls full deployment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechnicalK3rbal","CreatedById":86903,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T17:08:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHe bar on the top adjusts the altitude that the parachute will fully deploy at, the bottom bar changes the pressure the parachute will partially deploy at.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jacob01","CreatedById":61842,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T22:13:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, thanks for the help!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
