I\u0027m curious to see what some people tried, and what could\u0027ve been. (I most certainly have a whole plethora of designs and programs which have been left half-completed.)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGuess I\u0027ll start with one\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe failed spacecraft I most focus on of my space programs is the Keburan, a shuttle project I began back in September based on my friend Jon\u0027s shuttles:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/wPwOF\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

They could only land with the assistance of RCS to slow down, otherwise risking destruction of the cockpit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETakeoff up to orbit would be relatively smooth if the directions were followed, until the fuel tank would start running out of fuel. The orbiter would start struggling to stay in control towards the end of the fuel tank stage. After the fuel tank would disconnect, the orbiter would be using 2 aerospikes, slightly unaligned with the center of mass, to propel itself into orbit. This also proved to be slightly unstable. Once in orbit, it would only have enough fuel to de-orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe inherent instability of the Keburan and Ktechka led to the scrapping of the program, especially after a payload test showed more of the instability. However, this is my only orbiter that has even achieved orbit so far (though I do have a new one in the works), and the Keburan program did certainly inspire some future programs which will probably later appear in this post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI always wonder about what would\u0027ve happened if this program would\u0027ve succeeded. I did make a placeholder forum page for it but never finished it, so I think it would\u0027ve gotten some good attention (preceding Zeke\u0027s and Giggles designs which would come about a month later) if I could have gotten cargo into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*It had an engine on the fuel tank to curb its instability\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, now I\u0027m curious what other people have worked on in the past, and how close we came to seeing some awesome spacecraft that were never to be.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-05T22:58:49Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2014 10:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Noname117\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MK3424","CreatedById":19932,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-05T23:01:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou do know that the real Buran didn\u0027t burned it\u0027s engines to get into orbit: it was attached to a massive launcher called the Energia.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spartwo","CreatedById":58131,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-05T23:07:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0027\u0027Remember that one time I said more is more?\u0027\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027\u0027Yes...\u0027\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www./convkey/a182/8075hjn0qi17f4hfg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00228075hjn0qi17f4hfg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027\u0027And that\u0027s why I hate horizontal takeoff.\u0027\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the only one which I would call failed,the rest aged badly or didn\u0027t meet expectations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Noname117","CreatedById":53624,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-05T23:14:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEh, only called it that because it was competing with Jon\u0027s shuttles (named kerscovery, katlantis, keandeaver, etc.) I didn\u0027t design it as a replica.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
