The larger cargo seems to move by itself just fine when not in the cargo plane. But I did rearrange the plane (much for the better) so as to have fewer intrusions into the cargo area. I also took your suggestion to put something small in there, but the effect is the same. It just sits in the plane, the wheels will turn, but it won\u0027t move back or forth.
