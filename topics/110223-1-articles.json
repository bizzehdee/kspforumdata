I looked through science but see no other mechjeb feature to unlock. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerba Fett","CreatedById":62292,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T19:48:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs the feature still there in sandbox where there is no techtree to deal with?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pandemic","CreatedById":144101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T02:22:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll have to check.

I prefer to have flags at both ends myself, but the stock game has an odd bug that keeps eating my 27 end flag right now, unless I do a bit of a hack to make it stay put. You can set the flag as a target, and the end result is very nearly as good as MechJeb\u0027s pseudo-ILS guidance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the issue is landing, it really is worth spending a bit of time learning how to pull off a textbook landing by hand. It\u0027s not easy, I know, but worth it in the long run. Low, slow, and very flat, no violent control inputs on final approach, that\u0027s the key to learning successful landing; once you have calm gentle landings sorted, you can move to more advanced stuff like a mad supersonic power dive from 20,000 directly towards the threshold, pulling up hard at the last moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the issue is \u0022altitude hold\u0022, that doesn\u0027t really seem to work terribly well, to be honest, at least for me. It always seems to over-compensate and constantly hunt for the set altitude, without really stabilising there, even if I start out straight and level at the altitude before engaging it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T09:18:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100073-1-0-x-Pilot-Assistant-Atmospheric-piloting-aids-1-9-3-%28May-18%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPilot Assistant\u003C/a\u003E does much better than MechJeb for aircraft.

I have the general layout of where the landing strip is but that\u0027ll make it quicker to find. I\u0027ll check out pilot assist. I liked MechJeb purely for the heading and altitude autopilot. I\u0027ve had good results with setting a heading and altitude, leaving the machine in 4x mode for 20 minutes or so, completing a contract and doing the same on the way back. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve noticed recently that it seems like something changed though. The controls are a lot more sensitive or maybe aerodynamics changed somewhere. I\u0027m still running 1.0.2 but something is different. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWeird thing is before the update I was able to use the mechjeb space plane autopilot all the time in career mode.
