It is also featured in my in-progress Let\\\u0027s Play series (expect a thread about it once I have a few episodes). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnlike the last design, this version can be rather difficult to land, as a bit more weight has been added to the nose area, which tends to make it front-heavy. RCS-on is suggested for landing. Also, the craft tends to tilt strongly once it has left the thinnest part of the atmosphere, so using RCS and throttling back tends to be necessary. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe orbital stage rocket has been the least stable component, but the version V design\\\u0027s linear port RCS has made it slightly more stable. Keyboard adjustment is suggested once out of the atmosphere to make gradual changes to roll, pitch, and yaw!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs always, suggestions about improving the design (I would prefer to keep the final stage somewhat intact, though!) are welcomed!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy!
