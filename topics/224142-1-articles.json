It seemed so at first. No performance issues, or at least not the crazy performance problems I\u0027d heard about, but then again I\u0027ve barely gone to orbit. And I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll be playing it again any time soon. For a franchise that ostensibly made a name for itself through making something as complex and bewildering as aeronautical engineering and orbital mechanics fun, it boggles my mind how everything else about the game seems so irredeemably simplified and dull.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScience wasn\u0027t amazing in KSP1 but at least I knew how and where and why it was earned. In KSP2 it just seems to pop up. I\u0027m mostly notified after the fact with very little notion that anything at all had happened. Its like a very slow game of Sonic the hedge hog. Complete with the loss of all my rings if I hit the ground too hard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is no economic incentive either to make a rocket more efficient in terms of resources. The sky is the limit so long as it fits in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. Which impacts the use of the free science points as well. There is no reason to research lesser parts except as a stepping stone to the bigger more powerful and more useful parts. Its all the same once unlocked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I first heard of KSP2 I was convinced it would be amazing. Missions and Science could be rebuilt and improved. But no, both are far simpler, and far less motivating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy biggest beef with KSP1 and science, was that you could complete all the science in the Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. It would be trivial to envision a a system of resources that would force the player further out into the system while tying that progress directly to their efforts. We could make science depend on access to rare-kerbin elements on Kerbin for tier 1. Science becomes a resource specific to a planet and the elements available on it. Parts should have a monetary cost as well as a resource cost. Those resources are the same elements science experiments are focused on. Properly researched, you mine those resources and use them and money to build rockets. Research must be unlocked per part, or group of parts, and paid for with Science associated with the materials those parts require. Bam. Now, I\u0027m going to build a rocket with parts that require Rare-Kerbin elements which is just enough to get me to Dres or Eve. Now I start doing science at one of those to understand their Rare elements and how to use them, then how to mine them, shipping them back to KSP or building a colony to mine and refine locally, now I can unlock Tier 2 propulsion research on one planet, and Tier 2 structural research on the other. Then from those planets to the next adjacent orbits. Working my way closer to the sun or deeper into outer reaches of the Kerbol system. And it keeps going, the first interplanetary ship barely gets us to the next system. But after a while there the research makes it easier to travel and communicate between. All the while you have definable goals and objectives, purpose and a sense of accomplishment beyond just getting there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut instead, its not much more complex than rocket goes up, science comes down.

I\u0027ve read what little there is to read aboutKSP2\u00A0 in the road map, and I\u0027ve read more than a few articles, and watched more than a few videos about KSP2, before actually playing it for a day or so myself. What I haven\u0027t seen or heard about, is anything remotely like what I described. Excepting what sounds like a likely diluted resource gathering.

It is not, it is a list of development steps. We won\u0027t crack interstellar travel, the devs will. And yes, interstellar is easier to implement than resources, because it consists basically in placing new stars somewhere and new planets around them. The difficulty is more in the design variations than in the game mechanics.

The game is in early access, so the colonies are implemented in order for the players to test the new game mechanics brought with it: new parts, orbital construction, maybe ground-anchoring...

With this perspective, the simplified science gathering game loop can be disappointing. However, I think KSP2 game loop as planned by the devs will be different from KSP1 (launch, collect science, transmit/recover, spend points in the tech tree). They talked about it but I don\u0027t remember where. I think it will be a bit closer to an automation game: resource gathering improvement, supply lines improvement, and science gathering will be used to unlock parts but will be less significant than in KSP1. Some people will like it, some people won\u0027t, but for now we have to keep in mind the game loop is not complete, hence the lack of motivation for rocket launches\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Presto200","CreatedById":232857,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-03-17T14:45:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we\u0027re talking about the development roadmap I would also vote for resources and delivery routes between colonies to be before interstellar travel.

It would mean more if we have to worry about resources before just putting together an interstellar mothership instead of it feeling like a sandbox game mode and putting it together without a worry. For such a giant step for KSP players and their Kerbals, having to gather all the resources to make the interstellar ship complete and finally having a basically \u0022complete\u0022 game after colonies, resources, and interstellar added would bring even more pride to that first voyage into the new solar system(s).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Draslin","CreatedById":133345,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-03-17T15:01:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou talk about the roadmap as a progression tree for players:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnless they are making the game open source, no I\u0027m not.

But I don\u0027t think the items in the roadmap are in the order they are for the sake of what makes sense to us players, but to what makes sense for developing the game. Take your example of having interstellar before resource gathering. It could be that they plan to have a resource that isn\u0027t available in the Kerbol system, you have to go interstellar to get that recourse. If that\u0027s the case, then it wouldn\u0027t make sense to have resource gathering come before interstellar if there isn\u0027t already the other star system in which to put that resource.

I spent a few hours googling how to deal with this bug or that bug, another few hours trying to design craft and play in such a way as to avoid said bugs or other instances of \u0022working as intended\u0022, and probably about 20 minutes of actually playing the game as it was intended. I posted a thread yesterday, large landing legs exploding at 2m/s out of sheer frustration, getting a refund was also hinted at. Exploding landing legs is only one thing but yesterday it was the straw that broke the camels back. You are right that getting a refund after 20\u002B hours of gameplay is unlikely, but kerbal is a game that takes a long time to play, especially if you spend most of that time googling how to get around bugs, is that really time spent playing the game?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have calmed down since yesterday. I\u0027ll hold off on trying to get a refund now and hope that after a few months or even years the game will become worth the purchase. I want to like the game, I am really trying to, but it seems better for me to just put the game down and not play until the next update. My time with this game seems better spent on this forum, attempting to give some constructive feedback. At least that\u0027s something the devs can work with, better than staying silent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
