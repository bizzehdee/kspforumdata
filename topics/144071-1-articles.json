Luv the PC Version, \u0026amp; was sooo much awaiting the Xbox one Version too be released!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1st time trying it out, i was like ohh\u00A0 ok, a little low settings on the GFX then im used too on my PC. But ok, lets try it...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot long after i started to learn the Controls, and shortcuts. Ok, Controls need some finetuning and need to be edited if needed. \u0026amp; who the F%\u00A4 desided too put LB/RB on map mode to \u0022Change target view\u0022, when LB/RB is used as a shift button for everything! (no Kerbal would have made a binding like that) \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, so GFX i doubt will be made better. The Controls i hope will be patched.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut... Why is it that one can only do x4 timewarp in Flight/Map-mode?\u00A0 I know one can go too trackingstation and speed it up, but even when doing 1/4 an orbit, it can take you 10 mins in x4.\u00A0 Going into trackingstation lets you speed it up, but then you loose vital info on where in Your orbit you need to do changes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTravling too the moon, i need 4-5 visits too the trackingstartion, just too be able to speed up too x50/x100/x1000. Now, for the game too be even playeble for newcommers, this i\u00A0a fix that need to ba taken care of.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI get it, that if in flight, doing more then x10 can love the system/spaceship, but why not atleast make it possible to doo x500 in mapmode!?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen atlast. Memory Leak? or what it is. After playing this game for over 1 hour, the Whole game slows Down, moving the pointer, espesialy over items in buildmode (when info on items pop up), seems like getting that info up on screen takes too much CPU Power \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E, but only after the game has been running for a while.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, \u0022panning\u0022 the researchscreen, laggs like hell....\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInflight fps goes Down too somethins that look/feels like 10fps or lower.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, quit the game, restart/reload save, and its all fine! atleast for a little while!\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis last problem hurts the most, cuz what, does the consoles really suck that much?
