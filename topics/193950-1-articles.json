Whenever I drop a rover off of something like a nearby plane, then fly the plane, land it near the rover and switch to the actual rover, the rover starts floating in the air with no control. It slowly drifts upwards and I have to EVA my Kerbals off of it because it can\u0027t be recovered. Recently it\u0027s been happening with some other things and really annoys me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Demordrah","CreatedById":198685,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-13T18:35:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just experienced this myself on PS4.\u00A0 I shot a missile from a mobile platform, switched view to watch the missile fly, and when I switched back, my missile launcher was floating up off of the runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
