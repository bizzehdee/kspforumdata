I write Creepypastas in my free time but never publish them because some are rather dark and after recent events I didn\u0027t know how everyone would react. This is purely fictional and shouldn\u0027t be taken seriously. This is also a rather short story because Creepypastas and Kerbal SPace Program don\u0027t really mix well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EHello Kerbal Space Program community, I recently bought the game after the Steam Summer sale. I love it really but I\u0027ve had some \u0022Experiences\u0022. My first few flights went as you\u0027d expect, explosions and screaming. It was kind of funny in a comical sense seeing the explosions for the first three launched but after it began to get annoying. I finally managed to get a suborbital rocket after about nine failed attempts. I was actually happy but that first kerbal was Ludmey Kerman. Jeb, Bill, and Bob all died in my attempts. I tried for an orbital flight after and as you\u0027d expect this took a few tries as I knew the flight profile but of course couldn\u0027t build. On a mission I named the \u0022Get the hell to orbit-4\u0022 Jeb returned as did Bill and Bob. I was using the standard one Kerbal pod so Jeb went ahead. The launch went off without a hitch, same with booster seperation and jettison of the second stage. I was so happy I was cheering and screaming when I made it to an orbit of 71km by 87km. I looked at the screen to see the sun setting as we entered the dark side but I looked in the corner of the screen where your Kerbal is and saw... Jeb Screaming? I thought to myself \u0022This isn\u0027t right, I\u0027m new and I know Jeb isn\u0027t supposed to be screaming\u0022 When I asked myself why he was screaming out loud the game crashed. I thought \u0022Hmm that\u0027s odd, it\u0027s like it heard me?\u0022. I turned my computer chair to reach for my coffee but I was stopped by a masked man staring in my window. He was wearing one of those Paper Kerbal masks staring into my window and when I blinked he was gone. About three minutes later I started the game back up and when I resumed that flight from orbit I heard a scream upstairs. I ran upstairs only to see my wife dead on the floor with her neck twisted in a way I didn\u0027t know possible and blood dripping from her mouth. I looked out the window to see the same masked man staring in with his mask covered in blood. What I\u0027m here to tell you is if you see Jeb screaming don\u0027t turn around. Shut your computer down and walk away or you might share my fate. He\u0027s coming for me, I know it. I\u0027ve seen him staring in my window when I\u0027m trying to sleep and when I awake from a nightmare. Jeb\u0027s not meant to scream people.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d really like some critique on my kinda dark writing.
