In the most recent mission the tug had six\u00A0LV-N\u0027s which should be giving 60 kN each, but I\u0027m only getting 20 kN on max throttle. On a previous attempt I had a Rhino engine giving 11 kN when it should have been 2000. Right clicking showed low fuel flow and a \u0022Prop. Requirement Met\u0022 of less than 100%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve done three successful redirections previously that didn\u0027t seem to have this issue. \u00A0Is there something that could limit the fuel flow of an engine despite fuel being available?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a screenshot.
