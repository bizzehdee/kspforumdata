Out of no where my quicksave doesn\u0027t work. And when I try to quicksave, I try to go back to space center and it won\u0027t work either. This forced me to close my window. I tried a few times and the same thing happened over and over. It\u0027s wierd cause yesterday it was working perfectly and I haven\u0027t installed any mods. I also shutdown my computer to see if it was that but same thing kept happening. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone had this problem?

Or are you saying that you push F5, it quicksaves, and then you can\u0027t load your quicksave with F9? If the latter is true, what exactly happens when you hold F9? Also, are you saying that your persistent save file works, when you load up your game?
