It comes in at the same time as the Terrier and the Poodle is just one node away; making it a rather unconventional choice for a vacuum engine.\n\n2. Since it\u0027s radially mounted you must use symmetry of some sort; as such you\u0027ll always have more than one Thud and that\u0027s not good for Delta-V.\n\nWhat do you have to say about the Thud?"},{"CreatedByName":"yorshee","CreatedById":135011,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T23:41:17Z","Content":"I use it to deliver heavier payloads via the skycrane method, it\u0027s pretty good at doing that."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T23:41:27Z","Content":"Thud is great for skycranes that stick at the top of another (usually big) payload to land somewhere where you need thrust pointing down.\n\nAnd no, stacking multiple engines doesn\u0027t necessarily hurt dV. I believe 3 LV-909 will have the same mass as LV-T45, but 909 has better vac Isp, meaning they will actually perform better than a single LV-T45 in terms of dV given the same amount of fuel regardless of payload mass - of course, atm Isp and TWR will be worse. My point is, it\u0027s not always true that multiple engines are bad, so don\u0027t feel to bad if you need to stick multiple engines because you have need for TWR or other design considerations."},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T23:41:35Z","Content":"It can be useful for landers or medium sized rovers. Also, while the Poodle is one node away, you also need the LT-2 landing strut, as the LT-1s are shorter than the Poodle, so the Thud remains a good choice for landers for a short while\n\n It\u0027s a bit of a niche engine, as it trades specs for radial mount. Eventually, if I need a lander which doesn\u0027t have an engine at the bottom, I tend to sacrifice gimbal and place a pair of aerospikes beneath radially attached fuel tanks."},{"CreatedByName":"More Boosters","CreatedById":147303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T23:45:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thud is great for skycranes that stick at the top of another (usually big) payload to land somewhere where you need thrust pointing down.\n\u003E And no, stacking multiple engines doesn\u0027t necessarily hurt dV.

The Thud (and the other radials) are supposed to act as [Vernier Engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernier_thruster): their main purpose isn\u0027t thrust, but control. Especially roll authority on a rocket that only has a single engine.\n\nIt\u0027s main problem is that it\u0027s too big, even on biggest single-engine lifter a pair of 24-77s will do the job nicely, thankyouverymuch.

I could take a big tank (3.75m or 5m with mods) and stick a big docking port (2.5m or bigger with mods) on both ends of the tank. Then the tanks could stack on each other as needed and still have docking ports on either side for other ships to attach to and refuel with. When they were almost empty I would de-orbit them. Using a combination of radial chutes and retro thrust right at the end, I could soft-land the tankers and get some money back.\n\nAnyway, the point is that they are pretty decent engines if you need a big radial engine, and there are times when you do."},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T02:16:19Z","Content":"It is not useful for how I play, which has become small, compact probes over a while.

Also incredibly useful if you want to insert an intermediate piece of a station such as a large fuel tank and you want to strap docking ports on both ends, or when you have a tightly packed series of vessels that you are launching.
