I came to these thoughts after realizing that Venus is really the only other body in the solar system with a solid surface and mass close to that of earth. Knowing Venus pretty much matches the definition of hell I pretty much came to the conclusion that the only way we could terraform it would be if we were to smash stuff into the planet at really high speeds. Basically you would start of by flinging a largish number of solid asteroids at venus in such a way that they may help boost it\u0027s orbit slightly and so they blow away some of the atmosphere. You could finish off by launching a few water ice comets (big ones) at the planet do it has some water. In the end you would want enough atmospheric pressure to prevent the water from evaporating and you want to cool the core to reduce the amount of volcanic activity ( maybe some of the materials blasted into space would turn into a small moon or to if the asteroids were big enough). So I\u0027m just curious on how well this would work, could we get an earth like planet or would we be stuck with a volcanic wasteland?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit/clarification thing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I never intended the orbital boost given by impacting asteroids to amount to much, whether it be a meter or a mile every little bit helps\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Comets/water-ice bodies would be used later once the planet reached a state where water could be supported as a liquid if not a solid in some areas \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I didn\u0027t intend on removing enough of Venus\u0027s atmosphere to make it the same pressure as earth\u0027s, if it needs to be a bit thicker or thinner to allow the planet to be more habitable then so be it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-This wouldn\u0027t be cheap or necessarily fast (you will have wait awhile for the big rocks to reach their destination and for the planet to settle down)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-A big asteroid that causes the planets internals (and most likely external) structure to shift significantly is not at all bad.

If there is not breathable air in it, then everyone is dead anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hard part of it is that there are not accessible raw materials to build a habitat out of on Venus. That might eventually be possible to overcome, although that\u0027s unlikely for a long time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the rest of your ideas, they are not feasible. Yes, you could move Venus if you slammed ENOUGH rocks into it. However, if you\u0027re going to use each rock only once, I doubt there are enough asteroids in the entire solar system to move Venus\u0027 orbit enough to make it habitable. The total combined mass of all the asteroids is VERY SMALL. For example, the entire combined mass of the asteroid belt is only 4% of the mass of the Moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if you re-use your asteroids, then you can move Venus over a long enough period. If you send enough asteroids past Venus, using Venus\u0027 gravity to gravitationally brake the asteroids into lower orbits, you WILL eventually boost Venus to a significantly higher orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour problems do not end there, though. First off, Venus is well very far outside the habitable zone. Earth is inside the habitable zone, near the inner edge. So what are you going to do with Earth? You\u0027d have to move Earth, too. I doubt that Sol\u0027s habitable zone is large enough to fit two Earth mass planets in stable orbits, but I could be wrong. Even if it is possible to fit two plants, your problems are more than doubled, because not only will you need to move two planets, not one, but you\u0027ll radically change Earth\u0027s environment, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and finally, Venus lacks a magnetic field, and it has an extremely slow, retrograde spin... not ideal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy far, the best way to terraform Venus is to use solar shades to reduce the apparent brightness of the Sun. This effectively allows you to ignore habitable zone concerns and make the temperature on Venus whatever you desire it to be, without having to move it at all. And considering that your solar shades probably only need to be a few dozen microns thick (if that!), it will take very little physical matter and resources (at least compared to some huge asteroid redirecting scheme) to affect this change.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheGatesofLogic","CreatedById":58468,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-09T01:05:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYup, earth is a very lucky planet indeed, having the magnetic field it does. The fact of the matter is that rocky planets tend NOT to have strong magnetic fields or high core temperatures this late in their lifetime. Earth, being the more massive body in the collision, managed to absorb the core of the mars-sized world it collided with, spewing out mostly just the lighter surface elements to for the moon as we know it. As a result the earth has a core with a relatively high concentration of radioactive materials providing an excellent thermal energy supply that has outlasted all of the other rocky worlds around us, which in turn provides the energy required to support the earth\u0027s magnetic field, keeping us nice and safe from solar radiation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-09T01:17:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs it happens, there is \u003Cem\u003Eanother\u003C/em\u003E Mars sized body in the solar system: Mercury.

As a more realistic number, I think I remember reading many years ago that it would take well over a trillion years for the Earth to tidally lock with the Moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, this is the first time I ever remember hearing that the Moon would actually escape from Earth before it would tidally lock. I\u0027ll see if I can look into it further when I get the chance. If it turns out to be true, thank you very much SargeRho for teaching me something new! Not like it\u0027s actually useful information though, since it will (probably) not happen anyway (as the Earth is currently predicted to be consumed by the red giant Sun) \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-09T18:56:19Z\u0022 title=\u002204/09/2014 06:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-Velocity-","CreatedById":74097,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-09T20:25:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022R0cketC0der\u0022 data-cite=\u0022R0cketC0der\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EActually earth won\u0027t become inhabitable because of the sun brightening.

I first read about Earth tidally locking with the Moon probably back in like, 1999ish in an article by Bob Berman in Astronomy magazine, and he was claiming that it would actually happen. (He even went further, claiming that after tidal locking had occurred, the process would begin to reverse as the Earth slowly tried to tidally lock with the Sun, and that eventually, the Moon would crash into Earth!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ESo, not everything you read is true.\u003C/span\u003E Perhaps with a long enough time scale, Bob Berman would be proven right (as long as the Moon doesn\u0027t escape first as SargeRho suggested could happen), BUT our Sun is not a red dwarf.

I do however feel the need to clarify a few things such as that when I mentioned having the asteroids hit Venus so it boosted the planets orbit I was not actually intending for the orbit to change much whatsoever!!! Mainly what I meant was that if you can have an asteroid hit Venus in such a way that it boosts the planet to a higher orbit, whether that distance be a meter or a mile, go for it. It doesn\u0027t have to be anything significant, its just that every bit helps. Also on the note on giving the planet a moon.... well I never really thought to even bother giving it one. Also if you REALLY want to give the planet a moon or to I don\u0027t think it necessarily needs to be as large as our own, whatever works is fine. On the topic of getting asteroids and moving them I think that it may be best to just redirect a few that are on an elliptical orbit that passes within the inner planets. You could probably move the asteroids with probes powered by some electric/and or plasma thrusters (Ion, VASMIR, etc.... Whatever is most suited) or even a NERVA/nuclear engine (We all know we humans have ALOT of spare U-235 among other fun radioactive elements lying around).
