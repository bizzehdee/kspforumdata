Hey I modded a part that almost just like that. Still keeping my old mods but the new ones have found their uses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have done a fair share of new part modding, in particular the Space Plane II parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Dupped a SP2 crew and made the primary node a back attach node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Dupped and Shrank the F2 to F1 fuel to F1 to F1/2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Dupped smaller conversion and gave it \u0027special\u0027 properties \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERant- Finding the SPP directory was not easy - shouldn\u0027t it belong in the parts directory?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom these parts it was possible to build a sleek 2 @ 2 symmetry space ship with a 4 nacell design really worthy of sci-fi notoriety, Bravo on the new parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComments: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. however, the capacity and fuel density of the SP2 monopropellant tank is about 2/3rds of what it should be. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Another bravo goes the the considerable number of fueled conversion parts, I found one deficiency, but more or less every conversion is covered. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I was looking at the SP2 \u0027telescoping\u0027 docking port, and I wondered could you actually transfer crew through such a crapped space. My solution as to convert a Side-Adapter mod into a back of the part as crew and goods transfer area. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Unrelated to new parts but somewhat related to 3, I think a factor 0.625 to 0.88 basic crew transfer shaft would be a nice addition to some ships, something about as long as MK1 but half to 70% as wide. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. I am looking to build parts for a high ISP VASIMR-like ION drive, there are issues discussed below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship was designed to be a true full feature interplanetary ship, capable of performing a multitude of independent missions in one trip, in this it accomplished its task but with exceptions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. To conserve fuel ION drive was used for the interior planets, it was decided that since a leg could be made from Moho to Eeloo taking full advantage of the Oberth effect and the proximity to the Kerbol this was a good choice. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. To utilize ION drive as frequently as possible on the burns including the landing burns (this is possible on many satellites).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Refuel as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the trip to Moho it was quickly realized that the mass density of Xenon is really low, one either has to bring a hideously large and wide Xenon tank into orbit or a bunch of F2 tanks (big-orange \u002764\u0027) dimension and chain them together on docking ports. We all know what happens when we do this [Kracken noises heard in the back ground]. The only other option is to use a F3 docking port. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SP parts work so much better than previous parts in terms of stability. Despite having a thrust slightly above the S gravity of Moho, the combination of high ISP engines and ion drive got the ship down safely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting up was no problem, but on the Moho-Eeloo transfer, Xenon was a major issue. The solution I have decided for this multimission ship is a higher ISP ION Drive, otherwise one needs to cheat on fuel density. There is plenty enough energy around MOHO to justify the change. This is only a ~5500 D/V and with high ISP (2000 to 5000s now) engines is should be easily accomplishable, except for the feul density issue. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEeloo landing - a breeze, no problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEeloo to Jool transfer - surprisingly easy (although took 5 years this ship has 7 crew and space for 42).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJool - Pol - 1st major problem, ship was damaged on landing - flight engineer I brought along was useless. (see below)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJool - Bop - Big problem, this is not the place to land a 100T (empty) ship. The biggest problem is that there is no unambiguous reference for terrain. I find myself saying \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027this l o o k s? like a slope\u0027 to move over and find what looked like a 20% grade from above is a 60% grade from the side view on descent. The only real positive reference was the asymmetry in light spot created in the \u0027night\u0027 landing cameras. This can be exaggerated by having two of different colors one mounted further back on the ship. However this only works well if the ship is within 100M of landing, not the time when to decide were to land. ON Bop there is the simultaneous issue of getting close enough to survey, changing direction, and staying far enough the terrain to avoid collision. Without telemetry, for large ships one needs to send out probes with rovers to select landing spots, this creates another problem (see below). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETerrain Guidance\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat we need here is terrain guidance of some sort, for example a switch that shows were the lowest and highest points in the terrain. Alternatively another map mode in which the gravity centered point-centered mess can be brought forward or backward against the terrain to see where the mesh first and finally breaks the surface. The irony here is that I have a massive space ship with a crew of 7 and 2 dozen veiw ports but still have no radio telemetry capability, even 100 M off the ground!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Cargo bay objects and lag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have to say from the start that the new 0.90 parts have greatly simplified ship building in terms of parts and need for converters etc. A comparable ship of complexity 0.90 versus previous 0.25 has lower lag, but with the new capabilities also comes the new sources of lag. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted several probes that could be dropped instead of landing. The weight and size was not an issue, but each probe adds to the part count. I was wondering why could not parts be frozen in a SP2 cargo bay when the doors were close and the part count diminished to 1 for the cargo bay only altering the weight of the cargo bay. I thinks a real good idea to mask part intricacy while the cargo-bay door is closed and SP2-cargo bay is structurally intact. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically 4 small probes (F-half) slowed the game down from just under normal time to about rate = 1/3 rd. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second issue was I fixed my sat with a modified smaller radial decoupler to the back, should the decoupler not be active until the cargo bay door is open. What Iam trying to say is that should not all the activities of parts in cargo-bay (e.g. fuel tanks, parachutes, etc) \u0027silence\u0027 while in a closed cargo bay?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe strut connector needs a more civilized big brother.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the advent of the new VAB \u0027tweak\u0027 tools, the strut connector needs to be appended. I Use a MK1 that has been side flattened to form a nacelle arm, it can be attached via strut connectors after tweaking, it would be nice to weld to parts together once they are inside a certain range (say 0.05M).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlexible attachment schemes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe use of adapters such as the radial attachment points (which I typically use for mounting complex engines to fuel tanks) are not really necessary under most uses and add to the part count. There should be part attachment nodes that can be \u0027stuck\u0027 in multiple, user chosen, ways. For example if I want to node- stick an engine to a tank, or stick the same engine in a 6:1 configuration to the same tank, I should have the option. Finding stable places to put nuclear engines and ION drives is not easy, and most endup cranking up parts count, hard to get into space, require unnecessary and unattractive strutting and a kracken fodder once there. These problems are largely solved by getting rid of the need for \u0027bridge\u0027 parts and creating flexible attachment parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAppending the above:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECargo bay wobble. This goes to the suggestion above that activities of objects in the cargo bay should be silenced. I found my cargo-ed lander was wobbling excessively. If I silenced the reaction wheels elsewhere it stopped, then finally silenced the reaction wheel on the lander, and turned on the main wheel.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-29T16:11:06Z\u0022 title=\u002201/29/2015 04:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yemo","CreatedById":114412,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T20:14:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHaving given up on career mode for the time being . . . \u003Cp\u003E1.
