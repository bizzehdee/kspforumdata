Transferring a Kerbal from one pod to another. If there is no available place for the kerbal to go... I get stuck in kerbal transfer mode and can\u0027t click on anything or get out of it while remaining in scene... hitting Esc and heading back to the space center and then back to the space craft through the tracking station works as a work around to restore normal function.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I have the Explore Duna mission. I have a craft in orbit around Duna. The part of the mission \u0022enter orbit around Duna\u0022 will not complete. When I look at the craft on the tracking station it says I\u0027m on a suborbital trajectory... but in reality I\u0027m very much in orbit. I sent another craft to land on Duna... I put it in a stable orbit first before going for the landing. That didn\u0027t tick the orbit box on the mission either. both craft were unmanned. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWindows. I assume 32bit as it\u0027s a Steam install and I believe that\u0027s the default setting. No mods\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP version 25.0.642\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
