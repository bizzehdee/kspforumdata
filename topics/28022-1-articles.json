One thing has occurred to me over these long months of lurking: The people here are insanely nice. Nowhere I looked have I found any source of spam, harsh criticism, or plain out trolling. Not only that, but a lurker also recently made it to the Community Spotlight on KSP Weekly on their first post. That inspired me to write this and say thanks to the community and to the moderators who keep it clean! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003ET\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#0000FF;\u0022\u003EH\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FFD700;\u0022\u003EA\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#696969;\u0022\u003EN\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008000;\u0022\u003EK\u003C/span\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FFA500;\u0022\u003EY\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EO\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#EE82EE;\u0022\u003EU\u003C/span\u003E!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
