Would be counter-productive for me to include them in a performance-oriented mod.  Perhaps if the goal of the mod was \u0027super-realistic models\u0027 it might be more pertinent; but as the goal of the mod is \u0027low-part-count performance friendly vessels (with better than stock detailing)\u0027, it goes directly against the theme of the mod.\n\nAs such, I had move on to working more on the mount geometry rather than wasting time on a feature that... I\u0027m not too impressed with anyway (especially after seeing the performance implications, and the massive change to model setup).\n\nYes, using skinned mesh renderers might look a bit better; but is it worth the massive change to engine model setup (and additional work on top of an already work intensive model), and the increased overhead/decreased performance?  I don\u0027t think so.  The current fuel-line baffle stuff looks acceptable and as far as I\u0027m aware is pretty close to how those lines would look when flexing (have never found videos of gimbal tests on engines that show good detail of the fuel line stuff)."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-18T21:48:11Z","Content":"Looking good is one thing, but if it is detrimental to cpu load, then not worth it."},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-18T21:50:21Z","Content":"[@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/) What causes the performance issues?

I wouldn\u0027t think that moving vertex groups around would be that costly.  And the stock Panther jet engine uses the same technique for its gimbal.\n\u003E \n\nIts caused by a few things:\n\n1.) Skinned mesh renderers are never batched.  One SMR = AT LEAST one draw call (possibly more with more complex shaders/texture setups).\n\n2.) For -each- vertex that is manipulated, a new matrix transform and multiplication must be done, for each bone that is influencing that vertex.  More verts being moved = worse performance.  More bones per vertex = even worse performance.  For my fairly-detailed engine models, moving around 4-6k verts to animate the bell is probably a bad thing (and due to how armatures are setup, that is the only way I could find to animate the fuel-lines; had to animate the entire gimballed portion of the model).\n\n3.) This is all done on CPU -- in a game that is already CPU limited due to phisics/joints/whatever the cause is.  Doubly bad.  If it did all the SMR calcs on the GPU I wouldn\u0027t stress it; but Unity apparently does them all on CPU.\n\n4.)  Apparently using SMRs can -increase- performance in rare cases where the single SMR is replacing -many- previously distinct objects.  From the reading/research I\u0027ve done, this is a rare case -- most real-use cases result in decreased performance when using SMRs, even when they are not currently animating.\n\nAs I stated in my last post -- I\u0027m going to do some actual in-game tests tonight (hopefully; if I can get the rigs to work in Unity) to see just how bad the performance hit is.\n\n[http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-SkinnedMeshRenderer.html](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-SkinnedMeshRenderer.html)\n\n[http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/skinned-meshes-performance-issues.261492/](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/skinned-meshes-performance-issues.261492/)\n\n[http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/skinnedmesh-performance.25257/](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/skinnedmesh-performance.25257/)\n\n[http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/MecanimPeformanceandOptimization.html](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/MecanimPeformanceandOptimization.html)"},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-18T22:22:50Z","Content":"[@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/) Thanks for the info, I think that makes sense.

Doing an in-game test now to see how it holds up...\n\nFound out a few things. 1.) If any vertex in a mesh is assigned to a bone; they all must be assigned to a bone. This is a Unity limitation; un-parented verts work fine in Blender.  2.) You can parent entire objects to bones; it just doesn\u0027t look like it in the hierarchy, and the methods to do so are a bit clunky.  3.) Wow.. the instructions/tutorials on this stuff... suck (esp. in regards to stuff that works in Unity).\n\nAfter parenting the main bell to a bone, and the frame to a bone, I split of the fuel-line joint areas and made them into a separate mesh (single mesh for both sides, so only one SMR for the entire engine), and set the vert weights for the 32 verts that comprised the skinned mesh.  This is probably as optimal (performance wise) as this setup would allow.  It actually removes two distinct objects (the fuel baffles), and the code running their constraint updates.  So.. trade 2 regular renders \u002B 2 active model constraints, for a single SMR; might be a decent tradeoff.  The gimbal actuators will still require distinct objects\u002Bconstraints, but there has not seemed to be any problem with those so far.\n\n![CWY39sv.png](http://i.imgur.com/CWY39sv.png)\n\nAdditionally, there is no noticeable hit from using quite a few engines (and tanks...) in a single scene (not sure how far I\u0027de have to go before I could even go below FPS cap....).  Pretty terrible test... but... at least I know there is not any massive/dramatic performance hit.\n\n![Zrl4C6Y.png](http://i.imgur.com/Zrl4C6Y.png)\n\nMy main objection is mostly to the change of workflow and model setup;  I\u0027m not a fan of how the hierarchy doesn\u0027t look proper in blender, and it messes up quite a bit of my naming/hierarchy scheme that I\u0027ve setup to keep these models manageable.  Nothing that can\u0027t be solved and/or re-learned given time... but I\u0027m going to make sure that this is something I want to move forward with before I do.  Will be a lot of work to re-rig all of the existing engines (and do some minor texture updates for the new geometry), and I\u0027m not sure I want to get into it that far.\n\nRe: Fairing textures -- I mentioned that the textures are configurable, but I should probably mention that the UV-mapping is configurable as well;  currently only on a simple level, but I\u0027ve set the mesh-generator up in such a way that it will be very easy to expand the functionality to more complex setups in the future.  However, as mentioned, it will be a ton of work to do so, and it is not anything I really want to get into at the moment.  Probably not a year worth of work, but likely a few weeks at least of headache inducing graphics math (which is why I delayed redoing the mesh-generator so long in the first place).\n\nFor now, you are more than welcome to try out other textures to see how they would look; they use the same UV map (by default-configurable) and layout that the stock fairing textures do (left side is the outside of the fairing, right side is the inside)."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-19T03:18:36Z","Content":"Pfff, I don\u0027t get past 30fps average with just regular parts.

This brings them to a mass ratio of 0.44 compared to the real article (where the real scaled value would be 0.64\\*0.64\\*0.64 = 0.26), so still vastly overweight compared to a true-cubic-scaled mass balance.\n\nHowever, this begs the rebalance of the SC-A and SC-B parts to bring them in-line with the mass balance of the SC-C parts. \n\n**SC-A-CM** - 5,560 kg \\* 0.44 = 2446.4kg  (or 2.5t); only slightly less than the 3.1 that it currently sits at, reduction of 0.6t  \n**New Mass** = 2.5t (total, including ablator, monoprop, etc)\n\n**SC-A-SM** - 24,520 kg \\* 0.44 = 10788.8kg (10.8t) (total mass) -- 6110kg dry mass \\* 0.44 = 2668kg (currently @ 3.5t, reduction of ~0.8t).  \n**New Mass** = 10.8t total, 2.7t dry, 8.1t propellant\n\n**SC-B-CM** - 10387kg \\* 0.44 = 4570.28kg (4.6t); current is 5.2, reduction of 0.6t  \n**New Mass** = 4.6t\n\n**SC-B-SM** - 15461kg \\* 0.44 = 6802.84kg(total mass) -- 6185kg dry mass \\* 0.44 = 2721.4kg (currently @ 6t, reduction of ~3.2t). (yah, this thing is massively overweight for some reason...)  \n**New Mass** = 6.8t total, 2.7t dry, 4.1 propellant\n\nWill probably work on updating those throughout the week, as well as fixing up the SC-B-SM RCS transforms to conform to the new system and improved control (esp during translation).\n\nEdit: Also... cleaning up the geo work for the last previously started engine; obviously it is a WIP (still missing a lot of geometry, needs all the mesh joins, cleanup, and the low-poly pass):\n\n![DHYuFRs.png](http://i.imgur.com/DHYuFRs.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-19T18:51:17Z\u0022 title=\u002201/19/2016 06:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-19T21:52:40Z","Content":"What engine is that?
