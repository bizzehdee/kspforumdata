Consider that could be a vein of harder material that formed under a hill of softer terrain during the Mun\\\u0027s formation and much more tectonically active history, and then the softer material was blown away by a nearby meteor strike later on. True, the chances would be astronomical, but when you are dealing with astronomical objects, those odds tend to become pretty favorable."}]}
