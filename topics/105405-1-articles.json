Do not ever treat longitude as being of constant physical distance, it\u0027s not. Latitude is constant physical distance, longitude varies according to latitude. Using longitude for distance is only valid at the equator, it\u0027s not even close once you\u0027re out of the equatorial region. That flaw made using SCANsat slower and more annoying than it needed to be. The longitudinal width of scan lines should grow with latitude on Mercator projection maps (or equivalent), tending towards 360\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 from a single pass over or near each pole, assuming a constant altitude circular orbit.
