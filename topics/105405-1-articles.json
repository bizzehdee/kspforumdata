Yeah, it\u0027s simple; but this is a game about flying things into and around orbits - once there\u0027s something interesting to do in orbit why would you make it happen instantaneously? Obviously there are people who like it the way it is, but to me it comes across as a prototype system - not something that belongs in 1.0. Of course this is the first release with resources, maybe they\u0027ll make it better in subsequent releases.

Once you start playing with mods that make Kerbals require oxygen, food and water a scanner taking time can have an impact. The old scansat system is a better system. If your going to realistically model rocket launches with aerodynamics, limited fuel and gravity why not every system in the game? Otherwise why not just place a scanner on the launch pad and instantaneously have the planet scanned. Or better yet as soon as you research the capability to use scanners have every planet automatically scanned?\n\nYou either model nothing or you model everything correctly in my opinion.\n\nHopefully the Scatsat guy will update his mod and change this system back to a more realistic and better system."},{"CreatedByName":"mike9606","CreatedById":90275,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T01:33:52Z","Content":"I myself prefer the current system, as I do not like having to sit for 5 minutes on max time warp.

What are your thoughts about it?\n\nConsidering that the information provided by this scanner is pretty much useless, you get what you pay for. So not at all OP.\n\nThe best way to think about the orbital ore scanner is as an abstraction of centuries of groundbased telescope observations of the planet going back to Kalileo, stuff you should arleady know before you left, but which the game has no other mechanism of presenting. All you get is a general idea that certain large regions of the planet in general might possibly have some ore here and there in higher concentrations than elsewhere. That\u0027s all you learn from this scanner. The only way to learn anything useful is to take this initial scan as a starting point for detailed, on the spot investigations with the much more accurate ground scanner and NBS. And most of the time, these scanners will show you that most of what the orbital scanner said was a lie."},{"CreatedByName":"zarakon","CreatedById":5160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T02:30:22Z","Content":"I\u0027ve gotten a few contracts to deploy satellites with the resource scanner on them\n\nNone of them put me in orbits where I could actually USE the scanner!"},{"CreatedByName":"iDisOrder","CreatedById":143952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T04:28:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E **Shameless promotion:**\n\u003E If the way the orbital surveyor works really bugs you, I made a [mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121298-1-0-2-Orbital-Survey-Plus-1-2-A-stock-survey-scanner-tweak-%28now-with-biome-overlay%21%29) that tweaks the surveyor to make it take longer to scan, as well as provide a biome overlay toggle along side the resource overlay toggle for planets that have been scanned.

It would add nothing of value to the game to force the player to sit watching it for a while. The current mechanic is basically just fine, and it is absolutely not overpowered or broken.\n\nThat said, \u0022just fine\u0022 isn\u0027t the same as impossible to make it better. \u0022Just fine\u0022 means that there\u0027s no burning issue with it that needs any urgent changes. I certainly wouldn\u0027t have a problem if the results were not available until it had been sitting up there for a while, as long as there was no pointless forced interaction with it.\n\nOne thing though, if there\u0027s to be any change, don\u0027t make the classic noob-navigator mistake that SCANsat historically made (not sure if it still has the flaw or not, have not used it in a long time). Do not ever treat longitude as being of constant physical distance, it\u0027s not. Latitude is constant physical distance, longitude varies according to latitude. Using longitude for distance is only valid at the equator, it\u0027s not even close once you\u0027re out of the equatorial region. That flaw made using SCANsat slower and more annoying than it needed to be. The longitudinal width of scan lines should grow with latitude on Mercator projection maps (or equivalent), tending towards 360\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 from a single pass over or near each pole, assuming a constant altitude circular orbit. The maths to calculate the correct longitudinal width are not difficult.\n\nI\u0027m also not convinced that ore scanning would really benefit from a model which required an actual complete scan based on the satellite physically passing over the entire surface through many orbits. Simply having the results available an hour or a day later would be fine, if there was to be any change at all, the precise detail of the scanning doesn\u0027t need to be implemented.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T05:43:14Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 05:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Murph**"},{"CreatedByName":"sj176","CreatedById":138287,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T22:54:33Z","Content":"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s that much of an issue.

To me, the current resource scanning system (the initial survey portion with the M700) seems inconsistent and doesn\u0027t teach the player anything, removing the hands-on discovery that made me fall in love with this game. Why do I have to be in a polar orbit? Because the thingy said so.\n\nThe current system limits choice. Sometimes I\u0027m only interested in scanning for resources along the equator, but I\u0027m forced into a polar orbit with my scanner regardless.\n\nIt also don\u0027t take into account any logistic challenges that come real-time scanning, like maintaining electric charge or coordinating time frames with your other missions.\n\nI\u0027m not saying I want SCANsat to be stock, but it would be nice to have some semblance of real-world orbital scanning mechanics. Personally I\u0027d rather the scanner have an unrealistically huge FOV to make the process quicker and simpler but still show players why a polar orbit is needed to map the whole planet. That seems more consistent with the rest of KSP\u0027s design philosophy.\n\nBut that\u0027s just my opinion!
