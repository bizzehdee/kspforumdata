In an episode, I saw him attaching Mk16 parachutes (the little ones) to a lander. I wanted to do the same. But I couldn\u0027t do it for some reason. Now I have a bit of a dilemma. I want a detachable escape tower for the Mk1 pod, and the current radial parachutes look obnoxious for such a small pod. If the Mk16 unradialability was an accident, or even intentional, I would love to see it back. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DisarmingBaton5","CreatedById":68576,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-07T01:31:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI always turn on part clipping and put an octagonal strut inside a mk16 chute.
