Trying to make a custom KSP controller with arduino, but I\u0027ve encountered a problem:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m using the Joystick arduino library (the second version)\u00A0and a potentiometer to control the X axis of the controller. I\u0027ve checked it on Devices and Printers, in the \u0022controller settings\u0022: it works, the dot moves from one side of the square to the other. But when I launch KSP and assign that particular axis to, say, Roll control, the spacecraft starts spinning because the axis motion is wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s call -1 one of the limit angles of the potentiometer, 1 the other and 0 the center. The expected behaviour is: the spacecraft rolls one way\u00A0when the potentiometer is at state 1, the other way at -1 and it does not spin at state 0. The actual behaviour is, instead, that it spins one way at state 0, the other way at state 1 and it stops at, say, 0.5 (haven\u0027t really defined it, but you get what I mean, at (\u002Blimit angle)/2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI read somewhere that this is because there is some compatibility issue with some controller setup, and although I am myself a Unity developer I haven\u0027t really used controllers that much in my games and I admit my ignorance on the topic, so if any of y\u0027all beautiful people can help I\u0027ll be happiest to go on with my project \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
