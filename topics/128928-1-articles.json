First of all I would like All keys to be in it. This means that I could klik a button and it will both pitch up and yaw left. I can also add something to the roll or yaw group to steer wheels. I would also like rover wheels to be able to be controlled with action groups.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy next suggestion is a Lego robotics type programming interface for action groups and only available in the vab and with someone who has a level 3 vab and level 3 mission control and a tech node that gives a part called \u0022action group control unit\u0022. Exploding the part means all action group programs cannot run. For how the programming would work this is what I came up with\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0start=\u0026gt; wait until rocket reaches 10000m=\u0026gt; turn 20degreez left=\u0026gt;stop program\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nor something like\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nstart=\u0026gt; loop until X key is clicked[set throttle to 100%=\u0026gt; wait until plane reaches 600m/s=\u0026gt; set throttle to 20%=\u0026gt; wait until plane reaches 550m/s]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nor\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nstart=\u0026gt;wait 20 seconds=\u0026gt;if decoupler X has decoupled end program=\u0026gt; if not decouple it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhat do you think? This would allow you to make your own autopilot so this is not taking away?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
