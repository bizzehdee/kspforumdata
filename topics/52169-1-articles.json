These days, CPUs like your Intel i7 have multiple cores, which in most circumstances act like multiple CPUs to divvy up the processing work. It\u0027s a feature that is called multithreading, but unfortunately KSP doesn\u0027t make use of this feature. So what\u0027s more important than the number of cores your CPU has (whether it be 2, 4, 6 or 8) \u003Cem\u003Eis how fast its clock speed is\u003C/em\u003E (2.8, 3.0, 3.2gigaherz), etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, having a high clock speed will allow the game to run better because even though a program with multithreading utilization can use all 8 cores of a 2.6gigaherz octo-core CPU to do calculations really fast, a no-multithreading program like KSP can only use the 8 cores as if they were a single core clocked at 2.6 gigaherz, which is pretty slow these days for calculation intense games such as KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, while it\u0027s obviously good to have a decent graphics card in KSP, it\u0027s not as important as it would be for a game like Crysis because KSP doesn\u0027t use graphics cards nearly as much as it utilizes the CPU.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, anything over like 6gb of RAM should be enough memory as the game doesn\u0027t use more than 2 or 3gb IIRC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*** This is all an overgeneralization\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-07T02:15:45Z\u0022 title=\u002211/07/2013 02:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by hobbsyoyo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
