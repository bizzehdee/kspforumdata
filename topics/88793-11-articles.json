This isn\u0027t the \u0022cost per launch\u0022, which would include a whole lot of fixed costs, including infrastructure and development, which are confidential corporate information.

In this case, the service wasn\u0027t provided, si I\u0027m guessing that the contract says that they owe NASA another flight. The rocket and spacecraft belong to them, so either they were insured and the cost of the vehicle is paid back, or they weren\u0027t and it\u0027s a loss for them. Hopefully, this sort of contigency was provisioned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the infrastructure damage, Wallops Island facilities belong to NASA and are leased to the launch provider.
