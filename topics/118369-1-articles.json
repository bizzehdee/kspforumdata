And even then sometimes you pay dearly in dV because you can\u0027t hit a window in time due to Minmus\u0027 position. Yup, I do follow you on youtube, in case you didn\u0027t know already. You build \u003Cem\u003Etiny\u003C/em\u003E!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can, however, get the proverbial nine tenths of the dV savings, with much more often launch windows (8.3 times more often, or every six days to any given ejection angle), basing the whole thing in Mun instead. The difference in LKO during the ejection maneuver is about 100m/s, plus 100-200 to leave Mun depending on how high your Munar depot is, compared vs lifting from Minmus and ejecting there like you do for about 300m/s, so the advantage from Minmus, dV-wise is pretty much nonexistant if you factor orbital depots. You pay in worse fuel \u0022gear ratio\u0022 (the fuel tankers to supply the orbital depot eat some fuel per kg delivered), and have another craft to fly, of course, but hey, compromise solution. If you launched straight from the ground in both cases Mun would be about 600m/s more expensive for a given ejection on account of the bigger gravity well, but if both places used orbital depots, then the difference is much less, at about a couple hundred m/s. All figures, of course, eyeballed and only approximate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there are other metrics that could make the second-best alternative the most ideal. For example, you can supply at the last second some expedition, because the flight time there is a few hours. That is something that can\u0027t be measured in numbers, but that I find very useful because all of us forget \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E at launch. Or it turns out that we added some numbers wrong and we need some solar panels, or something. Plus, I play with KAS\u002BKIS, so orbital outfitting is really cool to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen again, you go much more minimal that I do, of course. And to each their own! But if you have a rugged mission architecture, with built-in dV margins, it\u0027s good to put them to use into making your mission planning more convenient. My only 1.0 save is currently at day 21, with a couple million on the bank and Mun and Minmus tamed already (surface base with mining equipment, orbital depot, the works). Now I\u0027m grabbing some \u0027roids to get the LKO depot going and make surface mining mostly obsolete, with a bit of luck. I anticipate I will need fuel around kerbin much less often from now on, so perhaps stockpiling a few E-classes I will have enough. Sentinels are great to find them! I already have three targets, and a test refinery is going to grab a C-Class in a couple days to practice.

Note that there is no rule as to \u003Cem\u003Ewhere\u003C/em\u003E to put the depot. But going to Minmus means your launch dV is about 5km/s, while reaching a LKO depot is about 3.5km/s. The most convenient for the mission itself is a depot in low kerbin orbit and leaving form there, but that will mean a complicated mining operation to get the fuel in place. The easiest on infrastructure is to refuel directly on Minmus\u0027 surface, but that takes a lot out of the ship to get there in the first place, and Minmus is only on the right spot to launch to a given escape trajectory once every 50 days. Munar orbit is a happy medium, if you know how to do things to keep your energy when you leave the kerbin system, your escape will be about 800m/s cheaper than from low kerbin orbit, and you get launch windows every six days.... but you still need much more dV on the launch vehicle if you don\u0027t have a LKO refuelling station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you are worried about life support, a trip to Minmus to refuel will eat about 15 days of food, while Mun will be under one before you are on your way. Either way, if you are going interplanetary, pack enough food for a couple years... you might miss a return window or something. Also, 5th Horseman has a nice config file to allow the refineries to produce Mulch to feed your life support systems from ore, I\u0027d advise doing something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd lastly, I will note, that if you really just want to fuel a big mothership on orbit because you couldn\u0027t launch it full, SSTOs are probably the most economical way to do it: fuel is dirt cheap, and carrying a small satellite in the bay will allow you to actually earn money doing fuel runs if you pick the relevant contracts. I\u0027m talking something like a 0.5mT probe making about 200-400k\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1 by completing a couple of contracts every time I launch a Big Red worth of fuel in a Longsword, for absolute peanuts (10k\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1 in fuel or less? something ridiculous like that). That\u0027s about 200k\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1 positive cash flow, for every Big Red I put up there. And the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122347-Longsword-Big-Reds-to-orbit-at-25-payload-fraction\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELongsword\u003C/a\u003E isn\u0027t even a particularly huge SSTO (though it \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E efficient, costing ~200k\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1 itself, which means I can stomach the loss if my cat makes me crash one on landing).

You park a tanker (not a depot) in Minmus orbit, refuel it with several launches from the lander (which need not refuel it in a single launch- having a smaller lander saves you on initial setup costs) and then have the tanker return to Low Kerbin Orbit- using the atmosphere to drop the orbit back down over one or more aerobraking passes from a return trajectory (which is EXTREMELY cheap from Minmus- if you eject from Minmus\u0027 SOI heading retrograde relative to the moon\u0027s orbit around Kerbin...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf done properly this is actually cheaper in Delta-V than returning to LKO from Munar orbit, due to the weaker gravity-well and much lower orbital velocity of Minmus than the Mun... The tanker can be quite large and designed without the thrust needed to land (it also doesn\u0027t need landing-legs, which is another reason to have a specialized lander...) using something like an LV-N for propulsion, for instance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tanker meets up with craft needing refueling in Low Kerbin Orbit and refuels it, leaving just enough fuel to return to Minmus to refuel again. The tanker can also double as a tug or transfer-stage, and can be used to haul modules back to Minmus that are too large to refuel in LKO in a single trip... (keeping the two vessels docked reduces the number of transfer and capture-burns you have to make, and allows use of the tankers possibly higher-ISP engines)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis plan can also be carried out with the lander returning all the way to LKO, to reduce the need for rendezvous and docking, but this will be much less efficient in terms of fuel \u0022gear-ratio\u0022. By the time the lander even makes Minmus orbit, it will have already emptied a portion of its fuel tanks and you will be wasting fuel moving empty fuel tank mass back to LKO.

For any given unit of player time, you can advance your space program a lot more through other means.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realize some enjoy setting up the operation simply for its own sake, and that\u0027s totally cool. However, in terms of being a practical gameplay solution to anything other than a handful of problems (the Eve landing/return example mentioned previously being one), I feel it leaves a lot to be desired. The relationship of player-time to in-game resources is a rather sticky problem to deal with for this kind of system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
