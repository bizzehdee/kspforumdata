Perhaps a different modifier key would be preferable...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot to say that I don\u0027t agree with the basic premise here - I once landed a rover on the Mun with a separable sky-crane. Landed, started the engines running and then separated it so that it could disappear off into space. A very short while later, I accidentally switched to it via the \u0060[\u0060 key. Of course, I\u0027d over-estimated how much fuel it needed in the first place so the engines were still running. So I couldn\u0027t leave it because it was accelerating. And I couldn\u0027t shut it down because it didn\u0027t have any control (such as a probe core). So, I had to wait through 30 minutes of game time until the engines finally used up all of the fuel (and it was on an escape course out of the system - I did say I\u0027d overestimated the fuel) before I could switch back to an interesting vessel and carry on actually playing the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-01T11:12:38Z\u0022 title=\u002204/01/2015 11:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Damien_The_Unbeliever\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T11:32:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes.
