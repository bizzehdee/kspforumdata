to a relevant post.\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0 It\u0027s six\u00A0years old but still accurate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Gigantor solar panels are rated for 24.4 ec/s\u00A0 at Kerbin\u0027s\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eorbit,\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0as in at Kerbin\u0027s distance from the sun, absent any intervening obstacles.\u00A0 Intervening obstacles can include the Mun during eclipses, Kerbin itself (Kerbin tends to shade the panels a bit at night), and atmosphere.\u00A0 Because of this, the surfaces of the inner planets are actually some of the worst\u00A0places in the solar system to use solar panels:\u00A0 solar panels at Eve sea level (with 5 atm of pressure) tend to be about two-thirds as efficient as panels at Kerbin orbit, and Moho\u0027s 61-day night (owing to its crazily-long rotation period with respect to its orbit about the sun) is something of an issue, as well.\u00A0 High temperatures affect panel efficiency, too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the linked post, testing showed that near\u00A0Kerbin sea level, Gigantors produce something in the neighbourhood of 21.5 ec/s at noon and get worse from there.\u00A0 Near sunrise and sunset, they make less than 1.5 ec/s.\u00A0 I don\u0027t know the decay curve, but there\u0027s no way that the average output is more than 90 ec/s over the course of the day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother possibility is how many converters you are running on your converters.\u00A0 By that I mean to say that the Convert-O-Tron 250 has four converters on it:\u00A0 Monopropellant, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, Ox, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid

and so each will pull 30 ec/s to run.\u00A0 (They will also overheat the part if you try to run more than two, I think).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany players use fuel cell arrays rather than solar for their conversion processes, since the cells consume less than the converters produce, still generate respectable power, work at night, and don\u0027t break off in atmosphere.\u00A0 It chafes at my understanding of thermodynamics, but it\u0027s a valid gameplay strategy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022
