This means some major programs like Apollo, Soyuz and many others are still missing, which I feel is a shame. Whitecat\u0027s pack already covers most of these, but has a lot of overlap with this pack and so won\u0027t work too well together. He has been gone for some years now, and the license would allow integration of these 2 mods, so that would be the goal.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EHoSf light version(\u00AE): a new, different version of this huge contract pack, that cuts back severely on the repetitive missions and removes the launch failures. The result would be (what\u0027s in a name) a light version of this pack that\u0027s quicker to play through. It would be a middle ground in terms of size and progression between Historical Progression and HoSf. The really interesting part would however be this: because of the size reduction, it becomes easier to do more interesting things per contract. The idea would be to add more parameters to each contract, and in particular add specific parameters for user of Bluedog Design Bureau and possibly also ProbesPlus and Tantares. This way using the excellent real-alike reproductions could be incentivized.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI would REALLY love to know what people think about these ideas, so please share your thoughts if you are interested in any of this!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
