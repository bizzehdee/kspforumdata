\u00A0The core of my argument is that looking at this as an engineering problem from a high level view, the asteroid belt is a far more tractable problem than Mars. \u00A0Being able to do full up testing, being freed from many causes of sudden catastrophic failure, and so on all make it far more doable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-20T05:12:22Z\u0022 title=\u002209/20/2016 05:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by SomeGuy123\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-20T05:43:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the sci-fi book which I\u0027m currently reading (Robert Ibatullin, \u0022Rose and worm\u0022), they did the following.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a kilometer-sized \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/db_search/show_object?utf8=%E2%9C%93\u0026amp;object_id=16912\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Enear-Earth asteroid\u003C/a\u003E, a former comet core.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith mess of silicates, water and ammonia ice inside, regolith layer on surface, visually - a piece of stone.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the near future (2280) it should get a close (400 km) flyby of smaller asteroid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst they dropped a descent of drillbots which made holes in the stone layer.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen they dropped into the holes thermochemical bots which:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) produced heat, melting/evapourating the frozen fluids, which were slowly bursting the asteroid with gas bubbles like a dough, turning it into a porous ball full of caverns.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) produced chemical agents polymerizing the released hydrocarbons, together with ammonia, water and silicates, steeping this porous ball structures with a glue which then turned into plastic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile all this joy was taking place, special bacteria inside caverns produced oxy, hydro and carbo.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWeaverbots made a net\u002Bcable from carbon, turning it many times around the asteroid.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen a counterpart asteroid got closer, a rocketbot took the cable and harpooned it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo they got a 400-km (originally) asteroid dumbbell rotating once per hour with 1/5 earth gravity, with several thousand of genetically adapted human species inside living in caverns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut they did this only after the Earth was destroyed by an alien attack.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNo purpose in any colonization IRL.

Robotic worms would eat out the asteroid from the inside, outside a system of magnetically launched and landed buckets would move mined material up and equipment down (few m/s tops) to a mining station that orbits above the asteroid. Compressed O2 and O2 ion engines would be use for attitude control and station keeping. The mining Station would first heat the asteroid material in hydrogen gas to several thousands degrees, boiling off the lighter lowing boiling point minerals as hydride, the hydrides would be electroplated or plasmified back into raw elements (recycling the hydrogen). The heavier stuff would then be burned in\u00A0fluorine and separated by boiling point and electroplating voltage (recycling the fluorine).
