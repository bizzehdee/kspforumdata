The main issue being that the whole thing flopped and bounced about until all the wheels were busted bar the inner mining module which was fine and didn\u0027t bounce about at all. The whole vehicle was launched as one vessel but it just went crazy flopping like a fish until all the tires were popped.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is my rover for the sake of so you can see what I mean and how it\u0027s built in case that helps any.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u00224uTtcjz.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4uTtcjz.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022uLXRoJR.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uLXRoJR.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nany help or advice would be helpful.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe wheels are from Buffalo and the inner module is EPL. The wheels are mounted to IR parts but I haven\u0027t had trouble with the wheels being mounted on them until I launched the vessel with module and the Rear cab attached. Any advice would be appreciated.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit : The instant I docked the cab to the smelters All the tires popped at once. And the two cabs connected by the two running boards could drive just fine but then would suddenly have the tires all take their turn to pop within 2 seconds. I was watching the wheel stress and it showed no sign of high stress though the bounced like they wre running over something despite being stationary.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u00229Ynzk7E.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9Ynzk7E.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u00228ML3eSL.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8ML3eSL.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI will note the two smelters are using the same wheels and they haven\u0027t popped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-10T01:33:16Z\u0022 title=\u002211/10/2016 01:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by ThatHomelessGuy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
