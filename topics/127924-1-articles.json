I have been playing this game for about a year now, and not once have I seriously landed or orbited anything around any other planet in the game. Up until now. Playing career, and I had this plan that if I established a presence in the Duna/Ike system, I could use it as an outpost for other interplanetary missions. At least for the outer bodies beyond Duna. So far, my plan is to first establish a mining operation on Ike, using an orbital station around that to help refuel interplanetary vessels and such. After that, I might build an orbital station around Duna itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far, I got the mining packages of my station in orbit around Ike and am already mining it, and I\u0027ve already sent a lander onto Duna, which is now in the process of returning some nice fresh science back to Kerbin. It gets old after a while farming Minmus and Mun dry of science to complete your tech tree, after all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt has taken me a bit too long to seriously touch another planet, but my plans are finally coming to fruit. I\u0027m super excited, and I will share pictures after I deploy more orbital station packages. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-15T18:18:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCongrats...
