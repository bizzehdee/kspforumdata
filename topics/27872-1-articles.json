I have one window setup that has drag losses, gravity losses, steering losses, and dV expended. It also has my steering error and a suicide burn timer. There is a button that is called MARK that will reset the whole lot. You can just click mark before your maneuver and you will know how much dV it costs you. I use this all the time to decide how much fuel to pump into my transport units since they can generally carry many times more fuel than is needed to land at the mining site.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheFooBar","CreatedById":66951,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T15:00:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve installed MechJeb but I can\u0027t seem to find (or I\u0027m overlooking) where the expended delta-v is at.
