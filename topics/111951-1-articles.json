Maybe that\u0027s due to me being more programmer than mathematician.\n\nIt is algorithmic, which, in my view, is primarily due to the step-wise method of dV calculation for staged rockets. It also depends on what value you\u0027re trying to optimize: launch mass, dV, cost, etc. \n\nI recall seeing a webpage (which I frustratingly can\u0027t find right nowon project rho [here](http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/multistage.php)) that discussed having a hapless graduate student plug in various values to determine the optimal ration of fuel between *two* rocket stages to minimize total launch mass. In a two stage system the solution is relatively easy to find, but in a *three* stage system the solution becomes much more difficult to locate.\n\nIf you\u0027re optimizing dV, in theory there wouldn\u0027t be a solution because larger stage attached below any described rocket, which can have another booster stage attached beneath it, etc etc.\n\nIn my experience, it\u0027s simply easier and equally (if not more) effective to design rockets with stages for specific jobs, e.g. 1 or 2 stages to launch to LKO, a separate stage for a transfer, etc. You can optimize for each leg of the journey.\n\nAdditionally, Wikipedia has some interesting information on optimizing rocket staging [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket#Optimal_staging_and_restricted_staging) and cites [Curtis\u0027 Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students](https://www.amazon.com/Orbital-Mechanics-Engineering-Students-Aerospace/dp/0080977472/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8\u0026qid=1433432512\u0026sr=8-1\u0026keywords=curtis\u002Borbital\u002Bmechanics).

For an early example, you could have a Swivel or Reliant launch to 30k, and have a Terrier take over where the atmosphere becomes super thin. As long as TWR is adequate, you save on fuel efficiency by both dumping the dead weight and switching to a more efficient engine (which can be done before many people, I believe, assume).\n\nThere are also other considerations of course. Say you\u0027re making an expedition to Mun. Your lander has about 3k of dV with reserves of 360 fuel. You could build a relatively cheap lifting and transfer stage, land once (and move once or twice) and be able to make it home. Alternatively, you could overbuild your lifting and transfer stages, have some junior docking ports on a massive transfer stage, and use that to refuel from Munar orbit - leading to 5 or 6 times the number of landings for perhaps only 2x the cost. Here, the utility of creating an extra 15-20k dV can trump early atmospheric staging concerns."},{"CreatedByName":"Northlight","CreatedById":142232,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T16:56:03Z","Content":"Only way to determine wheter to stage or not, (And how many stages you should have) is to do the math for each variant.\n\nGiven a target delta-v, and payload.\n\n\\* How big (in tonnes) is the rocket if only using one stage?

The bad news is that the solutions are complicated and ugly, even in simplified special cases.\n\nIn a typical simplified scenario, the goal is to maximize the payload fraction for a given delta-v target. Rocket stages are defined by two parameters, Isp and dry mass fraction, and you can scale them up and down arbitrarily. There are no TWR requirements, Isp does not change during flight, and only vertical staging is allowed. If all stages are have the same parameter values, each of them should provide the same amount of delta-v. If one stage has a strictly better (Isp, dry mass fraction) combination than another, it should provide more delta-v.\n\nThe optimal number of stages depends on the delta-v target and stage parameters. In KSP, the availability of suitable engines also has an important role. One stage per 2000 m/s should be about right for Kerbin launches, with something like 2500 m/s from low-TWR stages with efficient conventional engines. This means two stages to LKO or for an encounter with the Mun, and three stages for Mun landing or Jool encounter."},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T19:31:57Z","Content":"First off, there won\u0027t be a formula. I\u0027m also sure this problem is also NP complete.\n\nThere are two big ways staging gives mass advantage in KSP. Engine specialization and dead weight removal.\n\nEngine specialization is simply using the right engine for the right situation. You won\u0027t use a 909 for takeoff just like you would avoid a mainsail for interplanetary travel. The ISPs create relative advantages between atmospheric and vacuum operations.\n\nDead weight removal is about not carrying mass that has no use. 1\u002B TWR with 4km/s dV requires a lot of engine. Towards the end of that tank you really don\u0027t need all that engine (or tank). If you could lose some of it you would need less fuel for that same dV.\n\nThe easiest place to see staging offering a mass advantage is drop tanks. The dry mass of the largest tanks is more that a comparable stack seperator. For a long train of drop tanks, the lack of trailing empty tanks will create a dV advantage which means you need a shorter train for the same total dV."},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T22:46:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t think it\u0027s been updated to 1.0.2, just to 1.0, but the [Kerbal Optimal Rocket Calculator](http://garycourt.github.io/korc/) does things algorithmically - try all combinations and look at the best results.

It\u0027ll give you the general case of what the lightest possible rocket looks like.\n\u003E - - - Updated - - -\n\u003E \n\u003E I didn\u0027t say acceleration, I said TWR, that skipper SSTO you talk about isn\u0027t getting off the launchpad at all until it burns most of your fuel.\n\nAs a *practical* matter yes. As a *mathematical* problem, no.\n\nI am aware that the single stage \u0022solution\u0022 will not \\*actually\\* function on Kerbin due to changes in pressure affecting Isp and thrust, but that question is not solvable mathematically. \n\n The problem is more generic than that. \n\n If given an arbitrary engine and mission requirement, at what point does staging show a reduction in stage mass?\n\n I would have thought that it would happen when the mass of the empty tanks in the single stage match the mass of twice the added engine in the two stage design, but the model isn\u0027t supporting that assumption.\n\n It seems that the single stage design is working out lighter until the DV requirement exceeds the capability of the single stage design."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T03:49:36Z","Content":"Without TWR restriction, the answer is never - two simple proposition should kill it. One is for each given stage, more than 1 engine is never better than using just 1 using the same amount of fuel (this easy to prove, since Isp doesn\u0027t change, and the ln term will get bigger by reducing engine mass). The other is staging two 1 engines is never better than combining the two stages with the same amount of fuel (to prove this, notice that if fuel mass z is given, then ln((x\u002Bz)/x) is a decreasing function, so putting second stage engine and decoupler is always worse).\n\nWith TWR restriction, things become interesting, but we need to rigorously define the restriction before we dig into it.\n\nEDIT: screw it - I know I often produce bad proofs. Apparently I forgot empty tank mass - let me recalculate and update later\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-05T04:20:05Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2015 04:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FancyMouse**"}]}
