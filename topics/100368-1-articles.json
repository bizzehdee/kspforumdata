I have been playing KSP since it came out on Steam and I\u0027ve been having a lot of fun over the many months, setting new challenges for myself and developing the craft to succeed at them. In both the campaign and sandbox, I\u0027ve landed crew on the surfaces of all the planets (that have a surface) and all the moons, both in the stock game and with selected mods. I\u0027m very confident in my ability to put any size and type payload in orbit around, or on the surface of, any object in the Kerbol system. With the exception of two places, I\u0027m also confident that I can return the crew back home after their long journey! I\u0027ve not been able to return from the surface of Eve or Tylo. I\u0027m working with the Stock game for now, as I\u0027d like to be able to accomplish this without any mods that make it easier, and obviously favorite mods like Ferram Aerospace Research and Deadly Reentry make it more difficult for Eve, when used together. I can get a large, fully fueled craft to the surface of Eve, but it doesn\u0027t have enough power to return to orbit. If I give it more fuel, it makes it too tall and it tips over when it lands, or too fat, which increases the drag on the return flight. To make things even more frustrating, I haven\u0027t been able to find any videos of anyone who has landed on the surface of Eve, planted a flag, and returned the crew to Eve orbit in the stock game. I\u0027ve seen people use mods that make it easier, outright cheat, or use over powered sci-fi type parts, but never in the stock game. There is a single video from Scott Manley, in an early version of KSP, where he lands on and returns to orbit from the surface of Eve (probably in a stock game, as he doesn\u0027t mention any mods) but he never plants a flag there!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s interesting that Eve and Tylo are so opposite: you can use parachutes to get a fully fueled craft to the surface of Eve, but can\u0027t use parachutes at all on Tylo. On Tylo, there\u0027s no atmosphere in your way to get back to orbit, but on Eve there\u0027s so much of it, most of the fuel you need is just to get out of the thickest part. The Tylo lander I built gets there just fine, but is almost out of fuel when it does land, with not enough to beat Tylo\u0027s gravity on the return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone please point me to any of the following?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A3 A video of someone in a recent version of KSP, using stock parts and no flight consequential mods, showing a mission that plants a flag on Eve or Tylo, and returns to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A3 A craft, using only stock parts, designed to land and return to orbit from the surface of Eve or Tylo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A3 Advice on how to design and/or fly craft to accomplish the mission of returning from the surface of Eve or Tylo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe what I\u0027m looking for is already out there, and I just haven\u0027t been able to find it, so links are helpful.

Tylo is perhaps the highest test of your rocket piloting skills, with the strong gravity that will slam your lander downwards if you aren\u0027t careful, and guzzle your fuel if you have to hover for any length of time. But design-wise it\u0027s not too bad. Eve on the other hand is a major design and engineering challenge, but the flying is relatively straightforward - though you may need to be good at precision landings if you aren\u0027t taking enough delta-V for a launch from low altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T03:57:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETylo (although ive never managed it in a SSTO yet), is extremely easy to pull off, provided you have a high dV and moderate TWR craft.

The design above was supposed to have ladders up the side to gather science, but I forgot \u0027em, and had to do insane maneuvers to get the science back (ballistic EVA) as the science equipment was meant to be left behind. Kerbals have about 300n of EVA thrust, giving them 3.2m/s^2 accel - or a bit less than half of Tylo\u0027s surface gravity, so you can\u0027t EVA-cheese your way past ladder design here!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my advice for Eve: \u0027Tis a silly place.

A Tylo landing and ascent into orbit can be accomplished in a \u003Cem\u003Esingle stage\u003C/em\u003E (which is useful if you want to reuse your lander to make a bunch of Tylo landings on the same mission).

Doing so allows you to decrease the size DRAMATICALLY. This is a \u0022tiny Tylo lander\u0022 I made sometime last year. It caries a single Kerbal in a command chair. The Kerbals weight is counter-balanced by a goo experiment on the other side (it took a lot of testing on Kerbin to get it right). It wouldn\u0027t work right now because it\u0027s lacking reaction wheels (the probe core I used no longer has reaction wheels), but that could be easily rectified. I\u0027d probably sacrifice some of the RCS. It\u0027s powered by 8X 48-7S engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AXkL6PR.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022AXkL6PR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo Tylo is easy to make a lander for, but difficult to fly it, actually. You have to time your deorbit burns just right. But that\u0027s what quicksave and quickload are for, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEVE, OTOH is far more difficult. You need like 11,500\u002B delta-V to make it to orbit from sea level, AND a TWR of around 2 for all the lower stages- and that\u0027s an EVE TWR of 2, so like 32, 33 m/s acceleration. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy early Eve landers worked but were mounstrous; the first I made was 700 tons and couldn\u0027t even make it from sea level to orbit, it had to be launched from like 2000 meters elevation at least. The second generation I made was better, but still 400 tons, IIRC. Finally, I dumped the requirement for a crew cabin and science experiments; my Eve-bound Kerbals simply live and work in a big habitat that lands \u003Cem\u003Eseparately\u003C/em\u003E, and use a rover to drive them over to the Eve ascent vehicle (which I landed somewhere nearby) when they are ready to depart. This allows me to create an Eve ascent vehicle (\u0022EAV\u0022) that solely is devoted to getting to orbit. So my Kerbals sit protected by a \u0022wind screen\u0022 in command chairs. My current design only has seats for 2, but I could expand its seating to 4 if I wanted, I think. But it would be wasted weight when I\u0027m only planning on two-man Kerbal Eve surface missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncluding the orbital maneuvering engines- which are jettisoned during landing- the entire thing weighs just 162 tons (the actual ascent vehicle part of it weighs 135 tons). Earlier designs of my EAVs had the parachutes jettison on takeoff, but with these newer designs that have a lower center of gravity, that only saved a few m/s delta-V so I judged it overkill. Anyway, it uses two separate stages of asparagus staging. The first set of asparagus staging uses aerospike engines to get through the lower atmosphere. Stacked on top of this asparagus assembly is a second, smaller asparagus staged assembly that is based on 48-7S engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy \u0022EAV Mk6\u0022, including orbital maneuvering engine and docking port-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9kHxXPV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229kHxXPV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is just the ascent stages.
