I\u0027m now starting a new program with less mods installed then before. I\u0027ve found now that the stock parts really meet my needs in all ways but one - fairings. Therefore I installed the KW Rocketry mod to take advantage of the nice fairings in that. I\u0027ve also installed crew manifest and Kerbal Alarm Clock for better flight management. So with a renewed spirit, I have christened the Phoenix Program:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ESub-program 1: The Robin Series - suborbital/orbital satellites and probes to test basic propulsion and design configurations.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EFirst Mission: Robin I\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObjective: Test basic steering and fairing design while carrying a suborbital probe which will take atmospheric readings during its descent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LXYic5L.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LXYic5L.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst launch of the Phoenix Program - Robin I heads skywards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3j6PuIQ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223j6PuIQ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket continues to ascend as the motor runs out of fuel.
