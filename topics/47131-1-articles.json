Usual update times were of about 3-4 months, they dropped down to 2-3 months for .20 and .21 but the devs decided to go back to the old development cycle, so we are back into 3-4 months periods between updates. Last update was end of July, so I wouldn\u0027t be expecting the update before end of October. It hasn\u0027t even entered experimentals yet, although from the weeklies, I believe they shouldn\u0027t be too far \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, that said, no need to ask for release dates, no one knows them, not even the devs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThread closed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
