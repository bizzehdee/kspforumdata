Almost everything gets sent up without crew too. The most senior kerbonauts (Bill, Bob, and Jeb) are quite busy and take more junior staff with them, but they get the first choice at the best missions, but they don\u0027t hang around while the expedition is being put together. I would like the ability to upgrade some of the other kerbonauts to that elite, orange uniform, status.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-28T21:57:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Stealth2668\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Stealth2668\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERight now I use one stage to get me to about 10km, then a stage to circularize, and lastly the lander stage that goes to another planet. What about going to far planets? How do you go about that? Just wondering what more experienced people do. Also this is for career mode.

Always start with the payload because on this all else depends. First, decide what the payload\u0027s job is, like land on Duna and return with 2 each Goo and Material bays plus whatever other science you can do. Having thus spec\u0027d out the payload, design and build it to meet the specs. Now it\u0027s simply a question of providing sufficient motive power and there you have many options depending on what all else you want to accomplish. For a Duna trip, you can have anything from a bigger version of your Mun rocket and flying it the same way so the lander gets itself home. Or you can have a mothership and leave the lander at Duna for future use, and many other things. It only depends on your ambitions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the staging, however, that depends on 3 things: 1) the mass of the payload, 2) where you\u0027re sending it, and 3) what mods, if any, you\u0027re using. Some mods have such big rocket parts that you can, with a sufficiently light payload, do a single-stage-to-Duna thing. But there are also things like FAR/NEAR and Deadly Reentry that make you build rockets within some constraints as to their shape. FAR/NEAR, for example, like long, tall, skinny rockets so asparagus, while possible, isn\u0027t the end-all and be-all it is with stock air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I use FAR/NEAR, I therefore tend to make vertically staged rockets. Usually there\u0027s a stage that gets it off the ground and up a good ways, sometimes with the help of SRBs. Then there\u0027s another stage to finish reaching altitude and circularizing. Then there\u0027s a transfer stage which may or may not be big enough for a round trip. Then there\u0027s the payload with whatever engines it needs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-28T22:11:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI generally use my sub-assembly launch stages, which consist of a core rocket with a single set of liquid boosters and additional SRBs if needed. The next stage is the transfer stage which I use to circularize my Kerbin orbit (I design my launchers to have just short of the needed Delta V for orbit). Next would be the payload of a lander, rover, or probe. I also sometimes put the 1.25 or 2.5 meter probe cores on the launch stage if I plan to use it to circularize, in which case it has a little more Delta V so it can get into orbit and retroburn to have a Perikee of ~35 Km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, if I launch unusually large payloads I may use MOAR BOOSTERS!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
