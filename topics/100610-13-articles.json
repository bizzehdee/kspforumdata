What is the part to time scale up like? for example 1000 parts takes 10 times longer than 100 parts?\n\u003E \n\nThere really isn\u0027t a scale up time based on part count. It depends mainly on the whole scene complexity: What\u0027s shiny, what glows, what has volume distortion, what has bump maps, all sorts of background things. It also is *highly* variable when you change the render quality. A 100x100 pixel render with 10 samples per pixel takes a lot less time than a 1080x1920 one with 300 samples per pixel, as I normally render these. But two renders with the same quality settings of a craft with five parts and Zeke\u0027s old 1000\u002B part shuttle really don\u0027t have different render times.

It\u0027s a lot like having writers\u0027 block, except for rendering. On top of that I had fallen off of KSP again, in favor of a bunch of other games, but as usual I\u0027ve found my way back.
