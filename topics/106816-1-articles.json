Under 1x physics warp it flies straight with no control input, slowly dipping into a dive. The prograde marker tracks vertically down the navball.\n\nIf I turn on 2x, 3x or 4x physics warp, the plane starts to yaw and roll to the right. It\u0027s always to the right, even if I initially set up the plane with some slight roll to the left. \n\nThe effect is more pronounced the higher the physics warp.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T08:43:21Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 08:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran**"},{"CreatedByName":"oscardssmith","CreatedById":142840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T06:02:07Z","Content":"I am having the same issues with Linux x64"}]}
