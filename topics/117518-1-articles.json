You still get the full return if you just recover and never transmit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mobile science labs though are special. And the percentage you see in the UI doesn\u0027t mean anything, by the way. That\u0027s a leftover from when the lab had a different function. How exactly it works today is a little complicated, but the abridged version is: based both on the experiment you\u0027re sending to the lab and where the lab is at the time*, a certain amount of \u0022data\u0022 is generated and stored in the lab. Every point of data is worth 5 science points. There must be scientists working in the lab to slowly turn data into science, which you can then transmit home. (Don\u0027t recover your lab, it is not a regular experiment and will not yield any science upon recovery.) So, depending on how much data you get out of the experiment, you may get a very significant amount of bonus science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The highest yield is having a lab landed on the surface of a body and then feeding it experiments from that same body. I.e. crew reports from the Mun fed into a lab landed on the Mun. The only exception is Kerbin, where having the lab on the surface is worthless for obvious reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T12:50:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, you are wrong \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E You underestimate the lab \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore that - if you don\u0027t transmit, you receive the full science at recovery, so if transmit is 45% and recovery after transmit is 55% then recovery without transmit is 100%. Also, experiment transmitted can\u0027t be recovered unless you collect it again - e.g. if you transmit your surface sample, you need to pick another to deliver it to Kerbin. This is not the case with the lab - the experiment after being \u0022processed into data\u0022 is returned with the option of processing into data removed - you can then remove it from the lab and deliver to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for the lab. Recovery of a soil sample for Minmus is worth some 150 science points. The same sample submitted to a lab in Minmus orbit will yield some 180 data points. Each convertible to five science points, for a total of 900. That means you can get some 700% of science - 45% transmit, 55% recovery, 600% laboratory processing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"More Boosters","CreatedById":147303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T13:45:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe lab is ridiculously overpowered and you can easily fill out the tech tree by just going to Minmus with it a few times.
