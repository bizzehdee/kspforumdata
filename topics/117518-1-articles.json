Transmit data (will send part o science)\n\n2. Recover data (will get data left of \u0022Transmitted\u0022 data\n\n3. Use science lab to analyze data in new way and transmit it.\n\nSo totaly i can get about 130% od science (45% Transmit, 55% recover, 30% science lab). Is this work this way or am i wrong?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-03T21:41:32Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2015 09:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cucumbor**"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T11:50:19Z","Content":"I *believe* that if you transmit then recover, the recovery value is reduced by the transmission value, leaving you with no net gain.\n\nScience lab however is definitely a multiplier; drop your results off at it, then recover them, for many lovely sciences."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T12:48:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I *believe* that if you transmit then recover, the recovery value is reduced by the transmission value, leaving you with no net gain.\n\nCorrect, transmitting is just \u0022I cannot wait for recovery (or do not plan to recover this) and I want some science right now!\u0022. You still get the full return if you just recover and never transmit.\n\nThe mobile science labs though are special. And the percentage you see in the UI doesn\u0027t mean anything, by the way. That\u0027s a leftover from when the lab had a different function. How exactly it works today is a little complicated, but the abridged version is: based both on the experiment you\u0027re sending to the lab and where the lab is at the time\\*, a certain amount of \u0022data\u0022 is generated and stored in the lab. Every point of data is worth 5 science points. There must be scientists working in the lab to slowly turn data into science, which you can then transmit home. (Don\u0027t recover your lab, it is not a regular experiment and will not yield any science upon recovery.) So, depending on how much data you get out of the experiment, you may get a very significant amount of bonus science.\n\n\\* The highest yield is having a lab landed on the surface of a body and then feeding it experiments from that same body. I.e. crew reports from the Mun fed into a lab landed on the Mun. The only exception is Kerbin, where having the lab on the surface is worthless for obvious reasons."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T12:50:56Z","Content":"Yes, you are wrong ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) You underestimate the lab ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nBefore that - if you don\u0027t transmit, you receive the full science at recovery, so if transmit is 45% and recovery after transmit is 55% then recovery without transmit is 100%. Also, experiment transmitted can\u0027t be recovered unless you collect it again - e.g. if you transmit your surface sample, you need to pick another to deliver it to Kerbin. This is not the case with the lab - the experiment after being \u0022processed into data\u0022 is returned with the option of processing into data removed - you can then remove it from the lab and deliver to Kerbin.\n\nNow for the lab. Recovery of a soil sample for Minmus is worth some 150 science points. The same sample submitted to a lab in Minmus orbit will yield some 180 data points. Each convertible to five science points, for a total of 900. That means you can get some 700% of science - 45% transmit, 55% recovery, 600% laboratory processing."},{"CreatedByName":"More Boosters","CreatedById":147303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T13:45:47Z","Content":"The lab is ridiculously overpowered and you can easily fill out the tech tree by just going to Minmus with it a few times.

Now you have a reason to be bothered taking all your returning missions to the lab it before landing. Or taking a lab on all missions - you could discard it before coming home ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"plotz","CreatedById":140852,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T14:25:45Z","Content":"That whole lab thing completely flew past me.

Simply you face a situation \u0022I *need* that part NOW!\u0022 and you go on a roundtrip around your labs to collect the overdue science and reload them with new experiments - and they don\u0027t break the game, just provide a resolution to a tight spot.\n\n500 science points take a good couple months of gametime. Just don\u0027t delay stuff \u0022until the lab is done with them\u0022.\n\n...actually, now that I think about it, I believe I\u0027d have already finished my science tree *if not for the lab*. It sits there in Minmus orbit with some 50 experiments on board, about 2/3 of them processed so far, and still a good year or two from finishing the rest, and since I can\u0027t just remove the completed ones and leave the ones that can be processed into science, they still sit there awaiting delivery to Kerbin after being processed into data.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-03T14:35:01Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2015 02:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy**"}]}
