I had a kerbal step out of a capsule and into a chair on a small rocket before launch. He made it the whole flight but it was a short flight without a lot of delta v. On a separate trip I flipped a Mun rover off the ground, my kerbal landed some meters from it alive. I think if there were stronger seat belts he might have snapped his neck. It\u0027s a side effect of believable physics as far as I can tell. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eside note- when I heard about the external chairs the first thing I thought of was motorcycles, the chairs imply risk. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-28T18:56:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHelps if the physics is working.
