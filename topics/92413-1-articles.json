This is an incredibly popular program among the Chinese scientists and will likely win the funding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.Asteroid program-I talked about this a few weeks ago but to recap, probe will fly to near earth asteroid, land and drill\u002Bdo science, they want to do 3 of these missions.

Even now, we can see the space race rekindling. This time though, it\u0027ll be the rookies vs the old timers. Personally, the U.S has a big advantage: hardware designs have already been drafted, all that is left is to test, build, launch, and assemble. What makes it easier for China, though, is that they have access to large amounts of info on the red planet and the moon. They\u0027re roadblock, though, is learning how to build they\u0027re own launch vehicles and spacecraft. The U.S. is basically modifying and modernizing decades old hardware that has been tried and tested many times over. China has no such experience nor preexisting hardware to work off of.\u003Cp\u003Ethe space race between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. was more of an actual race, both contenders starting with little experience\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand primitive hardware. the new race is more of china catching up and riding piggyback on the experience of others: their spacecraft is basically the Soyuz with a Chinese label, they only need to visit Wikipedia to find info on the red planet already gathered by NASA. The U.S. is going to use its own hardware to go to mars. If and or when china goes to mars, it won\u0027t be a Chinese space craft: it will be every other space fairing Nation\u0027s hardware with Chinese labels symbols.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think is interesting about them planning an SRM, no one else has done one yet you act like it is somehow unadvanced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

It\u0027s easier to send a robot. The USSR put probes on the Moon, but couldn\u0027t build a moon rocket to save their lives (it actually ended up taking them). So even if China puts a functioning sample return probe on Mars, it only means they have the necessary knowledge to perform a mars mission. To send living, breathing humans to mars is much, much harder.
