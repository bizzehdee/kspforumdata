The idea here is to keep the Thread on track with the title \u0022Arcade Stuff\u0022 Examples: Tell us a story of an Arcade Game you played years ago or recently or post pictures of your favorite Arcade Games. Now we have the jest of it I\u0027ll start with my little story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt a near by grocery I visited often Arcade Games where brought in and taken out to be replaced by the more popular one as many of us seen. Well Asteroids arrived one day and this one was a blast! I loved this game and it became my favorite. After playing many times with many quarters I was getting really good at this. Here are some tips along the way of how I got to this punch line. My first tactic was destroy one large Asteroid\u00A0at a time without hitting others in the background. Often this would happen anyway but it was a good way to keep the amount of Asteroids to a minimal on the screen and boy did we want to do that!\u00A0Next the annoying Flying Saucer, the large slow moving one wasn\u0027t too bad to shoot but that little one was a real pain. Keeping things honest here I don\u0027t remember if I discovered a way to take that little one out quickly or if I saw someone else do it but hey whatever works right? Because this little dude was worth a lot of points, what I would do is leave one tiny Asteroid on the screen and keep waiting for the Flying Saucers to come out, also while doing this I was flying often at a high rate of speed upwards through the top of the screen and coming in from the bottom so\u00A0when a Flying Saucer would enter the screen I would place a stream of bullets just ahead of him so that he would hit them. After a few points were being made eventually\u00A0the last Asteroid would get hit and oh wow here comes those huge Asteroids filling the screen once again! As I said before I was getting good at this, and now for that punch line. The big plan when playing an Arcade Machine is to see your name at Number One .....Numero\u00A0Uno!! of course. So now I am reaching 999,999 and as an ignorant young child having fun in life, I did not know the Game would start over?? Back to Zero?? Are you telling me after all these hours of playing I will not have my initials on the top??? Number One?? for all the World to see?? Well it was a lot of fun and for those of you that would like to know......the initials you would have saw would have been \u003Cstrong\u003ECAC\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-20T11:38:51Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2017 11:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Castille7\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pxi","CreatedById":78711,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-19T15:41:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m old enough to remember when arcades were actually arcades, and not 90% claw machines and coin pushers.\u00A0 It was rare that I had the cash to spend any significant time in them though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t really have the space for one but I\u0027d love to get hold of a Capcom Z-back cabinet - basically the iconic Street Fighter 2 style cabinet for anyone that doesn\u0027t know - good looking and designed for day-to-day operation, board swapping etc. to be performed from the front.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s nice to see that barcades are now beginning to fill the gap left by traditional arcades, the overwhelming majority of the games are easilly available for play in various forms, but the cabinets themselves are pieces of computing history that needs preserving.\u00A0 People like John Jacobsen (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/user/blkdog7\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.youtube.com/user/blkdog7\u003C/a\u003E) are doing sterling work in that regard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qzgy","CreatedById":160994,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-19T17:17:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m young enough to not have gone to a proper arcade.

The idea here is to keep the Thread on track with the title \u0022Arcade Stuff\u0022 Examples: Tell us a story of an Arcade Game you played years ago or recently or post pictures of your favorite Arcade Games. Now we have the jest of it I\u0027ll start with my little story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt a near by grocery I visited often Arcade Games where brought in and taken out to be replaced by the more popular one as many of us seen. Well Asteroids arrived one day and this one was a blast! I loved this game and it became my favorite. After playing many times with many quarters I was getting really good at this. Here are some tips along the way of how I got to this punch line. My first tactic was destroy one large Asteroid\u00A0at a time without hitting others in the background. Often this would happen anyway but it was a good way to keep the amount of Asteroids to a minimal on the screen and boy did we want to do that!\u00A0Next the annoying Flying Saucer, the large slow moving one wasn\u0027t too bad to shoot but that little one was a real pain. Keeping things honest here I don\u0027t remember if I discovered a way to take that little one out quickly or if I saw someone else do it but hey whatever works right? Because this little dude was worth a lot of points, what I would do is leave one tiny Asteroid on the screen and keep waiting for the Flying Saucers to come out, also while doing this I was flying often at a high rate of speed upwards through the top of the screen and coming in from the bottom so\u00A0when a Flying Saucer would enter the screen I would place a stream of bullets just ahead of him so that he would hit them. After a few points were being made eventually\u00A0the last Asteroid would get hit and oh wow here comes those huge Asteroids filling the screen once again! As I said before I was getting good at this, and now for that punch line. \u003Cu\u003EThe big plan when playing an Arcade Machine is to see your name at Number One .....Numero\u00A0Uno!! of course. So now I am reaching 999,999 and as an ignorant young child having fun in life, I did not know the Game would start over??\u003C/u\u003E Back to Zero?? Are you telling me after all these hours of playing I will not have my initials on the top??? Number One?? for all the World to see?? Well it was a lot of fun and for those of you that would like to know......the initials you would have saw would have been \u003Cstrong\u003ECAC\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat was the problem with older games and the 8-bit programming. That is called integer overflow. The same thing happens on Pac-Man when you hit level 256, where the screen is split in half; left side had the left side of the map, while the right side was just a flurry of numbers and invisible walls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
