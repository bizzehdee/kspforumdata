The Space Shuttle main engines are RS-25D. RS-68s were considered for the SLS as an alternative to the RS-25D. But since NASA already owns quite a few spare RS-25Ds (and they are also more efficient than RS-68s), they decided to use those instead, and make cheaper expendable versions of them once they need more. Engines are one of the most expensive components of a spacecraft so it would make sense to use an existing stock of engines to lower costs at first. It takes a very long time to design, test, and build new engines. (J2-X are the engines to be used on the second stage of the SLS.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason there isn\u0027t much demand to put a lot of mass into LEO at once is that we haven\u0027t made that demand yet.
