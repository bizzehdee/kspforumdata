The rapidly dwindling population of survivors managed to launch numerous monoliths across the system, in hopes of seeding intelligent life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheir plan failed. They made Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis planet would not be visible in the map view, or discoverable through any telescope. To find it would require the player to locate several SSTV signals (these and the monuments were the equivalent of what flags are today for Kerbals - a \u0022look, we were here\u0022) around the system. Each signal would normally contain a complete list of orbital parameters for the home planet, but over millions of years of degradation, only a snippet would remain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the orbital elements of the planet had been found after decoding and analyzing enough signals, its current position could be calculated with reasonable accuracy, and a mission sent out. Once found, the planet would reveal itself as just a bit smaller than Kerbin, covered in frozen cities, abandoned monuments, oceans frozen solid, and an atmosphere long lost to the depths of space. This far out, the sun might even not light up the world too much, leaving it in a perpetual state of twilight. A very, very, very unusual and alien world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the subject of the first SSTV signal - it depicts four precursor critters standing by their monument, their home planet, and the symbol of the planet\u0027s world government, a universal sign of peace and exploration.

In my universe, the Kerbals have only evolved \u0022intelligence\u0022 and civilization in the last 500 years. They live mostly underground, but as they have evolved and are a rather curious species, they have started building and exploring the surface as well as the strange things beyond the surface since their emergence. I kind of envision them as immature children with a lot of energy who achieve through trial and error more than research, simulation and testing. Which, kind of goes along with my play style. I just got my first set of probes on Duna, and I didn\u0027t do any research on how to get there - just built a rocket that looked like it might make it, and tried it out. After a few failures, I was able to get there. Of course, the first two probe \u0022landings\u0022 didn\u0027t go as hoped - with all my fuel spent, including my landing rockets, I only ended up \u0022braking\u0022 enough to land on Duna by holding down the \u0022W\u0022 key for 15-20 minutes to decelerate with RCS jets. That resulted in having no fuel for the landing, only parachutes - which didn\u0027t keep me slow enough and resulted in smashed but functional probes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy earlier Mun missions followed the same process - resulting in Jeb successfully landing on Mun in the first attempt aboard the Khonsu I (I didn\u0027t send any probes prior to this attempt though). I thought it would take a few tries, and that I might just orbit Mun on my first few attempts. But things were going well enough and Jeb pulled off a stellar landing. Unfortunately, I then found out I didn\u0027t have enough fuel to get home. And, at the time, I didn\u0027t have the resources for a rescue mission, so my space program came up with a \u0022replacement\u0022 program in order to bring home a national hero and boost the morale of Kerbal civilization. Thus, rookie uknown Orlie Kerbin flew a ship to Mun, got off, and let Jeb fly it home. Later, Bill Kerbin would attempt a rescue mission of Orlie - but also didn\u0027t have enough fuel to land and take off. So Jeb, being the hero he is, flew a second rescue mission to pick up Orlie while Bill orbited Mun. All three flew home together, in two separate ships. Unfortunately, upon re-entry, Bill\u0027s parachute was ripped from the hull and he died on impact. It was a sad day for Kerbalkind and the Kerbin Administration of Aeronautics and Orbital Science (KAAOS), but at least we learned what the physical limits were for a single small parachute. Jebediah made the first Minmus landing shortly after this tragedy, and erected a flag to mark the occasion - which also contained a tribute to Bill\u0027s sacrifice and enduring inspiration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoon, we will attempt to send the first Kerbal to Duna (and hopefully back).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-06T21:00:24Z\u0022 title=\u002201/06/2014 09:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by sledgeweb\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T23:40:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo canon, HarvesteR said he would not weaponise space.... lol \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E sorry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlackBicycle","CreatedById":29657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T23:46:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile others theorize (and I enjoy those ideas allright)...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AmpsterMan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AmpsterMan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...The reason we all refer to Jebediah so fondly is because he is the first Kerbal that flies your craft...

Jeb, Bob and the rest are just survivors from a transteller seedship that malfunctioned and crash-landed in an uncharted system. Only the growing vats for the cloned frozen embryos, the embryos themselves, the mega 3D printer VAB that can manufacture whatever you can think of from base elements, and a broken teach-bot survived the crash. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe poor new Kerbal hatchlings can\u0027t learn much from their only teacher, so they grow up without proper knowledge of the world around them. All they can understand is that they are lost and they arrived on a rocketship, so they spend their days vainly attempting to rescue themselves by strapping fuel and engines together with them on top. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey just want to get home, really.

The original kerbals lived in a galaxy far, far away. They sent Jeb, Bill, and Bob (as commanders), along with many other thousands of kerbals on a mothership to explore this unique world. Some thing went wrong, and the kerbals all got stranded. Now, using the rocket parts left over from before, they are exploring space on the hopes of finding thier lovely home planet once again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt literally makes complete sense to me. Its the reason there are no civilizations on kerbin besides KSC. It explains why the kerbals are so eager to volunteer to go to space. It explains why they all some-what know how to fly rockets. It explains why alot of the parts are found by the side of the road: Debris. And why they go to space to look at worlds that are not nearly as diverse as kerbin.
