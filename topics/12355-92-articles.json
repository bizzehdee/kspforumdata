Now I\u0027ve installed everything the way it should (the .dll is in the Plugins folder and the MechJeb2_AR202 folder is in the Parts folder). I can see the module in the \u0022Control\u0022 tab when I\u0027m building a ship, so I put that on my ship.

Adding RCS at the end of the central core hasn\u0027t seemed to help.
