I started a new career as I always do when a new patch is out. The upgradeable buildings really contributes in making a game out of KSP. I really enjoyed making difficult decisions on mission parameters to stay within restrictions. Until reaching tier 2. Tier 1 is really about scraping by, once you reach T2 you got everything you need and more and the pressure and excitement is gone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP has always had a bit of a problem with the end game for me, but I see no reason for the building upgrading to become irrelevant so quickly. I basically think there should more building upgrades, like 15 instead of 3 tiers for launch pad and assembly buildings, so that you get more granularity than really tight/more than enough/literally more than any computer can handle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn example: I was building a rocket in the T1 assembly building, and my part count went up to 32.
