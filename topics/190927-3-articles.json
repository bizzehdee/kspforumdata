The way the top of the model was done previously was a nearly flat conical shape to adapt down to the size of the bell, leaving some cool stuff exposed to look at. How the revamp handled this was horrible. It covered up practically everything, or tucked it all inside, and that\u0027s where your most giant mistake is. Either add a uncovered variant, or slim down the blocks of plastic to let some internals peek out like it used to on the Mainsail.
