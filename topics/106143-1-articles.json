I don\u0027t mind not having some of them but I\u0027m kinda pissed about not being able to use the Sepratron, Twitch, Atomic Rocket Motor and the Rockomax Jumbo-64. Not a bug, I know, but if you want to add new parts AND new categories, you should only put the new parts in those new categories... not move existing parts there. Just my 2 cents.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I tried using the fairings unsuccessfully, probably because I might have been using them wrong. The issue is that when I tried to get rid of the fairing as I would any other part, I was unable to. I was also unable to select any other part (or click on any other button for that matter). The only way to get KSP working again was to \u0022force-quit\u0022 the game and then restart it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I created a space station, took it to orbit and separated it from the rest of my ship. When I switched to it in order to bring it back to Kerbin, I was unable to fire the rockets, retract the solar panels, etc.. I tried this with it both manned (with a pilot inside the mobile processing lab) and unmanned (using OKTO). Manned, it did not work and it\u0027s possible that the pilot needed to be in some other position. As an unmanned station, I used a weird setup that has worked in the past: I placed a docking port on the side of the Hitchhiker storage container and placed the OKTO on it. When I launched my rocket, the OKTO was not even there anymore. I know for a fact that it was properly attached beforehand but it was still not there after reverting the flight and also after reloading the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Up to this point, I had built a rocket that would take one space station into orbit around Kerbin and then separate it so that it stayed in orbit. The remainder of the rocket would take another space station to Minmus. This was to complete 2 contracts. I found out that I could build 1 space station that satisfied both requirements, take it into orbit around Kerbin to fulfill one contract, and then fly it to Minmus to fulfill the other contract. Because of this, I modified the rocket and all was well until my return trip: as I prepared to re-enter the atmosphere, I tried to retract the solar panels and they wouldn\u0027t retract. In fact, after right-clicking them, the buttons wouldn\u0027t even show up. For humor\u0027s sake, I learned all about the purpose of the new heat shields really quickly after that because even though I decided to just sacrifice my solar panels (what choice did I have, after all?), I figured I would at least be able to land. Well... let\u0027s just say the engines don\u0027t like the heat that was produced on re-entry and if not for reverting the flight (again), Jebediah Kerman would no longer be with us. LOL\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Last but not least, I tried again but this time I decided to separate everything in the end, leaving Jebediah Kerman to safely use the heat shield built into the bottom of the Mk1 Command Pod. During the flight, I made a mistake and increased the warp speed too high. My rocket became uncontrollable. In an attempt to revert the flight (yet again), I hit the wrong button and it sent me back to the space station. After rushing over to the tracking station and then back to control my ship, I tried to revert the flight but it was grayed out. In order to not waste my nearly $79,000.00, I force-quit KSP and started it back up (sort of cheating, I know). I took the rocket to the pad and tried to launch it but when I tried to turn SAS on, it said there are no SAS modules and no pilots aboard but Jebediah was right there in the command pod, ready to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I\u0027m just wondering if anyone else is experiencing the same and/or if I need to uninstall and reinstall.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
