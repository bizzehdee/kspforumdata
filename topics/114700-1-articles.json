July is upon us, and with it some fond memories for this lady. For any of you interested in such things, I have a video tribute to the Apollo 11 mission in the can and ready for release on 20 July. Last year\u0027s tribute was reasonably well received in the \u0022Mercury, Gemini, Apollo\u0022 Facebook group, and I am hoping that this year\u0027s offering does at least as well.\n\nHere is last year\u0027s production:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/NZIUAnVVuMo?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nPer aspera ad astra!"},{"CreatedByName":"SemiaCloud","CreatedById":138816,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T01:06:55Z","Content":"Nice to see a tribute.

I was 9 years old and I still remember seeing it on TV... a few hours delayed because this was before satellites were able to send news items to us here in New Zealand. Australia was able to get it live, so what our air force did was have its Skyhawks rush over, grab the latest can of film, and rush back with it... to show on our TV\u0027s... amazing thing was that it really did bring the world closer together."},{"CreatedByName":"Dartguy","CreatedById":98197,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T12:35:15Z","Content":"I have a friend who was born on the day of the landing, her parents named her Moon."}]}
