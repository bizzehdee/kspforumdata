I was 9 years old and I still remember seeing it on TV... a few hours delayed because this was before satellites were able to send news items to us here in New Zealand. Australia was able to get it live, so what our air force did was have its Skyhawks rush over, grab the latest can of film, and rush back with it... to show on our TV\u0027s... amazing thing was that it really did bring the world closer together.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dartguy","CreatedById":98197,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T12:35:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a friend who was born on the day of the landing, her parents named her Moon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
