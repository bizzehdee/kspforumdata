It has been said in the past that KSP2 on full release will be based around resources, not money, and that got me thinking that maybe it\u0027d be cool to have them not only be a way to manufacture and replenish your crafts, but also making them unlock new tiers in the tech tree. Idk how resources will be implemented when they do (whether it be a single \u0022resource\u0022 meter that drains, or many different minerals and compounds that each have their own gauges), but the way I think of this, it balances out acquiring busted tech by forcing you to acquire a certain something that is somewhere in particular, making it more like a \u0022mission to be able to progress\u0022 rather than a shopping list. A more clear example would be, for instance, that in order to get something like the terrier engine, which usually is a big part of interplanetary travel for small vessels, you need to get a certain ammount of mun rocks and science points, or some mineral from mun\u0027s surface, meaning if you want to progress considerably, you need to achieve a mun landing first. (Idk i\u0027m no game designer so the balance is up to intercept, not me, but you get the idea)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn ksp1 you could literally just have one of the big labs in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and refill it with whatever science you got pretty much anywhere in kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and with enough time that\u0027d be enough for most of the tech tree, so with something like this it could help combat that and allow for more \u0022coherent\u0022 technology, but that\u0027s just me though, what does everyone else think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-12-01T08:46:04Z\u0022 title=\u002212/01/2023 08:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Dec 1\u0022\u003EDecember 1, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by MakaRonnie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
