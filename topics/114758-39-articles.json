This is one of these mods I think is a \u0022must\u0022 in the game. The only thing I miss is the possibility to have a workshop module to create parts needed for the base survival. I mean, when I arrived EVE and mount the base, I opened all my solar panels to charge batteries and all of them were immediately destroyed by wind forces. So the base stayed with no energy production and three frightened kerbals. Then I tryed to add compatibility with \u0022OSE Workshop\u0022 mod and it worked fine, but I think a big Workshop module to create big things would be great! \n\u003E \n\u003E The compatibility was as simple as add a cfg file to the Config folder with the definitions (for the science part).\n\u003E \n\u003E @PART[KKAOSS\\_Science\\_g]:FOR[Workshop]:NEEDS[Workshop]:HAS[!MODULE[OseModuleWorkshop]]\n\u003E \n\u003E ....\n\u003E \n\u003E If you need more information pm me. \n\u003E \n\u003E Regards.\n\u003E \n\u003E OSE Workshop: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108234-0-90-OSE-Workshop-KAS-KIS-Addon](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108234-0-90-OSE-Workshop-KAS-KIS-Addon)\n\nThanks!

Can I have both of them installed at the same time or do they mess each other up?\n\nThey are not really incompatible. The list of supported mods in the OP only lists the mods this one actively interacts with.\n\nSo in the case of USI Kolonization the parts just don\u0027t interact with each other. There are some differences for the resource gathering and recycling when using a life-support mod. It\u0027s a bit easier in KPBS. I have not yet heard that it will cause problems when both are used in parallel.\n\nFor interaction with each other [PocketBrotector](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/139300-PocketBrotector) also made a nice compatibility-patch: [UKS-KPBS Compatibility](https://github.com/LouisB3/UKS-KPBS_Compatibility) ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E .....
