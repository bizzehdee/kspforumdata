Also attached are two antennae, assuming they can send signals as well. All parts will be slightly engineered to improve performance by a small amount (so that I will not require a 200 ton launcher).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I send that design, I\u0027ll send a pioneering probe to test the solar irradiance at Jool, and if it is sufficient, the Kaku II design will go ahead. The pioneering probe will mass about 400kg, and the combined Kaku II probe will mass at least 6000kg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will be using parts from the KW Rocketry pack as well as stock parts, and the engineered parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the Kaku I, it was a probe that was much smaller and much less capable, it missed the aerocapture, having lost contact 1,230,000km from Jool. Systems went online, to find the periapsis out at Pol. The capture was costly, leaving 200m/s in the tank, the craft executed a flyby of Pol, and is doing remote Joolian research. It was thought that an error in the autopilot\u0027s programming caused the incident.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, this probe is named after Michio Kaku.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI give up.

It was supposed to be a mapping mission so I sent out a probe with like 4 or 5 of the larger KSPX Xenon tanks and then like 8 of the smaller 500-unit KSPX Xenon tanks, had something in the neighborhood of like 16Km/s of Delta-V... The probe itself was absolutely loaded with sciency stuff and mapping equipment and all kinds of bells and whistles, so had the mission gone better, I\u0027d have all of the Jool system charted out.. Yeah but about that solar power far out at Jool....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany problems occurred..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used the KSPX larger ion engine which takes more electricity... So...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t have enough solar power to be able to run my ion engines at full throttle no matter where I was, it would ALWAYS drain from the battery by some amount. (PUT A LOT OF SOLAR PANELS ON THERE. You are further out and it will have less sunlight to get to the probe.. So...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had to run my ion engine at no more than 20% throttle at any given point, or the battery would begin to drain. I could run it in full-throttle bursts, but most of the burn had to be done at 20% throttle... So....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe burn times for even a small burn took about 4 in-game hours, no lie. About an hour or so on X4 physwarp. So....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously I\u0027m not gonna be making any quick corrections if something goes awry, of course in Kerbal spirit, that\u0027s exactly what happened. I found out I was going the wrong way in orbit around Jool AFTER I had already slowed down from my injection burn and obtained some form of a stable orbit. Reversing the direction would have taken pretty much all of my delta-V and a huge burn time, so I decided to try and roll with it, maybe slingshot around one of the planets and fix my direction... So....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I come up on Pol, the first target, I\u0027m going much faster than I ever thought I could. My encounter time was about 15 minutes as opposed to the normal 1-3 hours or so. A single ion engine at 20% or less throttle with a heavy, fuel and battery loaded probe armed to the teeth with science stuff being able to slow down from twice of Joolian orbital velocity down to Pol orbital velocity in 15 minutes? Not gonna happen. I flew right on by.. So....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI kept going, passed up Bop and had some fun, took some pictures to send back home via a tacky postcard saying \u0022Wish you were here....No really, someone needs to come here and help me reverse my orbital direction, your insertion burn sucked!\u0022 So....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went to my current favorite planet that I\u0027ve only touched once, Vall. So I\u0027ve got my beautiful encounter lined up and then I get this: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qbaaIaR.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022qbaaIaR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh..

Like, whatever you think is going to be enough, solar panels, you probably need like twice as many.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Murchadh","CreatedById":57567,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T08:26:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was building a sat/probe/launcher for Duna and then noticed that Jool is coming up slightly before Duna and had the \u0022bright\u0022 idea to double the mission to both. The sat/probe has ~10k dV (ion) attached to a nuclear inserter (~6k dV). I actually redesigned the inserter to give it more oomph specifically for Jool but now you guys are giving me second thoughts. I totally like the idea of multiple cores for Jool and already have a design in my head for how I can further adapt the inserter to have a bunch of probe/sats peel off from side mounts. My probe/sat design weighs ~0.9t currently and I thought I seemed fine but maybe I should add moar solar panels (serves me right for testing the thing around Kerbin and not further away from the sun *facepalm*) ... but that would propabbly mean redesigning the probe/sat completely to be able to fit extra panels ... or I could just like go with a bunch of totally \u0022expendable\u0022 probes. Like a MIRV, only less dangerous (or more... depending on which Kerbal you talk to). I think I can fit 12 onto my inserter, shoot them off into multiple trajectories once I get to Jool and go for the fire, forget, hope and pray approach... I mean since I have never been to Jool, might as well see what happens and let it be a surprise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway thanks for the ideas and tips.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS\u0026gt; I totally love Kaku.
