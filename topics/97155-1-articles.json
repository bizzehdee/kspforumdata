I have no prior experience with Blender... or photoshop... or Unity. I\u0027ve read through a couple of tutorials, however, and figured I\u0027d give this a go. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, the Aries-1B is the shuttle spacecraft that was used in 2001 to move people and probably supplies between the Earth and the Moon. It\u0027s simply a round hull with engines on the bottom and a ring of windows above the middle, so I thought its shape lent itself well as a learning project for me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Re64F4P.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Re64F4P.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I have so far is a model I\u0027ve created in Blender that\u0027s basically situated around a sphere.

Next, I plan to add details to the windows before moving onto the RCS thruster mounts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will try to keep up on this project and see it through to completion insofar as irl concerns allow. I work on this on my mac between classes or after I get out of lab, so the workflow should be rather constant, however there is still a great deal I need to learn about texturing and Unity before I move onto those phases of the project, so there may be delays between my updates while I figure that kind of stuff out.
