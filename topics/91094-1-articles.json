I have some questions regarding the end of the movie, both related to the black hole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) At the end of the movie Cooper falls in the black hole and has his epiphany. However, how could one subjectively actually fall in a black hole? From a reference point far from the black hole, one of course can see things falling into a black hole, but how is this possible from the reference point of the falling object itself? As I understand relativity and orbital mechanics, one likely approaches light speed when very near the event horizon, which means time dilation basically becomes infinite, and the object will never actually experience passing the event horizon. Or is this some kind of paradox here? The only way I can figure out Cooper being aware of himself falling would be if he would have killed most of his velocity (good luck with that with relativistic speeds), and falling sort of straight into the black hole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Just before Cooper enters the black hole, the Endurance is slingshotting past the black hole, upon which Amelia remarks \u0022This little trick costs us 51 years\u0022. Wouldn\u0027t this have to mean they would be orbiting Gargantua for 51 years as seen from a reference point far from the black hole? That no longer seems like a slingshot - unless Gargantua is truly insanely huge - but rather like a stable orbit around it. Wouldn\u0027t a real gravitational slingshot just last several seconds from a time-dilated reference frame?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moss","CreatedById":106413,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-23T22:03:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) It\u0027s a movie.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Both.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"andrewas","CreatedById":24662,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-23T22:21:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) You have it backwards.

Time dilation slows down the subjective clock of Cooper/Endurance, not the clock of a far-away observer. If they\u0027re close to the black hole, musn\u0027t they actually go extremely fast (whole fractions of c)? The closer you get to a black hole, the greater your speed, the slower your clock goes, isn\u0027t that true? So how can you then pass the horizon? I get that your acceleration as measured by a far observer must be extremely tiny - and decreasing - since you would be asymptotically approaching c. Would that means that the acceleration is so tiny it would take them a burn of (as seen by a far observer) 51 years? But would said observer not see them orbiting Gargantua for the same amount of time?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is something here I don\u0027t quite understand. Wikipedia seems to tell me you can\u0027t see an object passing the horizon, because you can\u0027t actually see that event happening (hence the name event horizon). In stead, the object would red-shift forever (which, eventually means that for all practical purposes you\u0027re going to loose sight of the object, since your instruments won\u0027t be able to detect nearly infinitely red-shifted light).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sndrtj","CreatedById":110589,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-23T23:57:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s already late, but I guess I might have found my problem: I think I forgot that because Cooper\u0027s clock seems to go slower from the \u003Cem\u003Efar-away observer\u0027s\u003C/em\u003E point of view, the amount of (visible) work on Cooper/Endurance can also only be (very) small per time unit for the far-away observer\u0027s point of view. As he goes faster and faster, the amount of observed work dwindles to nothing, which means the observer sees Cooper approaching but never quite reaching the black hole. But for himself, even if takes a billion years from the observer\u0027s point of view, he will eventually cross it in a relatively short finite time from \u003Cem\u003Ehis\u003C/em\u003E point of view.
