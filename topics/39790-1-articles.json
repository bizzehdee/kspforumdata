Only one set of 4 is needed for center of gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a long rocket, they can be on the probe or last stage. The rocket will easily pivot at its base. It can also translate forward and reverse but will not translate in the diagonals. You can use a probe stage thrusters to control everything without using it\u0027s fuel tank by disabling it so fuel is used from a tank mounted on an upper stage. I have found that the new SAS has sufficient torque that I no longer need to use thrusters for orientation on my interplanetary craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-29T03:37:46Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2013 03:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SRV Ron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wesreidau","CreatedById":75430,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T05:51:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlways place RCS oriented according to your command module. If your command module faces north, put a port north, south, east, and west. Mounting RCS ports at angles results in wasted propellant because some fraction is being diverted in a direction that another force has to counteract. When possible, consider mounting RCS ports on the ends of long beams of the lightweight girders. This puts the force further away from the center of mass, and so you get better leverage (or so I\u0027ve convinced myself).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheLastMonkeylander","CreatedById":76545,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T06:29:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of RCS layout, can RCS thrusters damage your rocket like regular engines can?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wesreidau","CreatedById":75430,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T06:32:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENope.
