So we can put something stationary in the air? (Like a weather balloon or a floating base)\n\u003E \n\nSort of. Currently you can achieve this by making sure the mass of your vessel is in-between the two payload ratings. Right click the balloon in the editor part list, the mass needs to be less than the recommended payload but more than the number in brackets. As lift decreases with air pressure (so altitude) the balloon can carry more at sea level than higher up. By having a mass in between the two, it will rise then start to fall when the balloon doesn\u0027t have enough lift then rise again when it gets low enough to have enough lift. This will just keep repeating. The balloon needs to be the active vessel or in physics range for this though.\n\nTethered balloons are planned in a future update which may suit your needs better. In the mean time you can achieve the same thing with the KAS winches.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-01T12:49:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2016 12:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by JoePatrick1**"},{"CreatedByName":"Noob21","CreatedById":160756,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-01T19:47:02Z","Content":"This is a pretty cool mod.
