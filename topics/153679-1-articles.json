It\u0027s pretty confusing for me to explain so I just made a graphic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/lY6fK\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/lY6fK\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem I\u0027m having is landing it. If I keep it angle at \u0022Normal\u0022 It does pretty good, I only have to make small adjustments to tilt. But, as soon as I get below Lunar orbit, \u0022Normal\u0022 changes to a different position entirely, and my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E system turns my rocket at an angle that I can\u0027t land at. I would turn off \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E entirely, but then my base would just start flipping out uncontrollably. I would appreciate it if anybody had any advice on how to make a controlled sideways landing. (I have Mech-Jeb tier two, if necessary.)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-18T18:04:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen your navball switches into surface mode, the Normal/Antinormal and Radial-In/Radial-Out markers disappear. The entire frame of reference is reoriented towards the ground. You can anticipate this, and manually switch back to orbit mode, but that may make landing difficult because speed is counted a different way. Instead, try some of the other orientation options. I assume prograde/retrograde won\u0027t help you, since your command module is inline, but try one of the radial directions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aegolius13","CreatedById":165625,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-18T18:32:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt might work to put a docking port or something on the center, facing upward. \u00A0Then you can use \u0022control from here\u0022 and land it like a regular lander.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
