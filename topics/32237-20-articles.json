Currently, I have a crude IVA for the Kirs Docking Module, and placeholders for everything else. Until all this is done, I see no reason to rush to update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - I\u0027ve tried just about everything to fix the IACBM wobbling issue. The best result I\u0027ve seen was from redoing the docking colliders so that the hatch-mode toggle is no longer necessary for EVA, and the removal of animated colliders supposedly means more rigid docking. Unfortunately, I keep receiving conflicting reports as to the efficacy for this fix, and quite frankly I\u0027ve run out of options. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Rumor has it that 0.23 introduced multiple airlocks per crew compartment, specifically in the crewed Science Lab. I am investigating how to do this for FusTek, as this has been a common request.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Due to this \u003Ca href=\u0022http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/1313\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ebug\u003C/a\u003E, the FusTek parts currently have an offset part origin, and by extension, an offset CoM to counter the former. I am also still investigating whether the bug has been fixed as of 0.23.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - In the dev build, I changed the scaling factor from 1.25 to 1.0 to make it easier for me to work on models. The parts will still be the same sizes in game as before, but this means redefining the attachment nodes in a craft-breaking manner. Also, the aforementioned airlock / origin-distance bug may creep back in as a result of this change, so I need to investigate further.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - My original intention with the dev build was to optimize the models and textures, using MODEL{} node calls and common image atlases. This has worked reasonably well, but nothke\u0027s persistent requests to allow his non-repeating texture variants means that I have to redo all the UV maps and atlases from scratch, determining which elements to repeat and which elements not to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPlease remove the intentional jacking-up of this build so I could use it.
