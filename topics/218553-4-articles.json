If it requires metal, methalox to build/fuel rockets, then you could reach a fail state where you run out of those. Or, maybe there\u2019s automatic resource collection on kerbin, but then the player would just be timewarping until their reserves are full. Either way, it\u2019s either not a very rewarding gameplay loop or an outright fail state which I would be okay with, but many others, including the devs, are not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis issue of whether or not the player can build unlimited rockets is a fundamental one. It is especially important when it comes to automation, because with no restrictions imposed the player could automate 1000 supply launches a day from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. It\u2019s also an issue that the playerbase doesn\u2019t really know how to solve, I think, as you still see some people saying that rocket parts and fuel should be unlimited on Kerbin. So I\u2019m interested in brainstorming, for sure. Maybe it warrants its own thread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell you wouldn\u0027t be able to send out 1000 launches a day because the resource re-charge rate wouldn\u0027t allow it. You also wouldn\u0027t hit a fail state because even if you deplete your stock you can just time-warp ahead a few days and try again. I think this is good for a game thats encouraging players to go out and take risks and fail occasionally, or (heaven forbid) crash on the Mun and need a rescue mission. In my mind you\u0027d start out with storage full and enough basic materials to run your first 5-8 missions or so, enough to get you reliably to orbit and build your first Munar/Minmar missions. The starting recharge rate could be scaled to generate enough fuel and metals to build an averagish Mun mission every 3 days or so. Thats pretty fast and wouldn\u0027t bog players down in constantly time-warping just to fill up the tanks, but its also tight enough that you wouldn\u0027t want to gobble up all of your raw materials in supply runs. Keep in mind also that supply runs have to deliver to a station or colony and that destination needs to have enough tank storage to accept it. If their tanks are full then a supply run is a waste. Now, you could ship metals with your supply run to build more tanks but at a certain point you\u0027re going to have enough to do what you need to do and just heaping it up is a waste of time. This would be the same as delivering fuel and metals that you mined off-world but because of the inherent efficiencies of shallow, airless gravity wells you\u0027ll be able to produce what you need that way faster and easier than from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think many players are used to games with tightly limited resources and their built-in anxiety is going to drive them to make the mistake of piling up way more fuel in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E than they really need at first.

And why wouldn\u2019t you gobble materials in supply runs? Without life support, there is no urgency to rescue missions, etc., and mission timing is usually irrelevant. Therefore, you can just timewarp enough to resupply whatever you\u2019re resupplying, and take a short break from constant supply runs to launch another mission. This strategy will work until you have either large colonies that aren\u2019t self-sufficient and need supplies from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, or until you have several colonies in several places.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemember: the goal of the simple (not exotic) supply system is to constrain the number of launches you can conduct at any one time.

I don\u0027t think largely linear, rote, grind-for-reward gameplay is good, though yes many, many current games rely on gnawing at players\u0027 reward/dopamine response exactly in this way. Thats what\u0027s so important about game balance and allowing room for creative solutions. Stardew Valley is in some ways just a cutesy-bootsie farming game, but the specific balance between different crops is incredibly well tuned to ensure that its not the \u0022MAKE BLUEBERRIES\u0022 game. In my mind good games aren\u0027t about grinding through bottlenecks. It\u0027s about creating a dynamic set of strategic forks and potential synergies. Strategic forks are moments in gameplay where players have a choice: \u003Cem\u003E\u0022I can pursue this path and get X or I could pursue another path and get Y.\u0022\u00A0\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EHold this in your mind as distinct from \u003Cem\u003E\u0022I can pursue this path and get X or I can pursue another path and get 10X\u0022\u003C/em\u003E.

This can be worked around by using solar panels in locations with enough sunlight, or likely with automated deliveries of fresh nuclear fuel for reactors.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf resource deposits are infinite, balancing the game\u0027s progression by tweaking extraction speed kind of breaks down. Once a resource has been found and extraction and delivery set up, the player can simply timewarp an arbitrary amount to fill the need of any construction project rather than consider seeking out a more concentrated source of it and/or scaling up their operation. This is how it is in KSP1 with ore mining and refining into fuel. The player may still consider scaling up their resource extraction if they feel the convenience of less timewarp is worth it, but it will be difficult to integrate \u0022scale up the extraction of this resource\u0022 as a challenge into the game progression.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome ways to break binary resource availability:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMaking resource deposits finite - That may encourage players to be more careful with their resource use, but it\u0027s difficult to balance because what\u0027s effectively infinite for one person\u0027s ambitions may not be enough for another\u0027s. In order to accommodate most players, the designers could exponentially scale resource deposit size based on a \u0022difficulty rating\u0022 of a world, similar to how resource deposits scale exponentially with distance from the starting point on Factorio maps.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAdd a running cost (including construction resources like metals) to colonies. Expanding one\u0027s infrastructure will necessitate scaling up operations and looking for new and more concentrated sources of a resource.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAdd mechanics that discourage gratuitous timewarp later in the game. This is at odds with the game\u0027s goal of interstellar travel though, which takes far longer than resource extraction and delivery happening inside a solar system.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I\u0027d like to see an experience like this: You\u0027ve found a small deposit of resource X, you can now use it in small amounts for new parts you couldn\u0027t build before. But after a bit of research, you discover another use (more new parts, colony buildings) for resource X, but now you need an order of magnitude more of it. Your existing deposit just won\u0027t do, but luckily your probe orbiting Eeloo has found a huge, concentrated source of X.

But let\u0027s take a step back and ask a more fundamental question. Why have limited resources or money at all? What is the desired effect on the way players build and fly?

I think teaching players to \u0027play smarter, not harder\u0027 and not just brute force navigation puzzles is a big part of why I was so engrossed by KSP in the first place.

I think teaching this skill is absolutely fundamental to the game and putting a bit of limit on rocket glut is a solid way to reinforce that. I think you\u0027ll probably agree.

I think you\u0027re right there\u0027s a place for both \u0022X or Y\u0022 and \u0022X or 10X\u0022. Let stick with Factorio as an example because it\u0027s awesome and Im currently obsessed with it. Factorio is obviously about production scale, but in a sneaky way it\u0027s also got a lot of \u0022X or Y\u0022. When I laid out my KSP2 tech path options (H2 vs Nuclear for example) I wasn\u0027t suggesting a player would pick H2 and skip nuclear entirely, just that they might pursue one or the other \u003Cem\u003Efirst\u003C/em\u003E. Factorio is full of these kinds of decisions, choosing when to go in on trains, when to wall-off, when to start nuclear or solar or in which order, how fast to push toward roboports, etc. You usually get to everything eventually, but there\u0027s a lot of freedom to choose what specific order you want to unlock things and what to devote resources to. So I was probably wrong to frame my post as \u0022X or Y\u0022 is better than \u0022X or 10X\u0022. They\u0027re more yin and yang. What I meant was that I hope KSP2 doesn\u0027t have a rote, linear build order that almost everyone follows. Im looking for a bit of freedom and adaptation in the order folks unlock and pursue different fuels and technologies, the same way I scratch my chin a bit almost every time I pick a tech unlock in Factorio.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOther posters have also made made interesting observations and I think folks are right that resources and time-warp is a hard nut to crack but I want to turn a bit to the AMA today.

So they\u0027d like to even this out and make the experience more balanced and intuitive. They\u0027re also looking more closely at tuning and balancing experiments, how much science do they generate, do they need to be in a specific place, do they need specific resources, do they need specific time? - The mention of resources is curious here because \u0022resources\u0022 aren\u0027t slated till much later in the roadmap. Im guessing he means resources like electricity?

Lots of cool possibilities.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESpecific to rockets being free (quoted, cleaned up for \u0027ums and ahs\u0027)\u003C/strong\u003E - \u0022We\u0027re effectively designing our progression such that that\u0027s not an issue. I should clarify that as we\u0027re going through our milestones the science milestone is going to be more similar to the science mode from KSP1. You didn\u0027t really have cash in that mode in KSP1 so we\u0027re working within the same constraints of that. In the far future when we have resources and things we\u0027re often taking the approach that we want players to feel like they\u0027re able to do a lot of stuff from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and from colonies. So I\u0027m not going to say that launching rockets will be free, there\u0027s always going to be a cost that\u0027s associated with a rocket, but the amount of various resources that you might have access to at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, at various places,\u00A0 that will control what you can launch when.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFollow-up to similar question:\u003C/strong\u003E \u0022This is a fairly far-future question in the sense that in the science update we\u0027re looking at the same scope as the KSP1 science mode generally, and in that sense we\u0027re not going to have limits on resources on Kerbin, but going forward again our goal is to push the player to explore outward rather than to explore inward. My kind of personal opinion on the role of money and scarcity is that we want to be sure to empower players to try new things in a safe environment. Kerbin is a safe environment.
