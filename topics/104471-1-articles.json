It works similarly to the turbojet, except rather than the compressor being driven by an exhaust turbine, it\u0027s driven by a separate piston engine. The hot gas from the combustion chamber goes directly to the nozzle- with increased energy due to not driving a turbine on the way. It\u0027s basically something between a boosted ramjet and an afterburning ducted fan- depending on how the compressor is set up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing that interests me about this design is that you have two operating modes- the \u0027cold\u0027 jet thrust provided by the compressed air, and afterburning mode where the compressed air is heated for increased thrust. You\u0027d have two distinct combustion processes, and so two degrees of freedom to control the thrust produced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, these engines pretty much died off when a functioning turbojet became practical, but I wonder if they\u0027d still be useful today. Particularly, part-load efficiency of a piston engine doesn\u0027t drop off as much as it does with a gas turbine, plus there\u0027s the option to reduce fuelling or switch off the combustion chamber and run on the compressed air thrust only. There\u0027s also the maintenance reduction associated with not having to deal with a gas turbine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI reckon there\u0027s potential here for fairly small, fast aircraft doing short hops between remote areas.

Turbochargers help by using that gas for an additional compression stage, but at that point, why not use a turbine? Turbine engines don\u0027t have to match compression either side of combustion, so while a diesel may compress by 20, it can only expand by maybe 10, while the turbine will do 20 and 20.

You need pressure in the gas flow to expand it for more velocity - the core flow has less oxygen to burn, but it has lots of pressure available, so it\u0027s the far more effective, and actually more efficient one to add fuel to. I believe often when set to afterburning mode they may also reduce fuel into the main combustion chamber so that more oxygen is available for the afterburner - the afterburner is considerably less efficient than the core, but it\u0027s more powerful, which is what you want if you turned it on anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mrfox","CreatedById":69277,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T15:20:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Iskierka\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Iskierka\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMaybe compared to small gas turbines, but all piston engines are hugely inefficient compared to any gas turbine that can get its compression high. Pistons are drastically limited in how much power can be extracted as they have to use the same stroke for expansion and compression, despite hugely different pressures on either side, so they leave much gas unexpanded and wasted.

In the 400-1000 hp range that you\u0027ll see for small private/business planes, they\u0027re already happily competitive with pistons in efficiency, but are lighter and have a much longer maintenance cycle. They do, however, cost much more to begin with, due to turbine\u0027s requirements of much better materials and tolerances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd while that is a trick that is used, yes, it only reduces the problem, doesn\u0027t remove it. If you match expansion to compression by limiting the intake valve, then you do improve energy extracted, but the engine is now fighting vacuum pressure against itself, wasting power on the intake cycle. You can balance this to get close to the theoretical maximum of the thermodynamic processes\u0027 performance, but not nearly close enough to beat larger turbine engines. Micro turbines, sure, but that\u0027s because turbines are very hard to miniaturise. And to be back on the original subject, motorjets won\u0027t particularly be able to bypass this flaw, as the limiting factors will still exist, only you now have to fit a piston engine around it too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thought might be that you could use something similar to a motorjet to alleviate the biggest disadvantage of turbine engines, which is throttle time. You could reverse the electric generator that most turbines already have fitted somewhere to give a boost up to max rpm, with a sufficient battery to provide that power. The engine would still be a gas turbine in core function, but a relatively easy-to-fit and, importantly, lightweight electric motor would provide boosting. Current F1 turbochargers do the same trick to eliminate turbo lag, so that full power is immediately available out of corners. Then at high speed, rather than have to waste power by opening a waste-gate that limits turbo pressure, the same device extracts electrical power to the exact amount that no pressure is lost, and the energy is stored for the electric motors in their hybrid engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
