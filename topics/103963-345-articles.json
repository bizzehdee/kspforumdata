I stumbled upon someone else having [a similar problem over in the technical support section](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/193431-crashing-after-a-couple-of-scene-changes/). In both cases there are quite a couple of mods and it\u0027s always scatterer crashing after a non-set number of scene changes.\n\nLots of mods lead to lots of the 16 GB of RAM used, but there\u0027s still free RAM available.\n\nI find it really curious, that the crash is always caused by an access violation error when scatterer is being called after some playtime.\n\nDoes the Stack Trace of the Crashed Thread from my error log above help any?"},{"CreatedByName":"blackrack","CreatedById":104258,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-28T06:37:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 9 hours ago, FasterThanFlourite said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Does the Stack Trace of the Crashed Thread from my error log above help any?\n\u003E \n\nIt doesn\u0027t, because it crashes on a core unity method.
