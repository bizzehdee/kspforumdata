CO2 is a very stable gas and trying to use it as propulsion would probably net you as much dV as blowing the hatch in a pod. Very very small amounts. In KSP, that amount might seem enough to bring you home or some other thing, but in real life you need far more thrust to do anything big, like changing your orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bellino","CreatedById":67962,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T02:14:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReplying to this-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess i worded the title wrong, as this isnt an engine, but an RCS fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso now i want to find out how much dV blowing a mercury hatch would make \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DaveofDefeat","CreatedById":58539,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T02:36:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI feel like exhaling out into space has the major side effect known as dead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OtherDalfite","CreatedById":8317,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T02:46:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DaveofDefeat\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DaveofDefeat\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI feel like exhaling out into space has the major side effect known as dead.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, holding your breath will also lead to a side effect known as ruptured lungs and still dead!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bellino","CreatedById":67962,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T02:47:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour not exhaling into space... lol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour taking the CO2 into a tank, storing it, and then shooting it out for dV\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T02:57:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is to actually extract the CO2 out of the spacecraft\u0027s atmosphere is no easy job. For short term use like Apollo spacecraft lithium hydroxide is used. Lithium hydroxide absorbs CO2, turns into lithium carbonate and releases water so the process is non-regenerative, but the system itself is pretty simple and compact. For long term solution on board space stations a more elaborate system using molecular sieves is used where dried air is forced through the sieves and the sieves stop the bigger CO2 molecules from getting through while the smaller O2 and N2 are able to fit pass the gaps. When the sieves become saturated with CO2 it\u0027s moved to the outside of the spacecraft and into the sun where CO2 is then allowed to leak away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe regenerative system is complex enough that the two systems on ISS called Vozdukh and CDRA that use this method often break down, sometimes even together! When that happens the crew switch to back up lithium hydroxide system and go about fixing them. Considering that this system is responsible for keeping the crew alive I think it would be a bad idea to make it even more complex just to get a tiny bit of delta-V out of it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-14T03:02:05Z\u0022 title=\u002209/14/2013 03:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Temstar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dharak1","CreatedById":61137,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T04:16:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf there was a way to extract CO2 then this may be viable for long term spacecraft like space stations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
