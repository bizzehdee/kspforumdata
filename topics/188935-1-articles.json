Make sure you have parachutes (when I play a career game, I will add two drogue chutes along with the main chute) and by using the engine at 1/2 throttle, you can slow your rate of decent to seven meters per second or slower. This way, when you do make contact with the ocean\u0027s water, you don\u0027t end up with the engine blown to pieces from impact. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EI hope this helps you.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"drpunk","CreatedById":200335,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-16T15:09:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould probably put wheels on it and drive it into the water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-16T15:55:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223688085\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022188935\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221571237065\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002278762\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bcbarnes\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n51 minutes ago, bcbarnes said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone have any suggestions for a design that might work for this contract?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEverybody knows that splashing into the water is safer than slamming into the ground. Except in KSP, where it isn\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShort explainer: If you land on solid ground, only the parts that actually hit the ground need to survive the impact, then everything else will survive as well. Even if the lowermost part(s) blows up, the explosion may at least slow the fall of everything that\u0027s on top of them. This doesn\u0027t always work, but often provides a kind of crumple zone that protects at least part of your vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhereas if you splash into the water, every part that\u0027s too fast when crossing the waterline will simply vanish. No crash, no explosion, nothing whatsover that would help to slow the impact for the remainder of the vessel. That\u0027s why your command pod, which is pretty tough, is stripped of all or most parts that are more fragile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack to the problem at hand: If you mouse-over the Poodle in the part list, some data comes up. Among other things, it says \u0022Tolerance: 7.0 m/s Impact\u0022. This means that if you come down slower than 7m/s, it will probably survive. \u003Cstrong\u003ETherefore, you somehow need to slow down your vessel so it splashes down at 7m/s or less.\u003C/strong\u003E MOAR parachutes might already be enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"machine1760","CreatedById":169014,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-16T18:26:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy not try putting the engine and small fuel tank on the nose of the capsule instead?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"catonthekbd","CreatedById":189435,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-16T18:30:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou don\u0027t actually need the fuel tank.\u00A0 Just stage the engine - it does not need to fire up \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sitting Duck","CreatedById":200432,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-17T02:25:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are obviously a lot of things you could try, as anything listed above.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game isn\u0027t thinking logically (heh, obviously).
