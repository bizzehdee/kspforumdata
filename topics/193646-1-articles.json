You should also try looking in this folder: C:/users/your username/appdata/locallow/squad/kerbal space program, for a file called Player.txt which contains much more detailed logs. Appdata is a hidden folder so to find it you\u2019ll need to enable show hidden to see it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe error message on the screen should contain a part or module name, try searching for that name inside your GameData folder- a program like VSCode is recommended for this. If you find what parts are causing the error try deleting them or\u00A0even the mod they come from and that should resolve the issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe most likely cause of this type of error is running an old version of a mod that is incompatible with your version of KSP, so check your mod versions to ensure they\u2019re up to date and match your KSP version. If you just added a mod or mods and started getting this error, remove those mods and see if the problem persists- if it doesn\u2019t then one of those mods is to blame, if it does then there\u2019s something else going on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you downloaded the game from a Steam and still have it inside Steam with mods in it, then it\u2019s possible that Steam updated the game and broke some mods; if you were previously using 1.8.1 then you can try rolling back to that version in Steam by right clicking KSP and clicking Properties, then the Betas tab and then picking 1.8.1. You should copy the KSP folder and paste it somewhere outside of Steam\u2019s control if you\u2019re playing with mods as game updates can break mods, but if the KSP folder is outside of Steam then his can\u2019t happen. It makes updating the game itself a bit more complicated, but removes the possibility of updates breaking your mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
