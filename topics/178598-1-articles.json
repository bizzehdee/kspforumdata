I haven\u0027t been playing KSP for some time now and I remembered now what irritated me the last time I played. I don\u0027t want to force flight to Duna (or other planets, actually I\u0027m using GPP) if the transfer window isn\u0027t there. Next transfer to a planet that I currently getting a contract for is far ahead from now and before that there are transfer windows to plenty of other planets. I wouldn\u0027t want to warp and waste time, closing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E for a year just to wait for transfer window to that specific planet and I also wouldn\u0027t want to miss contract rewards for other planets that I\u00A0have transfer window to before the one specified in current contract.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nMaybe there\u0027s already some mod for that? If not, I suppose I will just ignore the \u0022world\u0027s first\u0022 contract for now and earn kerdits\u00A0on satellites that I don\u0027t need and measuring \u00A0temperature in sh*tholes. Still I think basing contracts on transfer windows\u00A0would be good idea for a mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JH4C","CreatedById":188049,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-28T20:16:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think there\u0027s sufficient flexibility in the Contract system for it to do what you\u0027re suggesting, at least not within Contract Configurator. You\u0027d need to take a lot into consideration, and there\u0027s every chance that what\u0027s possible with your current tech level may be outdated by the time the contract comes due, but you\u0027re still stuck doing it. Just because a transfer is coming up sooner doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s a better or more easily attainable destination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you\u0027d be better served by setting up Kerbal Alarm Clock to remind you when the transfer windows are due, and continuing to run other trips for more money/science in the meantime. There\u0027s also mods like Astrogator that can help you schedule your transfers and even program the manoeuvres for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed1061158599\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/155998-14-astrogator-v081/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:225px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-29T14:41:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost of those \u0022worlds first\u0022 contracts have no expiration date, so you\u0027re free to wait till the transfer window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven interplanetary contracts that do have expiration dates typically give you like 20 something years to do it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, no such thing as \u0022wasting time\u0022 really unless you have an urgent contract, just clean up any short term contracts and then warp to your desired window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
