But a note: you may wind up spending more DV than you expected if you don\u0027t pay attention to phase angles--it\u0027s perfectly possible to brute-force a rendezvous, but you\u0027ll need to plan acordingly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Armchair Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":76165,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T22:15:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESee if it\u0027s possible to get a Kerbin intercept using the Jeb\u0027s EVA pack and aerobrake into Kerbin orbit.

While in a Kerbol orbit, 20km is close, which makes closing the gap harder. I ran out of RCS in the end and had to dock with rockets. Also, due to the way KSP represents distances etc, time warping when more than 200 meters apart can move your target significantly (like kilometers), so don\u0027t time warp when close but over 200 meters away.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
