I mean, I know lunar dust reflects light in all directions, and so tends to appear the same intensity regardless of time of day, but the darkening of a surface at an angle is just radiant intensity. The moon wouldn\u0027t look like this, but it would be a question of modeling the soil correctly, not correcting for atmospheric effects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwilight was, in my understanding, the period of time AFTER sunset when the light emitted by the sky continued to illuminate the surface. On the Moon, radiant energy intensity per surface area of the moon would decrease as the sun moved lower into the sky, just like Earth.

If scattering from soil is isotropic, then it should be not as dim. If it scattered preferentially as a reflection (equal to angle of incidence), then the shot looking towards the sun should in fact have the ground brighter, not darker. Perhaps they coded illumination based upon Kerbin? So yeah, the light from a given cross section (normal) is spread out more on the surface, but it seems grossly exaggerated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing is the relative effect. The sun should be so intense, that even is measurably dimmer (grazing angle on surface) it would still be very bright. Images on the lunar surface are only not blown out entirely due to high f stop or a lot of filtering. So you\u0027d get less light hitting a given munar surface area than a X hours before, but the quantity of light would still be greater than light during most of the day on Kerbin since none is reflected/absorbed by atmosphere.
