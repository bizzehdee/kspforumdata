At most.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Bootable CD/USB isn\u0027t strictly speaking always a requirement: particularly on older versions of windows I\u0027m led to believe you can do it within windows.

Every single person has something they would like to keep private. What if your pc gets stolen, just to give the obvious example. And that should go for your mobile phone too.
