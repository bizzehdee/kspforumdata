It takes a little more than making sure the CoM is right, you need to have it line up with the Center of Thrust, or CoT. Where both of them land will depend which way your craft will fly. To help this, instead of putting random parts to even out the mass, use some thrusters and tweak their thrust limiters, to make sure the CoT is directly beneath the CoM. If you have a plane radially attached to your rocket, try to have the CoT line up with your CoL (center of lift) more than your CoM. Also the new RCS nozzles that use liquid fuel are handy to keep your rocket straight during accent, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf any of this looks wrong, please correct me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jas1126","CreatedById":99760,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T06:53:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks very much for the tips.

With the outer 2 at higher angle (like 15? or so) than the inner 2. (10 degrees?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also tried my best to keep the fuel as high up as possible(hard to see in the pictures) with the decoupler attatched to the Crew Compartment. As a higher placement means the fuel moves less in relation to the center of thrust. The SRBS are also placed low and are tweaked heavily to burn out JUST as the fuel moves to far due to the higher trust from the SRBS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimply put this design DOESN\u0027T work anymore(its .24), as the MK3 parts were changed, as were the wings. Your best bet is to keep a few things in mind. But don\u0027t get down, the game has added a few things to help us get Asymetric designs under control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Keep things simple. More parts you add more confusing things get. Especially if you add more fuel, as its movement during acent is hard to determine without actually trying it out. More parts you add, more thrust you need and thus more fuel you need. Its a complicated cycle which is unkind to any asymetric ship, as fuel displacement is your enemy and your litterally balancing it above your engines all the way to orbit. (and beyond in some cases!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Keep your fuel \u0022above\u0022 your thrust. In my designs the thrust and center of mass allowed a very straight ascent path(possibly 3 degrees off the prograde during straight ascent). If you take off and immediatly starting going past 10 degrees from straight up your design wont work. Without massive changes to your thrust vectoring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Tweak your thrust levels of your ascent engines along with changing the angling of your thrust vector. Minor adjustments can create big effects. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. VERNOR VERNOR VERNOR- hands down the easiest way to get anything under control. In an asymetric Shuttle Design stick a few of these on the External Fuel tank/stack and you will get MASSIVE control over your ship. This is at a cost, as you now must carry more fuel to keep your ship under control, so putting 6\u002B on your ship will eat away your fuel reserves. So getting your ship to be close to stable will help greatly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI plan to remake a new shuttle utiling the new parts and cargo bays. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVernors can be a big help, but relying on them to much wastes to much fuel when you can make better design choices. Asymetric Shuttle designs are the hardest thing to make in this game hands down. Until we get a high gimbal high thrust engine to compesate for fuel movements and offset centers of mass, we must build our ships perfect. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoodluck!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-15T12:38:55Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2014 12:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MKI\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bishop149","CreatedById":82368,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T12:57:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never even bothered trying this TBH its easier just to launch 2 light shuttles at a time so the weight is always precisely balanced on the either side of the rocket, and you get twice the spaceship for your launch!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real spaceshuttle goes up with its own thrusters firing while still attched to the boosters / fueltank, so I assume this offset thrust is just enough to balance out its own weight. you could probably achieve something similar in KSP by setting the thrust limiters just so on the shuttles engines. . . . but would take a fair old bit of trial and error to get right.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T14:53:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESpace Shuttle alikes are always going to be difficult in stock KSP.

The Saturn 5 sent up crew and cargo (the lunar lander) combined in one launch, so the Shuttle isn\u0027t alone in that capability. The shuttle orbiter had an empty weight of more than 3 times its max payload. If the payload was set inside a simple fairing on top of the rocket it could have saved most of this extra weight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne important reason for using it was cross-range: The military mandated that if required, it could launch into a polar orbit and de-orbit one orbit later, during which time the Earth moved underneath by 1000 miles. The shuttle could glide back to Cape Canaveral over this distance if it had to. Second reason was for experiments that could be done in a pressurized, reusable lab in the cargo bay then flown back to Earth. Also, as said before, the Shuttle did reuse the expensive main engines, but it\u0027s debatable whether or not it would have been actually cheaper. Something like SpaceX\u0027s model of flying back the spent stages down to Earth would probably be the cheapest option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of that was taken from the Wikipedia article, you guys inspire me to get lost in Wikipedia so many times...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sandworm","CreatedById":66244,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-16T06:44:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere was one thing that shuttle could do that rockets couldn\u0027t.
