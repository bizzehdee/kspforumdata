It then takes the distance from the point the ray hits to the maximum extension of the wheel collider and turns that into a percentage value based on the \u0022compression\u0022 variable in the script. This percentage value is then used to set the time of the animation. For example, when the suspension is completely compressed, the animation will go to time 0. When the gear are off of the ground and completely uncompressed, the animation goes to time 1. Based off of the compression experienced by the suspension on the wheel collider, the animation can therefore be anywhere within times 0 and 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to using the data it gets from the raycast to set the time of the animation, the script uses the point hit to set the position of the GroundContact object\u0027s Transform component. This is similar to how the stock wheels do it, except that the stock wheels position their wheels at the hit point plus some extra height based off of the radius of the wheel. AALG places the GroundContact object directly at the hit point, simplifying code a little bit. The original code for the AALG would use the same method as stock wheels, which worked for simpler models like the 747 landing gear but quickly fell apart as soon as something like Capt Kipard\u0027s landing gear came along. The current code is slightly harder to set up in Unity in terms of positioning things (like you need to know the radius of the wheel meshes), but it\u0027s actually a lot better in terms of accuracy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EwheelBase.position = hit.point\u002B(wheel.radius\u002BheightOffset)*wheel.transform.up\u002B(perc*traverse)*wheel.transform.up;\u003Cbr\u003E//Complicated, ugly, and not always accurate, especially with things other than the simple 747 gear I designed for testing this.\u003Cbr\u003E//Doesn\u0027t always position things right, even if they\u0027re set up 100% correctly \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ENEW:\u003Cbr\u003EgroundContact.position = hit.point;\u003Cbr\u003E//Very simple and elegant.

It is also floating backwards down the runway at 0.1m/s. It doesn\u0027t stop, it can\u0027t be stopped. If you mess with it too much, the wheelcollider clips through the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems to want to be set up in Unity like the stock wheels, which is just wrong! It shouldn\u0027t have to since there is no dependency on the stock modules (because they are trash). If I have to set up the gear like a stock wheel, which is what this plugin is trying to avoid, then I\u0027m going to contact Squad about throwing out their entire wheel code and rewriting it from scratch (in fact, I probably will anyway).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing that is working is the visual alignment. It works fine, animating the compression like a pro... when the landing gear suspension actually compresses! I\u0027m guessing that there is some code somewhere in KSP that forces wheelcolliders to have a specific spring value, regardless of what it\u0027s set to in Unity. I\u0027m testing it to see if the suspension compresses more with more weight (as it should) but considering what\u0027s gone on so far it wouldn\u0027t surprise me in the least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEdit 2:\u003C/strong\u003E Thank goodness.
