At all. Know what else the Original Series never had in it?\u003Cp\u003EThe Original Series never had the old worn-out trope about evil capitalists, either. If memory serves, corporations and business were never mentioned once in the entire series. Money was mentioned at least once, but the only case of that I can remember is Harvey Mudd conveniently neglecting to pay royalties when he sold the Denebians the patent rights for a fuel synthesizer...... All in all, ST:OS is proof that you \u003Cstrong\u003Ecan\u003C/strong\u003E write a good story (or an entire season of them!) without resorting to the old worn-out trope about greed or business or capitalism.

A number of them were parallel Earth\u0027s, or the mirror universe. There was also Stratos, enjoying a life of luxury in sky cities at the expense of the under-appreciated labor class who lived in ridiculously unhealthy working conditions. And a final note on the topic of money, I chuckle at Triskelion a little, wondering if we as humans, even if we reached some insane level of immaterial existence, would still be clinging to some form of score-keeping as silly as currency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the Ferengi are actually going to be major players, a lot of fun could be had with their version of Capitalism. To the point of a lot of Federation folks thinking they\u0027re evil, because \u0022we did away with that nonsense centuries ago,\u0022 only to find out that the Ferengi version of Capitalism is actually far more honorable than anything humans were able to achieve.

And there also wasn\u0027t a trend for people to sue everybody who offended them. These days, the only films where the bad guys are Muslims are films such as Zero Dark Thirty which are based on actual history (however loosely). You can\u0027t have Chinese bad guys much any more because a billion of the moviegoers are Chinese (but if it\u0027s a martial-arts-based movie where the good guy is also Chinese, it can work out, but must be handled very carefully). The U.S. government is one of the few safe bad guys these days because they\u0027ve withered into complete sissies and won\u0027t do anything.

Star Trek TOS was about a future very different from ours, in which the human race no longer had most of the problems we end up dealing with today. It wasn\u0027t about the present. Certainly some of the episodes were parables about present-day problems, but only because there are some problems that never go away. Other stories in the series weren\u0027t based on present-day problems at all. And in a few cases, Kirk and his crew sighed with resignation at aliens who had problems the human race had already solved. The iconic Planet Killer for example. Certainly that episode has some parallels with nuclear war (one of which Kirk mentions explicitly in the episode) but that parallel is a faint one. We never actually find out where the Planet Killer came from; Kirk and Spock could only guess. This episode was not about the present; t\u003Cstrong\u003Ehe human race has never fought a global nuclear war.\u003C/strong\u003E We have never had our ultimate superweapon go bonkers and start destroying all of intergalactic Creation, for a very obvious reason. Bottom line, this episode was not about the present.

I really tried to like him, but Prime did some incredibly stupid things and even as a kid I was disappointed in him. He kept overlooking who Megatron was, made treaties with the Decepticons while I was yelling at Prime that he was going to get betrayed again (and I was always right!), failed to learn from his mistakes, was pretty weak in battle, and was just a really poor leader for the Autobots. (one of the best parts of Original Transformers was when the Autobots built the Negavator--I was blown away. I was going \u0022holy crap, the GOOD GUYS invented a superweapon!?!? YAAAAAY!\u0022)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the TF1 reboot movie, Optimus Prime is a total badass. Here he\u0027s following the trope to a T. He rips Decepticons limb from metal limb and smacks other Decepticons upside the heads with the pieces. The reason the trope works here is, Optimus Prime doesn\u0027t have the character flaws he had in the animated series, and I found the change very refreshing. Prime doesn\u0027t do stupid. He doesn\u0027t negotiate with the bad guys. In fact, the first time he encountered a Decepticon in open battle, I don\u0027t think Prime said one word. He opened an economy-size crate of You Messed With The Wrong Robot, stabbed his unfortunate victim in the face, and treated the wreckage with zero respect. WARRANTY EXPIRED!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(the other thing I liked about TF1 was that human weapons did actual damage to Decepticons, and the human race actually had a fighting chance on the battlefield--something you don\u0027t see a lot of in modern sci-fi without the humans resorting to various hastily-MacGyver\u0027ed superweapons)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
