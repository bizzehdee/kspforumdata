How to build space station on Pluto\u0027s orbit, we would need there better power source than solar panels, for example larger RTG, wind turbine for Laythe (make \u0022scanners\u0022 that measure wind speed), small geothermal power plant for some vulcanic planets (add hot spots detection for scanners).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know we need to have parts balanced, so IMO to create illusion of technological progress in KSP more \u0022advanced/futuristic\u0022 parts should have not only futuristic look, but also additional features.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I mentioned about capsules, we could also have different mix of features some probe cores could have larger batteries, others build-in antennas or solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuturistic fuel tanks could have build-in RCS thrusters or landing legs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat kind of approach should make illusion of balanced progress in carrier mode, player should be able to build more and larger crafts/stations/bases still being bellow his part count limit and he would be able to do things faster, because time is also resource in this game \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-15T04:06:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think we should get some nuclear reactors instead of Larger RTGs and I like the geothermal and wind turbine thing\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
