There are two basic types of human. \u003Cp\u003EThen there are infinite small variants like skin tone and whatever.

I\u0027m one of the people where it truly does not matter one whit what color a person\u0027s skin is or what junk they have. And I\u0027m fine with making them gender neutral or making females and males. Whatever makes you happy. Like I said in the other thread, whoever is next up in the astronaut complex gets the seat. That\u0027s not going to change based on the name or the secondary sexual characteristics of the mesh or the shade of the texture that covers it. The only features that me at all to me at this point are courage and stupidity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be honest, kerbals \u003Cstrong\u003Edo\u003C/strong\u003E look like little dudes. But there are so many placeholders in this game, hell how many times have the planets changed looks? So many features of this game are undeveloped that actually affect how the game is played, that arguing about the sexuality of avatars is silly. At least at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re trying to assign human characteristics to a species that the developers have said are asexual. They appear to all have the same skin tone. If you\u0027re trying to humanize them, why is skin tone left out? And I\u0027m not suggesting random skin tones, although if they go to the trouble of randomizing this stuff, I can\u0027t imagine it would be that big of a deal. But I\u0027m not going to get all bundged up about it, either way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
