Perhaps like a limited F2 option?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf not, is it possible? And would someone be willing to make it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf not removing staging icons, then perhaps running them along the top of the screen (moving the altimeter in the process and having the fuel gauges come out below the icons.) Ultimately what it could be used for (besides personal preferences) is creating a clear frame across your display for recording cinematics and so on, while still having all information available to controlling your craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that Enhanced Navball allows scaling and moving the navball about, but I\u0027m looking for the other graphic items.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks and Peace.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-07T01:27:35Z\u0022 title=\u002210/07/2015 01:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by theJesuit\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EA bump and reopening of the request\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-28T02:46:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really don\u0027t have time now, but I\u0027ll experiment in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-28T03:08:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWider Contracts App does this sort of UI trickery, although the goal is to change the size, rather than removing UI elements.
