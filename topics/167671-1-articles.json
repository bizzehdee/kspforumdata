Yes, it was to prove to myself that I could, because when I played for the first time\u00A0it seemed something impossible. It was a real pain, but very satisfying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I\u0027m playing with mods that I think are balanced or with things that make sense. Always bordered me that the game didn\u0027t\u00A0have any electric engine, that could run only in intake air and EC. Looked at a lot of mods, and liked the most one of Nertea MK4 Spaceship. It uses 200 EC/S, which is manageable with Near Future batteries and reactors, but I don\u0027t think it is unbalanced. I find very fun to make Eve airplanes, VTOLs and quad-copters instead of rovers.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow I\u0027m thinking of\u00A0making a vehicle that uses electric engines in it\u0027s first stage, maybe an\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E.
