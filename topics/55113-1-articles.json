It had a built in converter though, and most pre .21 saves can be successfully converted to the new format. 0.22 added science sections for career mode saves, but the format is identical for sandbox saves. In fact, it\u0027s possible to use saves from .18 in .22, the biggest problem is the terrain changes. Anything landed on Kerbin or the Mun runs the risk of being underground or similar problems.

A key thing to understand about compatibility in KSP is that when something makes a save incompatible, that doesn\u0027t mean the game will outright treat old files as unloadable. To make that happen, we here have to manually set a new \u0022last-compatible\u0022 version number for the file formats that broke, so the game throws error messages and disables the incompatible ones.
