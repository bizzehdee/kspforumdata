Able to be stored in very small cargo bays and land on small distant moons (Engines released pending completion.) Even tho it is of small size and stature it will be well suited to supplying roving probes with required fuel for much less then a full mining rig.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xzuL4PW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022xzuL4PW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003EIt will have center core, that is just a simple attachment point or maybe include a probe core.
