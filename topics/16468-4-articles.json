Jeb is at the controls! Surprisingly, Jeb sticks the landing like the boss and makes himself the first Kerbal to set foot on the Mun while it is still attached to his body! Naturally, after some photo-ops, I use the EVA pack to fly around the Mun. On my way back to the lander, I realize to my horror that I have had my finger on the throttle for far to long and Jeb splatted onto a slight drop off nearby the lander and died. He would have wanted to go that way...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy next mission involved me designing a Mun-capable rocket with a full, three-man crew. It took far more tries to get it right then the single capsule, but it was finally ready for launch. My new mission: Recover the previous rocket currently landed on the Mun! I had never tried to land close to another rocket on the Mun before, but now was the time to try it. I got far closer than I had though myself possible on a first try, but the stranded rocket was within visual range. However, the area of the Mun that the rocket was stranded on happened to have fallen into night. I gingerly approached the surface and hoped for a good landing spot. As I came down, it became clear that I was about to land at a bad angle....on a suspiciously familiar drop-off. As the lander started to fall over, I realized my RCS was used up trying to keep my hastily designed craft on course early on.....my only hope was to gun the engine and gain enough altitude to reattempt a landing. No luck, the craft had too much momentum to stop the tilt and crashed down the embankment in a glorious fireball. After holding my head in shame, I looked up to see a surprising sight: Three Kerbal thumbnails staring back at me. As the fire and smoke cleared, the only thing left of my lander was the Command Capsule.....not even the parachute on top survived! So what did I do? I hopped one Kerbalnaut out of the capsule, flew him (Gently!) over the embankment and across the short distance to the derelict lander, climbed the ladders to get in, and made a flawless return home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.....Now, in full KSP fashion, I need to rescue the rest of the rescue crew....\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is too funny.

That plan certainly went a bit awry as I was beginning to drop a bit too much and lack the necessary power to even return. Fortunately, I managed to land on a small island several minutes later (went on for an estimated 20-30 minutes without fuel). Not so bad if you\u0027re closer to the runway a bit, but I was definitely too far with this mishap. I probably should\u0027ve used a real glider for this one. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMishap 2 (Happened in 0.15 mainly): After some time getting to close to orbit, I jettison the first stage and pressed \u0027space\u0027 again to activate the next (with throttle on max). Certainly wasn\u0027t a smart idea (especially when the engines are still apparently stuck together or real close) and caused one of the engines to blow up. Fortunately, I had spare engines and even another stage to utilize (though can\u0027t travel as far due to one engine being destroyed). It definitely helps to have spare engines similar to real mishaps or failures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMishap 3 (Happened in 0.16): During EVA on the Mun, I had one Kerbal (forgot which one it was) explore the Mun and make nice photo shoots. I found a relatively interesting Mun mountain (not the Mun Arch mind y\u0027all) along with some interesting areas and make haste. That was a huge mistake because that poor Kerbal lost control of his EVA Suit and eventually died upon crashing on to the Mun. Sent another one (since it was a three-kerbal lander) to try to explore that same area. Fortunately, he survived and decided to make a return home (with one death). It was either Angry Kerman (yes, that name exists) or one of the other Kerbals who died that faithful day. :|\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll provide more mishaps if I have anymore to offer. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Panichio","CreatedById":2858,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-21T04:43:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket did \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E explode.

After assempling it, and spawning it in orbit i then notice it was full of lag. It was so strange. I then sent Bill out from the space dock out on a EVA to investigate. As he approached it i got lag to the face. Still managable though. I then realized that it was just the ship. The lag was getting worse and worse. I hurried to get bill back to the space dock, but the lag got to me. As i was 30m away from the dock, Bill started spinning out of control at 2 frames a second. 1 minuite later the lg stopped, and the dock was no where to be found. I wasnt far from it, but it wouldnt give me the purple markings to show where it was. Bill was getting farther and farther. He then made a desperate attempt to get back to the dock. But it was difficult seeing he was on a trajectory almost dipping into the atmoshphere. With RCS fuel running out, I made the deccision to stabalize my orbit. I went back to the dock where Jeb and Bob were. They made desperate attempts to save Bill. The Dock grew nearer and nearer to bill. I switched over to bill, but the Dock was wayyy below him. And just zoomed below him at crazy speeds. He tried to chase, but his RCS pack reach 5%! I went to the dock again to try and take a more calm appraoch to this. I did douzen and douzens of orbits around kerbin to slowly meet up with Bill. According to the map i was real close to Bill, but seeing he was so tiny, there was no way i could see him. I went back to bill and started searching...nothing...5 mins later...nothings...WHERE THE HELL IS IT?! Then i saw a small space ship in the distance slowly flying past me. Thank god. Finally i was in range, but i decided to play it safe and make Bill do the rest. I was still far away so i did short quick bursts of RCS to conserve my fuel.

What are the odds of a orbital collision..... i see many posts in this thread about orbital collisions. Also make sure u are careful around jumping of mountains on mimmus. I died falling at high speeds.

Entirely by accident.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomewhere in LKO, one of the side-mounted engine-pods on the orbital-insertion stage ran out of fuel because of a glitched fuel line. This of course meant I had 3 out of 4 engines running (the 41 used an odd design for its second stage, a central LVT30, and 4 LVT45\u0027s. Because of dodgy fuel line setups, the early versions had the 30 cut off significantly before the 45\u0027s), and asymmetric thrust. Being new to the game, I couldn\u0027t really do much manually with this....so I figured I\u0027d see how high an orbit I could get with a damaged craft. With ASAS on, I could put the throttle onto a VERY low setting, and the craft would, more or less, stay in the right heading thanks to the wonders of vectored-thrust engines. This ended up putting me into the right orbit to (eventually) get captured by the Mun. Unfortunately, on separation of the defective stage, some wacko glitch broke up the rest of the rocket and sent debris sling-shotting into solar orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I\u0027d sorted out the fuel issues and beefed up the structure to guard against Kraken damage, the 41 went on to be probably the most reliable rocket I\u0027ve ever made, with variants doing everything from satellite delivery to Mun landings. But the first flight was an AMAZING failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I too have also had something similar to the \u0022Icy Slopes of Minmus\u0022 scenario, only it was an entire 3-man lander, minus the engine and landing legs. Sidzor\u0027s EVA-pack saved him. Not as crazy as going to the Mun with asymetric thrust then blowing apart in a massive glitchy cascade that made even JEB scream, but getting that way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-22T09:50:37Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2012 09:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Fendleton\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tbrown85","CreatedById":38128,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-22T12:18:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProbably trying to set a lander down on the Mun using only RCS thrusters.
