I can attach them, but what\u0027s left is just a stud. I cannot draw the line to the other tank.

Even with struts you need to use the \u0027special\u0027 KAS struts.\n\nCan you right click the fuel duct once it\u0027s attached? of not, then it probably doesn\u0027t work."},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T13:25:13Z","Content":"If you want to connect fuel ducts outside of the VAB, that\u0027s what the CC-R2 Connector Port is for. Just put one on each of the ships you want to join, land them so that the ports are facing approximately towards one another and send someone on EVA to join them together."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T19:37:24Z","Content":"Mod use question moved to the mod subforum."},{"CreatedByName":"Bogeyman","CreatedById":136919,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T08:10:25Z","Content":"I tried again on a mockup. The KAS hose couplers don\u0027t do anything. Except you can manually pump fuel to other tanks. I wanted to have it like with the yellow ducts, that the ship automatically pumps fuel into the direction you installed the yellow duct. But that you cannot handle with KAS. Should be fixed."},{"CreatedByName":"LitaAlto","CreatedById":110917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T13:37:12Z","Content":"It isn\u0027t KAS/KIS, but marce made an EVA transfer mod that lets you use a (modified) stock fuel line that you can connect to another craft. Unlike KAS, the two craft remain separate craft, so it\u0027s very useful.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93627](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93627)\n\n(Yes, it works in version 1.0.4.)"}]}
