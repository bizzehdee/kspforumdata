Now your in orbit catching up with the space station set it as your target then you need to use a maneuver node until you get an intercept marker closer than 5KM, burn that maneuver node and when you are close make sure the Nav ball is set to target so it shows your speed relative to the target, burn on the retro grade on the Nav ball this will decrease your speed relative to the target until it is zero or under \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#0000ff;\u0022\u003E1M/S\u003C/span\u003E.
