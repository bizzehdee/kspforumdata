Now your in orbit catching up with the space station set it as your target then you need to use a maneuver node until you get an intercept marker closer than 5KM, burn that maneuver node and when you are close make sure the Nav ball is set to target so it shows your speed relative to the target, burn on the retro grade on the Nav ball this will decrease your speed relative to the target until it is zero or under 1M/S. You now have to point your rocket to the purple circle mark on the Nav ball and burn towards it make sure you are under 50MM/s, you should see the prograde marker on top of or near the purple marker if this drifts too far from the marker or you stop getting closer then reduce your speed again burning retrograde and then burn towards the station again repeat until you are very close and not going to smash anything.\n\nDocking, now make sure both spacecraft have docking ports pointing towards north and one south this stops the positions moving about so you don\u0027t have to keep re-positioning your rocket, you then should only have to use the docking controls with the RCS thrusters to position your rocket and dock, \u0022Just take us in slow Jeb\u0022.![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T14:36:04Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 02:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Orb8Ter**"},{"CreatedByName":"mudkest","CreatedById":115812,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T17:40:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E burn on the retro grade on the Nav ball this will decrease your speed relative to the target until ists zero or under 1KM/S. \u003Csnip\u003E 50KM/s, \u003C/snip\u003E\n\nsurely you mean m/s ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nhavent looked at the vid yet, but this jumped out at me"},{"CreatedByName":"cat-the-cat","CreatedById":127012,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T19:50:29Z","Content":"Literally threading a needle if you can dock at 50km/s xD"},{"CreatedByName":"Orb8Ter","CreatedById":114914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T14:34:47Z","Content":"Ah yes didnt notice that ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif) Thanks I will correct.
