I\u0027ll take my slow rocket ship instead. At light speed, time runs infinitely fast in the external universe, and all lengths in the direction of your motion are contracted to zero. So if you could ride a photon through the solar system, you would instantaneously find yourself in the death throes of the universe- assuming there is an end- and trillions of light-years away from Sol or probably further, assuming you weren\u0027t \u0022lucky\u0022 enough to strike something like a star or planet or interstellar dust grain hundreds, thousands, millions, or billions of light-years from Earth first. At least you would have a very high probability of being absorbed by interstellar dust if you left in a direction aligned with the galactic plane- though that depends on what kind of photon you wanna be. If you\u0027re a radio photon, you\u0027ve pretty much got a guaranteed instantaneous one-way-ticket to the end of the universe.
