If all the techs were available from day 0 and all costs were equal, one of the first techs that would be picked surely would be the tech that gives the lightest probe core that can SAS and has some reaction wheels ( the OCTO, IIRC ), because obviously you want to reduce your payload mass to the minimum due to the rocket equation tyranny. But you ( dev team again ) have been adamant since first time we had science that you want manned flight first for #reasons ( never understood that TBH. It is not that you can nowadays EVA out besides in the Kerbal surface until you drop the bling ( so no opportunities for beauty EVA shots at first flights ) and if you are adamant on having a kerbal face in the lower right corner in first flights, you could always do a CAPCOM IVA and put Jeb on a joystick remote controlling it ). So, if we go the way you describe, QA will surely give you a list where probe techs would be high in the list of the first techs to be achieved, but you ( dev team ) would not want that ...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-18T00:31:07Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2015 12:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by r\\_rolo1**"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T00:16:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ***I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve created a new version of the tech tree which features absolutely no dependencies between nodes.

And you need to add the fact that a good bunch of parts are not directly touched by the contracts ( fuel tanks, powered wheels, structural parts in general, capsules, batteries ... actually it would be faster to say what parts **are** touched by contracts directly ), so the bare minimum would either be **the** bare minimum ( say for your example would be a 200 l tank, a 48-7S, a OCTO2, a solar panel and the smallest antenna ) or a myriad of interchangeable configurations if you give it any kind of lenience ...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E One problem this testing WILL catch, is the awkward problem in .90 of aerial surveys: landing gear was too high-up in the tech tree.

My personal opinion is that, given that there are only 3 non-rocket non-ion engines ( and one of them is firmly stuck in the end of the tech tree due to it\u0027s Scifiey nature in RL ), it is hard to make a decent progression in the flight department in terms of engines.

I liked NovaSilsko\u0027s idea of the easter egg storyline and hidden planet, but that would be a lot of work on top of an already huge workload (by the sounds of it). But how about if the Explore Body contracts lead up to a big final Grand Tour contract to land on all the planets in a single mission?

Really glad to see that we\u0027re getting a proper interplanetary transfer tutorial, that\u0027s something I\u0027ve still never really mastered (MechJeb is my friend and is the main reason I still play this game), I\u0027ll have to give it a try after 1.0 comes out and hopefully be able to finally master it.\n\nThat\u0027s an interesting methodology for getting data to check the node placement, not necessarily what I would do but hopefully it works out. My approach would be to draw out a rough draft (possibly based on what you have now) and playtest it repeatedly, identify problem points where players run into progression problems (i.e. a part/node needs to be moved earlier) or parts that are completely unused (move parts later to encourage players to use alternatives, or move the unused parts earlier before the alternative is unlocked). I would assume this is also the approach used by the various mod developers working with the tech tree.\n\nI also agree that at some point the whole progression mechanic needs to be completely rethought, it doesn\u0027t really make any sense that random science data from other planets would be used to unlock new parts. It would make more sense for a mission plan to be identified (i.e. a contract) and then you identify the parts needed and do the research with funds (and possibly with contracts to unlock some parts as mentioned in another post, contracts to do something similar to the orion capsule test flight would be cool) and then to change the science to be the currency for some kind of end-game goal instead of being the primary means of progression. Another possibility would be that specific experiments give specific bonuses to certain parts, i.e. pressure experiments in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere could improve the ISP of some of the engines, temperature/pressure/radiation experiments are required on a given body before EVA is allowed (as a side note: we have temperature and pressure experiments, but no radiation or magnetic fields?) so we would have a reason to send a small probe to scout ahead of time to upgrade get the data needed for a manned mission.\n\nThanks again Squad for providing weekly devnotes for us and for interacting with the community, I know we can be vocal and complain at times but it\u0027s because we all care about this game and want to see it succeed as much as you do.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-18T01:39:20Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2015 01:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lord Aurelius**"},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T02:07:35Z","Content":"Will the follow-up to the addition of DDS loading be that the stock textures are migrated to .DDS(DXT1/5) to take advantage of the increased loading speed?\n\nIf so this presents an opportunity to rationalise the textures (ensure appropriate sizes, PoT sizing etc) and to disable [CPU R/W flags](https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2015/02/05/unity-tips-1) for suitable textures so that DX9 doesn\u0027t feel the need to keep mirrored system memory copies around after they\u0027ve been pushed out the GPU.\n\nI\u0027m assuming modders will also be able to start packaging their textures as .DDS?"},{"CreatedByName":"gkorgood","CreatedById":124879,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T02:18:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I guess that little mishap helps someone out then, haha.
