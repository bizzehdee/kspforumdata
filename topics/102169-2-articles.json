I would assume this is also the approach used by the various mod developers working with the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also agree that at some point the whole progression mechanic needs to be completely rethought, it doesn\u0027t really make any sense that random science data from other planets would be used to unlock new parts. It would make more sense for a mission plan to be identified (i.e. a contract) and then you identify the parts needed and do the research with funds (and possibly with contracts to unlock some parts as mentioned in another post, contracts to do something similar to the orion capsule test flight would be cool) and then to change the science to be the currency for some kind of end-game goal instead of being the primary means of progression. Another possibility would be that specific experiments give specific bonuses to certain parts, i.e. pressure experiments in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere could improve the ISP of some of the engines, temperature/pressure/radiation experiments are required on a given body before EVA is allowed (as a side note: we have temperature and pressure experiments, but no radiation or magnetic fields?) so we would have a reason to send a small probe to scout ahead of time to upgrade get the data needed for a manned mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again Squad for providing weekly devnotes for us and for interacting with the community, I know we can be vocal and complain at times but it\u0027s because we all care about this game and want to see it succeed as much as you do.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-18T01:39:20Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2015 01:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lord Aurelius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T02:07:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWill the follow-up to the addition of DDS loading be that the stock textures are migrated to .DDS(DXT1/5) to take advantage of the increased loading speed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf so this presents an opportunity to rationalise the textures (ensure appropriate sizes, PoT sizing etc) and to disable \u003Ca href=\u0022https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2015/02/05/unity-tips-1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECPU R/W flags\u003C/a\u003E for suitable textures so that DX9 doesn\u0027t feel the need to keep mirrored system memory copies around after they\u0027ve been pushed out the GPU.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m assuming modders will also be able to start packaging their textures as .DDS?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gkorgood","CreatedById":124879,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T02:18:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KasperVld\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KasperVld\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI guess that little mishap helps someone out then, haha.

As an addition to your proposal, maybe later nodes could also unlock upgrades to earlier parts (so the tech tree doesn\u0027t get cluttered up with obsolete parts) such as better thrust/isp for engines, lighter parts, more power efficient parts, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"federicoaa","CreatedById":94879,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T03:10:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Marco: Making a Duna transfer from LKO is hard because you need to take into account planetary alignment, ejection vector, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI remember the first time I went to Duna I just left Kerbin SOI and then tweaked a node to have an encounter with Duna.
