Relatively easy to intercept and comes around for a transfer window with good frequency. Atmosphere is safe for capture even in 1.0.4, reducing dV requirements. Liftoff from Duna with either conventional rockets or winged craft is easy and getting to orbit requires minimal dV. Ike is close to Duna and easy to encounter, orbit, land and return. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve/Gilly, on the other hand, is nothing but trouble. Very easy to intercept and encounter from Kerbin, but there the trouble begins. The atmosphere is positively deadly at entry/escape velocity and yet does not slow a ship down enough to make a difference--you will have to burn engines to capture. Even if descending at incredibly shallow angle from a 90x90 orbit, parts are going to heat up and likely explode. Once you\u0027re on the surface....well, that\u0027s pretty much where you\u0027re going to stay unless you brought a LOT of dV along. And as for Gilly, that little rock is completely annoying. Crazy elliptical and inclined orbit plus low gravity makes it very difficult and expensive to find from Eve orbit. You might think that its low gravity makes it a nice place to visit, but it also means that it takes forever to get down and up--especially since you will be restricted to 1x time warp under 8000m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor my longer (and highly dramatized) opinions on these two systems, click on the links in my signature \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-13T16:07:36Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2015 04:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kuzzter\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T17:12:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cantab\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cantab\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBut what\u0027s the point?
