I know that FAR does something like this, but then that eliminates the purpose for the request in the first place! (There ARE people who enjoy using the stock physics over FAR)"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T22:43:30Z","Content":"You mean like the graphs and such that FAR produces?\n\nHere, this image accurately simulates all planes in stock aerodynamics: ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n![rYeJEUi.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/rYeJEUi.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T22:50:10Z","Content":"^^ Yep.\n\nThere is no need to simulate because it flies the same everywhere and at any speed. The whole point of the FAR graphs (which I don\u0027t use and find completely unnecessary FWIW) is to show you how it flies at different speeds and altitudes. A graph for stock would be a straight line."},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T23:13:54Z","Content":"lol, I yeah, I decided to ask because I noticed on another thread that someone was having issues with getting their spaceplane to fly and not just suddenly fall out of the sky."},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbas_ad_astra","CreatedById":126593,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T01:16:33Z","Content":"It\u0027s true that spaceplane performance is more straightforward in stock aerodynamics, but a spaceplane still has a \u0022stall speed\u0022 (i.e. speed at which L = W) and a maximum speed (where max thrust = drag) at any given altitude\u0027s air pressure, which defines its flight envelope.

Also, I think something to assist in the balance setting (I\u0027m sorry, I just learned how to calculate aircraft weight and balance in school) in the air so that when it takes off it won\u0027t auger into the ground.
