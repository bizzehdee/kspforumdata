The parts that aren\u0027t water are just shallow slopes and hills. I was thinking that it would be cool if laythe had rivers and mountains like kerbin. Laythe probably has a lot of tectonic activity which could create mountain ranges and water logged canyons. I feel like it could be incorporated well into 1.2 with the biome\u00A0overhauls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-29T18:55:34Z\u0022 title=\u002209/29/2016 06:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Vingo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAutocorrect\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-29T19:17:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRocks at least, instead of just mud, and dormant volcanos / cold lava flows.

All of the planets and bodies (besides most asteroids maybe) have interesting geological and meteorological features.
