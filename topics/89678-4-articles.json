I will resume Alexandria once I have Odyssey a little further along. Another reason is Odyssey has a story that gets stale if left alone. Alexandria on the other hand is history, and 1961 is not going anywhere.

I\u0027m trying to replicate the real shuttle, which lands with an engine configuration the same as mine. See video below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. It\u0027s the CSS. The parts have a fixed shape that matches the real shuttle. I can\u0027t remodel them, but would not want to anyway since #1 above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. KSP parts use \u0022point mass\u0022 to determine overall center of balance. The angle of the engines won\u0027t matter. If you\u0027re saying I should change it mid-flight, that would require custom programming since the standard gimbal module does not support this. Also, even if it did, normal gimbal is not going to change the CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. CoL and CoM have the greatest impact on lift and drag moments. There is one CoM. The engines affect it, but it\u0027s a constant once determined. They can\u0027t affect the nose on their own unless they have a non-standard aerodynamic module attached. They have the default module, and in fact they are shielded under FAR by the rest of the orbiter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Things used to work ok (seen in a previous video) before FAR values were added, so it\u0027s something about FAR. The engines did not change between those videos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. A take-off from the runway should be possible even if the craft was not meant to fly under power. The only reason it\u0027s not testable in real life has to do with CoM and fuel\u002Bpropulsion. In KSP I can cheat with infinite fuel. If it can fly with no power then it should fly with power. Velocity is velocity. Again, this worked ok in a previous video before FAR modules were added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Another viewer noticed the tail brake was on. It\u0027s possible this was the problem.

KSP parts use \u0022point mass\u0022 to determine overall center of balance. The angle of the engines won\u0027t matter. If you\u0027re saying I should change it mid-flight, that would require custom programming since the standard gimbal module does not support this. Also, even if it did, normal gimbal is not going to change the CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. CoL and CoM have the greatest impact on lift and drag moments. There is one CoM. The engines affect it, but it\u0027s a constant once determined. They can\u0027t affect the nose on their own unless they have a non-standard aerodynamic module attached. They have the default module, and in fact they are shielded under FAR by the rest of the orbiter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Things used to work ok (seen in a previous video) before FAR values were added, so it\u0027s something about FAR. The engines did not change between those videos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. A take-off from the runway should be possible even if the craft was not meant to fly under power. The only reason it\u0027s not testable in real life has to do with CoM and fuel\u002Bpropulsion. In KSP I can cheat with infinite fuel. If it can fly with no power then it should fly with power. Velocity is velocity. Again, this worked ok in a previous video before FAR modules were added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Another viewer noticed the tail brake was on. It\u0027s possible this was the problem. I have not tested it since they noticed this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/XCeukUsCodk?start=430\u0026amp;feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHey, thanks for the reply. I think I had some problems transforming my thoughts into english words.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I meant is, that when the shuttle engines are running (as they where in your video, as you tried taking off powered by the SSME) as they are pointing up, the force generated by them has two components, one greather part pushing the shuttle forqward, a smaller one pushing the end of the shuttle down, any by this, the nose of the shuttle up (like giving some elevator trim). Thus, if you would make changes to counteract this upward momentum, and then flying without the SSME turned on, the whole craft would tend to go nose down. I dont know that the css could not angle its engines straight, as i am using the KSO shuttle, and beeing non-realistic, it has wide range of gimbal movement, and if you angle iits angines completely up, it will show quite a tail heavy, nose lifting behaviour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://abload.de/img/untitled-1ycp96.png\u0022 alt=\u0022untitled-1ycp96.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Felbourn","CreatedById":97344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T16:25:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh I see. Well my method for all the \u0022real\u0022 tests is to tap the infinite fuel cheat just enough to get thrust long enough to get some velocity. After that I turn it back off and see if it glides. If I left it on in the video that\u0027s because by then I was sure it did not matter. Now I understand what you mean. In some pre-FAR tests this method of tapping fuel on and off worked to get velocity and gliding without crashes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InsaneDruid","CreatedById":137849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T16:50:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, ok then \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: Will you include Sojus T-15?
