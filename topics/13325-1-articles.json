But I will post the ship as an attachment so you can have some fun with it too. KEEP IN MIND. It is truly RCS, and RCS boosters aren\\\u0027t powerful at all, so they can\\\u0027t lift a lot of weight on Kerbin. Less weight capacity means less RCS fuel, so you wont have much fuel to work with. This was really meant as something for possibly the Mun or Minmus, as the gravity there is much weaker and there is no drag. The \\\u0027K\\\u0027 key is to ascend (turn the RCS and the SAS on), while H is to accelerate and N is to decelerate. Normal pitch and yaw controls work as well. Enjoy =P\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
