I started adding mods soon enough (like a week in). One of the gems I found was RemoteTech2. It adds a challenge to the game that mostly makes sense (I both lament and am grateful for the lack of directional requirements for antennas - i.e. Directional antennas don\u0027t have to be physically pointed at the target, unlike how solar panels should be facing the sun in the game.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, beside the obvious communications challenge RM2 added, the other challenge is setting up a nice constellation of comsats. There are some of us who are kinda OCD about some things. I fall into that category a bit. I\u0027ve made some of constellations to date, all eyeballed for spacing. 90 degree spacing was easy, but for my last constellation, I wanted LESS comsats in it - the minimum of 3 in KEO - so I needed 120 degree spacing. That\u0027s not as easy to eyeball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI futzed around in KSP for a while instead of creating this new constellation. (I got horribly sidetracked by what eventually was found to be a memory leak bug in AGX...) I recently broke down and decided to create something to help me out with my constellation planning: A synchronous orbital period calculator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s just an Excel spreadsheet that take 2 of 3 inputs and spits out the relevant variable you\u0027re probably looking for:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Input an orbit period and an apsis = gives you the other apsis height for the actual orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Input both apses = gives you the orbital period (and Semi-major axis)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Input just the period and you get at least the circular orbital height\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game and wiki gave me all the data required. Some browsing on Wikipedia gave me the relevant equations I needed. So now I know that a 4-hour sync orbit with KEO has an AP of 2868.75KM and a PERI of 1225.337KM. Now I can just lift one comsat to a given circular orbit and use my calculator to figure out the orbital apses I need to sync the subsequent comsats for even spacing. e.g. I lift one comsat and stick it in KEO (6 hour period). My next one is sent to circular orbit at 1225.337km. I set an \u0022intercept/rendezvous\u0022 node with the first probe, burn, then adjust to make my APO = KEO height. I wait until the second orbital intersect and circularize. I am now 2 hours (120 degrees) ahead of the first comsat, give or take.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis post is to see if anyone else has any interest in this calculator. It\u0027s excel-only, so not in-game. (I currently have no plans to write an actual game plugin or anything.) If there is interest, I\u0027ll have some incentive to make actually complete the spreadsheet in full. I currently only have data for the Kerbin system (Kerbin, Mun, Mimas). I haven\u0027t gathered the data for other bodies yet. I also need to clean up and complete the \u0022UI\u0022 section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figure if I wanted/needed something like this, there might be others who do as well. I can stick a copy of the current version on OneDrive for people to try out if they need to actually see what I\u0027m talking about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis little pseudo-project is also an excuse to brush up on my Excel skills.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterest and feedback would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T17:40:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am quite sure you can find such speadsheet on the forum already.

This calc I started is meant to figure that out for the user (for Kerbin or any other celestial body in KSP). You pick the body, enter the target altitude/apsis and the period you want; it tells you the other apsis you need to aim for. Or you can enter both Apses and it\u0027ll tell you the Period. (Just entering a period will give you the circular altitude.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, what if a player wants something other than 3 satellites? Let\u0027s say 4 sats: they need to figure out the (peri)apsis for a 4.5-hour orbit.

Placing a constellation around say the Mun requires different numbers. Again, this calc will help there. You can first type I either the target Period or altitude for your constellation (for alt, just use the same value for the Apo and Peri). Using the resultant numbers plus the number of sats you want, you can figure out the parking/transition orbit for spacing the satellites around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022hab136\u0022 data-cite=\u0022hab136\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESee also:\u003Cp\u003EIn-game RemoteTech Assist calculator: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/95072\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/95072\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVisual RemoteTech Planner (web site): \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ryohpops.github.io/kspRemoteTechPlanner/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ryohpops.github.io/kspRemoteTechPlanner/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is close to what I was looking for.

(I was thinking of doing a dV calc as well in the spreadsheet.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, there are other features I intended to add if I did develop this further:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Comparing the orbital altitude to both atmosphere alt (if applicable) and S.O.I. radius and warn if the resultant orbit crosses either one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-dV costs from (circular) parking orbit to target (circular) orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd a couple of other checks I can\u0027t recall right now...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Stone Blue: For a multi-launch constellation (especially equatorial), you get the second (and later) satellite(s) into a lower parking orbit, preferably at the same altitude as the periapsis of the spacing orbit you need. From there, set up an intercept with the first satellite. Do the first burn. For the second burn, wait another orbit, then burn. You should now have the second correctly spaced from the first. Actual example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin Geostationary orbit is 6 hours @ ~2,868,751 meters altitude. A 4-hour spacing orbit needs a periapsis of ~1,225,554 meters.

Comsat 2 is now 2-hours (120 degrees) AHEAD of the first sat. The third sat does the same thing, but using Comsat 2 as the target. (You can use Comsat 1, but you\u0027d have to wait 2 orbits...) In theory for Comsat 3 you could do a 2 hour transfer orbit... But the periapsis for a KEO-based spacing orbit is under Kerbins surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if MechJeb had a \u0022Match target orbit and offset\u0022 function...

Seeing as all the satellites are at the same altitude we can infer that this is an isosceles triangle and the two angles are equal therefore the corresponding angle to our side must be 30deg (half of 60deg). So our satellite spacing, the side of the triangle opposite 120deg, can be found using: Spacing = (3100/sin(30))*(sin(120))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis can be simplified for all 3 satellite constellations, with the a circular orbit and equal inclination, to: Spacing/sin(120) = (Altitude \u002B 600km)/sin(30) (rearrange as required)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 4 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 Spacing/1 = (Altitude \u002B 600km)/sin(40) (sin(90) = 1)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 5 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 Spacing/sin(72) = (Altitude \u002B 600km)/sin(54)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 6 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022 Spacing = Altitude \u002B 600km (all the triangles here are equilateral with sides of the same length so the sin maths is not needed)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
