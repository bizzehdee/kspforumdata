But in reality, it probably wouldn\u0027t actually work that way. The A/W Drive directly affects the curvature and distribution of space in a local area. It\u0027s not simply about adjusting the effective mass of the vessel. Neutralizing the mass of the vessel as you suggest would require even more tight localization of the effect, meaning there would likely be catastrophic effects if even a microparticle were to cross that threshold. And it wouldn\u0027t really neutralize the mass of the vessel anyway, it would merely counteract the distorting effect any matter has on the curvature of space.\u003Cp\u003EA more practical adaptation might be to say that the same exotic matter might be utilized by a different type of device targeting the Higgs Field instead, directly impacting the vessel\u0027s effective mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless, the primary reason for restricting the scope of that effect, rather than just letting the device completely neutralize it, is power. Odds are, such a device might work, but require as much or more power than the A/W Drive itself. Neutralization would require more than just the power to directly offset the vessel\u0027s mass. Like turning west instead of east when launching, you\u0027d have to double up to actually fully cancel it out. No, I have no scientific basis for that, because obviously no one can study it yet. Call me a visionary...it makes sense when put in with the rest of the workings of the universe. I could be hopelessly wrong though...c\u0027est la vie.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, 1/2 mass-capable drives of that type would take as much power as an A/W drive for a vessel of similar original mass capable of effectively hitting exactly lightspeed. Perfectly reasonable limitation on their capabilities, and prevents game-breaking. The only other option would be to write the device off entirely and never include it. Then again, I highly doubt by now that Fractal\u0027s even really thinking about it, anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EErr...

To elaborate: If the exotic matter is negative mass (and it is, in the context of an Alcubierre drive) we don\u0027t need any sort of fancy device to lower a ship\u0027s effective mass with it. All you\u0027d really need is a fuel tank full of the stuff. Dry weight, low positive value, full weight, large negative value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course then we get the potential problem of people building negative-mass ships and I kind of suspect that Kerbal would not react well to ships that weigh less than nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T17:17:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf we ever get realistic g-forces in game, exotic matter could act like inertial damper (yes, it is proper term - not the dampener). F.E: Your gargantuic spaceship is capable of 20 g. acceleration, but stress on the structure rips it apart well before reaching maximal acceleration. Add some exotic matter to the mix, and now your ship suffers only equivalent of 2 g\u0027s. Make it sufficiently resource-hungry, and the ship will be able to mitigate the overload only for a minute or two. Enough to get through the worst part, but too short and expensive to abuse.
