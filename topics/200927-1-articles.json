The audio from \u0022Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\u0022 that you\u0027re hearing now is from the end, when Sky Captain and Polly managed to release\u00A0the Ark\u0027s animal cargo in floating escape pods and then paralyzing the Ark\u0027s computer in mid-flight, preventing the second-stage booster engines from igniting, therfore rupturing the fuel lines,\u00A0\u00A0the fire resulting from this igniting the second stage (presumably at cookoff point)\u00A0and destroying the Ark.\u00A0 Yep. This is where the similiarites meet.
