I\u0027m waiting for the next transfer window for a mission to Sarvin. Do you have a list of Delta-V requirements to get to each planet or moon? I also want to try making a Delta-V map from it, if you have the numbers.\n\nThank you! Well, I don\u0027t have a DeltaV map for it, but you can get the orbital numbers from the \u0022Orbit\u0022 field from any body .cfg. Just dig trough the .cfgs and you\u0027ll find the necesary orbital paramiters included in them. Use notepad or notepad\u002B\u002B.
