You could try out the sample vessle or look at the galleries from the OP. They can show how to deploy a base ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022:wink:\u0022) \n\n2. The symmetry is an old enemy of me ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022:wink:\u0022) And this seems to unfortunately be an error/feature of KPS itself. For surface attachment this should work, but when the leg snaps to a node then symmetry is turned off. I think KSP does not support symmetrical attachment for nodes.. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif \u0022:(\u0022)\n\n3. Windows on the tubes may be a good idea bit i\u0027m afraid that won\u0027t be possible with the way a contruct the tubes currently. But i will have a look at it.\n\n[@Spheniscine](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125755-spheniscine/) I have been able to reproduce the bug with the not extracting vessels you have mentioned. I will take care of that bug in the update. I also have searched the contract system to find a way to update the contracts when deploying. There is a method called Update() for a contract. I just have to find out how to use the API to get the active contracts...\n\n###"},{"CreatedByName":"Vladthemad","CreatedById":100533,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-22T17:53:58Z","Content":"Not sure if anyone else brought this up yet, but in the USI life support support parts, it looks like there\u0027s a mixup in the resources.The greenhouse turns Mulch, Fertilizer, and Electric Charge into Supplies, which makes sense.
