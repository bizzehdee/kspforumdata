Anytime there is a new release you must do this or you will have problems. Slowly start adding you\u0027re old saved games back in when you see others posting that the new version does not break the old saves. Finally, start replacing mods when the mod authors post on their respective forum threads that the mod has been updated to be compatible with the current version.
