Your wheels, as they touch the ground, generate drag. If you have too much drag in the front, and not enough in the back, your craft will veer (almost always to the left because reasons). The devs gave you access to the friction controls on the wheels for this reason. Each wheel that touches the ground forms a lever arm -- the drag on that wheel creates a torque around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E. So one quick and easy fix is to set the friction on the front wheel to .4 or less. Many people put their rear wheels almost at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, and this reduces any effect of changing the friction of those wheels -- but you can try increasing the friction there and see if it also helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeyond that, yes, all sorts of low-tech \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E spaceplanes can be built.
