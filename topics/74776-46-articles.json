No I don\u0027t like the restrictions that the upgradeable buildings present, especially at the current upgrade costs. Major nerf isn\u0027t my idea of fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT - v0.41 of the All of It In 1 is now available on KerbalStuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMakes for the decision to either have upgradable buildings or have additional launch sites be the upgrade. Personally I\u0027d rather have the ability to get to the flyover contracts without having to fly for 45 minutes to get around the globe. Also, as a neat side effect, KK fixes the issue where x64 isn\u0027t playable in career mode. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Volt","CreatedById":4686,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T14:49:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AlphaAsh\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AlphaAsh\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAre you using FAR?

I first re-encountered the bug in this version when launching my twin-engine delta VTOL from the helipad at Blue Bay (\u0026lt;100m ASL, right?). Again, it\u0027s the same quirk, with any elevator movement (in this case of the all-moving T tail) resulting in a constant roll, to the right when pitching up and left when pitching down. The reduction of lift I first observed at Kerman Lake, so it\u0027s likely that the altitude is high enough to affect launches, especially with my replica MiG-21. So maybe it is \u003Cem\u003Ejust\u003C/em\u003E the rolling. I\u0027ve tested the Valkyrie (the VTOL) at high altitudes when launched from KSC and it flies with much more stability.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DLWhittet","CreatedById":112570,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T16:04:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AlphaAsh\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AlphaAsh\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease note that whilst KK is now working it has a new bug to contend with - when starting a \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Enew\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E career game, all KSC buildings are maxed at tier 3 already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan confirm that\u0027s it\u0027s only new games.

I play extensively with Kerbal Construction Time and Stage Recovery (well, not now, no update yet) and I\u0027d like to see some clever integration with that. What I mean is, in the long term, not sure if this is possible I\u0027d like to see something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Each site has a base cost for opening (appearing on the map). Recovering outside the range of these bases should COST money. A small interface to allow you to recover just crew and science and destroy the vessel (again, at small cost) would help. However, this merely allows you to use the basic non upgraded site. At each launch you still have to pay extra for the transport, and loose more time in KCT. Worse, you are limited as to how much mass you can actually move to a site and the refunds for landing near get diminishing returns. \u0022Recover Vessel\u0022 still means shifting the thing back to KSC and that costs money. Planes have the alternative to be left at the alternate sites until needed again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Now for upgrades:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Fuel depot. Ignores the fuel mass during transport and gives money back for the fuel remaining at the end of a mission if landed near.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Hangar. Allow you to Refuel, reservice (reset failure times for Dang it) and recrew any aircraft landed or left near the airport. Not sure if possible to STORE the craft \u0022in the hangar\u0022, that seems difficult, but you can always just park your craft and recover the crew only. Although will need a very small \u0022bus\u0022 to be able to launch crew at that site (nice as it also simulates crew transport costs to the site). Will need an interface to recover science back to KSC tho. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Data Link. Allows a link between the site and KSC. Signal travel time still applies. Quite expensive might I add. Alternatively, build a sort of network, only allowing you to connect to nearby sites (so that you don\u0027t just buy the one site at the other end of the planet).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Mega Antenna Array. Since some arrays already are implemented, a humongous range that covers the entire Kerbol System would be fun, but veeeeeery expensive. Maybe just one for the entire planet. This would be able to create a link to any antenna, but at cost, so that you can unfold that forgotten solar panel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Basic Assembly. Greatly reduces costs of launching at the site, as it mimics breaking the rocket into parts for transport and reassembly on site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Full blown mega launch site. Works normally, as an extension to KSC. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S yes, I am a masochist.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-18T10:13:24Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2014 10:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by karamazovnew\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlphaAsh","CreatedById":105348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T07:40:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022karamazovnew\u0022 data-cite=\u0022karamazovnew\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E3.
