How are you launching these days? I know it took me a while before I got the hang of the new atmospheric modeling. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor my part, once I launch I immediately start a very slight gravity turn, tapping to the side just enough get the prograde vector to incline a few degrees. Then I set the SAS to point straight prograde. After that, the rocket (assuming it is well balanced) should turn itself into a full gravity turns with a nice, gradual incline. When I start to see a shockwave of air start forming over the bow of the rocket, I throttle down; no sense fighting atmospheric friction. When the inclination of the prograde vector gets to about 45 degrees from the vertical, I switch the SAS back from prograde-fixed to general stability support and let it power up at that fixed angle. Then I watch the map, and wait until the apex of the trajectory is above fifty kilometers above the surface, then incline my rocket perpendicular to the surface and continue to thrust that way. It builds horizontal velocity and continues to raise the apex until it is at above seventy kilometers. Then cut the engines, drop a maneuver node at the apex, and wait to do a prograde burn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsually I have maybe a twenty to forty second burn, depending on my thrust-to-weight ratio.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-16T18:41:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe rate at which you can pitch-over through the gravity turn is fairly constant (bear with me) and so is the dV needed to get to orbit. Your ascent path is therefore primarily dictated by a vehicle\u0027s TWR:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. With low TWR (1.1 - 1.3, say) you climb relatively slowly, can be pitched-over almost to the horizon quite low and will put a lot of thrust into building horizontal speed at the same time as building Ap. By the time you, eventually, get to Ap this leaves little extra speed required for circularistation, and a short burn. The trick is, of course, not to get too horizontal too soon and waste too much time in thick, draggy atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. With hight TWR (1.8\u002B) you will climb quickly, with little time to pitch-over without flipping completely.
