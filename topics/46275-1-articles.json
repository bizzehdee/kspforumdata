It isn\u0027t just the angry posts, although that\u0027s part of it. What\u0027s most annoying is the notion presumed by many that gender is meaningless or unimportant to discussions of the Kerbal characters and their species.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI patiently await comments to the effect of \u0022here we go,\u0022 but I believe I have something different to offer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, to be sure: whether genders are added or not, one should keep in mind that the clothes we generally consider \u0022gendered\u0022 are not necessarily going to be as much in the eyes of an alien speices.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, in relating KSP to a wider human audience (including women who most certainly play this game and roam these forums) it would go a long way toward demonstrating that this game is not meant to be a \u0022boy\u0027s club\u0022 to do more than simply plug one\u0027s ears and pretend that because the game doesn\u0027t make explicit reference to Kerbal gender they are not, in fact, gendered. Gender, whether it is absent or present, is significant: it makes up part of the atmosphere of the game, which is at least as crucial to one\u0027s enjoyment of the game as the mechanics and story themselfes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make an analogy, a minimalistic graphics set like the Code Page 437 employed by Dwarf Fortress and various other roguelikes contribute to the atmosphere of the game; that you have to translate text into visual objects in your head makes the game a fundamentally different experience from a game with 3D graphics, just as much as the visual polish we\u0027ve seen in KSP of late has changed it from the releases of old. The praise heaped upon Nova and Claira as well as B9 for their contributions to the \u0022Kerbal aesthetic\u0022 or at least continuations of it are certainly a testament to its effect upon peoples\u0027 time with the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo gender is certainly a matter, and if the consistent recurrance of these threads and the often hostile-approaching-violent reactions at least some espouse in them are any indication, it is a matter certainly worth addressing. And I think it is undeniable that the broad majority of KSP players identify them as male, or at least with masculine descriptors, which really isn\u0027t very different in the the long view. Either way you cut it, excluding female bodies and feminine aesthetics and pronouns undermines the importance of the \u0022female\u0022 while bolstering the male: contrary to popular belief, the pronoun \u0022he\u0022 nor the concept of man are not, nor have they ever been, genderless, if only for the fact that few seem so eager to use \u0022she\u0022 or women as genderless constructs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis of course does not apply if you are as willing to address Kerbals as female as you are to address them as male, but is that really the case? That is not an accusation, nor is it an order; it is just a question. If you do indeed wish to address Kerbals with impartiality to either gender, then it is necessary to be at least willing to speak of them in feminine terms as much as masculine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I don\u0027t mind if Kerbals have an explicit gender or not. However, I feel it is definitely necessary, if this game wishes to purport itself as more than a boy\u0027s club, for female bodies as well as what society tends to consider feminine aesthetics to be implemented in KSP. That doesn\u0027t equate to Hartman hips and lipstick babes, for those concerned. And whatever happens, players should at least own up to the fact that gender plays a role in this game. Even if you earnestly consider them genderless (I do) it does not mean that the issue is \u0022meaningless\u0022 when discussing them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-18T02:36:29Z\u0022 title=\u002209/18/2013 02:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Accelerando\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-18T02:59:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for this post.

To be able to send up females in the shuttle or ISS actually involves engineering in getting the vehicle be able to support both gender. Since KSP is meant to be an analogy of Earth\u0027s space programs this issue should be actually a factor in the game. There\u0027s plenty of ways we could do this. For example maybe you had to do research (via normal method or say to send up a special one off capsule) to unlock \u0022gender neutral\u0022 capability for your capsules, and only then will you be able to hire female kerbonauts.
