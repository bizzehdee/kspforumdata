The jets should push on something with their exhaust but should themselves be fixed relative to the aircraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany aero, thermal, structural, and collision changes, as well as the Breaking Ground DLC, have come out since the turboshaft era. So your old designs if you have them are probably either suboptimal or totally nonfunctional. However, new parts like the flags allow for some pretty intense thermal abuse compared to most \u0022back in the day\u0022 parts. Can you make use of the current mechanics to build as fast a turboshaft plane as possible?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpeeds should be in level flight at any altitude, with no cheats. Propellors may use regular aero surfaces or BG prop/fan/helicopter blades, but not both, as doing so would allow for free energy turbines. Please don\u0027t use high powered motors or reaction wheels in your engines. A small one for starting it if needed is fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso feel free to share any turboshaft craft in 1.10 here, even if the speed is lackluster, or heck, even if it can\u0027t get off the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-10-16T02:43:48Z\u0022 title=\u002210/16/2020 02:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 16, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Pds314\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pds314","CreatedById":70014,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-16T03:21:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlright hmm I\u0027ve discovered something wierd.
