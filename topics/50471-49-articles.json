I don\u0027t use RemoteTech with light lag because it doesn\u0027t have enough automation tools, so it would be impossible to do things which could actually be done by real-life probes (like autonomous rendezvous and docking). I tested the DRE shields before the mission, and they seemed to reach their limit in both temperature and g-force at around 14km/s entry speed into Earth\u0027s atmosphere, which I think is somewhat realistic? Although something like the Galileo probe would be impossible to make. And putting together multiple heat shields didn\u0027t make much difference because once the first one broke the next one would follow in a few seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"metaphor","CreatedById":57640,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-10T04:08:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s another delta-v map of the solar system with a little more info (click to zoom in):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WGOy3qT.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WGOy3qT.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WGOy3qT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-10T04:57:03Z\u0022 title=\u002212/10/2013 04:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 10, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by metaphor\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-10T04:47:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022metaphor\u0022 data-cite=\u0022metaphor\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHere\u0027s another delta-v map of the solar system with a little more info (click to zoom in):\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WGOy3qT.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WGOy3qT.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WGOy3qT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe image isnt displaying properly...
