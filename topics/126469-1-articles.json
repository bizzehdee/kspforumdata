The main reason why I keep this is because it has this planet mod (Krag\u0027s Planet Factory) which has a bunch of cool planets which I never got around to going to, but the mod is not compatible with later versions. However this ended up being the save where I do most of my \u0027proper\u0027 missions in sandbox mode, mostly so that I won\u0027t get interrupted with updates. So I decided to do an Eve return mission, since I have never done it. Here we go:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe hardest part by far was designing the lander. Surprisingly, achieving the required Dv was not hard at all (although looking back, it could have been much more efficient. This design could achieve orbit from around 2000m from sea level on Eve), but making it able to sit on the ground on Eve without disintegrating was very challenging. Also finding the right amount of parachutes so that it would slow it down enough, and at the same time not break it apart. The final contraption weighed in at around 900 tonnes and 800 parts, including the largest fuel tank I ever made (using procedural tanks mod). Other mods I used were B9 for a bunch of lights and a few reaction wheels (nothing important at all), and KW rocketry for a few fuel tanks and 1 engine. MechJeb was necessary to control this 800 part monstrosity efficiently, due to lag.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere is the first image:\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis was before some minor tweaks such as the changing of the landing gear, as this one resulted in the whole ship vibrating after landing and exploding (as I discovered after a bunch of hyperedit tests on Eve), and adding drogue chutes. Anyway, as you can see, each stage has a TWR of exactly 1 on Eve, (1.7 on Kerbin), except the last stage, as this was before I added two of the tiny radial Rockomax engines (28-R?). Here\u0027s a breakdown of each stage (bottom to top):\u003Cbr\u003E\n1: Powered by 10 Mainsails, this is the stage that lifts the whole things up to around 7000m. The huge fuel tank holds about 40,000 units of liquid fuel. All those huge conical fuel tanks are made with the procedural tanks mod. I realised after building it that it sort of resembled a short and fat N1:D.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2: This stage is powered by 16 aerospikes, lifts it out of the thick atmosphere.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3: This is the crucial stage, powered by 8 aerospikes, gets it up nearly out of the atmosphere, and gets it up to about half orbital velocity.\u003Cbr\u003E\n4: This stage completes the orbital insertion, and is powered by an engine in the KW pack, called the Atlas Low Profile engine, which is designed for landers and is very flat. It has 120kN thrust and ISP of around 390, so nothing special.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fDTYV7m.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fDTYV7m.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nLaunching this thing to space intact was quite challenging, but my 1000 tonne lifter did the job (after a few tries due to unplanned disintegration). This thing had more than 1200 parts, so the lag made mechjeb autopilot necessary:\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe first stage of the lifter is powered only by those 4 SRBs, which are built using the procedural tanks mod again, each produces a thrust of around 25,000kN! (Ok, this part might be somewhat cheaty... the mod lets you scale SRBs to whatever size, readjusting the thrust.) The fuel tanks you see underneath are 5m KW tanks, and each of those engine clusters produces 11,000kN of thrust. The whole thing weighs about 3000-4000 tonnes on launch. As you can see I added 2 radial Skipper engines on the lander to aid with the landing.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDropping the massive SRBs (You might be wondering why there are no flames coming out of the engine. I think it\u0027s a glitch with KW on my save as most of their large engines do that, but they work normally.):\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u00229QemHbR.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9QemHbR.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSeparation of next stage:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u00220F7oobI.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0F7oobI.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd the next stage:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022HxE49NH.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HxE49NH.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd the stage after that\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022G2xV4Fn.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/G2xV4Fn.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nCircularising:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022pfMZQTs.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pfMZQTs.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo get this lander to Eve, an equally large transfer stage had to be sent up using the same lifter, and docking these two behemoths was quite challenging, requiring over 7000 units of monopropellant from the \u0027tug\u0027 (unfortunately forgot to take pictures of the launch and docking, but it was very tedious, at least they used a 3.75m docking port which was part of KW), which also weighed about 1000 tonnes, and was built using 5 KW 3.75m tanks, and powered by 16 LV-Ns and 1 KW rocketry 3.75m engine that has the same thrust as a Mainsail with similar ISP (used as a boost during the Kerbin escape burn). By the way, this mission also includes a rover and a bunch of scout probes to find the best landing site, which were sent to Eve using a much smaller ship, which you\u0027ll see later as I forgot to take pictures of it departing Kerbin. But it is a KW 2m tank powered by 6 LV-Ns basically (this is used to return the capsule back to Kerbin). Anyway, quite a lot of real life time passed between this picture and the next, as I had taken a break from KSP, by which time I had installed the Interstellar mod (this might have caused \u003Cem\u003Eslight\u003C/em\u003E unexpected problems, as you will see later), which I used to build a new Plasma Powered SSTO to bring the crew to the ship in LKO (which required 14GW of power beamed to it using reactors in orbit). The crew consists of Lodory and Edvis Kerman, veterans of my Dres mission, and first Kerbals to Dres (and anywhere beyond Duna). There is no way I would have launched the crew on \u003Cem\u003Ethat \u003C/em\u003Elifter:D:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022xHU3zRZ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xHU3zRZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn atmosphere it uses Monopropellant, giving it an ISP of around 2700s (comparable to jet engines) and a thrust of around 475kN.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bC0Be0b.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bC0Be0b.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn space, it uses Vacuum Plasma mode, which means it uses no fuel whatsoever, albeit with a penalty in thrust, which decreases to around 200kN (here approaching the \u0027KSS Mercury\u0027, as I called the lander):\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022W9yqD1h.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/W9yqD1h.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter a game crash, finally reached the KSS Mercury, interplanetary tug already docked:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022FpFD2ew.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FpFD2ew.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTransfer burn:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u00227ZOUwW0.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7ZOUwW0.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe transfer stage had around 2500m/s of Dv, more than enough to get to Eve.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022k1rW0ZR.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/k1rW0ZR.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPlane change in Solar orbit:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022OyOQ9tx.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OyOQ9tx.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks to a low energy transfer, only minimal aerobraking was required to capture, ensuring the ship didn\u0027t disintegrate...

Well, it adds a waste heat mechanic, which means that the closer the solar panels are to the sun, the more heat they produce, which has to be dissipated with radiators, which the ship doesn\u0027t have, or else everything shuts down.
