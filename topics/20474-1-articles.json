When I take that .dae file and wash it through Unity and the .16 KSP tools I get a part that is 80% smaller than the original.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is not a problem with the importing of .dae into Unity as, according to Unity\u0027s coordinate system, my part is the size I would expect it to be (1.75m diameter cylinder). I tested that by creating a copy of my part and moving it 1.75m to the side. The result was the two copies were touching perfectly side-by-side which wouldn\u0027t happen if the parts weren\u0027t 1.75m in diameter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo this leads me to believe that the scaling down occurs some time between Unity and KSP. It is not the fault of the config file since I confirmed that the \u0022rescale factor\u0022 is set to 1. When I set the rescale factor to 1.25 my parts scale up to their proper size (confirmed by stacking a dae version on top of a .mu version in KSP). Is there a setting in the part tools that I have overlooked that causes the scaling during the write process? Maybe I misunderstand what the \u0022rescale factor\u0022 is actually supposed to do?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance for any insight!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cykyrios","CreatedById":17639,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-26T16:33:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Absolution\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Absolution\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI get a part that is 80% smaller than the original.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIsn\u0027t it rather 80% of the original size?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I had played around with this a month or so ago, and yes, parts are slightly smaller than what they should be, using a rescaleFactor of 1. For some reason, the default rescaleFactor is 1.25, and is used when you don\u0027t force another one. Which means that, actually, everything in KSP is scaled 125%, and when you use a rescaleFactor of 1, you get your part as it \u0022should\u0022 be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would advise that you do not write the rescaleFactor, so you don\u0027t get a headache trying to make things fit together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, whenever you want to rescale something, you will have to take that into account.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Absolution","CreatedById":4156,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-26T23:15:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEasy solution then but I worry about texture quality.
