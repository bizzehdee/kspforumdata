Maybe is - I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ve the idea I\u0027m a much less then a beginner modder myself.\n\nBest regards\n\nPierre"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T15:25:45Z","Content":"[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/89920](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/89920)"},{"CreatedByName":"Pibue","CreatedById":147962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T19:11:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E To make it a bit tougher (and may be for the Squad-Dev-Section) it would be nice if this would be implementet in the standard KSP-Listing instead of an extra button access-menue.\n\nI take it back, this extra button, accessable at many sites is superb!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/89920](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/89920)\n\nThanks for the hint, exactly (and even more) what I searched for."}]}
