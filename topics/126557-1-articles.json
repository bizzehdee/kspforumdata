A hypothetical being that is not \u0027pushed\u0027 along the timeline the way we perceive ourselves to be, being free to move in that dimension back and forth as they please, could have a very hard time even understanding what we\u0027re talking about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnaffected by the arrow of time, time perhaps just being simply one more coordinate in the system, spacetime might be perceived like a \u0027solid\u0027 block, in which nothing \u0027moves\u0027 but simply \u0027exists\u0027 at a set of coordinates (x,y,z,t). There is no separate past, present, or future, all physical things are 4-dimensional \u0027blobs\u0027 that contain all moments in their lifetime, existing... I was gonna say \u0027simultaneosly\u0027, but let\u0027s say, \u0027in the same block\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven slicing up the block to examine it in detail, why would such beings even consider that 3D \u0027moment-things\u0027 contained in any one place of that block feel like they are forcibly \u0027moving\u0027 in one of those coordinates? To them, all things are unmoving. Even more wildly for them to understand: that that movement is perceived by moment-things to be at a \u003Cstrong\u003Eforced\u003C/strong\u003E synchronous rate in just one of the four dimensions along with every other moment-thing in the slice? Instead of specs we may all look more like spaghetti to them, composed of tightly-packed \u0027moment-cells\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure, they would \u0027see\u0027 that everything has a \u0027timeness\u0027, akin to what we call length, width, or thickness, but why would one of the four axes have any special meaning? Think of it as 3D objects to us: they are actually a very densely packed set of 2D \u0027sheet-things\u0027, each of which are located at a specific (and unmoving relative to each other, if integrity is to be kept) coordinate along the 3D body. Imagine a sheet-thing trying to tell us that they actually perceive life and space as evolving from the soles of our feet to the top of our heads, moving at a fixed pace, like browsing through MRI printouts of us. And that to them, their \u0027start\u0027 is actually not the soles of the feet or top of the head as we assumed, but some point at the front left shoulder, progressing towards their \u0027end\u0027 at what to us may look like an arbitrary angle through the 3D body.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA little more in the realm of what KSP players see every time they play the game: not being locked into one moment in time or forced to move along the timeline, they \u0027see\u0027 a 3D spacecraft in orbit as a donut shaped as the trajectory, much like a more solid orbit line like the program draws for us on screen (except... I guess it might be more like a helix, depending at what \u0027angle\u0027 the time axis is set to the others). To affect the craft at any moment in that orbit, they would simply reach \u0027straight\u0027 for that particular section of the solid spaghetti-craft, as simply as us clicking on an arbitrary point along the orbit line to place a maneuver node on one specific moment of the orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDue to their freedom to move along t at their chosen \u0027speed\u0027... think of KSP time warp, but additionally also \u0027backwards\u0027: how would we explain that a second is always a specific length along that axis?
