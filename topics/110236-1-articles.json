Most direct route should be pretty obvious (i.e. shortest time) and doesnt need a GUI. The idea is to give the player a rough idea of when to depart with Hohmann transfer. Obviously, it might be fine to depart a bit early or late since extra dV cost might be affordable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess I used API wrong. By API, i meant built in KSP GUI, rather than a plugin GUI (i.e. windows form). In other words, it should show up on screen, like what atmospheric trajectories does, rather than numerically in a windows form.

For instance, if you are orbiting Kerbin and you zoom out to see the whole system, your orbital trajectory around the Sun (Kerbol) should be shown. If you could place maneuver nodes around this trajectory, optimum launch window would be as easy to find as finding transfer windows for Mun and Minmus from LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T06:11:35Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 06:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by arkie87\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
