On most fighters they deploy directly upward or downward as this puts the flare on the same plane of motion as the engine when the aircraft is turning away from a missile. Angel wings is simply an effect of cargo planes that can\u0027t really maneuver out of the way and need to deploy flares everywhere at once.\n\n-Remember to test maneuverability for each design at 100% and 10-40% fuel. Aircraft that haul a lot of internal fuel (real life Su-27) are often only really supposed to enter dogfights with 40-60% fuel, range and time on-station is a big deal for air superiority aircraft, unlike short range interceptors.\n\n-Why are ram air intakes \u002B8? It\u0027s KSP, as long as it can maintain 100% thrust through desired flight envelopes without running out of air who cares what intakes you use. That goes under appearance otherwise. KSP ram air intakes aren\u0027t particularly realistic for jet engines due to not having any visible inlet ramps. If you want to award points for realism, the shock cone intake would be the most logical for mach 3\u002B fighters. While the classic round intake would be superior for aircraft that never go supersonic.\n\n-All jet engines in KSP have thrust vectoring."},{"CreatedByName":"TMasterson5","CreatedById":144591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T13:59:13Z","Content":"I like the way angel wings look though and seeing as the flares in KSP don\u0027t function like normal flares anyways it doesn\u0027t matter much where they are placed in the game sadly.\n\nAnd I did think of that. I flew them until they were at 50% and then repeated the tests. That is factored in to the existing categories. \n\nAs with ram intakes, I like the way they look and if the plane can maintain air intake through all speeds I did award them the points for having ram intakes anyways for fairness. And the circular nose intake doesn\u0027t look good for a modern fighter at all.\n\nI meant the actual thrust vectoring modules that are a part of QuizTech aero pack"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T14:21:44Z","Content":"I am not sure if I posted the version with its weapons on it or the \u0022clean\u0022 version with just the gun.

The UKSAF passed on that the pilots and flight engineers, navigators, and weapons officers all had a blast flying these planes and had many very close dogfighting contests with them. They actually arrested one crew that was trying to get in extra flight time by sneaking into the hanger in the middle of the night. The UKSAF has pardoned the crew because, \u0022Well, the planes are pretty awesome!\u0022\n\nThe UKSAF has announced their decision in the F10 procurement competition. They said that all of the designs were superb but some stuck out more than others by small margins and those are the finalists. They ended up choosing four finalists instead of three due to how close this contest is. The finalists are as follows:\n\n-KFS-41-D by Nestor\\_D\n\n-F-85 Lancer-CptNinja\n\n-FX3-D by Maverick221\n\n-Mk-2 by DMAN979\n\nThe very close runners up are:\n\n-S-32B by Steamtex\n\n-Vampire by Mad Rocket Scientist\n\nFinalists you now have until 2359 Easter Standard Time on May 28th to fine tune your designs and make any changes you feel are necessary(the list of things that the UKSAF pilots and engineers pointed out is below.) Remember, the aircraft you submit for the finals MUST resemble the original design. This period is for final tweaks only. you may switch out small parts or even large parts if they keep the appearance of the plane the same. You may also add any new features that you wish to. You must re comment on this thread with your final design by 2359 EST on May 28th to be considered. Good luck to all of you!\n\nTo the finalists a huge congratulations for making it into the finals. For the runners up you guys should also be very proud. This was seriously a very tough decision to make on how to order the six of you and it took me a long time to figure it out. So thank you for all of your contributions. Below is the full list of aircraft and what I felt are their downsides.\n\nKFS41BD-Add countermeasures, your front canards dont move, they are impacting the wing and being prevented from moving, replace stock hardpoints with BD Armory adjustable missile rails, try to get an AMRAAM inside that weapons bay, and the vertical fins on the wings that are used for Yaw look kind of weird. Keep the planes speed though, the thing is stupid fast and handles well.\n\nF85 Lancer-Fix your center of mass and center of lift, the jet wants to do a backflip on takeoff and set up the control surface functions, also consider switching out that middle fuel tank for a storage area and try to make an internal weapons storage bay. See the other finalists designs for what I am talking about. it will save you weight and decrease drag and it looks cooler.\n\nFX3D-Really nothing, your plane is good, fast and handles well. youre using Mk1 parts so dont worry about internal weapons bay unless you can get really creative with it and still keep the same general appearence. If you think you can though then go for it! The only other thing is that you need to add some struts to it to increase its strength, it tends to wobble at high speed and during high speed turns.\n\nMk2-Try to do more with the internal weapons bay, try adding more space for weapons and other stuff in there.You need to figure out a way to mount an external fuel tank(decouplers) to the aircraft. Also it is slightly slow to turn so try to add some more control surface area.\n\nS32B- Fine tune your handling and put an external fuel tank on it. Also Im not a huge fan of forward canards but if you like them then thats your thing keep them.\n\nVampire-Your engines hit the ground during sharp takeoff. Move your wheels back more.\n\nF2B Talon-Add countermeasures, fix ladder(it is deployed and unselectable), your engines hit the ground on sharp takeoff so move your wheels back, and the plane gets starved for air at high altitude\n\nXF10 Sparkle-I couldn\u0027t get over the body surrounding wings, and the jet itself is very large for a fighter.\n\nWasp MK II-It is too big to be a fighter and not fast enough of maneuverable enough. Also I didnt like the way it looked.\n\nF119 Akula-I didnt like the way it looked, I dont like nose intakes sorry, a rapier engine is really practical as this is only for low atmospheric flight, engine hits ground on sharp takeoff, and it tends to pitch nose downward slowly during flight.\n\nFFX1-Wing landing gear increase drag and I dont like the way it looks. Put it on the body and offset it so that the airflow doesnt hit it while it is retracted. Also your engine hit gournd on the unimproved surface and almost hit on the regular runway and carrier.\n\nKX10-I dont like the way it looked, it didnt resemble a fighter aircraft that much. Also once your fuel starts to drain it throws off your center of mass and center of lift.\n\nAgain a huge thank you to all that participated, you are the ones that have made this competition a success and I hope that all of you will participate in future contests as well for the UKSAF.(the current fighter bomber is getting quite old, hint hint)"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T21:47:41Z","Content":"Hm.

Angel wings is simply an effect of cargo planes that can\u0027t really maneuver out of the way and need to deploy flares everywhere at once.\n\nNot exactly correct, but pretty close. The DDS in 2nd and 3rd generation fighters were typically set for low count decoy deployment because early seeker heads didn\u0027t really have much for countermeasures rejection logic, and jinking maneuvers were usually enough to put the aircraft outside the missile seeker gimbal limit.\n\nThen new missiles came along, and so 4th gen fighters introduced HOTAS which allowed for various automatic countermeasures deployment programs that could, depending on the DDS, spit out a single chaff and/or flare per second or ripple deploy (the so-called angel wings that was referenced) or anything in between depending on what the missile warning system detected and the pilot\u0027s situation.\n\nNow slow moving aircraft at low altitude (such as A-10s with DDS pods or cargo aircraft) will ripple fire chaff and flare not just to foil any missiles, but to also break radar illumination and/or mess with IR targeting systems so that enemies targeting the craft either on the ground or in the air have to spend precious seconds attempting to reacquire.\n\nCombined with evasive maneuvers the big birds \\*might\\* be able to flee the area before they\u0027re shot down (highly unlikely), but in reality it\u0027s just so they can either buy enough time for their escorts to engage enemy craft, or, more commonly, foil any surface to air attacks long enough to get out of range."}]}
