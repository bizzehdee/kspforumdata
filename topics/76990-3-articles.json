All the same, I really prefer .64 scaled models, like Bobcat\u0027s have been since he started his historical packs. I think this project lends itself to modeling it 1:1, then releasing an unscaled version for RSS and a version with all parts scaled .64 for a non-RSS game. I really don\u0027t want another pack at the standard dimensions (1.25, 2.5, 3.75 etc), unless by chance the real model scales down to be like that, because loads of those exist already, there are stockalike SLS-like mods.

It\u0027s not true even on the face of it. Modelling is equally easy as long as you stay consistent with your dimensions and clearly not doing maths is easier than doing maths. Then there\u0027s issues with scaling bugs. Clearly it\u0027s best to model 1:1 with KSP. The scaling thing in part configs is the result of bad foresight on SQUAD\u0027s part anyway, isn\u0027t it. They simply scaled things as a hack, instead of remodelling everything to the correct scale. Sure it\u0027s useful, but I think people rely on it too much when they really don\u0027t need to.\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, didn\u0027t you say something about modularity and compatibility in another thread? If they make it with real proportions it will be impossible to scale it consistently. Say they wanted to make the adapter with real dimensions. if they scale the bottom of it to a standard width, the top will not be standard any more.
