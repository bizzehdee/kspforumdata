If you slow down by burning straight down until you are descending at 5m/s, you will not have removed the horizontal velocity, so you will be travelling at 45 degrees. While you are falling quickly you can only do so much to remove your horizontal velocity. You have to wait until you are falling much slower to remove it completely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are moving horizontally, then your craft is likely to roll when it lands, even if you are moving very slowly in the vertical direction, it also complicates things if you land on a slope.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
