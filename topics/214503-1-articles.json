I would like to share a bug that I\u0027ve experienced with Kerbal Space Program 2. When trying to load the space center scene on a computer that only has integrated graphics (and no GeForce RTX or AMD Radeon graphics card), the game just crashes. I\u0027ve seen some other people (like ShadowZone in this video \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVpeUc5mIF0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVpeUc5mIF0\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0at the part where he tries running the game on a laptop that only has integrated graphics) trying to run the game who have experienced this as well. If this will help at all, these are the specs of my main laptop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProcessor: 11th Gen Intel Core i7-11390H at 3.40 GHz (8 CPUs)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMemory: 16384 MB RAM\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGraphics: Intel Iris Xe Graphics\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAvailable Virtual Memory: 8.62 GB\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also tried running the game on a different laptop with 2 graphics cards (one with integrated graphics, and the other with an AMD Radeon) and it was able to load the space center scene without the game crashing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHopefully a developer will see this and fix the bug soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tazooka","CreatedById":226666,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-05T18:46:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m guessing the game is too demanding and powerful for your PC so it just crashes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tlx","CreatedById":227396,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-06T11:31:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d guess a memory problem, I can run it on my i7 1280P with integrated graphics but it consumes around 23GB of RAM in total when running the game since the GPU also uses RAM.
