The defaults for these values are comically low. Stock 1.25m parts set them to 50, and 2.5m parts set them to 200. Parts this size should probably set them to 1000 or so...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-03T03:04:43Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2013 03:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Gaius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jfull","CreatedById":61722,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T05:40:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt turns out my Titan lander works better than expected\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/594753342792991374/7895884369188EA50786255A27546074FCE72008/\u0022 alt=\u00227895884369188EA50786255A27546074FCE72008\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again for these parts\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
