I\u0026#39;m a licensed Amateur Radio operator and I see this as sort of the same thing. On Amateur Radio, we\u0026#39;re friendly, clean, responsible, and we\u0026#39;re accountable for everything we do. We\u0026#39;re required to be licensed and we\u0026#39;ll report those who aren\u0026#39;t to the FCC. If we don\u0026#39;t follow the rules and good operating practice we can get our licenses taken away and even get a fine from the FCC. We also help out our communities in times of disaster by providing communications when internet, telephone, and cell phone networks are destroyed. Now, look at CB radio: unlicensed, filthy, usually populated by unsavory people, users often exceed the 4 (or 7, can\u0026#39;t remember) watt power limit, and there is very, very little accountability. Oftentimes the FCC will track down bad CB users with a van with radios in it that they drive around and measure the signal strength of the bad person\u0026#39;s CB transmissions. As I said, there are also no CB licenses, but I think they can still fine you. Furthermore, users of CB often have very little desire to help their communities.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;m normally not one for this kind of government control, and I\u0026#39;ve never seen a drone in real life let alone flown one, but I see this as a common sense thing. Think about it: you\u0026#39;re flying something in public that could injure someone else if piloted incorrectly. You can also be a nuisance and do things to others with them that they might not want to do (like your example of people spying on their neighbors). I think that a licensing program would not only increase the quality and responsibility of the drone community, it would also increase the quality of the drones on the market. You\u0026#39;ll have people who truly enjoy it and not those who just want a toy to fly about and perhaps hassle people with.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-24T09:58:28Z\u0022 title=\u002211/24/2015 09:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Flymetothemun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T00:14:41Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027FishInferno\u0027]But what are the minimum qualifications?

But, based on what you\u0026#39;re describing, \u0026#39;no\u0026#39;, I think it\u0026#39;s more a case of [I]you[/I] being registered as an \u0026#39;operator of\u0026#39; (or maybe perhaps your radio equipment??) and not so much the plane itself.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOh, and I saw mention of the Task Force findings/recommendations on the news for the first time tonight. The emphasis of course was regarding the timely release of these new rules and the up-coming holiday season.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-26T01:08:00Z\u0022 title=\u002211/26/2015 01:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LordFerret\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
