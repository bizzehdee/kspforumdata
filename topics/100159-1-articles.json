So far I have flown a ship to orbit, played around in sandbox a bit and the mission control center. I can place and edit maneuver, zoom in and out, pan around, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have to admit this feels pretty incredible despite its small limitations. There are a few small issues that I need to resolve....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I can fully manipulate parts within the editor, but I cannot add new parts or delete old ones. So far I can get around this by creating ships at the Desktop, saving them and then loading them with the tablet (assuming I\u0027m not home), and for not being able to delete parts I can simply remove them from the ship and leave them unattached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I have no right mouse button functionality. I can get around part of this by setting up action groups but EVAs will be an issue as I will not be able to operate some functions like planting flags and surface samples. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. There are some fuctions that so far cannot access, such as the ESC and F1 through F12 buttons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill a boatload of fun!
