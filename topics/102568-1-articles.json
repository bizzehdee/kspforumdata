You would need a SAS capable probe core to aid the mission (if you don\u0027t have a pilot available).\n\nIf the kerbal is actually a pilot and is onboard, but you are still getting this message, then you might be hitting another problem.

Almost certain this is a bug. \n\nSo I opened the same file mentioned above, go to the space center, and examine both craft in orbit.

So I think to myself, \u0027great, I am just an idiot...\u0027 I tested SAS just to make sure I wasn\u0027t crazy and sure enough, no motion. Then for some reason I decided to open and close my docking port and suddenly.... SAS!!!! What is going on? According to some comments above, that shouldn\u0027t happen. I had been flying this kerbal all over the place, even used him to land on Minimus. \n\nI would move this to the support forum, but I am not able to reproduce the issue now.
