This happened easily with the small boosters, but I was not doing this for the large boosters. Problem Solved!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe TT-38K radial decoupler worked fine when under beta (0.9), but ever since I updated to alpha (ver 1.0.2.842) I cannot attach boosters onto the decouplers. When I put the boosters on my rocket, they attach directly to the \u0022main\u0022 fuselage (directly under the command module) right in the same spot as the decouplers. Right over them, in fact; they are clipping into each other. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I try testing out the rocket (specifically, 1 RT-10 solid booster with 3 RT-10 boosters attached radially) I fire the the three outside boosters, but when I click to activate the radial decouplers, they explode normally (inside of the outside boosters) and fall off without damaging anything, but the three outside boosters remain attached to the rocket. I couldn\u0027t find any helpful fixes or documentation of this bug, so I made this new post. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe decouplers worked fine in Beta, but not in the latest update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am a beginning KSP player.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T02:01:34Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 02:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by socxc9\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFound solution\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"socxc9","CreatedById":144527,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T20:20:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/moV8Ywn\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/moV8Ywn\u003C/a\u003E the RT-10 boosters not connecting to the decouplers.
