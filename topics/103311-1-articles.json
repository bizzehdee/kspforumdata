Will convert to DDS when everything is more mature.\n- Landing gear: currently no unique landing gear for this mod. Animations are way out of my modelling capabilites (yet).\n- The original Black Sky is supposed to reach 100\u002B km, so in Kerbal terms this model is overpowered (you get up to 110km easily). Maybe I reduce the amount of fuel so the maximum height will be around 75km, just outside the atmosphere.\n\nThis is my very first mod and my very first 3D modelling and texturing attempts. The learning curve was and still is very steep, so I\u0027m happy for any suggestions and tipps how to improve. \n\nThanks a lot to all in the forum providing all those valuable hints about mod development and modelling.\n\nPlease let me know if I need to change this post in format or content. \n\nAnd of course what you think about this mod ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif).\n\n**Dependencies:** \n\n- ModuleManager by sarbian: NOT included in ZIP file.\n\n- Reflection Plugin by Starwaster: INCLUDED in ZIP file.\n\n**Installation:**\n\nThe zip file contains a \u0027GameData\u0027 and a \u0027Ships\u0027 folder.

Reduced gimballing on engine.\n\n- 0.12: added bumped texture to the fuel tank to represent the ribbings of the original design\n\n- 0.20: changes for KSP 1.0.2. Split wing into flat wing and winglets, added parachutes for safety.\n\n- 0.30: added a cargo bay part, and a cargo SPH craft including a sample payload.\n\n**References:**\n\n[www.wearespaceship.com](https://www.wearespaceship.com/en/)\n\nThanks to them that they let me use the design of the Black Sky.\n\n**Licenses:**\n\n- Black Sky concept and design:  \n\u00A9 we are spaceship UG: [www.wearespaceship.com](https://www.wearespaceship.com/en/)\n- Models, textures and part config files:  \nAttribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International  \n(CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-07T06:53:04Z\u0022 title=\u002207/07/2015 06:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AndyMt**\n  \nEdit: New download link for Version 0.30"},{"CreatedByName":"Deltervees","CreatedById":133567,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T15:36:53Z","Content":"Very nice!
