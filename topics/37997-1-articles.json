The 1.6 anniversary is right around now, so that gives you a clue on what it has been so far. .18 came out in very very late November, .19 came out in early march, .20 came out in late may, and .21 is right around the corner. That will give you a reasonable time scale.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jokamo","CreatedById":35121,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-21T14:08:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eok, thanks for clearing that up \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Omicron314","CreatedById":59506,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-21T15:33:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sean Mirrsen\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sean Mirrsen\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E-snip- With that in mind, the version that precedes 1.0 could be anything, 0.30 or 0.126 - development will take as long, and as many intermediate releases as needed.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope we don\u0027t get to 0.126.
