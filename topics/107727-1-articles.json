Does any part of the asteroid\u0027s orbit get near Mun\u0027s? It\u0027s also possible that the game just shows its orbit as highly elliptical when in fact the apoapsis leaves the sphere of influence.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"whiterafter","CreatedById":66064,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T20:45:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was inclined so it didn\u0027t cross the Mun\u0027s orbit.
