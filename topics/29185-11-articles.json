You get more thrust per unit of weight of propellant if you\u0027re using LH2/LOX.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trick to exploiting this, though, is to \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E do what you did. You compared two rockets with the same \u003Cem\u003Epropellant volume.\u003C/em\u003E Instead, compare rockets with the same \u003Cem\u003Epropellant mass.\u003C/em\u003E Since LH2 is so much lighter than RP1, you need a much bigger tank to carry an appropriate propellant mass. But that\u0027s okay, because that much bigger tank of LH2 will end up being \u003Cem\u003Elighter\u003C/em\u003E than the smaller tank of RP1, because you need less propellant mass if you\u0027re using LH2, because the specific impulse is higher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo really get an intuitive grasp of how liquid hydrogen works in the real world, look at things like the Space Shuttle external tank and the Delta IV common booster core.

One of the virtues of a thermal rocket is that you can use \u003Cem\u003Eanything\u003C/em\u003E as reaction mass. The chemical properties of your reaction mass don\u0027t matter, because you\u0027re not reacting them chemically. If you want, you can use \u003Cem\u003Eplain water\u003C/em\u003E as reaction mass in a thermal rocket, and get perfectly acceptable results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is very stupid, though, is pumping \u0022liquid fuel\u0022 and \u0022oxidizer\u0022 through a thermal rocket and getting an Isp in the 800s. In a thermal rocket (whether it be nuclear or any other kind) the exhaust velocity of your reaction mass goes by the square root of the exhaust\u0027s enthalpy. At NERVA temperatures and pressures, pure hydrogen has an enthalpy of nearly 40,000 kilojoules per kilogram, giving it an exhaust velocity of over 8,500 meters per second! That\u0027s where the sky-high Isps in the 800s come from. When you pump through other fluids, you get lower exhaust velocities. Pumping pure water through a NERVA-type engine, for instance, would give you an Isp in the 200s, if I remember right. Which frankly isn\u0027t that bad when you consider that you\u0027re using \u003Cem\u003Ewater.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-19T01:55:10Z\u0022 title=\u002207/19/2013 01:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainArbitrary\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greys","CreatedById":57109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-19T01:52:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022hellion13\u0022 data-cite=\u0022hellion13\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewonder how that would work?
