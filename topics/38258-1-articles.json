It hadn\u0027t even occurred to me to search out a game like this so when I happened across a Steam early access note I jumped. Having transparent updates is very nice and in addition you can roll back (read somewhere you can do this) your game version to a prior \u0022stable\u0022 or \u0022stable for you\u0022 state. Sure you could do this with some simple file copies with the store version but who doesn\u0027t like some automation now and again?
