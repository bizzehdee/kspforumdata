We have Antenna TV and Me TV available on cable, and those already meet my 60s sitcom needs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ve had Netflix for at least a decade. I\u0027d probably drop it personally, but one of the housemates is really into older minor movies mostly just available on DVD. So he gets a lot of value from it. Their original streaming service was awesome, but now due to movie studio greed they\u0027re just another HBO-type service with changing movies every month.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T01:42:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI pay for Netflix and Amazon Prime, though Amazon Prime is more for shipping than anything else.
