We have Antenna TV and Me TV available on cable, and those already meet my 60s sitcom needs.\n\nWe\u0027ve had Netflix for at least a decade. I\u0027d probably drop it personally, but one of the housemates is really into older minor movies mostly just available on DVD. So he gets a lot of value from it. Their original streaming service was awesome, but now due to movie studio greed they\u0027re just another HBO-type service with changing movies every month."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T01:42:02Z","Content":"I pay for Netflix and Amazon Prime, though Amazon Prime is more for shipping than anything else. I watch some stuff on it, sure, but primarily I watch Netflix.\n\nI won\u0027t pay for Hulu. If I wanted to pay AND see commercials I would still pay for cable TV. However I do watch several new shows (Gotham, SHIELD, and Agent Carter if you\u0027re curious) on the free Hulu and don\u0027t mind the commercials because it\u0027s free."},{"CreatedByName":"gooddog15","CreatedById":59110,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T01:57:17Z","Content":"Id go with Netflix, hands down.\n\nNo offense to Hulu users, but it sucks.\n\nWhy? Ads, being limited to 2 seasons with 4 episodes available per show, not having alot of shows, ect."}]}
