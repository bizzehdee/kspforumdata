They could be linked to Basic jets, ant from further on, the basic jet will no longer produce thrust, but it will make the propeller spin. Custom Turboprops!! Also, a lot less efficient (but free) electric motor, that could consume electricity, and power a propeller.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-01T12:02:04Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2015 12:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainTurbomuffin**"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T12:09:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Love to see scramjets.
