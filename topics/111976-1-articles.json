It takes about a second until the part has been selected and i can fir it onto my rocket. Oddly when i copy and paste it from my rocket it works just fine. my ksp takes about 2.4 GB ram so it shouldent be a problem. Additionally i dont have frame drops when flying or doing anything else. It seem strange to me that the performance drops when i select a part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a ksp restart everything works fine again, so im guessing iots some kind of Problem with objects not being destructed properly. The only mod i can imagine hooking into the part-selection is KCT.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDOes anone else have a problem like that and has figured out a solution or tracked it to a mod?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethx\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebest regards\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelsteele3","CreatedById":127113,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T18:29:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWait, so you don\u0027t have a problem anymore?
