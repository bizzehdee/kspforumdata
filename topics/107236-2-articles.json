If you went to one extreme you couldn\u0027t have a high altitude glider, at the other nothing breaks the sound barrier. One side effect is the wonkiness at landing, though in a lot of cases that is still being caused by too many wings (and thus too much lift)\n\nPerhaps more granular wing function is something to request going forward. There\u0027s a right way to do that. Do keep in mind that there going to be a limit to how much fidelity the flightsim aspects can contain before the game becomes too complex for most people (and thus should be left to a specialized mod... if only we knew someone who does that sort of thing..) and more complex wing simming might very well lie beyond that line."},{"CreatedByName":"Linear","CreatedById":26619,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T22:07:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E All my this.
