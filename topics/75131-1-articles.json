So we get on to the topic of simulation games \u0022Me\u0022 being one of the biggest fans of this niche ramble on about my favourites out of my stack of sims reaching about two metres in height \u0022bit of an over-exaggeration\u0022, so anyway thinking I know it all, my one mate says \u0022have you played Kerbals?\u0022 Thinking back I remember Seeing KSP, with its Kerbals wanting to go into space etc, but never thought much of it.I thought it might just be another \u0022Flash onliney type game\u0022 with not much content and fun for about an hour. \u0022No its actually pretty decent\u0022 he says.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh boy, yesterday I look over the game, giving it a hawk eye and thinking I\u0027ll give that a go. What an amazing breath of fresh air it is! I could see from some comments that this game is quite technical thats why I went ahead and bought it, but wow just wow. I am loving it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo theres my \u0022stumbleupon\u0022 I\u0027m not really into space and NASA etc. but if there is one thing that is slowly changing that its KSP! I have varied interests so I catch on pretty fast. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess im just here to introduce myself and explain that I am a happy camper, joining the KSP ranks! Hope to hear from you guys and perhaps if someone can think off the bat of some mods for a newbie, perhaps one or two to get started with? I\u0027m not into fantasy mods, strictly realism/gameplay enhancing. Sure I have searched around but I have no idea or reference as to whats good, and mods seem to be an integral structure of the KSP fanbase.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-15T17:43:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello velve and welcome to the forum.

I still have a copy of the original SimCity and up. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am also mostly a stock player. I would highly recommend playing it clean, for at least a little while before you pop any mods in there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if you are only looking to install a mod or two then here are my suggestions. They don\u0027t really effect gameplay, but they make it a little easier to design, build, fly, and run a space program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first mod I would recommend is something that displays a craft\u0027s stats. The exact one will depend on how much \u0022help\u0022 you want, but I\u0027ll list two common ones so you can decide. They list things like deltaV (a measure of how much maneuvering you can do) and thrust-to-weight ratio, among a huge list of other stats.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1A) MechJeb 2.0 - MJ for short. I use this one because I prefer the look of the interface. MJ also includes an autopilot. For this reason, some people think it\u0027s cheatery. I rarely use the autopilot, so whatever. However, I would say if you use this addon, avoid the temptation to let it do all the flying if you get stuck. Although the autopilot feature does make a nice teaching tool on occasion. It is not, however, always the best at flying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1B) Kerbal Engineer Redux (KER) - Provides just about all of the same stats as MJ, but no autopilot. If you are afraid of being tempted by MJ\u0027s autopilot, than this mod is very similar. Without the autopilot, KER carries less \u0022cheater-pants\u0022 baggage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Kerbal Alarm - This is handy because you can use it to set reminders to pay attention to specific craft. It is really helpful when running several missions at the same time. For example, if you are playing with a craft and have an interplanetary capture coming up another craft, you can use the alarm to remind you so that you don\u0027t miss your orbital capture. (Or so you don\u0027t time warp past it, which is really annoying.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose mods don\u0027t change stock in any way, except to add a couple parts for MJ and/or KER. Alarm is just a little button in the corner of the screen. I use MJ and Alarm to make design and flight management easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther common/popular mods that aren\u0027t sci-fi-esque (which I haven\u0027t used):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Ferram Aerospace Research (FAR) - overhaul of the stock aerodynamics. Forces you to create more aerodynamic rockets, aircraft, and spaceplanes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Procedural Fairings (PF) - Creates nice fairing coverings for your rockets. Pretty much necessary if you use FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Tactical Life Support (TAC LS, or just TAC) - Forces you to bring food/water/air along with for your kerbals. No more decades long orbits in just a space suit...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Kerbal Attachment System (KAS) - provides options for attaching/removing things in flight with kerbals on EVA. Also adds some parts like winches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a huge amount of mods. So what mod to use really depends on what you are interested in doing with KSP. That is why I recommend playing it without mods for a bit before you pick some. Find out what interests you. Visuals? Airplane parts? Physics improvements? There are sooooo many including clouds, cities, helicopters. It\u0027s actually sort of unbelievable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other advantage to playing stock first is that you can extend replayability for a long time by adding mods in later, after you figure out all the basics and tricks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I think this post has gotten way to long.

I fully agree with you, I am currently busy with my vanilla play-through. Since I am aiming mostly at physics mods I would not know how they influence the game unless I know how the stock game plays.
