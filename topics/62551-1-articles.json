A bit of back and forth revealed that the thread had been deleted. I found this odd as most of the forums I frequent just close threads that are getting out of hand or too contentious. Often times these closed threads can serve as useful counterexamples for proper forum etiquette.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was just wondering, what makes a thread worthy of deletion rather than merely closing it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t take this as criticism of moderation, just curiosity as to how such decisions are made. I have the utmost respect for the moderators and the difficult and often thankless job they do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realize that this post might be construed as a violation of forum rule 3.4, but in my defense I don\u0027t know who I would contact directly as I don\u0027t know which mod removed the thread.
