This is simply a lighter, easier solution to have LS and such issues to worry about and deal with in the game. It\u0027s just not as full blown realism as TAC LS is, but slightly more involved than snacks is. Roverdude went to great lengths to make his mks mod able to use either his USI LS, or TAC LS, so I don\u0027t see how that is being in competition. It\u0027s just another option, Which I think a few people asked for and he also brought up to users of his mks, which is what USI LS is really geared toward, And for the most part it could also work as a stand alone LS option if people wanted. There was some discussion and it was generally a well accepted idea. And he never intended to compete with TAC LS. It Just provides different options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re happy using TAC rock on, nothing has really changed or been subverted by this mod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm not sure what the issue is with crp though, in one sense the original crp did do a lot to clean up some of the overlap and clutter of resources, but there are a lot of modders, and quite frankly Roverdude and a couple other modders tried to set up some sort of agreement on naming and density and such of resources quite awhile ago. Several very active modders sort of just snubbed the idea. In the end crp is just an easy framework for anyone to add any resource the want. And to try to come to an agreement with as many modders as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEveryone who mods sort of has their own idea of how things should be, I mean people still argue with taraniselsu over his densities and consumption rates and how long has TAC been out? And there was a bit of a discussion by some when Roverdude initially brought up the subject of his own LS. I won\u0027t get into that whole thing again but after some discussion those for it got to a consensus of what is really happening when using a life support and all the resources,and well Roverdude ended up with this mod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t understand the whole competition thing as none of this is a competition. This is all free stuff graciously provided to the community to use. Everyone plays different. I see it in no way hurting TAC LS (and what about the fact there were like what 3-4 other LS mods before this?) and I really have to say Roverdude never tries to cause problems with other mods or anything. He simply tries to provide options to people, especially with in the framework of his own mods. The moment a conflict was brought up about is dll. Naming he immediately said he will change that to be nice and not mess with other peoples hard work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T21:10:48Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 09:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hevak\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"almagnus1","CreatedById":78068,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T19:44:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny chance of looking into USI Life Support integration with sumghai\u0027s SDHI Service Module System mod?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor reference, the SDHI Service Module System\u0027s thread is: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52362\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52362\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"skbernard","CreatedById":67569,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T20:08:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eit would be up to sumghai (or anyone else) to write a config to make it work not rover\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"almagnus1","CreatedById":78068,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T20:21:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022skbernard\u0022 data-cite=\u0022skbernard\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eit would be up to sumghai (or anyone else) to write a config to make it work not rover\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E**Posts in the other thread**\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Apollo13","CreatedById":74572,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T22:45:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cdr_Zeta\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cdr_Zeta\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThank you for the clarification; I cant use it because I use TACLIFE so in my case I see no need for another LifeSupport Module from another MOD is what I am getting at.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EFine...don\u0027t use it then.
