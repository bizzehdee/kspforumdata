It is called USI life support because it is *by* USI, which is the in-game brand that RoverDude uses for his mods.

To give you a choice. Pick TAC-LS for realism, complexity and dire consequences, pick Snacks for some harmless fun with little overhead. The existence of this mod does not change the fact that those two have their place. It merely offers a third choice for those who do not like either extreme and want something in-between. Just like Karbonite was just a new choice in the age of Kethane."},{"CreatedByName":"Hevak","CreatedById":122200,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T17:48:31Z","Content":"@cmdrzeta I\u0027m not sure waht the real issue is. But a quick couple of things. \n\nThis life support mod does not have to be used to use mks and other USI parts. And I don\u0027t see USI as being in competition with TAC. This is simply a lighter, easier solution to have LS and such issues to worry about and deal with in the game. It\u0027s just not as full blown realism as TAC LS is, but slightly more involved than snacks is. Roverdude went to great lengths to make his mks mod able to use either his USI LS, or TAC LS, so I don\u0027t see how that is being in competition. It\u0027s just another option, Which I think a few people asked for and he also brought up to users of his mks, which is what USI LS is really geared toward, And for the most part it could also work as a stand alone LS option if people wanted. There was some discussion and it was generally a well accepted idea. And he never intended to compete with TAC LS. It Just provides different options.\n\nIf you\u0027re happy using TAC rock on, nothing has really changed or been subverted by this mod. \n\nIm not sure what the issue is with crp though, in one sense the original crp did do a lot to clean up some of the overlap and clutter of resources, but there are a lot of modders, and quite frankly Roverdude and a couple other modders tried to set up some sort of agreement on naming and density and such of resources quite awhile ago. Several very active modders sort of just snubbed the idea. In the end crp is just an easy framework for anyone to add any resource the want. And to try to come to an agreement with as many modders as possible.\n\nEveryone who mods sort of has their own idea of how things should be, I mean people still argue with taraniselsu over his densities and consumption rates and how long has TAC been out? And there was a bit of a discussion by some when Roverdude initially brought up the subject of his own LS. I won\u0027t get into that whole thing again but after some discussion those for it got to a consensus of what is really happening when using a life support and all the resources,and well Roverdude ended up with this mod. \n\nI don\u0027t understand the whole competition thing as none of this is a competition. This is all free stuff graciously provided to the community to use. Everyone plays different. I see it in no way hurting TAC LS (and what about the fact there were like what 3-4 other LS mods before this?) and I really have to say Roverdude never tries to cause problems with other mods or anything. He simply tries to provide options to people, especially with in the framework of his own mods. The moment a conflict was brought up about is dll. Naming he immediately said he will change that to be nice and not mess with other peoples hard work.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T21:10:48Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 09:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hevak**"},{"CreatedByName":"almagnus1","CreatedById":78068,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T19:44:01Z","Content":"Any chance of looking into USI Life Support integration with sumghai\u0027s SDHI Service Module System mod?\n\nFor reference, the SDHI Service Module System\u0027s thread is: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52362](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52362)"},{"CreatedByName":"skbernard","CreatedById":67569,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T20:08:55Z","Content":"it would be up to sumghai (or anyone else) to write a config to make it work not rover"},{"CreatedByName":"almagnus1","CreatedById":78068,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T20:21:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E it would be up to sumghai (or anyone else) to write a config to make it work not rover\n\nGood point.\n\n\\*\\*Posts in the other thread\\*\\*"},{"CreatedByName":"Apollo13","CreatedById":74572,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T22:45:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thank you for the clarification; I cant use it because I use TACLIFE so in my case I see no need for another LifeSupport Module from another MOD is what I am getting at.\n\nFine...don\u0027t use it then.
