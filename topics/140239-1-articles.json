Unfortunately, only one had a hint of KSP in it. Long story short, there was a giant ancient library made from purple flowers and gold. It was shaped like a space shuttle. I had to pilot a mini space shuttle (like in KSP) out of that giant space shuttle and I crashed it in a fountain. There was one angry tourist in the back screaming his head off.
