Either way, the ascent and descent dV costs for non-atmospheric bodies are roughly equal if you perform the maneuvers efficiently enough, so there\u0027s no chance that Laythe would require 4-4.5km/s to \u003Cem\u003Eland\u003C/em\u003E (given that atmosphere) unless you\u0027re doing something really wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the actual question, it\u0027s about 3-3.5km/s.
