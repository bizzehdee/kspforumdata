Also: the higher you fly, the more your rudders need to work in order to stabilize an unstable plane. I got the same phenomenon: everything seems to work until you reach a certain height and speed, and then the plane starts to flip. When it whirls down into the lower atmosphere and looses speed, it slowly stabilizes again, and you can start to ascend again. At some point it will flip again, etc. pp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake a look at your rudder control in the bottom left corner. Usually all arrows should be centered, but with an imbalanced plane the auto pilot slowly needs to tilt the rudders more and more - up to the point where it hits the limit. If you would switch off the autopilot just for a fraction of a second there, your ship will immediately turn over. And this is exactly what happens once you are trying to manually alter your course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong story short: take a look at the rudders. If they have trouble either keeping the plane nose down or up, you have a balancing problem. Either add more rudders/flaps, or try to balance your CoL/CoM more carefully.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"O-Doc","CreatedById":95453,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-28T10:04:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour canard is on backwards which is shifting your \u0022real\u0022 CoL during a pitching moment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
