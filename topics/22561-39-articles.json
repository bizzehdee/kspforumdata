Unfortunately, the new version has not gone well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I\u0027m having two separate issues. The probably simpler one is the game crashing when I go from the main space center screen to the launchpad. It doesn\u0027t seem to happen when I just move from the vehicle assembly building to launching. According to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://sprunge.us/RYVH\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPlayer.log\u003C/a\u003E, this seems to be due to a NullReferenceException somewhere or another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second issue is more important and makes the game unusable. It hangs at hard to understand points. Sometimes during the second menu screen (after \u0022start game\u0022, I mean) and at two different points on the launchpad (gotten to directly from vehicle assembly to circumvent the above) before and after Jeb\u0027s face shows up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t tested this second bug much because when I say it \u0022hangs\u0022, I mean my entire system goes unresponsive. The fan spins up so I assume it\u0027s in some kind of loop, but I have no way of knowing, as the CPU monitor, rest of the screen, mouse, etc. are all inoperable. Can\u0027t even switch to console. Music seems to keep playing, however. The only way I can stop this is a soft reset of the whole computer, so I don\u0027t know what kind of logs are available. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/1182\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis bug report\u003C/a\u003E might be relevant?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I mentioned, the demo on Steam worked fine.

Which is evidenced by not being able to even switch to console, which usually helps with soft driver lockups. This seems to be a hard lockup, and it seems as if driver locks up the GPU itself and is unresolvable by any normal means short of rebooting the system, which power cycles teh card, and therefore restores it\u0027s normal functionality. (When you issue the reboot command, the screen doesn\u0027t change from the KSP locked-up one until the power cycle happens and only then can I see GPUBIOS and BIOS messages).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECulprit and a solution (kind-of):\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe de-facto culprit for these issues, as far as I am able to figure it out are AMD Catalyst drivers (duh!), specifically version \u003Cstrong\u003E14\u003C/strong\u003E.
