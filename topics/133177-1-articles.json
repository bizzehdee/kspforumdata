Everything seems to be fine till I approach the target Kerbal to be rescued and get within a couple of km range whereupon the following happens:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) The game automatically switches to the kerbal without me pushing any buttons\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) The kerbal is spinning, very fast, and sitting in a command seat. I have to right click on him to get him to \u0027eva\u0027\u003Cbr\u003E\n3) When I switch back to my ship, it\u0027s Pe has changed from 80Km circular orbit to a -500km highly eliptical, suicidal re-entry, without using any fuel\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ve managed to do these occasionally by not warping when I approach the Kerbal - in which case the above 1 and 2 still happen\u00A0but my orbit doesn\u0027t change and I\u0027m able to rescue the Kerbal. - Anyone got a clue as to what might be causing this? I\u0027m finding it mighty suspect that all four of my rescue missions so far have ended up going after Kerbals stuck in command seats, rather than pods or cockpits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWemb\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"radonek","CreatedById":84077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-01T14:30:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222434980\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022133177\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221456742124\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022121979\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wemb\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 29. \u00FAnora 2016 at 11:35 AM, Wemb said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m finding it mighty suspect that all four of my rescue missions so far have ended up going after Kerbals stuck in command seats, rather than pods or cockpits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat one is easy. Kinda. When you get a new rescue\u00A0contract, look into save file. Do text-find of\u00A0kerbal\u0027s name, you will get contract details, craft and kerbals personal info (I always get them in this order). Now, comprehending craft data is usually not easy, but stranded kerbals are always in single part.
