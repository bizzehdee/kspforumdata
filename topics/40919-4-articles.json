Instead of having in huge gap between Kerbol and the next star, what if suddenly Kerbol was part of a binary star system, and the companion star had its own planetary system. It could be very far away, perhaps 5-10 times the distance of Eeloo\u0027s orbit. That gives you another star to play around with and you wouldn\u0027t need lightspeed stuff.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree.

I mean it\u0027s one thing to launch a mission and then go back to building on Kerbin, but if you launch the mission and time warp until it arrives you\u0027re looking at decades, possibly centuries, going by at home with nothing happening.

The current process involves replacing all the fluid in the body with some kind of gel or another, and then getting turned into an ice cube. Currently, we have no way of reanimating a person who\u0027s been frozen. As far as I know, there\u0027s also no way of making a person hibernate, or go into some kind of cold sleep to slow their metabolism. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I like the idea of having a multi-star system... uh system... I don\u0027t think traveling between stars should be like traveling between planets, only further away. If you think about it, each step in KSP means you have to change everything about your spacecraft. Getting a satellite into orbit compared to going to the Mun, and then going to Jool, and then Duna. All of these are massively different missions that require insanely different builds and strategies to get there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd with hibernation there\u0027s still the issue of game time to get there. Even with shrinkage, you\u0027re looking at a single straight shot taking a year or more in game time at the speed of light. And you run into a lot of issues when going the speed of light. (all that non-convergence, time dilation and the universe imploding when you turn on a flashlight.... (well maybe not that last one...)) So one trip out there, with a probe to see what\u0027s there: One year, also a year for the signal to return to Kerbin. (Have fun with that Remote Tech!) You launch a manned mission, and it\u0027s a year to get there, and another year for them to send the message that the space toilet broke, then another year before a new one can be sent. That\u0027s five years for two manned trips to the nearest star at four times shrinkage, and that\u0027s all with an engine that works by bending the fabric of space/time, requires absurd amounts of energy and negative matter.... (unless Wikipedia is lying to me again) And all that would result in zero pay off (Other than some sciency stuff after the toilet request was sent) and your Kerbals stranded in another star system until they can build another interstellar ship and wait another year for their relief to arrive. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I think Scott Manly\u0027s idea of finding Monoliths and learning how to build space gates is more feasible, and would make the whole thing more fun to actually play. I\u0027m thinking that you\u0027d have to build several gates that have to line up on some kind of escape trajectory and then something to \u0022catch\u0022 the ship on the other side. You would still need to send them there with conventional rockets or nuclear (maybe anti-matter or some kind of fusion) and have them build the gates on their side before you could start bussing Kerbals, and supplies to and from.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scoundrel","CreatedById":15369,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-06T17:50:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, a little spoiler alert (as the spoiler tags don\u0027t work I\u0027m whiting out the spoiler part) I\u0027m guessing a lot of people haven\u0027t gone to \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FFFFFF;\u0022\u003Ethe north pole of Kerbin\u003C/span\u003E, which would help shed some light about Squad\u0027s vision of the game that have been posed in this thread.
