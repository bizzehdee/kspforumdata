It\u0027s a really simple concept: If I press escape, it\u0027s because I want to escape whatever is in my face. That I can press escape and the thing in front of me doesn\u0027t disappear is a sin against the basic foundations of how you handle user input. Here\u0027s a couple scenarios to serve as an example:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESCENARIO 1:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am in the main menu, I open the new game screen but realize I haven\u0027t checked my graphics settings. I press escape to leave the new game menu and go back to the main. \u003Cem\u003ENothing happens\u003C/em\u003E.

This is also the case on any other building. The problems with that menu and its design have already been pointed out so I\u0027m skipping that, but just know that those same issues makes that menu popping up when I want to exit a building, way less than ideal, and makes the general \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E scene redundant since you expect me to look at a menu and select a building from there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESCENARIO 3:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m flying my ship and I need time to think about whatever is going to happen.

I\u0027ve lost more than one rocket (and had to revert a save) because one of my kids came up to me and I naturally hit escape to stop the game and pay attention to them. But then when I looked back at the game a minute or two later I either totally missed my maneuver or crashed into the surface or whatever.
