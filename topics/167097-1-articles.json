The time where we (normally) overindulge in candy. Today is November First; International \u0022Get Sick on last years Halloween Candy Day\u0022. But, there\u0027s a spookier side to today. Halloween was the day of spooks. And I\u0027m sure that you\u0027ll have heard many-a-tale or two that\u0027s meant to chill your bones. So tell them! We\u0027d love to hear em. Oh, and if you haven\u0027t heard one, just make one up!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll go first. (Heard this on the Halloween M*A*S*H episode last night)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo\u00A0my Grandfather was a sailor. Well one night, there was this massive storm. His nav equipment was out, he was totally lost, and this storm was tossing his boat every which way. Well he saw a boat;\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EThe Luck of The Irish\u003C/em\u003E, and it looked like it knew what it was doing. So he follows the \u003Ci\u003EIrish\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0in to port, and then it just sail off; clear into the night. So the next morning, he tells the Coast Guard about it. But they act confused, and told him that\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EThe Luck of The Irish\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0had broken up and sunk to the bottom of the ocean 20 years ago...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy spooking!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
