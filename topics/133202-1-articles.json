Is there an easy way to run a second mod free install of ksp if I\u0027m using the steam version?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FullMetalMachinist","CreatedById":156531,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-29T19:04:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbsolutely, it\u0027s the same as doing it without steam. Just move your current, modded, folder from the steam directory to somewhere else (to get there go to KSP in steam, right click, and click on browse local files). Then, in steam, just re-download KSP from steam.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, your modded game will only be able to be launched from the KSP.exe from wherever you moved it, and steam won\u0027t track the hours played any more.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-29T19:16:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother way, that doesn\u0027t require re-downloading anything, just \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecopy\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E your current KSP directory tree to a new location.\u00A0 Then, in one of them, just delete everything in GameData other than the \u0022Squad\u0022 folder and you\u0027re good to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YTNewneo","CreatedById":159646,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-02T08:13:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes like the posters before me already said, you can make copies of the \u0022Kerbal Space Program\u0022 folder that is located in you steam directory and just copy it somewhere else. that is how i have my steam version always without any mods and updated to the latest version, and i have another Folder on my Hard drive with a few different KSP Folders with different mods installed. That way you can have one for Real Solar System mod, one for Interstellar Mod, and any other versions that you would like to have. Also makes sure any update does not immediately break you modded\u00A0game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
