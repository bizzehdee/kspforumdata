Leave the probe in orbit, try and land it or attempt to bring it home. The latter two would both be more beneficial, since I want to send a manned expedition tomorrow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApologies for the fairly silly question, but I thought it better to ask than to take a hammer to my PC should I screw this up for the third time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-01T21:44:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn practice, I find it\u0027s better to plan maneuvers one at a time; your later maneuver nodes don\u0027t take any previous maneuver screw-ups in into account. You\u0027ll have to manually remove previous nodes before any updating at all will occur.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as how they\u0027ll appear on your nav ball, the nav ball will update itself once you\u0027ve gotten rid of the last node, and it will appear the same way (as a blue targeting indicator).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sundancer","CreatedById":83716,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-01T21:52:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat makes sense. It turns out it\u0027s unnecessary, messing around with the first node resulted in a circular orbit (hopefully) in an hour or so.

Don\u0027t tell me though please, I sort of ruined my first orbit because I read up on how to do it after two failed attempts.
