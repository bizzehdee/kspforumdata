I\u0027d already been moving towards simple designs and away from asparagus staging, it\u0027s efficient but unrealistic I guess, I never cared for it. My current booster family worked OK for the most part with relatively minor tweaking to things like TRW, adding fins or nose cones and the odd mid stage set of reaction wheels. There were a few spontaneous unplanned disassembles and the odd case of lawn darting but I\u0027d say it went well. I do have some questions for the FAR pros though. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can launch all of my designs, kick over 5-10 degrees at 65-75 m/s and they will pretty much follow the prograde, I can turn SAS off after the initial kick over and they still fly true, needing only an occasional tap on the D key in some cases. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy heavier boosters all seem to become bottom heavy and want to nose up later in the ascent (say 35K - 55K) as the upper tanks drain, I\u0027ve taken to turning off the top tank, perhaps the top 2 for most of the launch to get around this, which works like a charm (I don\u0027t have orange tanks / mainsails in this career yet). Is this common? Any suggestions for avoiding having to do this? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do you guys get those perfect ascent profiles and not fall so far behind apoapsis? On my best launches I usually wind up 5-7 minutes or more behind it and the problem seems to be in the upper part of my profile. It seems most of my launches would naturally circularize at around 60-65K, which is obviously a bit low, this is true for both my light designs and heavier ones. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoar boosters is obviously not the solution here \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoar skill and better design likely is\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe needed tweaks are likely very minor, but I don\u0027t see them. A bit more thrust in the later phases? TRW at launch is usually about 1.35 or so, main stack engines are tweaked so max throttle gives me about 1.5 when I decouple the SRBs, maybe 7.5K meters, 40 degrees from vertical, obviously this goes up as fuel drains, what is a good TRW at say 65K, maybe that would help me set the throttle for a better late profile. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, maybe a mod question: Telemetry, I\u0027d like to be able to record a few launch profiles, just the simplest data, time, distance downrange, altitude, angle, speed in an effort to improve my consistency and design, but all I can find are some highly complex, mission control type mods, nothing simple and easy.

A 1.25 TWR on the pad will get you to orbit just fine if you\u0027ve got the delta-V you need. Most of the ascent profile I used to use in stock still applied once I\u0027d finished the turn to 45 degrees - just stay there until you\u0027re 35 seconds to Ap, then tilt down gradually to 20 degrees and hold that until you\u0027re 45 seconds to Ap, then 10 degrees until you\u0027re 55 seconds to Ap.

I\u0027ve been in a minimalistic phase lately, SRBs around a central stack of fuel tanks with enough dv to get the payload in to orbit, shooting for around 3800dv with FAR. The only staging has been ditching the SRBs, then ditching the main stack just barely suborbital (I don\u0027t like space debris).

I just monkey with the fuel load to get about the right delta v for the cargo. I\u0027m mostly satellite launch contracts and scan-sat launches which are coming in around 1500-2500kg depending on what has to go up and where I need to send it.

No fairings at all, but I guess it\u0027s more aerodynamic to begin with, oddly it flies almost exactly the same, same flight path, same questions, maybe a few more presses on the A and D keys but it basically goes like the lighter one. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbsolute truth is, I\u0027m finding it a lot easier to get to orbit with FAR for more reasons than just the reduced delta v needed. If something is set up decently, it flies better than stock IMO. It\u0027s just harder for me to get to orbit efficiently, without a long coast period or having to nose up a lot at the end of the trajectory and I\u0027m a bit of a perfectionist.
