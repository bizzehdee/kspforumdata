I think I may have found a reason why\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we all know \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cwings and wing parts\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 create lift. This is good for making space planes not crash (I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll let you/Jeb decide if that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a good thing or not). What is also good for not crashing is putting wings in asymmetric pairs, horizontally attached to the fuselage. What is NOT good, it to use a single wing vertically attached to the rear of the craft (like the tail on a traditional aircraft). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe use of a vertical wing will create sideways lift, which is fine if they are used in pairs as they balance each other out. If they are used individually, they create lift only to one side. Now the amount of lift created is not huge, but at high speeds this can easily cause the craft to \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cflip out\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 to one side (emphasized with flameouts) causing an uncontrollable terminal descent\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good way to test this is to just delete all of the horizontal wings on the craft in the SPH (don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be a fool and save after you have done this... like I did), and have a look at the CoL; if it is pointing sideways at all, then there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s your problem!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve posted this just to make people aware of this issue, and also to ask if there are any wing mods that don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t create lift?
