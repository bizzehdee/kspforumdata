So with that said, and with the serious lack of updated (as of at least 1.0) threads on this topic, would anyone care to share their methods for removing debris and sending it down to the body it\u0027s orbiting (efficiently, and without much difficulty)? I\u0027m playing career by the way. I also would greatly prefer to be able to recover the funds associated with these pieces of debris.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/78226-105-stagerecovery-recover-funds-from-dropped-stages-v163-022116\u0022\u003EStageRecovery\u003C/a\u003E mod installed (and every single piece of debris is setup with chutes and could be recovered this way), which is awesome, but it doesn\u0027t ever seem able to save anything if it has to go through reentry. As a side question, does anyone know how to fix this? I can\u0027t put heat shields on all of this debris, and pretty much any stages that aren\u0027t jettisoned before orbit and must undergo reentry, always end up not being recovered. Everything usually burns up on reentry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if I\u0027m unable to recover any funds, I would like to start removing debris from orbit; I think it\u0027s starting to affect my computer\u0027s performance with all that extra stuff up there. As for suggestions, please keep in mind that all of the debris that I\u0027m trying to deorbit has no docking ports.
