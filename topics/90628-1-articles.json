More info is great. But if it\u0027s numbers or text pls disable it in target mode. It already is pretty messy when you get an intersect close to apo- or periapsis. The numbers overlap and I don\u0027t get clear readings \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E additional info should go hand in hand with a gui that can support it. Some kind of collision detection for texts would be nice aswell\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
