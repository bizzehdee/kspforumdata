I am running the most recent version of KSP (1.04) and my difficulty settings are unchanged from game launch. It happens in career and sandbox modes and was not an issue before 1.03 to my knowledge. I also suspect that I am experiencing diminished aeroforce but I have not looked into it that much.\n\nI have a few mod\u0027s installed (list below), but I have also tried deleting my Game Data folder and then reacquiring it from steam as well as reinstalling and running the game stock and neither seemed to help. Hopefully someone has an answer for me.

I did this, started KSP again and my heating issue was solved (Restarting KSP created a new default Physics.cfg file). Once I had finished playing, I went back to my KSP root folder and deleted the Physics.old folder.\n\nHope this helps:)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-04T20:31:43Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2015 08:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by maceemiller**"},{"CreatedByName":"Lokotor","CreatedById":149285,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T22:16:26Z","Content":"It looks like in the thread linked by Sal\\_Vager they also say that starting KSP with a shortcut (steam too maybe?) that it can cause the issue.
