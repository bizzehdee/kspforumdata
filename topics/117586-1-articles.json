I am running the most recent version of KSP (1.04) and my difficulty settings are unchanged from game launch. It happens in career and sandbox modes and was not an issue before 1.03 to my knowledge. I also suspect that I am experiencing diminished aeroforce but I have not looked into it that much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a few mod\u0027s installed (list below), but I have also tried deleting my Game Data folder and then reacquiring it from steam as well as reinstalling and running the game stock and neither seemed to help. Hopefully someone has an answer for me.
