But anticipate about 5 science per data.\n\u003E - Each lab can, in it\u0027s lifetime, research only one copy of any single unique experiment result. Goo at the poles and Goo over the grasslands are two different results.\n\u003E - You can put an experiment in as many labs as you like ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nIn short, the best place for the lab is on the surface of the same planet/moon that you did the experiment on."}]}
