Is a bit fun, but does require some good rendevous skills. Simply get speed up, then drift. You eva, fall off, but then use your RCS to keep your relative speed matched to the craft. Do the eva report, then simply RCS back to your capsule. Can make you nervous, but is fun! RCS cannot lift you off, but it can keep you with a coasting spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
