With all the styling, concerted media manipulation, vocal editing and more you could ask yourself how much of a real person you are actually seeing when you are looking at popular artists.

It\u0027s just as fun as any concert you might go to, and it is very much a \u0022live\u0022 performance; the vocals have been recorded in advance using the vocaloid software, but the instrumentals are played on stage by musicians.\n\nUsing a projection system, they\u0027re able to have 3d models dance and perform on stage, which is not much different from watching an animated music video, with the added effect that the model can work the crowd to some degree. Throw in an obligatory lights/lasers/pyrotechnics show and you have a pretty cool event.\n\nThe songs themselves range in genre; you can find pop, rock, r\u0026b, and other styles rendered with the vocaloid voices. I think that this flexibility is really why the whole vocaloid thing has taken off: the vocaloids themselves are better thought of as instruments, rather than as \u0022personalities\u0022, and the enormous body of music now available shows how interested artists are in the technology. The fact that vocaloids have different capabilities from singers opens up new avenues for artists as well. Unnaturally high or low notes, high tempo singing without loss of diction, the ability to generate the exact same sound repeatedly and reliably, never needing to stop for a breath. It\u0027s cool to see what composers are doing with these tools.\n\nApplying a \u0022character\u0022 to the voice is just very good marketing. It\u0027s easier, more recognizable, and more fun to stamp Miku\u0027s image as a pop star on an album cover, rather than try to market a generic synthesized album created by sound engineers.\n\nFinally, I don\u0027t think there\u0027s anyone who expects vocaloids in their current form to replace traditional singers. There may come a time when synthetic voices are easy enough to work with, and widely accepted enough that studios will be able to replace singers with software for automation reasons (reducing payroll, reducing time requirements, etc.) but I have a hard time believing society at large would prefer vocaloid music in their top 40 charts any time soon.\n\nAnd now that I\u0027ve already outed myself as a vocaloid fan... Any Civ5 players should try the [vocaloid faction mod](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=240472546). There\u0027s an enormous soundtrack to go with it (see description for soundtrack mod) and the gameplay style for the faction will amuse you (replaces all great musicians with special vocaloid units; spring onion farm tile improvement; lots more space for great works of music)."},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceXray","CreatedById":113396,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T19:24:36Z","Content":"Pros of Vocaloids:\n\nCan live forever(since they themselves are not real, only their image is)\n\nVery flexible and are more like instruments which can play almost any music genre.\n\nCan be animated and given a face so fans can relate to them more. \n\nNever engage in any bad behavior, their image can never be corrupted.\n\nFans can create a huge amount of their own songs, and even make their own PV\u0027s(music videos, animated dramas etc.) using MikuMikuDance. \n\nAnd about a live concert not being live:\n\nTechnically, they use the most polished songs and animations made by professionals, and also have an accompaniment consisting of living musicians. That makes a nice blend and makes the impression of a real concert. Also, the use of a projection and not just a flat screen makes them appear more alive, as they can also interact with the crowd to a certain extent(it\u0027s more like guess work since the ones making the animation have to know how the crowd will behave to what the model does).\n\nIn the end, the Vocaloid programs are made by people, and the voice samples come from a real person.
