It\u0027s just as fun as any concert you might go to, and it is very much a \u0022live\u0022 performance; the vocals have been recorded in advance using the vocaloid software, but the instrumentals are played on stage by musicians.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing a projection system, they\u0027re able to have 3d models dance and perform on stage, which is not much different from watching an animated music video, with the added effect that the model can work the crowd to some degree. Throw in an obligatory lights/lasers/pyrotechnics show and you have a pretty cool event.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe songs themselves range in genre; you can find pop, rock, r\u0026amp;b, and other styles rendered with the vocaloid voices. I think that this flexibility is really why the whole vocaloid thing has taken off: the vocaloids themselves are better thought of as instruments, rather than as \u0022personalities\u0022, and the enormous body of music now available shows how interested artists are in the technology. The fact that vocaloids have different capabilities from singers opens up new avenues for artists as well. Unnaturally high or low notes, high tempo singing without loss of diction, the ability to generate the exact same sound repeatedly and reliably, never needing to stop for a breath. It\u0027s cool to see what composers are doing with these tools.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApplying a \u0022character\u0022 to the voice is just very good marketing. It\u0027s easier, more recognizable, and more fun to stamp Miku\u0027s image as a pop star on an album cover, rather than try to market a generic synthesized album created by sound engineers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I don\u0027t think there\u0027s anyone who expects vocaloids in their current form to replace traditional singers. There may come a time when synthetic voices are easy enough to work with, and widely accepted enough that studios will be able to replace singers with software for automation reasons (reducing payroll, reducing time requirements, etc.) but I have a hard time believing society at large would prefer vocaloid music in their top 40 charts any time soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now that I\u0027ve already outed myself as a vocaloid fan...
