Avoid C1s - since they are unlikely to go look for you, it shouldn\u0027t be too hard.

If you can co-ordinate, there are a lot more situations where you should take the risk and try to take down C1. It also gives you an opening for bargaining instead of fight for the spoils.

but you have to kit your PMC.\u00A0 So if you die, you not only have a \u0027hatchling\u0027 with no gun, no armor, no equipment... he\u0027s also persistently wounded.\u00A0 You can pay to have him instantly healed, or use items you\u0027ve found or bought to heal your player, and then equip him with weapons, gear, food, med supplies, etc. - all from what you\u0027ve successfully extracted with or bought from vendors or other players (the game has a very good \u0027auction house\u0027 for players to sell found items to one another).\u00A0 So while the Scav is free to play, and you cannot lose anything, and any successful run is profit... you have limited \u003Cem\u003Etime \u003C/em\u003E/ opportunity to use him.\u00A0 Your PMC on the other hand is \u003Cem\u003Eexpensive\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Further - time is a factor because of how long it takes to get into a raid, and to run a raid.\u00A0 You literally \u0027feel\u0027 this investment as you\u0027re playing, and can, consequently get \u0027gear fear\u0027 where you play too conservatively out of fear of losing the stuff you\u0027ve worked so hard to acquire.\u00A0 You might get pumped playing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Drag\u0022\u003ECOD\u003C/abbr\u003E or BFx, but you get \u003Cem\u003Etense \u003C/em\u003Ewith Tarkov.\u00A0 Anxious.\u00A0 Adrenalin pumping when you win, and disappointed when you die.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBetween raids, you have a challenge of resource management: what to keep, what to sell, how to equip your character and quite often - how to keep enough inventory space available so that you can actually acquire your Scav\u0027s items after a raid.\u00A0 (Great raid?\u00A0 No space?\u00A0 No soup for you!\u00A0 Time?\u00A0 Wasted.)\u00A0 You get to explore modding different weapons to improve ADS time, handling, TTK, recoil, etc.\u00A0 You can\u0027t just keep weapons and ammo - you need space for quest items, med supplies, food, crafting supplies, gear, etc.\u00A0 You also have a \u0027Hideout\u0027 which you get to improve that will aid your PMC in healing / recovering (hydration and energy), allow you to craft items to sell or use, test your weapons between raids, etc. etc.\u00A0 There\u0027s like 10-12 sub-areas of the Hideout each with its own function and development tree and benefits.\u00A0 The PMC also has a skill progression\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn order to improve your Hideout, you have to complete quests for NPC \u0027Dealers\u0027.\u00A0 This \u0027quest\u0027 metric is awesome - because it is constantly sending players to different parts of the maps for more than just \u0027good loot\u0027.\u00A0 In-game this results in random, unexpected encounters between players throughout the map, along with the higher concentration of AI Scavs in the zones where quest objectives are.\u00A0 Other times, the \u0027good loot\u0027 areas are massive CQB fights or running fights much like you could find in other FPS titles - with one major exception: there are no set \u0027contact points\u0027 or zones to capture that give you or your team an advantage.\u00A0 Seven consecutive runs to the Resort area to try for the good loot will result in seven completely different fights in unexpected places around the Resort.\u00A0But you have to go to these contested areas to get the good loot to upgrade your hideout, complete quests, sell to get money to equip your PMC, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo at long last, we are at Character skill progression - which is a ton of ways where the game keeps track of your in-game experiences and you get to see your PMC improve in abilities, like Recoil Control, or Strength (farther grenade throws), medical skills (faster heals), faster running, faster searching, more stuff you can carry without penalty, better use of certain weapons... the list goes on and on.\u00A0 This is largely passive - but you actually can focus on something; like loading up a pack and running to exhaustion to improve related skills, or doing field-medical on yourself, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway - I\u0027m still learning... but for anyone who enjoys FPS gameplay, but is tired of \u0022Tag\u0022 - Tarkov is a brutally difficult, immersive game that is worth a look.\u00A0 (Unfortunately, there\u0027s no demo - so it really is a full-game purchase price to \u0027see if you like it\u0027).\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nOne last thing: sound.\u00A0 Sound is incredibly important in-Raid.\u00A0 I cannot tell you how many times I have crouched, tense, waiting to figure out which way some other player went or where they are coming from as we both try to silently get advantage over one another.\u00A0 The sound system is excellent - and modified by different gear, skills etc.\u00A0 Really adds to the \u0027stealth\u0027 and immersion of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeSchmuckatelli","CreatedById":154477,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-19T19:51:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223975322\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022202477\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221621452668\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 minutes ago, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was merely pointing out that there is no inherent reason for this to be a Russian vs Western choice in game design\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve spent most of my RU-designed/ market games with World of Tanks (and clones) as well as Tarkov.\u00A0 What WOT had was an on-the-surface simple Tank-skinned FPS arena battle game... but as you played you discovered a ton of hidden / not obvious features where skilled \u0026amp; experienced players could learn and use for advantage over others.\u00A0 Tarkov is similar.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy critique of major-studio US games is that they are exactly what you see on the surface.\u00A0 Player-learned knowledge is a minimal requirement for success, rather than surface WYSIWYG and twitch skills.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my impression of RU games is\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223974941\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022202477\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221621393835\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 hours ago, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027ll need a notepad and a logarithmic ruler,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nto know how to play at the highest level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...and I like that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-19T20:44:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223975322\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022202477\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221621452668\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, but a lot of games actually simulate recoil fairly realistically and have punishing ammo economy, so you learn to use bursts there as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah.
