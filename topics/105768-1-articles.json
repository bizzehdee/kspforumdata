I created a new career mode and went into the VAB to build my first rocket. I noticed the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI noticed first that there was two MK1 Command Pods, labelled slightly different. One was MK1 Command Pod, the other Command Pod MK1. One has 10 units MonoProp. the other none. The heat tolerance on one is much different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI selected one, then the other; both yielded the same results. I cannot attach anything to them inline. no parachutes, antennae or fuel tanks/ engines. It does allows me to attach a goo canister from the side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI created a sandbox game to see if other parts behaved the same way, some did and others did not (MK3 cockpit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T15:32:23Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 03:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by BROBI\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheMoonRover","CreatedById":136199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T22:32:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know why you have two Mk1 Command Pods, or what the cause is, but I\u0027m having the same problem when I add a few new parts to my mod.
