In the future we will export all the screens as independent props. The reason I know this, is because the bug occurs on the ADI which is really just a retextured HUD. The HUDs don\u0027t suffer from the bug because they are separate props from the six screens. Yet the six screens tend to affect one another with the bug when you turn on the orbital display and flip an adjacent screen to the ADI page.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I will try and squeeze the fix in before version 2.0 of the KSOS, but we\u0027ll see how the schedule goes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei run linux not Mac and it doesn\u0027t work (still) but it sorta... flashes...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enope wait that was my mistake i\u0027ll try do it porperly now. nope this doesn\u0027t work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-16T16:54:18Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2014 04:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by AntiMatter001\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sharpspoonful","CreatedById":83734,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-16T18:14:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FREEMANtsinq\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FREEMANtsinq\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure what your point is.

MechJeb is a rather dumb, simplistic autopilot that is only really good for providing flight data for you. A real rocket is precisely programmed for a specific mission, and things happen at specified velocity and altitude. MechJeb can\u0027t even do a roll program unless you hold it\u0027s hand through it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei don\u0027t get people who want this game to be like real life... i mean if you WANT to see a rocket go up and come down without fail watch the apollo missions and stuff.... it seems sort of pointless putting realism into a game with GREEN people who have planets tha are named nicely so people laugh and say \u0022yay this sounds similar to this\u0022 and sutff... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esorry for that lil rant... i just think that... you know... it\u0027s a GAME... your SUPPOSED to crash every 3 to 4 times a day.... that\u0027s what makes it FUN!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MOARdV","CreatedById":60950,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-17T21:40:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022helldiver\u0022 data-cite=\u0022helldiver\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENote, this will not fix the Blue ADI bug\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The blue ADI bug is linked to the Orbital display and may be a bug with the RPM renderer as users have experienced it with other RPM features (outside the KSO).
