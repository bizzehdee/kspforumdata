I upgraded my tracking station and had no maneuver nodes. I was about to submit a bug report then saw it was an upgrade of Mission Control. It\u0027s been too long since I\u0027ve started a fresh career. ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"LN400","CreatedById":140595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T05:04:29Z","Content":"Personally, I kinda like the idea of having to upgrade mission control (although in effect it\u0027s more contract control) and the tracking station. One thing is to send a sounding rocket up. Light the fuse and off it goes. Space flight takes a whole lot more. Computers to compute trajectories, commlinks, all those things. So yeah, to me it makes perfect sense having to upgrade these two buildings to unlock man. nodes.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T05:08:23Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 05:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LN400**"}]}
