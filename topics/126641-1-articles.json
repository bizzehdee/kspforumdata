Laws of physics and rocketry are the same (almost), so their rockets should be a bit like ours. But how much?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy opinion is that they are too similar to real life rockets, and with each new update getting more and more so. Don\u0027t get me wrong, i think devs are doing great job, but i think that the game is drifting away from original idea (at least how I perceived it, having played KSP from version 0.16 i think).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027d like to see is parts with performance similar to stock, but a bit more creative in design, something unique Kerbaly. I guess that this is not very popular veiw, since a lot of mods focus on \u0022realism\u0022: real solar system, real fuels, soyuz parts, space shuttle and so on.

I also think having it toon rendered could be an interesting experiment, then again I like toon rendering but understand it\u0027s not everyone\u0027s cup of tea. In the end though, the gameplay is what matters most and KSP ranks high there so visual style tends to be less of a concern than gameplay from my armchair.
