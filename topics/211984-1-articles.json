Have the Devs forgotten about it or deemed it not important enough? I love this game to bits and have done for many years, but having to wait over a year for a major update like this is not great, to say the least. I know how hard the teams have been working on KSP 2 and I\u0027m beyond excited to see everything that\u0027s new and improved, but as an Xbox player I\u0027m rapidly loosing confidence that I\u0027ll be able to try it anytime soon with how console timelines were and are handled with the original game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
