After a few missions, I noticed Bill had disappeared from the roster. Which was weird, because up to this point, he hadn\u0027t even seen the inside of a capsule. Then I looked at an available tourist mission that I\u0027ve been ignoring, and there he was. I never authorized this vacation, so I went into the save file and replaced every instance of \u0022Bill\u0022 with \u0022Gill\u0022, and copied Bill\u0027s data from a fresh save file. This seemed so set things right. No harm done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 A little later, I noticed Bill had gone missing again. This time I found him in a rescue contract I had already accepted. So I rescued him, and now he\u0027s a scientist rather than an engineer. Again no real harm done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 While this hasn\u0027t seriously affected game play, I am curious why it\u0027s happening and if I can stop it. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s a KSP issue or an issue with something I installed with the Galileo Planet Pack. I don\u0027t want to have to worry about assigned crew disappearing from missions to go on vacation or need rescuing from half way across the solar system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheRagingIrishman","CreatedById":165004,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-29T20:10:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s my fault, I shipped some buggy code in GPP (will be fixed in next release).
