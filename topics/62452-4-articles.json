With the mechanics of the game nearly fully developed, focus is now shifting to enhancing \u003Cem\u003Egameplay\u003C/em\u003E, especially for the more casual gamers. So it is fully understandable that development is now going towards career mode, contracts (providing goals, an alien concept for hardcore simmers), good in-game tutorials. All that makes perfect sense in the development of \u003Cem\u003EKSP The Game\u003C/em\u003E but it means that less (or no) resources are spent on \u003Cem\u003EKSP The Simulation\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs that a bad thing? Obviously it is, when you are looking for a realistic simulation (which the opening screen will tell you right of the bat KSP is not), but for development as a game it is natural.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me personally, atmospheric behavior (both at launch as well as re-entry, but I think re-entry heating is very closely related to good aerodynamic modeling) is the one part that needs improvement and that I \u003Cem\u003Eexpect\u003C/em\u003E improvement since it can only enhance gameplay (it adds an \u0022it\u0027s not over till it\u0027s over\u0022 element to the game).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I see with most requests for \u0022more realism\u0022 is a desire to make the game more \u0022hardcore.\u0022 N-body physics! Lagrange Points! Random Failures! Which will make the game a miserable experience for all but the most committed players. Running out of fuel in Duna, and quickly sending in a fuel tank while time accelerating because you don\u0027t want to wait half a year? LOLZ u didn\u0027t maintain ur orbit! Fuel arrives, mission has disappeared... That might be ok for some, 95% of the players will not be happy about that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, Squad will make decisions that make the game appealing for the majority of the players. And with KSP getting more and more fame, that will be a focus on making the game easier and \u0022fun,\u0022 not harder and radical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that KSP isn\u0027t a simulator per se, even if it\u0027s marked as one in Steam (with tags \u0022indie\u0022, \u0022early acccess\u0022 and \u0022simulator\u0022).

Said Deadly Reentry mod doesn\u0027t make the game harder, there\u0027re other things with the same magnitude of difficulty within the game. It just expands it in depth. And if we\u0027re talking about making the game easier for more casual players - delta-v/twr/burn time info is exactly what would make their life easier, as others pointed out, it\u0027s easier to understand space travel and rocket design with having these indicators at your disposal.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-08T16:03:13Z\u0022 title=\u002202/08/2014 04:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by macegee\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-08T16:13:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith regard to what I said in my second quote there, \u0022Secondly I would ask you to stop speaking on behalf of everyone in your arguments, and I quote \u0022While flying blindly might be fun for some people, it\u0027s gonna be frustrating for others, and, actually, for everyone - to become a grind.

The majority of the parts have been balanced towards sandbox, but that\u0027s not how it works in real-life. Things like aerospikes and nuclear thermal rockets should be OP, because that\u0027s just how they work. If they\u0027d balance towards career, the tech tree would unlock OP parts at appropriate times. You start building your rockets with simple 1.25m engines. Then you move on to big 2.5m engines, which make the small ones much less useful. The aerospikes and NTRs unlocked after that then take center role. But since it\u0027s a linear progression it\u0027s ok. In each phase you\u0027ll be using different engines, which keeps the game fresh for longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E4.

A public road map could help with that, but it can also result into too much entitlement by players. There\u0027s less room for experimentation, because if it\u0027s not delivered on the players will be up in arms.
