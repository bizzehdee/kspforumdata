As a family, we didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t eat dinner until 10 PM, and we would watch the original Star Trek every night at 11. My dad worked 364 days a year, only took Thanksgiving off, and from age 8 to 18, the only time I could hang out with my parents was by staying late. And every night, it was Star Trek on Channel 13 in L.A. That was my childhood. All my friends were Star Wars kids but I didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t go to the movies, so I was the Star Trek kid. Thinking about this, it became a very personal and very emotional decision.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Then it became a blur. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201COn Fast 6, we had a year turnaround and that was crazy. This one gave us six months to get ready, which makes it like an incredibly expensive indie movie.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003Cp\u003EHow does one put a stamp, coming into the third film of an iconic franchise? \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CAs great as JJ\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s films were, there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s still a lot to be mined from these characters,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Lin said. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThey haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really gone on their five-year mission, so what we experienced in the TV show hasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t been touched on yet. That sets up an opportunity for exploration and the deeper you go, the more you are examining humanity. Those are the things that I absorbed as a kid and hope to tap into and embrace and celebrate. By the time this movie comes out, Star Trek will have been around for 50 years.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Lin wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t say much about the script written by cast member Simon Pegg and Doug Jung, but he said a couple things. First, Pegg isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t in every scene as one might imagine when the script is by a member of the ensemble cast. And the plot isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t borrowed from old Trek episodes the way the last film was. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CIt\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s all new and fresh,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Lin said. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThe Klingons, Romulans and other species are great, but it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s time to go further.
