For example, make \u0022collect science data\u0022 missions one-time only deals (like the World First Record Orbit the Mun mission). If this makes it too hard, you could add one-time missions for each type of science in each location (e.g. you could have a mission for crew report in high orbit, then later a mission for temperature scan in high orbit).\n\nMight as well strip out all the space centre science, and missions for tests on the launchpad as well.

Simply upsizing the solar system or nerfing isp while keeping the stock parts isn\u0027t exactly difficult either, it\u0027s just excessively lag-producing.

It\u0027s really easy to forget that, and if you do forget it, since you have no control over the craft once it\u0027s behind a planet, you can just sit and helplessly watch your batteries go flat.
