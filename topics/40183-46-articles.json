So The changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Added new Pop Up menu when Player Crashes vessel (gives option to Delete Current Completed MissionGoals if doing a current mission) Good if you want to accept death and use a new vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Added new Pop up for when you get a SubMission Payout (Yes finally Added This!!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Fixed a few Null reference bugs in code that showed in Debug Menu..See Number 4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. No longer have the Current Budget Tab in the Space Center View (one of the error codes, Space Center Don\u0027t like it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Added some more values to the API. Load Save, Load Backup, and Save. Gives other mods the ability to Load an older save of MCE (if having there own revert) Load a Current Save (for whatever reason) and ability to save MCE if need be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Added an Option to settings for player to choose KSP Skin or Smoke Skin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Cleaned up some code that was not being used anymore in MCE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Made it pretty much impossible for you to accidentally use the Reset Space Program, Reset Mission Goals, and Reset Missions Buttons in the Settings Tab. (multiple levels, and also an exit) If you accidentally press them now, you were trying too. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9.

Well lets start off with thanks for the feedback. I tend to agree with everything you mentioned in the post. I have held off changing anything in this respect for one reason though. .24 is going to be a nightmare for MissionController I think. The plan is when .24 comes out, to get rid of the current way MCE Adds its own cost to Parts. (and yes some of them are wacky, and its showing its age) In .24 I plan on going back to using the Regular Values supplied by the parts themselves. (the main reason we don\u0027t use this now is because at the time most Mod Parts were not including the PART COST) Since .24 will introduce its own money system (again not sure how this is going to work, if its like science and only works in career its going to be a nightmare to code around that) and most likely everyone will start supply the PartCost to there new parts (and old ones) MCE can finally get rid of the wonky system it uses now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that does not mean that I will get rid of the whole system. Fuels will have to stay (unless they have fuel cost too in .24) I might keep it in place for those parts that still refuse to have monetary values. So that is why I have pretty much stayed away from messing with the system right now (why bother if its only going to last another month?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. As for the config file feel free to include it in a post in this thread, I might even add it as option in a future download. But by .24 it will be outdate since the config file will change drastically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. One of the biggest reasons Me and Nathan worked on making MCE so User friendly with prices was for the very reason you posted in this thread. Don\u0027t like prices its easy to change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Now for the ISP. ISP is figured out per part, and not a value of every part together. (thats why the values in the future type engines is so wacked, they have such High ISP I had to add exceptions for future engines) Most of the high cost comes from the ISP value. The higher the value the more the part cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the math on the Engine and its cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003Edouble ecst = Math.Pow((ispSL * atmoRatio \u002B ispV * (1-atmoRatio)) - ispOffset, power) * thrust * scalar;\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow also consider that there are exceptions are reductions for parts of this after the math.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003Eecst *= gimbalFactor;\u003Cbr\u003E                            ecst *= propMult;\u003Cbr\u003E                            ecst *= futureEngines;\u003Cbr\u003E                            ecst *= nukeMult;\u003Cbr\u003E                            cst = ecst;\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis is the values I added for Higher ISP Engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003Eif (!foundPropMod \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ispV \u0026gt; 600 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ispV \u0026lt; 1999){\u003Cbr\u003EnukeMult = Tools.GetValueDefault(mNode, \u0022nukeMult\u0022, nukeMult);}\u003Cbr\u003Eif (!foundPropMod \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ispV \u0026gt;= 2000){\u003Cbr\u003EfutureEngines = Tools.GetValueDefault(mNode, \u0022futureEngines\u0022, futureEngines);}\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope its not to confusing.

As soon as I enter flight scene (with anything), KSP debug window erupts NullReferenceExceptions like hell, no ship is displayed but the reference frame seems to be way out (depending on what I selected to fly, it seems to be somewhat initially centered on the mainbody the ship has to orbit, though fixed in space). Editor scenes are fine.\u003Cp\u003ENow, I have a ton of mods installed, so very possible this is tied to some nasty interference.

All have to do with Vessel Destroy. So wondering what it is your doing in the scene when this happens. For some reason everything is reading that your vessel was destroyed, and its activating every single Ondestroy event for everymod that is watching for it? In mission controllers case I will have to add a Check for the vessel not being there to get rid of the null reference since that is what it look like is going on. Again this doesn\u0027t seem to be just a MCE problem your getting code calls for every single Mod thats looking for Vessel Destroy. Only difference is that MCE doesn\u0027t no what to do.... But its still calling all the other events. Even If I fixed it on my end, you would still have the issue. Only difference instead of calling a null refrence it would call whatever I replaced it with, in this case it would be the same thing remote tech is doing which is listing what is destroyed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"malkuth","CreatedById":57414,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-01T20:13:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gaiiden\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gaiiden\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethere\u0027s an exploit that if you sit on the pad with a kerbal in your ship and create a user contract with the goal of 1 kerbal crew, as soon as you reload the contract you get a $20,000 payout.

Fixes an issue when going directly from game load to tracking station and trying to load a vessel. MCE got confused when Ondestroy event is called in TrackingStation (WHY the hell is this even called when loading?) and could not find the active vessel. this should be fixed now and vessel will load and not hang you game up, and have to restart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Please note, for MCE to fully load it seems if you still go directly from Game Load to tracking station and then load a vessel, some info will not load (like VC button) this is because all information is not loaded yet into MCE.. Best thing to do is at load go to the VAB (everything loads) and then do whatever you want. There is no major bugs with this, just some of the info is not loaded yet. (something to do with the SpaceCenter View oddness). Game will still run fine if you don\u0027t follow this rule, you will just get a few errors in the debug log about the Vessel Cost not being loaded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Testing thanks to diomedea for finding this nasty little bug. The fix I did was kinda quick (really don\u0027t have time to test all the effects this might have) The fix indeed fixing the issue. But I have a sneaky feeling that it might break the Pop Up you get when your vessel is destroyed during a mission. (you get choice to accept death or Continue with quickload or revert) If anyone can report to me that this even is still firing. I would be thankful (off to work). These are the things that make the even Pop. You must be in a Mission (any mission loaded into MCE), be in your active vessel in Flight mode! The part I added was a null reference to active vessel. What Im looking for is to make sure that once the vessel is destroyed it is not stopped by the New Null Reference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I brought back an old null refrence at load. (dammit on purpose) at least some of the MCE stuff will load right away now. Again this is a spaceCenter problem and not sure how to fix it. But the error only pops once ever.
