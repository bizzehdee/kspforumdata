I\u0027m no ContractConfigurator whiz, but is it possible to check to see if the probe sent back scanning data? If so, that could be a good middle ground. So, I can use my SCANsat probe already around Minmus, but I have to actually send back data to Kerbin. You\u0027d have to allow it to just auto-process if scanning data is maxed-out, though, since ISRU is all or nothing; if someone isn\u0027t running SCANsat, and has already ISRU-scanned Minmus, they need a way to be able to trigger it.
