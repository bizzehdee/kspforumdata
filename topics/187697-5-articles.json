Maybe you could design a game such that when you were in a non-hyperbolic orbit, unloaded, fixed conic section orbits are used but active vessels and vessels on hyperbolic orbits (or coming from hyperbolic orbit since last active) obey n-body physics. That said, I wouldn\u0027t bet on the devs adding any of this, mostly because system design is so much harder when you have n-body physics.
