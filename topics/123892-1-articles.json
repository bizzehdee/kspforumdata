Over the past few weeks for example, he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been working on overhauling the buoyancy models for the game and as a result it is now feasible to build working boats or indeed seaplanes. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Among the highlights of the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cfixes and optimizations\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been implementing are the optimization of the Flight Integrator\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s occlusion code, and the ability to transfer Kerbals using the right-click menu rather than clicking on a hatch. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Together with Brian (Arsonide) the contracts have also been given a critical look: the part test contracts will now depend on a constraint system instead of hardcoded values per situation. For example, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s now possible to specify how often a part can be tested \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 once, once per body or once per situation, or even infinitely. The constraints in terms of situations, but also things like flight envelope or different speed requirements can then be applied to certain prestige levels of the contracts. All of these features can be accessed through the part config files as well so that modders can go absolutely crazy with this system, expanding on the moddability efforts we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been going through since 1.0. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;More changes to contracts come in the area of the World First contracts: currently some of these rewards are automatically recorded, but we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re changing the system up so that it applies to all progress on every celestial body. Furthermore, these world firsts are now separate from the main contract system and they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll accumulate into one single report that shows you all earnings you have accumulated. The World First contracts won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t entirely disappear as they are a good way to push you beyond your comfort zone, but in 1.0.5 you will be rewarded for new feats even if you haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t filled out the paperwork, and a new strategy in the Administration Building will enhance this feature. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Of course, Brian hasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t just been working on contracts: small quality of life improvements are also being developed, such as an EVA navball. This navball doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t follow the Kerbal, but rather the camera, allowing players to look around and get their bearings to help (in particular) with ground surveys. Some issues with the science data transmission were also addressed, but mainly there is now an option to automatically abort the transmission when not enough electric charge is available to complete the task, and the science will be placed back in the container from whence it came. The advantage of this system is that it prevents the science from being devalued by repeated signal loss. It is on by default, but you can toggle it off on the antenna if you absolutely must send the data regardless of signal loss.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;More 1.0.5: Chris (Porkjet) has spent these past few weeks mostly working on cockpit internals for the new mk.1 cockpit and crew cabin, aided by Nathanael who implemented quite a few tweaks and small additions to the code that allowed for (for example) new nozzle effects on the jet engines. Thanks to Bob (Roverdude) the Mk3 cargo ramp deployment height will also be freely adjustable, a feature that we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re also considering to add to such things as cargo- and service bays. We saw a request pop up that this be applied to control surfaces as well, but for now that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s outside the scope we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re aiming for.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The cockpit internals will make use of a new shader which will apply lightmaps and ambient occlusion maps to the IVA meshes through a second UV map. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a fancy way of basically saying a lot of time will be saved because the same texture can be reused in several internals, instead of having to create them from scratch every time. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Did we cover everything? Not nearly. Bob (Roverdude) has been working on the new core heat system that we briefly touched upon a few weeks ago. He\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s pretty excited about the system which will not only add more depth to the existing context, but also opens up new possibilities to modders who can use it for things such as nuclear reactors and other high-temperature parts.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The core heat system is \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 essentially \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 a third thermal value to handle cases in which there are extremely high temperatures. Think of the aforementioned nuclear reactors or metal smelters. When drawing a comparison to a computer for example, the internal temperature in KSP represents the temperature in the computer case, whereas the core temperature in KSP represents the temperature of the CPU in the computer. One of the main issues to work around with this system has been the fact that it has to work under timewarp, unlike for example engine heat which can only be generated under regular time progression (or physics warp). \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;A lot of time was spent, and is being spent, making sure this system works well under timewarp and that it is balanced. The QA Team has been giving great feedback on everything from how to balance existing saves, to the gameplay \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153feel\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 of the system. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve included a screenshot of a small new UI element in the gallery below. Aside from all this, Bob has also created a new radiator, and again we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve included a screenshot below.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Now, as we all know we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re working not only on this amazing content patch that is KSP 1.0.5, but work also continues on the Unity 5 update and major the KSP 1.1 update that will encompass it. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Felipe (HarvesteR) has been stuck in \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 you may have guessed it \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 more user interface work, tackling the crew portraits system. In this area a few quality improvements have been made as well, rather than simply overhauling the codebase. The crew portraits quadrant you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re familiar with in the lower right hand corner of the screen will now smoothly scroll to the right and left, instead of just swapping the crews in three static panels as is the case currently \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 and the system is no longer hardcoded to have three portraits. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re currently looking into adding a few extra buttons there to let you expand the portrait gallery to show more than three portraits at once, if your screen width allows for it.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;While overhauling the crew portraits Felipe also got a chance to look into the internal spaces and the implementation of Kerbals in IVA. A longstanding bug was fixed in the process: the orientation of the sun light in internal spaces didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t actually match the sun direction in the outside world. Gone are also the days of the old \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153static overlay\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 effect implementation: instead of switching the portrait\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s texture image to show static (as we now do in 1.1), the old hack had the static and \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153KIA\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 messages rendered by a quad placed in front of the portrait camera, which was a pretty ugly hack although quite characteristic of the olden days of placeholder implementations.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;Jim (Romfarer) has been working on the list of features that were purposely left out on the previous user interface overhauls, polish tasks if you will. One of these tasks are sprite animations in the application launcher. The new sprite animations are now running on the Animator class using its transitions to toggle animations. At the moment it has two transitions: idle and notification. It is fully expandable so we can easily add more transitions down the road. If you want to add your own animated buttons it does require the animator component but only if you want to use the application launcher to automatically handle everything. That said, it is very much possible to attach anything you want to the buttons since animated buttons are only handled by the system as a convenience since that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s what we use internally. Details will follow in documentation.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Finally, Dave (TriggerAU) has been knee-deep in KSPedia work, designing content to fit into a later release. These pieces of content have to cater to a range of knowledge levels and be \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cbite sized\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2, so the biggest challenge has been trying to squeeze that information into single \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CScreens\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, and not make typos in the progress. A few examples have been included in the gallery below. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s about time to wrap up the devnotes now, but we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d like to thank everyone who voted for us in the Golden Joystick awards.
