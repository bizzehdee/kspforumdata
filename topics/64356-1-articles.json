After a few failures, I quickly discovered that I could plot my intercept by altering the planned orbit until the two \u0022nearest\u0022 node markers line up, after which they would quickly be replaced by the \u0027encounter\u0027 and \u0027escape\u0027 nodes. Good, so far, right? Until I get to the encounter node and I find out just how close (or not close) to the target body I really am. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I can see the \u0027nearest\u0027 node markers, I can mouse over them and find out how close it is to the actual target. In the case of other planets, this is usually a few million km. The trouble is, one I find the \u0027encounter\u0027 nodes, I no longer have access to the distance. Ideally, I should be able to tweak the orbit further (a hundred days out or more) to ensure that I intercept at a closer distance, but I see no way (outside of using mechjeb\u0027s autopilot) to accomplish this. When I hit my encounter node, I want to at least be less than a million km away, but from what I can tell, there\u0027s no way to do it. I then end up having to execute a 2-3 minute burn to achieve a stable orbit, when a 5-second burn 100 days ago would\u0027ve made this as easy as pie.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there something I\u0027m overlooking or is there actually no functionality for this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-26T20:55:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you get an encounter node, the trajectory around the target planet is plotted.
