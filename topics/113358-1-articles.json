On my career mode profile, it is time to send 3 Kerbals to Minmus, with a rover! I have made the rover and fit it into a Service Bay that is 2.5m, but I do not know where to place it on my lander. I have included a screenshot, if someone could tell me where would be a good place to put the Service Bay with it so that it can be deployed properly, it would be very much appreciated.
