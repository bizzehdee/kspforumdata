I know that mun lacks atmosphere, so my parachute won\u0027t work, so I\u0027m using thrusters to slow my descent, but it seems that every time I\u0027m trying to land, it\u0027s either the whole thing goes kaboom or my rover just crashed into the surface (usually with broken wheels), even after I\u0027m slowing my descent on full thrust (My rover is placed in a fairing with landing thrusters on stage below). Any idea how to land a rover easily on the mun?
