I have built and shared other craft that were just either fun to play with or eye candy, but had many issues and that were unreliable. With this craft I hope to bring great honor to what I try to build. Good Looking, dependable, durable, multi roll aircraft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mods needed to work with this craft are\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB9 Aerospace\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETT multiwheels\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETT MK4 Plane parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe use of the MK4 fuselage seems to be used very sparingly, I believe this is because the way a plane must be designed with them can look goofy and have difficulty flying and balancing its girth. My design features a rear opening cargo door, a twin tail setup and a high mount aileron for clearance. This makes the craft extremely agile for its size and empty it will take off at 50M/S. Stats are as follows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWet weight 66tons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETest Max Weight 150tons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECruising altitude 15k\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMax Speed 770m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMax power 2000kN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3800 fuel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe COM is slightly behind the COL, as fuel is emptied and cargo is loaded this will shift the COL correctly, fuel drains the rear tail tanks first then the lower tanks in front of the landing gear. This makes for a very very very stable craft. The only real down fall of this plane is the \u0022turbulence\u0022 until you hit 8k. It does like to flex with SAS activated below this altitude, it is not a problem but simply an observation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/9RBhN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
