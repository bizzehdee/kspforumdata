Among them was B9, which claimed that it was easier to use with FAR. I\u0027ve never tried it before. They lied to me. I loaded up the game and tried out a couple of small stock fighters/drones from B9. They all flew beautifully, and even did Immelman turns with complete ease. Then I built a small SSTO with a short cargo bay that I made sure to put the CoM inside and have the fuel drain equally around to avoid CoM issues. I strutted the crap out of it with the B9 invisible struts. It took forever to even make it off of the runway. Despite the perfectly placed CoL, big ass stabilator canards, and mega delta wings with control surfaces, the plane couldn\u0027t pull up at all:huh:. Even trying to made it yaw violently and randomly. I tried adjusting the CoM around a bit and adding a bigger tailplane, but it did nothing. Most of the time the nuke engine on the back connected to an adaptor fell off as soon as the plane limped off the runway. Struts did not help this problem. Next I tried flying the Heinlen SSTO, which has a noob-proof reputation. I followed my standard SSTO flight plan. Pitch up to 45 degrees right off the runway, level out at 13k meters to build horizontal speed, followed by another pitch up to 45 degrees to push the ap up above 70km, during which I usually switch to rocket power. It did do the initial pitch up, but the plane protested by oscillating rapidly along the pitch axis. When I tried to level off the plane buckled violently and went into a major stall. I\u0027m about to give up and crawl back to stock aerodynamics if I don\u0027t find a manual or a tutorial or something.

With FAR, it is easier to fly a plane \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECORRECTLY\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E. However, it does take a basic knowledge of aircraft design. Simply put, if you know how to build both Stock and FAR craft, FAR will be easier. But if you only know how to build stock, stock will obviously be easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, about learning how to build FAR. First, you may want to start with NEAR, it gives your planes the same basic properties as FAR, but is more forgiving. Specifically, you can turn a little harder and your aircraft won\u0027t fall apart and you can go from subsonic to mach without your plane changing it\u0027s flight characteristics. For example, there is no need to move fuel around to balance weight because the Center of Lift will not change based on speed alone with NEAR. What this will do for you is start a migration path, you will eventually move to FAR, but this lets you learn the basics before making such a huge leap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, about your plane. We need more info. Screenshots in the VAB with CoL, CoM, and CoT showing are a big help. The biggest cause of not pulling up off the runway is that your wheels are too far behind the Center of Mass. The wheels are the fulcrum of a lever when taking off, if the fulcrum is too far back, the plane cannot pivot. They should be just barely behind the CoM, if using the stock wheels put the CoM directly in between the two tiny \u0022stripes\u0022 on the wheel housing. If your wheels end up too far forward and you bottom out on lift off, you need to reconsider the placement of your higher mass items on the plane to move the CoM back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second cause is not enough lift and/or speed. The tell tale of this is that the plane will pivot back but the rear wheels won\u0027t leave the ground before the end of the runway. It shouldn\u0027t take a large amount of lift but, like we said, pictures help a lot. Speed can be an issue because FAR rebalances stock engines to fit with it\u0027s parameters. B9 may also be working against you because it rebalanced engines to it\u0027s liking so if your using pre-built stock craft designed for FAR, they may not work when B9 is installed, his reasoning is that he wants B9 engines to act as the upper level engine. However it creates a rather nasty issue with sharing craft in that most creators will say FAR or Stock, but few say FAR with B9 if the craft only contains stock parts. My recommendation is remove B9 till you learn FAR or at least go in and delete the module manager file in B9 that messes with stock engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-02T15:44:05Z\u0022 title=\u002211/02/2014 03:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BrotatoSalad","CreatedById":119211,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-02T16:27:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBut the stock craft I tried were from B9 and were probably designed to work well with FAR.

When you can fly that safely and land, move up to more complex and higher-powered craft. Building these small simple planes will also give you a better handle on some super basic aircraft design principles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you\u0027re just feeling lazy, you can turn off aerodynamic failures in FAR\u0027s options and deal with being a bad pilot with some more SAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne more thing in FAR: I\u0027d recommend activating the FAR panel during flight (push the FAR button). It gives you warnings when you start to stall (may be causing you to flip out) and when you\u0027re getting high dynamic pressure (meaning you\u0027re close to breaking your plane from aero forces).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-02T19:05:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHodo, I couldn\u0027t agree more. If your building an SSTO for example, you may even want your CoL further back to be more stable, this would be prohibitive of turning but why would you be turning an SSTO more than enough to keep your inclination good? Your going to most likely take off at 90 degrees and keep it that way and the same for landing, or only turn to get on a polar trajectory and to come around if you miss the runway. You don\u0027t need to turn on a dime for that. Meanwhile having the CoM further back means less likely the fuel shift will cause reentry problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the opposite end, if you want to take on those Fine Print aerial surveys that are becoming stock, you need to be able to turn.
