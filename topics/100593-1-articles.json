There were a few quirky moments, but the mission was a big step in the space program. The launch was a 2-Kerbal lander in a rather unique design. As you will see, Joe uses a first stage of monopropellant engines, but it has a second stage comprised of small radial motors that use an LFO mix. Below, just after liftoff. The crew for this mission are Karla Kerman and Rodwig Kerman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1381.photobucket.com/user/Mack2247/media/Joe%20on%20Minmus/screenshot906_zpshtjisbyy.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1381.photobucket.com/albums/ah207/Mack2247/Joe%20on%20Minmus/screenshot906_zpshtjisbyy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot906_zpshtjisbyy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAscent went without a hitch, and the crew reached Kerbin orbit safely, which is good, since I didn\u0027t add any type of LES, so if things go RUD they just have to hope for the best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1381.photobucket.com/user/Mack2247/media/Joe%20on%20Minmus/screenshot909_zps0kpdamuo.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1381.photobucket.com/albums/ah207/Mack2247/Joe%20on%20Minmus/screenshot909_zps0kpdamuo.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot909_zps0kpdamuo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trans-minmal burn is shown below.

He celebrates by planting a flag, the plaque of which was just a message citing something about how Minmus was going to taste like minty ice cream... As you can see, the snacks on these boring, long trips are not very tasty, and certain crew members have been near-mutinous half way here, so those certain crew members cannot resist the idea of a tasty destination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1381.photobucket.com/user/Mack2247/media/Joe%20on%20Minmus/screenshot931_zpsrhjanplh.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1381.photobucket.com/albums/ah207/Mack2247/Joe%20on%20Minmus/screenshot931_zpsrhjanplh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot931_zpsrhjanplh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow it was time to do a sub-orbital hop to a new location to see more sights and bring in more \u003Cem\u003EScience!\u003C/em\u003E But, unfortunately, I guess the Kraken had other ideas for the poor Kerbonauts...

Also fortunately, the engine damage was symmetrical, which meant I could decouple the two damaged engine units and use the other two normally. The crew would still have more than enough to get around, especially because this is Minmus... And the lander may be just a tad OP... But never mind that. Below is the second engine unit being jettisoned after Joe is righted. This will allow us to contine the mission normally.
