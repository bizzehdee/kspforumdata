First The kerbals stupid bulbous helmets makes fitting them side by side in the pod difficult (yes they need the helmets unlike the tantares soyuz which can use its orbital module has an airlock to make your ability to eva seem believable). Second that stupid interstage service module makes the design very inflexible if it is to be considered accurate meaning you must either compromise and deviate from the model like corvus does, make a series puzzle piece kit parts like fasa does, or cram all heat shields decouplers fuel tanks and engines into combo parts like tantares does. Third the accurate size is something odd ball like 1.5m (curtquarquesso ran the numbers in the tantares thread) this isn\u0027t so bad for the pod when making customs out if stock parts (the mk1 lander can is bigger than 1.25 as well) but its a killer for anything that is supposed to accurately fit flush with that (so basically the service module, big gemini, the chinese clone, and the lunar variants)\n\nEDIT: to clarify what I mean by 1.5 killing gemini parts other than the gemini pod itself is that a slight possibly blunt overhang on the bottom doesn\u0027t look as bad as a blunt ledge on top, but who knows the size difference is slight maybe it won\u0027t be that big of a deal depending on how they are modeled/textured what we need is some examples.
