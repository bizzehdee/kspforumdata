I recorded this first episode to see if there\u0027s interest, but I want to make sure someone will be watching before dedicating the time to it, since I already have two active series. I consider this episode to be sort of a prologue, it\u0027s more of a demonstration of the concept, but let me know what you think! I\u0027d love to keep trying, since the ultimate goal is just beyond my current abilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZdY-vDNmxio?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"}]}
