I\u0027m trying to keep a vaguely realistic progression so I don\u0027t want to use high tech stuff like ion engines until later on, but the Pyxis is going to be really useful for the near future. Any chance of an intermediate probe in the future, like a larger chemical engined probe with maybe a service bay for science kit that I can send to the Mun, Minmus and Duna/Eve?\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Just saw the Pyxis X4, that\u0027s definitely going to be useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery nice to hear that!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you also checked the Pyxis X4-L? that one is fitted with a parachute for like Duna and Eve. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso please let me know if you have feedback on them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want I can develop a newer probe to fit better in your needs, if so, you can just place a request with the details\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:Or a probe with low-tech parts\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-22T12:55:32Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2015 12:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ferdoni\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlueCanary","CreatedById":131301,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T14:54:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ferdoni\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ferdoni\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EVery nice to hear that!\u003Cp\u003EHave you also checked the Pyxis X4-L? that one is fitted with a parachute for like Duna and Eve. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso please let me know if you have feedback on them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want I can develop a newer probe to fit better in your needs, if so, you can just place a request with the details\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:Or a probe with low-tech parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe a larger modular probe/lander would be nice, with lots of science gear or space for a subsatellite or something might be nice.
