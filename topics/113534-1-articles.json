I plan to fly all the missions with either stock craft or craft from the forum, without doing any more than simple modifications to any of the craft.\n\nI\u0027m doing this because:\n\n-If one more of my own designs leaps twenty feet in the air and disintegrates I\u0027ll cry\n\n-The rocket buidlers forum seems to have a huge amount of companies fighting for a tiny amount of requests (kind of like the real life aviation industry I guess), so I thought doing this would even out the work/companies balance a bit\n\n-I\u0027m lazy\n\nI\u0027m using hard mode career but with the entire tech tree enabled so I don\u0027t have to worry about coordinating tech levels and stuff with contractors. To get craft I\u0027m using forum challenge and rocket builders requests. The most I will do myself is, say, slapping on some surface attached science instruments or attaching premade packages to planes.\n\n**Craft Used:**\n\n**Active Service:**\n\n**Planes:** \n\nStock:\n\n-1 Aeris 3A (Two bought, 1 crashed)\n\n-1 Ravenspear 1 (Two bought, 1 crashed)\n\nAndiron:\n\n-1 Penghu Utility Plane\n\nJeb42:\n\n-1 Unnamed Utility Plane\n\nUnited Aces of Jebediah:\n\n-1 MP-1 Hummingbird Light Sport Plane\n\n**Launchers:**\n\nStock:\n\n-Z-MAP Satellite Launch Kit (3 used)\n\nAndiron:\n\n-Holst Light Launcher (2 used)\n\nFlipNascar:\n\n-El Crappo Light Launcher (3 used)\n\n**Spacecraft:**\n\nRockomax Heavy Industries:\n\n-RMCM-01 Single Kerbal Command/Service Module (3 used)\n\nTelstar Micro Engineering:\n\n-Pyxis SR Satellite/Probe (3 used)\n\n-Auriga SR Heavy Satellite (1 used)\n\n**Other:**\n\nAMRSD:\n\n-1 Kerbike Motorcycle\n\n**Retired:** (none so far)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nDay 1:\n\nI\u0027m starting with 2 Aeris 3A for training pilots and low altitude research, which leaves about 6000 funds left.\n\nA training flight for Val and Jeb leaves the program with 44144 funds and two almost fully fueled Aeris 3A\u0027s on the tarmac.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Two Ravenspear MK1\u0027s were purchased, and one was sent off with Jeb at the controls. Unfortunately it crashed in a landing accident (I was distracted) but Jeb survived and the data was saved. The remaining Ravenspear was taken on a test flight and taxied back to the flight line.\n\nNow was time for the Space Program to actually try to go to space. The available launchers were FlipNascars El Crappo and Andirons Holst. After an unsuccessful El Crappo test (I suck at flying rockets without SAS) the first successful satellite launch was completed with a Holst.\n\nThe Ravenspear was then modified for a couple of part test contracts and returned safely.\n\nNext the program took delivery of two prototype utility/trainer planes from Andiron (the single engined one) and Jeb 42 (twin engined). Both completed successful flights, Jeb and Val getting some more hours logged and Bill and Bob getting some useful scientific research done. Jeb and Val found both planes handled well and were both quickly put into active service but had long landing rolls and high landing speeds, leaving a slot to be filled for a maneuverable short takeoff plane for exploring kerbin.\n\nWith the sun setting over KSC, Jeb, Val, Bill and Bob walked back to the astronaut complex, realising how hard it is walking when you\u0027re wearing a spacesuit and your head is longer than your legs. A request was quickly put in for some ground support vehicles to save any more embarrassing incidents of kerbals tripping over invisible walls and flapping around on the grass.\n\nIt\u0027s in a wierd order for some reason, but here\u0027s the pointlessly long imgur album:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
