It has a large fuel reserve despite it\u0027s small stature and is forgiving to new users in flight. I didn\u0027t design it with any action groups, though it\u0027s jet engines require a different flight technique than straight rockets. I\u0027ve outlined how to fly the craft as well as how to build the more complex parts in the in game vehicle description. Below I\u0027ve included the download link as well as a few pics. I know that one is a night pic, I happened to like how it looked though, so included it.
