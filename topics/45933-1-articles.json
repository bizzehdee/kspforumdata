The best way to avoid problems with it is to rotate your target ship so that the docking port you are aiming at faces perpendicular to your orbit plane, usually either south or north.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen orient your ship\u0027s port to face the opposite direction.

You need to translate using RCS (IJKL) until it is exactly in the center of your navball. At that moment the port is right ahead of you. Don\u0027t forget that if you get some speed using one direction, you need to kill that speed again using the other direction when you reach desired position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there is a yellow marker of your prograde heading. You need to put it over the pink mark. You can move it by combination of directional acceleration (IJKL) and forward/back acceleration (HN). When you put them over each other, you are coming exactly its direction (even if they are not in the center of your navball).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPractice with RCS controls until you get and keep them all aligned.

That\u0027s really not all that big of an issue; when it comes to docking, you want to be using your command module torque for changing direction - it\u0027s for the reason you describe; RCS thrust will screw up your alignment if you use it for rotational control. Shut it off when you want you rotate; turn it on when you want to translate. Go into Chase View and use IJKL to translate as you need to - but remember that you will need to counter-thrust to brake your momentum when you\u0027re in position (if you\u0027ve been pushing J, you\u0027ll need to push L for a bit later on, and vice versa, same goes for I and K).
