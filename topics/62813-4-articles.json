Thinking back to the early nineties, when digital photography and the internet were in it\u0027s infancy, I got all astronomy books I could get from the public library, and the best deep sky pictures in them were not nearly as good. And they were taken from Mount Palomar with a 5 m mirror on photographic plates, stuff no amateur could dream of... It\u0027s just amazing what is possible today. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith regard to shaking scopes, I think one problem is that a lot of amateur scopes have bad mountings and weak tripods. They are built to a price point, and the money goes into the dimensions of the optics, which will be the selling point. When I got my 8 inch Newton mirror, I talked to some guys from the local amateur astronomers club about wether I should invest into a better mounting, and they told me to go with a more solid tripod first. They said that a telescope should be built from the ground up, and I got a strong wooden tripod made for geodesy that made a lot of a difference. Maybe you can see if you can exchange some parts, I\u0027ve had a cheap scope where the main screws were compatible with photographic tripod shoes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if your scope tips over, it\u0027s not balanced. Maybe you can move the bellows that hold the tubus to balance it out? (If it has bellows.) That might help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: If your tripod has telescoping legs, you could try and retract them a segment or two from the bottom up.

I shot about 330 frames and compiled them to play back at 15 FPS. 30FPS is more standard for video but everything seemed to move too fast at that rate so I slowed it down to 1/2 speed. I quit shooting at 330 frames because the battery in my camera ran out. I had another battery but I wouldn\u0027t have been able to change it without moving the camera so I didn\u0027t bother. Instead, I used the second battery to get some still shots of the milky way, etc. If I go down to the desert again, I\u0027ll have to get a higher mAh battery grip for my camera so that I can let it run longer.

Yes, it\u0027s quite the eyeopener that Saturn is so large absolutely and as seen from here. Basically about the same diameter as the theoretical limit of resolution of the human eye (0.5 arc minutes or something like that). Also, Jupiter and it\u0027s moons --- kind of strange to think about how the gallilean moons should almost be visible to the naked eye if it were not for the large contrast.
