Jerdous had a heavy-lidded, vacant stare and a big goofy grin on his face. Edgas didn\u0027t think he was feeling much of anything at the moment. He usually lacked the stomach for such things, but had stared, transfixed, as the myriad of arms and articulated tools first scanned and analyzed the deep gash in Jerdous\u0027s head, then meticulously cleaned and debrided it, repaired the small temporal artery, cauterized several smaller bleeders, stitched the surrounding connective tissue back together, then finally closed the skin with medical staples. All with minimal interaction from Chadvey on the control panel, who seemed only slightly familiar with it. Edgas thought he might be sick again, but it was truly amazing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Now isn\u0027t that a thing,\u0022 Chadvey said quietly, apparently sharing the idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Geh-heeeeeeeheheheh,\u0022 said Jerdous as he groggily pointed at an errant drop of blood floating by.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe automated medical suite in the med-bay had scanned Edgas too, who was unhurt other than some bumps and bruises, a mildly sprained arm, and a big lump on his head. He and Jerdous had both escaped without concussions. Fortunately, Kerbals had very thick skulls. It was said a Kerbal could fall from nearly any height and survive as long as he landed on his head. Experiments exploring this were an ongoing project at the space center.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA tone from the machine signaled that it had finished. Chadvey began to wrap a lighter bandage around Jerdous\u0027s head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hmmm, doesn\u0027t usually effect people quite like that,\u0022 he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Butter,\u0022 said Jerdous, and launched into a fit of hissing giggles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Maybe the lowered consciousness filter is just revealing his true nature,\u0022 Burdous said blankly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadvey looked at the medication vial in the hypospray he had used, then touched some icons on the med-bot\u0027s screen, \u0022Ah gave him the right dose...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Anesthesia can have strange effects on some people,\u0022 Edgas said.

They used the venom of an indigenous aquatic snail to anesthetize the fellow. Why, he was havin\u0027 a grand ol\u0027 time even tho\u0027 they had \u0027is belly open like \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E,\u0022 Chadvey gestured with his hands wide apart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hurk,\u0022 said Edgas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022DONT YOU START THAT AGAIN OR SO HELP ME I WILL STAB YOU WITH A SPOON!\u0022 shrieked Burdous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas swallowed hard. He must have been really, \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E attached to that shirt. Jerdous found the entire exchange uproariously funny. Or maybe it was still \u0027butter.\u0027 He cackled on in breathy, hissing way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBurdous sighed and rubbed his eyes, \u0022ugh, why don\u0027t you two put Dr. Giggles here to bed, and I\u0027ll go begin the ignition procedure. I\u0027ll need you both on his station until I get the engine stabilized.

Edgas choked for a moment then joined in. Jerdous looked like wanted to disappear. Chadvey grinned. He sat down at the table with a steaming bowl of mush.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Not you too,\u0022 said Jerdous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, the lad does have a point,\u0022 he gestured to Edgas, \u0022it really is quite good. Besides, it hasn\u0027t kilt him yet.\u0022 Burdous was still laughing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Has the whole world gone mad?\u0022 Jerdous put a palm to his face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBurdous coughed himself under control, \u0022well, I\u0027ve run the final calculations and adjusted the course. I\u0027m running the pressure extremely low until I know what caused that pipe to fail. We\u0027re maintaining thrust but loosing efficiency. We\u0027ll make Jool in about ten days, but we\u0027re looking at a six month return trip.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Six months?!\u0022 Said Edgas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh good, Ah could use a v\u0027cation,\u0022 Chadvey grinned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We won\u0027t be able to maintain constant high thrust,\u0022 Burdous explained, \u0022have to run on nuclear fuel only for the most part. Only a few hundredths of a G.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022After this, I think we\u0027ll all need a vacation,\u0022 sighed Jerdous, \u0022but aren\u0027t we getting a little ahead of ourselves here? I\u0027d still like to hear this grand plan of yours, Chadvey.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, don\u0027t you worry, now, it\u0027s all well in hand,\u0022 said Chadvey, \u0022few more details to work out, that\u0027s all. Have a bit more readin\u0027 to do.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You don\u0027t have a plan, do you?\u0022 Jerdous said blankly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Now, lad, have ya ever known me to jump in all willy-nilly without a plan?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, no, I suppose not, but I still-- what?\u0022 Jerdous noticed Edgas staring intently at him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You, um, you\u0027ve got a speck in your eye,\u0022 said Edgas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What? I--ow! Ow! Damn!\u0022 Jerdous winced and put a hand to his eye, \u0022you\u0027re right, must have picked it up from all the crud floating around earlier. Excuse me.\u0022 Jerdous awkwardly climbed the ladder up toward the space-bathroom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Mmmmmmmmmmm,\u0022 said Chadvey, chewing, \u0022could use something to add a little kick, but it is surprisingly good. Real stick-to-your-ribs fair.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s because it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Eadhesive\u003C/em\u003E,\u0022 groaned Burdous with a hand to his face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But, er, six months?\u0022 began Edgas, \u0022can we last that long?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027ve got hard supplies worth a couple of years, more, even, if you two savages keep eating spackle,\u0022 said Burdous, \u0022air and water are completely recycled, with backup stores to augment that. Six months is barely a shakedown cruise.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSix months in space. A typical tour on the space station, one which Edgas had never actually finished. Out here in the middle of nowhere. It was a bit unnerving, but then he remembered that that would be the \u003Cem\u003Eeasy\u003C/em\u003E part. The true test awaited at Jool. He just wished he had some idea what it was.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas pressed his head against the cold surface of the window in his cubicle. Several days since the engine malfunction, and life aboard was becoming nearly routine. From here, he could just barely make out Jool, back towards the rear of the ship. Only it was also the bottom. Space was weird like that. It had finally resolved into more than a bright point of light, but only just. He could barely discern the deep green disk, and the three tiny specks of the Galikerman moons. He remembered seeing such a view through his small backyard telescope when he was just a young Kerblet, to see it now with his own wide (and rather bloodshot) eyes was mesmerizing. In only two more days they would skim past Jool and on to their final destination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas leaned back and rubbed his eyes. That was still a long way off. Despite pouring over paperwork for days he was still no closer to unraveling the truth. It was always just out of sight, like a dim star. He picked up the small thumb drive again, and turned it over in his stubby fingers. Maybe this would be something. Out of all the drives he had been through, none had been encrypted. Until this one. And it had been written on in that strange not-quite-right Ussari script. The encryption protocol seemed extremely complex, Edgas knew it was out of his territory. But that would mean bringing it to Burdous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWas there really any reason not to trust him? Chadvey had said not to trust anyone, not even him. But the three of them seemed like very old friends. Was he just being dramatic? He did have that flair. Edgas hated this cloak-and-dagger nonsense. He was a trillion miles from anywhere, he was going to have to trust \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003Eone! But the engine...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould Burdous really sabotage his own engine? He seemed more attached to it than even that ridiculous shirt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EIt did get you off the ship... and nearly got you killed.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould Burdous \u003Cem\u003Einduce\u003C/em\u003E a failure in just the right place like that? Then leave the circuit open to blow the valve? Then bypass the break to move on? Dammit, it was always so \u003Cem\u003Econvenient\u003C/em\u003E. What was he \u003Cem\u003Emissing?\u003C/em\u003E What is it he couldn\u0027t see??\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas sighed, this wasn\u0027t getting him any closer either. He needed to know what was on that thumb drive. He would have to play his hand and talk to Burdous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe stepped out onto the crew deck and looked around. Chadvey was in his bunk, snoring with a sound like a wounded animal. The thin door did little to muffle it. Jerdous was down on the command deck, monitoring the engine and listening to soft music as usual. That meant Burdous was probably in his cubicle. Edgas crossed to it, took a breath, knocked on the door.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022S\u0027open,\u0022 said the voice from inside, \u0022oh, it\u0027s you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hi, I... um....\u0022 Edgas stopped dead. Covering nearly every wall of the tiny room were pictures, drawings, and clippings. Edgas glanced around, every one seemed to be of an oddly proportioned female, in every color imaginable. Some of them did indeed have hair in strange places. Or none at all. Then he noticed Burdous giving him that cold, measuring stare again. He would have to choose his next words very carefully.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Um... er...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022...yes?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ugh, look, I found this thumb drive in the boxes of drives Jerdous left for me. It\u0027s heavily encrypted, I can\u0027t even figure out what\u0027s written on it. It seems like gibberish.\u0022 He handed the drive to Burdous, who looked it over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Trying to transliterate\u00A0into Ussari?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, but, it doesn\u0027t make sense. I\u0027m passable enough speaking the language, but I can\u0027t read it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s because it\u0027s not in Ussari.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s not?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, it\u0027s Erakonian. Common mistake for those who don\u0027t know the culture. South Erakonia officially changed writing systems a few decades ago after that little spat with the Ussaris that left the country divided. But sometimes you still see the old letters used. Says \u0027whiterabbit.doc.\u0027\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Can you access it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Pfft,\u0022 said Burdous. He pulled out a very small laptop from somewhere, plugged the drive in, and began typing away. \u0022Well hello, there, lil\u0027 fella,\u0022 he grinned at the screen, \u0022show me your secrets... hm... hmmmmmm... now that\u0027s unusual... don\u0027t worry, I\u0027ll be gentle... oh cra--!\u0022 The screen went blank and something popped and sparked. Edgas gasped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What just happened?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Curiouser and curiouser,\u0022\u00A0Burdous murmured\u00A0absently as he stared at the smoking computer, rubbing at\u00A0his chin, \u0022I thought it was \u003Cem\u003Epossible\u003C/em\u003E, that\u0027s why I used the ol\u0027 sacrificial lamb here, but wasn\u0027t expecting they\u0027d actually \u003Cem\u003Edo \u003C/em\u003Ethat.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What? Who?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Whoever made this. You\u0027re right, it\u0027s some very, very high level stuff. Most government stuff isn\u0027t this high. Most. They even included a destructive self-defense back door, very hard to do. Whatever\u0027s on here, someone really wanted to keep it from prying eyes.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So you can\u0027t decrypt it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Pfft, puh-leeze. You really don\u0027t know who you\u0027re dealing with, do you?\u0022 Burdous actually smirked, \u0022it\u0027ll take me some time, probably a few weeks. Have to be very, very careful with that subroutine.

No one made sound. The interior of the massive ship was silent, and still, save for the dim susurrus of the air handlers and the computer occasionally announcing pertinent information. For over an hour now, no one had said a word. Each of the four Kerbals was fused to a window, eyes wide, mouths agape, faces cast in an ethereal green glow. Rational thought, scientific analysis, excited speculation, all these had been wiped from their minds an hour ago. They could do nothing but stare, fascinated and uncomprehending like children before the divine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJool. The mightiest of worlds. Those cultures that did not call it king called it deity. The ship now passed within a hundred kilometers of its cloud tops, so close that atmospheric drag was measurable, if insignificant. Below them, now easily seen by their own eyes, clouds in every imaginable shade of green roiled and raged. Tumbling, churning, seething, the clouds flailed and writhed and twisted like...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E...like the grief of a despondent father...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPresently, they passed over the terminator, the greens giving way to brilliant gold, fiery red, and royal purple. Lightning bolts stretching for thousands of kilometers highlighted the boiling clouds in the growing darkness. And all around the ship, glowing auroras in hundreds of iridescent colors silently danced and swayed as radiation deflected around it. It was beyond imagination. The engine was quiet now, all power diverted to that magnetic field that kept the radiation at bay and created the auroras. If it were to fail, they would all die instantly. If they were lucky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey had passed very near to the deep blue jewel of Laythe, close enough to see dim sunlight sparkle on alien waves. Laythe, where it was said the oceans were so salty you could walk on them. Laythe, with its unexplainably breathable atmosphere, a possible oasis for life out here in the frigid void. They had passed so close with nearly mundane indifference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ice world of Vall had beckoned them too, all pale blue glaciers and frosted mountain tops. They had passed through the ejecta plume of a cryovolcano, across the shining, broken, nearly craterless young surface, and back out into space again, never slowing in their path.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPol lingered deep in the darkness as a barely realized speck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd finally, mighty Tylo: lifeless, pallid, still; like an undead guardian. It glowered at them menacingly from a safe distance, ever watchful. Accusing. Never trusting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ship swung around the dark side of Jool, her own auroras danced around the poles, flashes reflected in the night. Then even Great Jool began to recede, her waning crescent seeming to follow them as they drifted away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That was the most beautiful thing Ah\u0027ve ever seen,\u0022 said Chadvey to no one in particular, \u0022Ah could die a happy Kerb now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor another day, the ship drifted, colors shimmering around the hull, until it was at last clear of the deadly radiation belts, and began its final braking maneuver high over the lumpy and misshapen world of Bop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey all felt it. After the ethereal beauty of Jool, it was jarring and disorienting, like falling from a warm bath into an icy river. And for Edgas, it was like opening an old wound. Only he could really tell, Chadvey had been right. Even though it made his skin crawl, \u003Cem\u003Eit\u003C/em\u003E was weaker here. As the massive ship passed in cold tranquility over the chaotic surface of Bop, every Kerbal on board knew. There was something down there, something... \u003Cem\u003Enot right.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNobody felt much like eating. Which was an extreme feeling for a Kerbal. They agreed that immediately descending to the surface might not be prudent. They could all use some rest, and time for the ship\u0027s limited instruments to gather more data. It was deathly quiet on board now, each Kerbal huddled in their small cubicle, finally realizing the enormity of their situation, yet trying not to think about it at the same time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas sat, or rather floated, once more going over documents and being frustrated. At least it took his mind off what was outside. He was very tired, but dreaded the prospect of trying to sleep. Reality wavered and crackled.

Mah one window has a truly stupendous view of the flat across the way. Ah\u0027ve seen the rather homely occupant of which naked so many times that in Ibtetia we\u0027d be legally married. In the last year, Ah\u0027ve been home exactly three weeks two days and four and a half hours, and not all at once.

Ah\u0027ve seen... so many incredible things in mah life. The curvature of Kerbin passing out of the atmosphere. A blue marble, rising over the stark limb of the M\u00FCn. The great cavy migration across the windswept plains of Nusad. The aurora borealis over Kermangrad, on a frigid, crystal night. The desert of Gerin become vivid green, in its centennial bloom. Gunboats on fire off the shoulder of Erboon. Ah\u0027ve watched c-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannh\u00E4user Gate. And now, the sunset, over the deep green clouds of Jool. Never in mah long life did Ah think Ah would see that.

Well, except for that poor fellow in the tavern in Dachland, had to show him his own elbow, Ah did, ya just dunna say that to a lady,\u0022 he shook his head, \u0022anyway, Ah always acted with the best of intentions, for the greater good.

It\u0027s gonna be a long, slow burn... not much power in this little thing.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLong and slow it\u00A0was, but uneventful. From their cramped position in the lower pod, Chadvey, Edgas, and Burdous could do little but wait, and occasionally strain to see out of the small windows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Burn complete. Ok... course looks good, we\u0027re on target to initial point. Looks like five minutes of coasting to braking burn.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Copy,\u0022 said Chadvey, \u0022Edgas, can you reach that thing now? No good having junk bouncing around the cabin.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, I think so.\u0022 Edgas loosened his harness and reached toward the floating object. For a moment, he could have sworn it floated right into his glove. It was...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Goo?\u0022 said Burdous, \u0022I thought we stowed it all back on the ship.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We did...\u0022 Edgas said. He looked over the object in his gloved hands. It was a fist sized canister of Mystery Goo. From the clear window in the side, they could all see it was glowing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s... odd...\u0022 Chadvey mused, \u0022never seen Goo do that before.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s Goo, it does odd things all the time,\u0022 Burdous grunted, \u0022we still call it \u0027goo\u0027 for crepes\u0027 sake.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Better get it out of the way lad, don\u0027t need--\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe canister of Goo \u003Cem\u003Eexploded\u003C/em\u003E, leaving the three surprised Kerbals blinking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What in the bloody green blazes--?!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ewwwwwww!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s all sticky!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I didn\u0027t do anything!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027ve been slimed!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Are you lads all right?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Moho\u0027s belt! It\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Eevery\u003C/em\u003Ewhere.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas wiped the Goo from his faceplate. It clung like glue, \u0022Er, is this safe?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ah dunno, lad. Never been covered in goo before. Well except for that one time in Gomlonila, that was--\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022STOP!\u0022 Burdous shrieked, shoving a finger in Chadvey\u0027s faceplate, \u0022not. Another. Word. It\u0027s bad enough I\u0027ll have to clean \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E stuff out of the pod now, Hurky McBarfsalot here does NOT need to hear \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E little gem.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe intercom buzzed, \u0022um... is everything all right down there?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ach, we\u0027re fine here. Just redecorating.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Redeco--? Wait, wait I can \u003Cem\u003Esee\u003C/em\u003E something!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe three Kerbals tried in vain to look out the windows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What\u0027ve you got, lad?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Can\u0027t really tell... it\u0027s big, sticks out from the surrounding terrain like a sore thumb... pale. Only a couple of kilometers off our course. The immediate area\u0027s no good for landing, too many boulders. I\u0027m gonna have to set down in a small crater, maybe a half kilometer away. Hang on, making course corrections now...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe lander descended slowly on a meager jut of flame, bounced once, then settled onto its pads. Chadvey, Burdous, and Edgas wasted no time in depressurizing their capsule and squeezing out the tiny door out onto the surface, slipping frequently on the Goo that clung to every surface. There was no need to deploy a ladder. Here on the lonely, dim surface of Bop, gravity was minuscule, a drop of a couple of meters was only the slightest bump.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas tried to steady himself, the low gravity only adding to smothering feeling of wrongness of the place. Although broad daylight, it was dim as evening. The diminished sun hung low in the sky, he barely needed to shield his eyes as he gazed upward. In one part of the sky, Jool still hung imposingly. He looked over the moons, Laythe, Vall, Tylo, and the speck of Pol, all locked in their eternal dance. He then looked across the sky, and there was everything else, spread out like chained captives. The glint of Moho, the purple of Eve, crimson Duna, lonely Dres, even a sparkle of distant Eeloo, which struck him as odd.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd of course, the pale blue dot that was his home. Everything he had ever known, everything he had ever experienced, and billions of souls going about their lives blissfully unaware, all hung there like motes in a sunbeam. Helpless. And here were the great heroes, bouncing around comically, covered in ooze.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas finally tore his gaze away. He was feeling more and more uneasy. They had revealed themselves to an unknown predator. It was watching them now, waiting, biding its time. They couldn\u0027t see it, and it would attack at a time of its own choosing. Edgas shuddered, then blundered over to help Chadvey and Burdous unload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJerdous had finally finished securing the lander. He descended now from his pod, and looked at the other Kerbals in vague confusion, \u0022ok, what happened to you three?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Don\u0027t ask,\u0022 grumbled Burdous, trying unsuccessfully to wipe more Goo from his faceplate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do ya have the seals?,\u0022 Chadvey asked Jerdous, who grinned and delicately patted a pouch on his suit, \u0022good, keep them safe. Ah think we\u0027re about done here. Gather what yer taking and let\u0027s be off.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The plan?\u0022\u00A0Jerdous raised an eye... bulge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The plan,\u0022 grinned Chadvey, \u0022now everyone, use yer suit jets if you need to but try to conserve, no sense flying around all willy-nilly.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAwkwardly, the four of them set off, bounding across the surface like deranged beach toys. It did not take them long to locate what Jerdous had seen. Its sickly yellow-green cast conflicted starkly with the dim brown boulder-strewn landscape. In little time, they were standing before it, wide-eyed and slack-jawed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Congratulations, Chadvey,\u0022\u00A0Burdous said flatly, \u0022it\u0027s a... squid.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was no denying the resemblance. The form laying on the surface looked like an enormous, bloated, half-rotten squid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Look,\u0022 Edgas pointed, \u0022it\u0027s been blinded!\u0022 What appeared to be huge eyes did indeed look to have been mutilated, one laying on the ground near its empty socket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Something doesn\u0027t feel right here,\u0022 Burdous\u00A0looked\u00A0around nervously, \u0022like, \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E not right.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, no it doesn\u0027t,\u0022 agreed Chadvey.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So now how about this grand plan, O Fearless Leader?\u0022 asked Jerdous facetiously, setting down the bulky laser.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, Ah was kind of hoping something would happen.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s it?\u0022 Jerdous said with a blank look, \u0022that\u0027s your plan?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadvey just shrugged, not easily done in a space suit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I knew it,\u0022 Jerdous threw his arms up rising a few centimeters, \u0022he never even had a plan.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Um... don\u0027t think that\u0027ll fit in the lander...\u0022 Burdous observed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas cautiously hopped over to huge yellowish form.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Careful, lad,\u0022 said Chadvey, holding up a hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas nodded. Something.... something in his head was trying to click. All around, reality shimmered and wavered, making it very hard to think. He reached out a hesitant hand, and gingerly touched the surface.... Nothing. Nothing at all happened. Except... he looked closer, made a brushing motion with his hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What do you see?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSickly yellow-green dust puffed from the surface, then slowly drifted to the ground. Something gleamed in the light from his helmet lamps. He brushed again, and again, and again, squinting, pinching his brow. He retrieved a small rock hammer from a suit pocket, and gave the surface a good whack. It went \u003Cem\u003Eclink\u003C/em\u003E. Edgas couldn\u0027t hear it, but felt the subtle vibrations though his gloved hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis thoughts began to fire in a chain reaction, each one triggering another. Growing realization slowly dawned on him... and his eyes widened in rising horror.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EOh no...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EOh NO!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe looked up. The whole thing was made of the same substance as the other seals. Only there \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E no third seal. There were no seals at all. This structure, whatever its manifestation in this reality...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No....\u0022 Edgas whispered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a moment, panic swirled in his gut, but only for a moment. There was no point in panic. It was already too late. They were as good as dead. Except for... Slowly, too slowly, Edgas began to turn. This thing... the discs... they weren\u0027t seals... this... this was a \u003Cem\u003Eprison\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd they had brought the keys.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is no sound in space. No medium, to carry the vibrations. So it was a cruel twist of irony, that Chadvey Kerman, who had always lived life so loud, died in silence, his body slowly toppling over backwards in the meager gravity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-02-08T01:04:23Z\u0022 title=\u002202/08/2018 01:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 8, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FonVegen","CreatedById":105181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T11:24:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt takes a certain amount of talent to take me from smiling at \u0022MechIvan\u0022, to broadening my smile with that Carl Sagan bit, just to completely crush the mood with that cliffhanger in the end \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECongratulations, you just made yourself one of my favourite writers... now onwards to waiting for the final chapters!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*waits heroically*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat might take a while, I assume?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"teepee2345","CreatedById":98846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T12:09:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewow i did NOT see that coming.
