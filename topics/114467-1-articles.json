Having never used KCT before, I\u0027m sort of blindly flailing here, but I put 14 of them into the VAB to increase Build Rate 1 from 0.10 BP/s to 0.80 BP/s. That should help us actually get these first rockets off the ground ASAP. I put the last two into the R\u0026D Facility to raise Development from 0.5 science/day to 2.0 science/day.\n\nHaving been given final approval by the komrades in the Kerblin, the Koviet Space Center has finally been formally established, outfitted with all of the latest in aerospace technology and the best and brightest personnel.\n\nIt\u0027s not much to look at, but that\u0027s Koviet aesthetics for you. From such humble beginnings, a mighty, Kerbol-system-spanning space program shall arise like a zombie. There may be awkward, uncertain movements. There may be no evidence of intelligent thought. There may be blood and death. But there will be a single-minded determination that will not be diverted from its goal by anything short of a bullet to the head, or perhaps a government shut-down.\n\nAfter getting our bearings, we head over to Mission Control to see what lofty assignments await us.\n\nI had the usual starting options, of course\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACthings like \u0022Orbit Kerbin\u0022\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACbut naturally, in the interest of starting out realistic, took as my two contracts the \u0022Launch Our First Vessel\u0022 and \u0022Gather scientific data from Kerbin.\u0022 Lofty is a relative term, anyway. Our missions will at least have some modicum of loft to them, in any case. We shall meet the Party-mandated loft quota.\n\nWith our tasks thus bestowed, it\u0027s time to take inventory of the kind of arsenal that can only be achieved through central planning and unwavering state support.\n\nOpenTree starts you out with the \u0022Start\u0022 Tech, which bestows the Basic Fin, 2HOT Thermometer, Mk16 Parachute, Modular Girder Segment, M-1x1 Structural Panel, and M-Beam 200 I-Beam Pocket Edition. As my first time with OpenTree, I couldn\u0027t help but notice the absence of a command module or any sort of propulsion system.\n\nFortunately, OpenTree also gives you 5 science, to pick between Unmanned Tech (allowing the unlock of the Stayputnik Mk. 1, the Sepratron I Solid Thruster, and the Small Inline Reaction Wheel) or Manned Tech (unlocking the Mk1 Command Pod, RT-5 \u0022Flea\u0022 Solid Fuel Booster, and Pegasus I Mobility Enhancer). I went with Unmanned Tech, more for flavor than anything else.\n\nSo, with my science selection made, time accelerates as the Koviet scientists get to work. About 51 hours later (Y1, D2, H3), the research is complete! I pay my \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A14,100 Krubles to unlock the three parts from Unmanned Tech, and it\u0027s time to begin work designing the first mission for the Koviet Space Program!\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Zero. I have been to zero other planets. I\u0027m coming back from a very long hiatus, having last played the game in 0.22. Back then, I took a couple of one-way probes to land on Duna and Eve, and that\u0027s it. Nowhere else, no other planetary flights, bagel. So it should certainly be interesting!\n\nSuffice it to say I\u0027ll be making abundant use of unmanned probes as \u0022scouting\u0022 missions to test how safe a given mission plan is.

The boys down in R\u0026D had been hard at work, but they must have been working on their pet side projects because when it came time for them to present the results of their labor, all they had to show the committee was a chirping metal sphere, a few used aerosol cans that somebody had stuffed solidified explosives into, and a disc with some small but dense ball bearings inside.\n\nRather than admit to the Kerblin that the party-sanctioned scientists down in the R\u0026D lab were obviously buffoons, the program director decided to use some Koviet ingenuity to turn potatoes into mashed potatoes, as the saying goes, and so work began on designing the **Cricket I**, aptly named after the annoying chirping sphere that was appropriated to serve as its core component. The KSP would be hard-pressed to turn these raw materials into anything truly impressive, but fortunately their assignments did not demand impressiveness: Only a simple data collection on the launchpad, and a demonstration that kerbals could, in fact, build something capable of leaving the ground. Underwhelming objectives, perhaps, but that would not dissuade our intrepid engineers!\n\n- **Cricket I**  \n\n    - Stayputnik Mk. 1 Probe Core  \n\n        - (x3) 2HOT Thermometers, attached to the core, for measurements at the launchpad, in flight, and upon landing\n\n        [\\*](x4) M-1x1 Structural Panels, arranged in an open box around the Stayputnik core\n\n        [\\*]Mk16 Axial Parachute, attached to the top of the open box, in order to ensure a mostly-intact landing.\n\n        [\\*]Small Inline Reaction Wheel\n\n        [\\*]Modular Girder Segment\n\n        [\\*](x4) Basic Fins\n\n        [\\*](x2) Sepratron I Solid Fuel Thrusters, with the thrust limiter at 40%\n\n        [\\*]Total Cost: \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A14,417\n\n        [\\*]Construction Time: 7d, 4h, 9m\n\nConstruction on ***Cricket I*** was completed on Y1-D11-H1-M11, and rollout to the launchpad was accomplished seven minutes later. Given the momentous nature of the event, however, the decision was made to delay launch until the following morning for better photo opportunities. So it was that, on Y1-D11-H4-M42, the Koviet Space Program initiated the launch of its inaugural craft!\n\nThe flight was not exactly overwhelmingly impressive, but it went off flawlessly and achieved all of its stated objectives. During its 1\u002746\u0022 flight, ***Cricket I*** achieved an altitude of 424 meters and covered a total distance of over 1.2 kilometers. Its thrusters, to nobody\u0027s surprise, had a short operational life, but served their purpose with traditional Koviet determination. Three temperature measurements were recorded, including one during the craft\u0027s short airborne period. After exhausting the thrusters, the Mk16 parachute was deployed and returned ***Cricket I*** safely and relatively intact to the surface, although the stabilizing fins were ruined by the impact.\n\nAlthough ***Cricket I*** failed to even leave the campus of the Koviet Space Center, its short flight showed that Kerbals *can* use explosives to throw things into the air, and it promised that, one day, they might even use explosives to throw things to the great shiny objects above.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

They took 15 of these pieces and began research into Manned Tech (5 Science) and Light Rocketry I (10 Science), to be conducted over the next few days. The Koviet Space Program also received considerable (for the fledgling operation) financial awards, as well as a small boost in its overall prestige. Great things awaited!\n\nThe program director was so encouraged that he accepted contracts not only to leave the atmosphere of Kerbin, but even to put a ship into orbit around it! (These two contracts, the only two left in Mission Control, were accepted mostly as a formality, and because the Orbit contract \u0022expired\u0022 after only a couple of days. Nothing else was going on, so it wouldn\u0027t hurt to get them into the hopper if nothing else.)\n\nAs the excitement following the success of ***Cricket I*** subsided, focus turned to the next step. Although ***Cricket I*** had shown the capacity for flight, it was brief and slow. The Sepratrons may have served a demonstrative function but more *oomph* would be necessary for the next step.\n\nTwo \u0022upgrades\u0022 had been awarded in KCT, and both were spent on VAB Rate 1, bringing the construction speed up from 0.8 BP/s to 0.90 BP/s.\n\nAbout two and a half days after the recovery of ***Cricket I***, research into Manned Tech was completed, and access to the three component parts was purchased. The sum of \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A13,500 unlocked the Mk1 Command Pod, the RT-5 \u0022Flea\u0022 Solid Fuel Booster, and the Pegasus I Mobility Enhancer. Despite the name of this particular technological \u0022node\u0022, as the komrades in the R\u0026D trailer referred to the collection of breakthroughs, due to concerns over crew safety no immediate plans were made to strap a kerbal to a barely-controlled explosion and hope for the best. Instead, the engineers returned to the basic design that had served ***Cricket I*** so well, planning to modify it to accommodate the new advancements in propulsion represented by the RT-5 Solid Fuel Booster.\n\n**Cricket II**\n\n- **Mission Objectives**  \n\n    - Avoid endangering komrades by relying on uncrewed probe cores rather than crewed command modules\n    - Faster, Higher, Farther \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Achieve new records in speed, altitude, and distance.  \n\n        - Specifically, the Minister demands a speed of 150 m/s, an altitude of 3.5 km, and a distance of 5.0 km from the Koviet Space Center campus.\n\n        [\\*]Recover the craft intact, and take a temperature reading of the landing site\n\n    [\\*]**Construction**\n\n    - Stayputnik Mk.1 Probe Core\n    - (4x) M-1x1 Structural Panels in an open box\n    - 2HOT Thermometer to read the temperature at the landing site\n    - Mk16 Axial Parachute\n    - Small Inline Reaction Wheel\n    - RT-5 \u0022Flea\u0022 Solid Fuel Booster (Thrust Limiter 20%)\n    - (4x) Basic Fin\n\n    [\\*]**Engineer\u0027s Report**\n\n    - 13 parts, 3.2m height\n    - 2,045 kg gross weight (1,050 kg solid fuel, 995 kg dry weight)\n    - TWR at launch of 1.62, with estimated burn of 44.2 seconds\n    - Construction Time: 1d, 4h, 12m\n    - Construction Cost: \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A12,642\n\nConstruction on ***Cricket II*** was completed on Y1-D15-H5-M58, approximately five hours before the anticipated completion of the research into Light Rocketry I, and rollout was begun. On the 16th day of the program\u0027s existence, ***Cricket II*** was ready for launch.\n\nUnfortunately for the Koviet Space Program, a combination of errors made in the design and operation of the craft became evident almost immediately. Overly \u0022twitchy\u0022 controls caused the craft to begin tipping over too early in its flight, and the low thrust limitation on the SR-5 engine failed to generate enough velocity for the fins to adequately stabilize the trajectory. Manual control was necessary to attempt to maintain a proper flight vector, which rapidly drained the Stayputnik core of its electrical reserves. The shut-down of the core made it impossible to activate the craft\u0027s parachute, and a result the ***Cricket II*** crashed hard into the ocean approximately 6.9 km east of the Koviet Space Center.\n\n- **Mission Results**  \n\n    - **Flight Time:** 00:01:00\n    - **Science Recovered:** 0\n    - **Salvage Recovered:** 0\n    - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Avoid endangering komrades by relying on uncrewed probe cores rather than crewed command modules\n    - **Qualified** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Faster, Higher, Farther \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC The ***Cricket II*** achieved a velocity of 191 km/s and covered 6.9 km on the ground (8.4 km total traveled), but its maximum altitude of 1.73 km fell far short of the target 3.5 km.\n    - **Failure** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Recover the craft intact, and take a temperature reading of the landing site\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I like (again, for aesthetics) starting with uncrewed craft, although it certainly has its challenges\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACsuch as the fact that an axial parachute can\u0027t \u0022naturally\u0022 be attached to the Stayputnik, so if I want recoverable craft I have to do some Kerbal Engineering in order to shenanigan my way into it. Being limited to the Stayputnik also, as I found out with Cricket II, is particularly rough when you\u0027re trying to steer before the invention of batteries, since its electrical charge capacity is so low (10 EC!). Running out of EC caught me badly off-guard, and for a few panicked seconds I couldn\u0027t figure out why my parachute stage wasn\u0027t firing... I right-clicked on the parachute in an effort to \u0022manually deploy\u0022 it, but the option still wasn\u0027t there, and that\u0027s when it clicked that I had killed the core\u0027s battery. Fortunately, it was all over a few short seconds later. ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I am Really looking forward to this Landwalker- I hope you can maintain the level of detail and atmospheric tone!\n\nThanks, and I hope so too!

The program director dragged the engineers away from their vodka and locked them in the assembly building until they could produce a guaranteed success.\n\nUnfortunately, the program director had neglected to give them any blueprint paper or, for that matter, pencils, so the engineers were forced to rely on pre-existing designs, and ***Cricket III*** ended up as an exact replica of its ill-fated predecessor. Despite this ominous result, the komrade chief engineer took the additional step of modifying the thrust limiter on the RT-5 Flea Solid Fuel Booster to double what had been used for the ***Cricket II*** launch. While this meant a much shorter burn time, the hope was that the increase in early-flight velocity would generate enough drag on the craft\u0027s fins to stabilize it without needing to resort to the Stayputnik\u0027s electrical controls. This would preserve electrical charge to allow the Stayputnik core to trigger the Mk16 parachute at the proper time, and would hopefully allow it to continue operation upon reaching the surface in order to record a temperature reading.\n\nWhile the ***Cricket III*** was under construction, R\u0026D completed some preliminary research into new types of intentionally-triggered explosions. Despite the encouragement provided by this breakthrough, funding was not awarded for prototype development of R\u0026D\u0027s proposed designs, as they were deemed unnecessary for the current projects.\n\n**Light Rocketry I**\n\n- O-10 \u0022Puff\u0022 Monopropellant Fuel Engine\n- FL-R10 RCS Fuel Tank\n- FL-R25 RCS Fuel Tank\n\nIt was widely agreed that the capabilities of these designs were insufficient to achieving the goals set out by the Ministry, and as a result they were indefinitely shelved to much grumbling from the scientists.\n\n**Cricket III**\n\n- **Mission Objectives**  \n\n    - Continue \u0022safe\u0022 experimentation into rocket-powered flight with probe cores\n    - Achieve an altitude above sea level of 3.5 km (failed by ***Cricket II***)\n    - Recover the craft intact\n    - Conduct a temperature reading of the landing site\n\n    [\\*]**Construction**\n\n    - Stayputnik Mk.1 Probe Core\n    - (4x) M-1x1 Structural Panels in an open box\n    - 2HOT Thermometer to read the temperature at the landing site\n    - Mk16 Axial Parachute\n    - Small Inline Reaction Wheel\n    - RT-5 \u0022Flea\u0022 Solid Fuel Booster (Thrust Limiter 40%)\n    - (4x) Basic Fin\n\n    [\\*]**Engineer\u0027s Report**\n\n    - Part Count: 13\n    - Height: 3.2m\n    - Weight: 2,045kg gross / 995kg dry (1,050kg solid fuel)\n    - TWR at Launch: 3.25 (22.1s estimated burn)\n    - Construction Time: 2d, 3h, 24m\\*\n    - Construction Cost: \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A12,642\n\n\\* Construction time was higher than that for ***Cricket II***, as that craft had been able to use recycle parts from the salvage of ***Cricket I***.\n\nConstruction on ***Cricket III*** was completed at Y1-D18-H3-M58. Due to the timing, the program director was able to get in a very anxious and fitful nap before the following morning. Rollout was at Y1-D18-H4-M48, and launch occurred at Y1-D18-H5-M04.\n\nImmediately upon liftoff it was apparent that the chief engineer\u0027s hypothesis regarding additional thrust would prove correct, as ***Cricket III*** was able to easily maintain its heading using the magical power of aerodynamics after a small initial adjustment by the Stayputnik to set the flight\u0027s course. No further electrical charge was wasted on vector maintenance. With a more vertical bearing, the ***Cricket III*** had no trouble achieving and even exceeding the desired altitude before the combination of burnout by the RT-5 and gravity by Kerbin slowed its ascent and began its return to the surface. The Mk16 parachute was activated a few seconds into the descent and deployed successfully. A couple of minutes later, the craft touched down in the shallows off the beach east of the Koviet Space Center campus, approximately 3.16km away. As had happened with ***Cricket I***, the stabilizing Basic Fins were destroyed by the impact, but the remainder of the craft remained intact. The Stayputnik was able to record a temperature reading from the shores before its battery ran out and it went offline, and recovery operations were commenced.\n\n- **Mission Results**  \n\n    - **Flight Time:** 00:04:25\n    - **Science Recovered:** 3.6\n    - **Salvage Recovered:** \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A12,405\n    - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Continue \u0022safe\u0022 experimentation into rocket-powered flight with probe cores\n    - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Achieve an altitude above sea level of 3.5 km (failed by ***Cricket II***)\n    - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Recover the craft intact\n    - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Conduct a temperature reading of the landing site\n\nWhile the ***Cricket III*** met all of its operational objectives, data recorded from the mission indicated that the Koviets still had a long way to go if they wanted to go a long way. With a maximum altitude of 4.7km and a distance traveled of 3.16km, ***Cricket III***\u0027s performance indicated that the next goals in height and distance (7.5km and 11km, respectively) were not feasible with the current technology. Additional research was necessary if new thresholds were to be reached. However, the craft\u0027s maximum velocity of 268m/s suggested that the goal of 300m/s may be within the Koviets\u0027 grasp with a few tweaks to the design\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACbut only optimal operational conditions would likely be able to achieve even that.\n\nThe mission resulted in the collection of 12.5 \u0022Sciences\u0022, resulting in some arguments in R\u0026D over the proper way to proceed. Some advocated beginning research on Aviation I (to unlock the AV-T1 Winglet, Delta Deluxe Winglet, and LY-01 Fixed Landing Gear), while others pushed Rover Tech I (unlocking the EAS-1 External Command Seat and the RoveMax Model S2 Rover Wheels). In the end, it was determined that additional scientific data would be collected before establishing the next path of research, as the departmental warlock claimed that only 2.5 more \u0022Sciences\u0022 would allow them to pursue even higher secrets, delving into the black magic of improved electrical systems or more explosive rockets. The promise of better explosions drew a collective, knowing nod from the rest of the department, and so plans began for the accumulation of more of the mystical \u0022Science\u0022.\n\nDirect observation was considered the most efficient way to accomplish this, and in pursuit of this goal, the engineering department was tasked with a great assignment: To begin plans for the first crewed launch of a Koviet craft. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

And thus design commenced on what would become the first crewed flight of the Koviet Space Program.\n\nEarly in the design of the new craft, concern was voiced over the potential speed of the craft\u0027s descent, as the Mk1 Command Pod was many times heavier than the Stayputnik Mk.1 Probe Core, and there was no guarantee that a simple Mk16 axial parachute would be sufficient to slow the capsule enough for safe landing. In order to ascertain the safety of a crewed flight, as well as to estimate the craft\u0027s ability to achieve mission objectives, a simulation was arranged that definitely did not involve throwing a model off the roof of the Vertical Assembly Building.\n\nThe simulation (which may or may not have been rigged to satisfy Ministry representatives) indicated that the Mk16 parachute would be sufficient to slow the craft to approximately 6.5m/s before impact. It was predicted that, while this would result in the (now typical) loss of the craft\u0027s stabilizing fins, the craft would land intact and be recoverable. Furthermore, the simulation predicted that an appropriate flight trajectory would be potentially allow the craft to reach the Ministry\u0027s demands of 300m/s velocity and 11km distance traveled. These results were universally deemed acceptable, and construction of the first crewed craft of the KSP was approved.\n\n**Fleabiscuit I**\n\n- **Mission Objectives**  \n\n    - Demonstrate the ability to launch a crewed capsule, and safely return it to Kerbin\u0027s surface\n    - Achieve velocity of 300 m/s\n    - Travel 11km from KSC campus\n    - Recover the craft intact\n    - Conduct a crew report at the launchpad\n    - Conduct a crew report at the landing site\n    - Conduct an EVA report at the launchpad\n    - Conduct an EVA report at the landing site\n    - Conduct a temperature reading while flying over Kerbin\u0027s water\n    - Conduct a temperature reading while splashed down in Kerbin\u0027s water\n    - Conduct a temperature reading of the landing site\n\n    [\\*]**Construction**\n\n    - Mk1 Command Pod\n    - Mk16 Axial Parachute\n    - (2x) 2HOT Thermometer\n    - RT-5 \u0022Flea\u0022 Solid Fuel Booster (Thrust Limiter 40%)\n    - (4x) Basic Fin\n    - (3x) Pegasus I Mobility Enhancer\\*\n\n    \\* These had not been part of the simulation, but were added at the last minute after a junior government bureaucrat demanded that the pilot be able to descend to the surface of the launchpad for a photo opportunity and to make a report on its condition prior to launch.\n\n    [\\*]**Engineer\u0027s Report**\n\n    - Part Count: 12\n    - Height: 3.0m\n    - Weight: 2,506kg gross / 1,456kg dry (1,050kg solid fuel)\n    - TWR at Launch: 2.65 (22.1s estimated burn)\n    - Construction Time: 3d, 1h, 1m\n    - Construction Cost: \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A13,422\n\n    [\\*]**Crew**\n\n    - Test Pilot \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Jebediah Kermanov\n\nConstruction on ***Fleabiscuit I*** was completed at Y1-D22-H0-M11, with immediate rollout, and launch occurred at Y1-D22-H0-M31.\n\nIt was expected that, because of the large Electrical Charge capacity of the Mk1 Command Pod, the craft would have no trouble maintaining a shallower trajectory than the Stayputnik-controlled ***Cricket*** crafts, and should therefore easily reach the water. While the design of the ***Fleabiscuit I*** was more straight-forward than the complicated open-box design of the ***Cricket*** series, the construction of the Mk1 Command Pod was more complex and required additional time for construction.\n\nAfter preparing the ***Fleabiscuit I*** on the launchpad, the necessary photo opportunities were taken and Komrade Jebediah reported his thoughts on the launchpad (\u0022Tastes like chicken!\u0022). The pilot performed several unsanctioned acrobatics on the ladders during his climb to the command pod, much to the annoyance of everyone else involved. Later, he would have the gall to submit a report claiming to contain his observations while \u0022Flying over Kerbin\u0027s Shores,\u0022 but this was heavily redacted and is not available for public viewing.\n\nThe craft was launched, and Jebediah immediately set a bearing of 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA at a vertical angle fluctuating between 45-60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA. Komrade Jebediah\u0027s basic piloting skills llowed him to maintain stability along this trajectory for the duration of the RT-5\u0027s burn, to the satisfaction of the program\u0027s onlooking engineers. Cheers were raised throughout Mission Control when the craft surpassed the assigned 300m/s threshold, and the ***Fleabiscuit I*** continued its ascent. After burnout, Komrade Jebediah released the controls and let aerodynamics and gravity handle the rest of the work while he fogged up the capsule window and drew smiley faces, then wrote a short report as the craft descended. \n\nIt soon became clear that the trajectory taken by the craft would make it difficult to reach the 11km distance marker, and Mission Control instructed Jebediah to activate the parachutes. Our komrade coughed several times, claiming that he couldn\u0027t make out the radio transmissions, and pulled up on the controls in an effort to \u0022shallow-out\u0022 the craft\u0027s descent and stretch out to the prescribed distance. Mission Control was in hysterics as the ship rapidly descended towards the ocean, and in the bedlam somebody knocked a mug of coffee into the computer that was maintaining the flight summary data, resulting in an unfortunate loss of information.\n\nThankfully, ***Fleabiscuit I*** narrowly covered the last few meters to reach 11km, and Komrade Jebediah activated the parachute some 500 meters above the waters. The craft splashed down shortly thereafter with the predicted loss of stabilizing fins, but was otherwise undamaged by the ordeal. Our pilot took a final EVA to make reports on the nature of the ocean, but in his excitement at having been the first kerbal to ride a rocket into the sky, failed to properly document conditions inside the cabin. Komrade Jebediah has been awarded several decorations for his service, and has also been remanded to a short reeducation clinic to ensure that such an oversight does not happen in the future.\n\n- **Mission Results**  \n\n    - **Flight Time:** Unknown due to Loss of Flight Summary Data (Estimated approximately 5 minutes)\n    - **Science Recovered:** 27.7\n    - **Salvage Recovered:** \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A13,155\n    - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Demonstrate the ability to launch a crewed capsule, and safely return it to Kerbin\u0027s surface\n    - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Achieve velocity of 300 m/s\n    - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Travel 11km from KSC campus\n    - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Recover the craft intact\n    - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Conduct a crew report at the launchpad\n    - **Failure** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Conduct a crew report at the landing site\n    - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Conduct an EVA report at the launchpad\n    - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Conduct an EVA report at the landing site\n    - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Conduct a temperature reading while flying over Kerbin\u0027s water\n    - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Conduct a temperature reading while splashed down in Kerbin\u0027s water\n    - **Bonus** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Conduct crew report while flying over Kerbin\u0027s water\n    - **Bonus** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Conduct \u0022EVA report\u0022 while \u0022flying\u0022 over Kerbin\u0027s shores\n    - **Bonus** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Conduct \u0022EVA report\u0022 while \u0022flying\u0022 over Kerbin\u0027s water\n\nFollowing the flight, the komrades down at the R\u0026D labs were ecstatic at the number of \u0022Sciences\u0022 that had been returned as a result of the ***Fleabiscuit I*** launch, as this brought their total capacity to 40.2 \u0022Science.\u0022 The labs quickly began research in several directions, with results expected in the coming days, with focuses on electrical storage capacity, communication (due to Jeb\u0027s alleged radio failure), improved stabilization wings with the potential to survive impact (or in any case to offer better stabilizing options), and a variety of different ways to explode things more violently while still keeping them relatively controlled.\n\nDespite the success of the ***Fleabiscuit I*** launch, flight, and landing, demands were ever increasing from the Ministry. New assignments included reaching a velocity of 450m/s and a travel distance of 17 kilometers, both unimaginable with the available technology. There was also renewed insistance on reaching an altitude of 7.5 kilometers. Some in the Ministry were also making ridiculous suggestions that if the program could land a kerbal safely in the waters east of the space center, surely the same could be done in the plains to the west. Despite the absurdity of the logic inherent in such positions, the program director couldn\u0027t deny that, at some point, a crewed flight might require a \u0022terrestrial\u0022 landing, and that the safety and viability of such an event should be investigated.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

His performance had resulted in the collection of unprecedented quantities of scientific data collection, and the brains in the R\u0026D labs were hard at work refining the raw science into useful technologies.\n\nIn the interim, however, a new demand arose. All previous flights had traveled east, towards (and eventually into) the great eastern ocean, and with the exception of the ***Cricket II*** electrical failure, had all been safely recovered. This prompted the question of whether or not the same results could be achieved when landing on firmer surfaces (often referred to as \u0022ground\u0022). Since it was inevitable that a flight would one day have no choice but to make a terrestrial landing, the Koviet Space Program director felt it prudent to fill the time waiting for further technological advances by launching ***Fleabiscuit II***, taking a westward heading for the verdant grasslands beyond the Koviet Space Center campus.\n\nAs with ***Fleabiscuit I***, a short simulation (costing \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A113.7) was run to ascertain the level of risk to the lucky kerbal chosen to pilot the craft. The results showed a \u0022terrestrial\u0022 landing at the expected speed of 6.5-6.8m/s would be jarring, but not damaging, and that an appropriate flight trajectory at a heading of 270\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA and a climb of approximately 50\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA would be sufficient for the craft to reach the grasslands. An intact landing was expected, and it was noted that on solid ground the base of the RT-5 \u0022Flea\u0022 Solid Fuel Booster could potentially protect the stabilizing fins and thus keep the entire craft together. With these acceptable results, construction (or rather, refurbishment) of ***Fleabiscuit II*** was commenced.\n\n**Fleabiscuit II**\n\n- **Mission Objectives**  \n\n    - Demonstrate the ability to to safely land a crewed capsule in low-altitude terrestrial sites\n    - Recover the craft intact\n    - Conduct a crew report while flying over the grasslands\n    - Conduct a crew report upon landing in the grasslands\n    - Conduct an EVA report upon landing in the grasslands\n    - Conduct a temperature reading while flying over the grasslands\n    - Conduct a temperature reading upon landing in the grasslands\n    - No objectives were set regarding speed, distance, or altitude, as the necessary thresholds (450m/s, 17km, and 7.5km respectively) were deemed unattainable with current technology\n\n    [\\*]**Construction**\n\n    - Mk1 Command Pod\n    - Mk16 Axial Parachute\n    - (2x) 2HOT Thermometer\n    - RT-5 \u0022Flea\u0022 Solid Fuel Booster (Thrust Limiter 40%)\n    - (4x) Basic Fin\n    - (3x) Pegasus I Mobility Enhancer\n\n    [\\*]**Engineer\u0027s Report**\n\n    - Part Count: 12\n    - Height: 3.0m\n    - Weight: 2,506kg gross / 1,456kg dry (1,050kg solid fuel)\n    - TWR at Launch: 2.65 (22.1s estimated burn)\n    - Total Delta-V: 745m/s\n    - Construction Time: 3h, 10m\\*\n    - Construction Cost: \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A13,422  \n\\* Only the Basic Fin flight stabilizers were actually constructed, as the rest of the craft was salvaged from the recovery of ***Fleabiscuit I***.

A bearing of 270\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA was set immediately after launch, with a climb angle of approximately 50\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA above the horizon, which was held until the burnout of the RT-5 booster engine. The Mk16 Axial Parachute was released and, at an altitude of 1km, fully deployed and successfully slowed the craft to its desired landing velocity. The only hiccup in the flight came as a result of the ***Fleabiscuit II*** landing on a small incline, causing it to fall over on its side\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AChowever, the craft was undamaged and, to the surprise of everyone in Mission Control, the stabilizing fins did, in fact, remain intact throughout the landing and were recovered along with the craft.\n\nIt was noted in R\u0026D while going through the scientific data recovered from the mission that Valentina had apparently been taking creative writing lessons from Jebediah, judging by her EVA report claiming to be flying over the grasslands when all systems showed that she had already landed.\n\n- **Mission Results**  \n\n    - **Flight Time:** 3 minutes, 1 second\n    - **Top Speed:** 380m/s\n    - **Flight Ceiling:** 5.3km\n    - **Ground Distance:** 7.3km\n    - **Science Recovered:** 17.6\n    - **Salvage Recovered:** \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A13,257\n    - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Demonstrate ability to safely land a crewed capsule in low-altitude terrestrial sites.\n    - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Recover craft intact\n    - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Conduct crew report while flying over the grasslands\n    - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Conduct crew report upon landing in the grasslands\n    - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Conduct EVA report upon landing in the grasslands\n    - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Conduct temperature reading while flying over the grasslands\n    - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Conduct temperature reading upon landing in the grasslands\n    - **Bonus** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Conduct EVA report while \u0022flying\u0022 over Kerbin\u0027s grasslands\n\nWhile the flight set no new records, it did demonstrate the viability of a terrestrial landing of a crewed command module. Komrade Valentina also returned valuable information regarding conditions above and on the grasslands of Kerbin, which the scientists planned to somehow turn into useful research. Chief Scientist Komrade Werner von Kerman declared that research would be started on structural advances to allow more complex constructions of future craft.\n\nIn the aftermath of Valentina\u0027s return and the recovery of ***Fleabiscuit II***, it was also noted that the Koviet Space Program had been authorized for four additional base employees. Three of these were sent to the VAB (raising Rate 1 to 1.0 BP/s, and create Rate 2 at 0.1 BP/s), and one to Development (improving its rate from 2.0 to 4.0 science/day). \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

The scientists guaranteed major breakthroughs on the horizon, and the engineers were on edge to find out what \u0022throughs\u0022 were, how broken they would be, and whether or not they could be repaired. To the relief of all the kerbals in Engineering, it turned out that \u0022breakthrough\u0022 was some nonsensical egghead term for the useful byproducts of their Science Refinery operation. Over the span of only a couple of days, R\u0026D submitted findings and proposals on a variety of new equipment designs.\n\n- **Aviation I** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Completed Y1-D24-H3-M41  \n\n    - AV-T1 Winglet\n    - Delta-Deluxe Winglet\n    - LY-01 Fixed Landing Gear\n\n    [\\*]**Science and Electricity I** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Completed at T1-D25-H5-M11\n\n    - Z-100 Rechargeable Battery Pack\n    - Mystery Goo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 Containment Unit\n    - Radiator Panel (Small)\n    - Communotron 16\n\n    [\\*]**Light Rocketry II** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Completed Y1-D25-H5-M11\n\n    - RT-10 \u0022Hammer\u0022 Solid Fuel Booster\n    - LV-T30 \u0022Reliant\u0022 Liquid Fuel Engine\n    - FL-T400 Fuel Tank\n    - KW Rocketry SA-05 LFT\n    - KW Rocketry SA-1 LFT\n    - Globe I SRB\n    - KW Rocketry 1.25m Stack Decoupler\n    - FL-A10 Adapter (1.25m to 0.625m)\n\nThe program director submitted requisition forms to the Ministry, but found himself facing political squabbles back at the Kerblin and some dissatisfaction that the program had not yet met the prescribed milestones for speed, height, and distance. As a result, the Ministry authorized only the **Aviation I** designs in full, while rejecting the design for the Radiator Panel as \u0022frivolous\u0022 and only approving the RT-10 \u0022Hammer\u0022 Solid Fuel Booster and the KW Rocketry 1.25m Stack Decoupler from the **Light Rocketry II** proposals. The spokesman for the bureaucrat responsible for these decisions simply remarked that \u0022Solid fuel has proven adequate to date for the program\u0027s purposes, and there is no reason it should not continue to prove so. Funds cannot be diverted from the Koviet Armed Forces at this time for luxury expenditures.\u0022\n\nNevertheless, the board of the Koviet Space Program was undeterred, and set out to placate the Ministry through demonstrations of a design capable of meeting the most recent performance requirements. Some rumors briefly arose that the program director wanted \u0022to build a rocket that can reach the Kerblin,\u0022 but these were promptly quashed and those responsible reassigned to launchpad clean-up duty.\n\nIn order to reach these goals, it was clear that the RT-10 \u0022Hammer\u0022 Solid Fuel Booster would be necessary, and simulations were arranged to estimate its efficacy. For liability reasons, it was determined that the first launch would entail a return of the uncrewed \u0022Open Box\u0022 design of the ***Cricket*** missions.\n\nThe initial simulations assumed a design similar to that of the ***Cricket III***, but replacing the RT-5 \u0022Flea\u0022 with an RT-10 \u0022Hammer\u0022 solid fuel booster, and the 2HOT Thermometers that had been carried by earlier flights with two Mystery Goo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 Containment Units, so that Koviet scientists might try to figure out what, exactly, it was supposed to be used for. The first simulation (\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A122) set a thrust limiter of 40% on the RT-10 booster (TWR of 1.91), and while the simulation predicted a flight ceiling of around 8.84km, it was determined that such a design would only be able to travel approximately 11km\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACfar short of the 17km demanded by the Ministry\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACdue to sacrificing distance in favor of altitude. For the second simulation (\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A122), the thrust limiter was reduced to 35% and a shallower trajectory was assumed. This resulted in an altitude just under 8km (still satisfactory), but managed less than 14km of travel, still short of the goal.\n\nThe third and final simulation introduced a novel concept to the Koviet Space Program. Inspired by an intern loudly breaking apart a Toblerone bar during an awkwardly silent brainstorming meeting, it was suggested that the 1.25m Stack Decoupler be used to attach a tried-and-tested RT-5 Flea engine *underneath* the RT-10 Hammer to give the craft that extra \u0022kick\u0022 off the launchpad. With some tinkering by the design team, this resulted in a projected flight that would be capable of reaching both 7.5km altitude and 17km of ground distance. (Of all three simulations, the highest velocity ever predicted was a meagre 319m/s. This was so far below the Ministry\u0027s prescribed milestone that it was eventually accepted that the design authorizations available to the program would be wholly inadequate for the task, and thus it was disregarded for the current mission. Furthermore, the added cost (and subsequent loss upon being jettisoned) of the RT-5 Flea and the Stack Decoupler were deemed acceptable in the interest of proving that the Ministry\u0027s distance and altitude requirements could be met in a single flight.)\n\n**Cricket IV**\n\n- **Mission Objectives**  \n\n    - Test capabilities of the RT-10 Hammer Solid Fuel Booster\n    - Execute first staging separation of the Koviet Space Program\n    - Gather observations of the Mystery Goo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 at the landing site and while in flight\n    - Reach an altitude of 7.5km\n    - Travel at least 17km from the Koviet Space Center campus\n    - Recover the primary body of the craft intact\n\n    [\\*]**Construction**\n\n    - Stayputnik Mk.1 Probe Core\n    - (4x) M-1x1 Structural Panels in open-box arrangement\n    - (2x) Z-100 Rechargeable Battery Pack\n    - Mk16 Axial Parachute\n    - (2x) Mystery Goo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 Containment Unit\n    - Small Inline Reaction Wheel\n    - RT-10 \u0022Hammer\u0022 Solid Fuel Booster (Thrust Limiter 35%)\n    - (4x) Basic Fin\n    - KW Rocketry 1.25m Stack Decoupler\n    - RT-5 \u0022Flea\u0022 Solid Fuel Booster (Thrust Limiter 60%)\n\n    [\\*]**Engineer\u0027s Report**\n\n    - Part Count: 18\n    - Height: 6.2m\n    - Weight: 5,962kg gross (S1 1,750kg; S2 4,212kg) \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Includes total of 3,862.5kg solid rocket fuel\n    - Stage 1 TWR: 1.67 (14.7s estimated burn)\n    - Stage 2 TWR: 1.68 (68s estimated burn)\n    - Total Delta-V: 2,102m/s (S1 266m/s; S2 1,836m/s)\n    - Construction Time: 4d, 3h, 22m\n    - Construction Cost: \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A14,152\n\n    [\\*]**Crew**\n\n    - None\n\nConstruction was begun at UT Y1-D25-H5-M12, and finished at UT Y1-D30-H2-M33. Rollout the following morning at Y1-30-H5-M37, with an immediate launch.\n\nThe ***Cricket IV*** initially set a more-or-less easterly bearing at a vertical angle of approximately 80\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA. However, the lack of sufficient velocity provided from the RT-5 Flea Booster in the first stage resulted in early \u0022tipping\u0022 of the craft. This required manual corrective action through the integrated reaction wheel, but unlike the failure of ***Cricket II***, electrical shortage was averted due to the inclusion of the new Z-100 Battery Packs, thereby allowing the craft to somewhat counteract the meddlesome force of gravity.\n\nApproximately 15 seconds into the flight, the RT-5 Flea was exhausted and successfully jettisoned, with the transition being made to the RT-10 Hammer. The RT-10 justified its (admittedly nominal) cost over the following minute, and although the craft\u0027s angle of ascent by the time of burnout had sunk down to perhaps 35\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA (or even lower), the power provided by the RT-10 still allowed it to meet all of its operational objectives. Following burnout and the apex of the flight trajectory, the parachute was safely deployed, and shortly thereafter the craft splashed down with the customary destruction of the stabilizing fins.\n\n- **Mission Results**  \n\n    - **Flight Time:** 4 minutes, 21 seconds\n    - **Top Speed:** 309m/s\n    - **Flight Ceiling:** 8.5km\n    - **Ground Distance:** 22.8km\n    - **Total Distance:** 33.1km\n    - **Science Recovered:** 9.9\n    - **Salvage Recovered:** \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A13,278 (78.95%)\n    - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Test capabilities of the RT-10 Hammer Solid Fuel Booster\n    - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Execute first staging separation of the Koviet Space Program\n    - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Gather observations of the Mystery Goo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 at the landing site and while in flight\n    - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Reach an altitude of 7.5km\n    - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Travel at least 17km from the Koviet Space Center campus\n    - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Recover the primary body of the craft intact\n\nThe milestones set by ***Cricket IV*** in both altitude and surface distance were welcome news among the program\u0027s supporters back in the Ministry, and the mission helped them lobby successfully for the authorization of additional equipment designs, but not without compromise\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACin exchange for the release of funding, the Ministry demanded even greater results, ordering an altitude of 11.5km and a surface distance of 28km, both well in excess of anything the KSP had achieved to date. There was also a not-especially-gentle reminder that 309m/s would hardly be acceptable if the program were to ever reach its purported goal of this alleged \u0022Space.\u0022\n\nThe dour attitude of the Ministry wasn\u0027t able to completely dampen spirits on the Koviet Space Center campus, however, as the scientists were going around thumping their thoracic cavities over completing research into something they called \u0022Structural Engineering I\u0022 and which the engineers tended to call either \u0022Mind your own damn business\u0022 or \u0022Why didn\u0027t you tell us that *before* we build the stupid rocket?\u0022 It eventually came out that the research had been completed after construction of ***Cricket IV*** had already commenced, and so the R\u0026D staff had all spent a few days on the beach. One of the lead scientists claimed to have documented authorization for this work absence from the Ministry itself. While he was only able to produce an illegible handwritten document that was measured at 63% coffee stain by mass, the matter was not pursued further, as the program director felt the eggheads had earned a break from their \u0022breakthroughs\u0022 and did not want to provoke any bureaucratic inquiries.\n\n- **Structural Engineering I** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Completed Y1-D27-H3-M51  \n\n    - Structural Fuselage (1.25m)\n    - M-Beam 650 I-Beam\n    - Cubic Octagonal Strut\n    - TR-18A Stack Decoupler (1.25m)\n    - TR-2V Stack Decoupler (0.625m)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Furthermore, its anemic speed demonstrated the glaring weakness of the RT-5 \u0022Flea\u0022 Solid Fuel Booster when employed in any \u0022serious\u0022 aspiring spacecraft. Various factions among the engineers lobbied for another launch in the ***Cricket*** program and switching the placement of the RT-5 and RT-10 boosters, or another ***Cricket*** launch with two RT-10s (one replacing the RT-5 of the ***Cricket IV***. However, Ministry pressure demanded more than minor tinkering for incremental gains. The Ministry demanded an attention-grabbing flight that would blow through old records and win the program (and the Minister) unprecedented acclaims.\n\nSo it was that, much to the grumbling of most of the kerbals in Engineering, design work began on a new flight series.

Rollout began at Y1-D33-H5-M0. Launch occurred at Y1-D33-H5-M58.\n\nAhead of its RT-10 \u0022Hammer\u0022 first stage, the craft traveled directly up for approximately 230 meters, reaching a velocity of 50m/s and beginning a gradual turn to a 70\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA vertical angle on a 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA compass bearing. Although Jebediah continued slowly shallowing out the ascent angle and the first stage separation occurred without issue, the combination of back-to-back RT-10 boosters proved to provide far more power than anyone (except some engineers, or so they later claimed) had anticipated\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACby the time the second stage had burned out, ***Swallow I*** had reached an altitude of approximately 31.5km and a speed of **1,475m/s**, blowing away the Ministry\u0027s mandated 450m/s. Visiting bureaucrats in Mission Control were ecstatic! Here was a rocket that could truly show the world that the Koviet Union would go to space!\n\nWhat they didn\u0027t realize was that ***Swallow I*** would show the world that the Koviet Union actually *was* going into space. Right now. 2 minutes and 45 seconds after liftoff, ***Swallow I*** passed an altitude of 70km, making Komrade Jebediah Kermanov the first kerbal to leave the atmosphere and experience the weightlessness of space, ultimately reaching a ceiling of 85.6 kilometers above Kerbin. It was a proud and incredible moment for the Koviet Union.\n\nThe exuberation was quickly dampened, however. Komrade Program Director Gene Kermanov pointed out that despite the historic achievements being set, ***Swallow I*** was *supposed* to have been reaching an altitude ceiling of around 12 kilometers and a speed of 450-500m/s. Yes, it had reached space, but it *was not supposed to be there*. The craft was not equipped for atmospheric reentry, and to make matters worse, had no way of separating from the exhausted second-stage RT-10 Hammer booster. Simulations and the flight of the ***Cricket IV*** had shown no problem landing on top of a spent RT-10 Hammer... but those had all been low-atmospheric trajectories at comparatively low speeds. ***Swallow I*** would be returning falling from over 80km, through a heated atmosphere, at speeds well in excess of Mach 3.\n\nThe mood in Mission Control darkened considerably, and all attention was turned towards how best to return ***Swallow I***\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACand more importantly, Komrade Jebediah Kermanov\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACto Kerbin intact. At 81km and falling, Jebediah oriented the ship retrograde and was ordered to hold that orientation at all cost and as long as possible, in the hopes that it would force the RT-10 to absorb the brunt of the expected reentry heat (and possibly burn off the booster entirely, reducing the total weight of the craft). \n\n5 minutes, 20 seconds after liftoff, ***Swallow I*** reentered the atmosphere. One minute later, at an altitude of approximately 38km, the craft began experiencing atmospheric heating, and holding orientation became increasingly difficult\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACthe craft was traveling at 1,590m/s at this time, and concern was mounting rapidly. At an altitude of 28km, Jebediah lost control of ***Swallow I***, causing it to flip around wildly and, despite all efforts to correct orientation, begin descending nose-first. The RT-10 had not, as was hoped, burn off before this loss of control occurred. With the ship hurtling nose-down, it became impossible to slow the ship down to anything resembling appropriate velocities. Approximately 200 meters above the surface, the Mk16 parachute was deployed in a desperate last-ditch effort... and was promptly ripped from its cords.\n\n7 minutes, 20 seconds after liftoff, and 4 minutes, 55 seconds after it became the first kerbal rocket to reach the endless expanse of space, ***Swallow I*** crashed into the shoreline at over 300 meters per second.\n\n- **Mission Results**  \n\n    - **Flight Time:** 7 minutes, 20 seconds\n    - **Top Speed:** 1,135m/s\n    - **Flight Ceiling:** 85.6km\n    - **Ground Distance:** 250km\n    - **Science Recovered:** 0\n    - **Salvage Recovered:** \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A10\n    - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Reach an altitude of 11.5km\n    - **Bonus** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Reach an altitude of 19km\n    - **Bonus** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Reach an altitude of 26.5km\n    - **Bonus** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Reach an altitude of 70km\n    - **Bonus** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Escape the atmosphere!\n    - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Land distance of 28km\n    - **Bonus** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Land distance of 39km\n    - **Success** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Reach a velocity of 450m/s\n    - **Bonus** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Reach a velocity of 750m/s\n    - **Failure** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Recover craft intact\n    - **Failure** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC All kerbals returned alive\n    - **Failure** \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC Gather observations of Mystery Goo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 at landing site and other locations\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I intentionally put off the \u0022aftermath\u0022 of the flight, which will be discussed at the open of the next mission write-up. Suffice it to say, heads will roll.\n\nI had actually done a trial run of this same flight a couple of days ago, and it went nearly identically in most respects. The differences? Well, Jebediah survived. \n\nSuch is the fickle nature of aspiring space flight.\n\nI only did the trial run in the first place because I was curious whether or not the design would be capable of meeting the 450m/s milestone (since the ***Cricket IV*** hadn\u0027t come anywhere close). Despite the relatively minor change in Delta-V (***Swallow I*** had a total of 2,242m/s compared to ***Cricket IV***\u0027s 2,102m/s), whether it was because I took a \u0022better\u0022 ascent angle, the improved aerodynamics of the Mk1 Command Pod, the greater \u0022power off the launchpad\u0022 of the RT-10 Booster, or a combination of those three, the trial run blew away the 450m/s velocity test and proceeded to blow past almost all of the other milestones, as well. *And* Jebediah returned safely. In the trial-run, the RT-10 Hammer Solid Fuel Booster and the two Mystery Goo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 Containment Units were burned up during reentry, which helped slow down and properly orient the command pod.
