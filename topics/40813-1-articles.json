The domes come in 5, 7.5, 10, and 20 meter diameters, and have fittings that attach to 2.5 meter and 3.75 meter parts. Presently they will have no functions apart from being structural elements, yet I am looking for suggestions. Future projects after this has been completed include a fusion reactor that will run on hydrogen (liquid fuel) and produce electricity and Helium for use in ion engines (Helium will act in a similar way to xenon as it is also a noble gas, However in real life the ionisation energy is high hence it is not used.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ydzBWRrh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ydzBWRrh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7vts41oh.png\u0022 alt=\u00227vts41oh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are the preliminary shots of the fusion reactor models I am currently working on to go with a huge ion engine. I have tried to base as close to the real life toroidal magnetic confinement reactors such as ITER. (Look them up - they will save the world).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the tritium-deuterium plasma heats up in the torus (doughnut) fusion takes place releasing energy, mostly in high energy protons. The energy released continues the reaction. Currently it is 50 years away until the first commercial power producing reactor, and 20 years until the first plasma in ITER.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have decided not to use the laser design as the torus is in a later stage of development plus I think that a doughnut shaped star is way cooler!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChangelog\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E03/07/2013\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECreated Sketchup 3D models, Need exporting to blender and finishing.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EStarted Fourum post.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EModels should be released soon however it is my first model so be patient.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E05/07/2013\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EStarted model for Fusion reactor.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jtLne84.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jtLne84.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-05T20:30:40Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2013 08:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by michaelpooper\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kous","CreatedById":77130,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T14:08:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice looking models.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could have the fusion reactor produce Neon or Argon which have reasonably lower ionisation energies.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T14:22:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMost logical step would be to integrate this mod with one of Life Support ones - either Ioncross or Taranis Elsu.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelpooper","CreatedById":73869,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T16:13:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat could be a really good idea, however I first have to actually get the parts working.

I loaded the model into blender and it just looks like a chunk of geodome, loaded into unity and it was unusable. You need to modify your approach a little. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst abandon doing a complex model right up front, download unity and then lookup some the fine tutorials on this forum that deal with getting models into unity. If you simply interested in having your models in KSP then you could perhaps team up with someone familiar with unity enough to achieve what you are looking for. I\u0027ve got enough know how to build simple objects and engines, but I haven\u0027t figured out docking ports, doors, ladders anything animated yet, it\u0027s not a steep learning curve, but can be time consuming.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
