I am working on a small mod for KSP, but I have an issue: the normal map is bugging the shadows. The only way to not having this issue is to remove the Normal Map, or reduce the strength of it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, I do not know how to reduce it in Unity.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSomeone here knows? Or have another idea...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
