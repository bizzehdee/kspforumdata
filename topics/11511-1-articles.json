Now I\\\u0027m working on the smallest possible double Mun return craft. I would be interested to see how others would try to go about this engineering (and piloting) problem. I have seen that some people have accomplished a double mun return on other challenges. The ships I saw were quite big. So that\\\u0027s the challenge, make them smaller. And by small, I mean low mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
