He has a \u0027business\u0027 building solar panels and batteries. He is building a that Starship to take massive payloads to orbit. I hear NASA has proposed using one to put\u00A0a\u00A0large telescopes into orbit.\u00A0 It\u0027s pretty clear what\u0027s going on here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn case you can\u0027t see it, let me lay it out\u00A0for you. Starship puts a massive telescope into orbit. Nobody is going to question it because it will be all public and official. Not a spy satellite, not a problem.\u00A0 Little will we suspect that this \u0027telescope\u0027 is actually the most powerful laser ever made. But it won\u0027t be enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext they\u0027ll send up a massive sunshade to go with that massive telescope. JWST needs one, why not this one? Nothing strange, right? But that \u0027sunshade\u0027 is a really a massive solar array to power the massive laser, something one of Elon\u0027s companies can easily supply without question. But that still isn\u0027t enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there\u0027s a third servicing mission to add more things to the \u0027telescope.\u0027 They\u0027ll talk about scientific payloads, but it\u0027ll be a massive bank of\u00A0batteries to make a capacitor for the laser plus a massed krypton-ion thrusters, like Starlink uses, for better maneuvering. With Starship\u0027s massive payload capacity and a bit of subterfuge, it\u0027ll be too late to stop it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTarget this orbital death ray with ASAT launchers and it\u0027ll burn out the guidance of the missiles in flight, then it can turn and fire its laser to change orbit\u00A0and avoid all interceptors. Then it\u00A0will be able to burn\u00A0all satellites on orbit and attack anywhere on the ground in a direct line to the laser. Everything on-board will be\u00A0solar powered and by the time they need to re-supply krypton gas, all opposition will be too suppressed to stop a re-supply launch. It will dominate a huge area!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...Once again, I\u0027m channeling the mindset of conspiracy theorist here. I doubt this\u00A0would happen, but I think it would be more fun if I\u00A0let everyone poke\u00A0the holes in this one. I am well aware this is\u00A0a stock\u00A0villain superweapon. But it\u0027s not about how clich\u00E9 it is, but plausible it sounds.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-11T14:55:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027ve just killed a secret plan of a whole company...\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nA real killjoy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DDE","CreatedById":146349,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-11T18:43:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224030576\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022204617\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221631367018\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022101735\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u002255delta\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, 55delta said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTarget this orbital death ray with ASAT launchers and it\u0027ll burn out the guidance of the missiles in flight, then it can turn and fire its laser to change orbit\u00A0and avoid all interceptors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK, one question, Mr Bond: is Elon Musk secretly a North Korean?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/GTznf1x4khc?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-11T18:49:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224026765\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022204617\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221630491448\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022208000\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Beccab\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 9/1/2021 at 11:17 AM, Beccab said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedOther\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed7327961867\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026amp;module=system\u0026amp;controller=embed\u0026amp;url=https://twitter.com/SoberAlmost/status/1432348704661458950\u0022 style=\u0022height:629px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStarship Earth to Earth is dumb... you\u0027ve got a long boat ride, a lot of\u00A0bureaucracy to keep track of everyone, a long boat ride to the Starship as it has to be far out enough to not disturb nearby cities, and before all of that, you have to filter anyone who can\u0027t take 2-4 gs of acceleration so they don\u0027t pass out on the way up.
