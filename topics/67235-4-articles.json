Rather than having the file structure as Gamedata/Diazo/AGExt. In short, as Yilmas said its simply user error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe I can elaborate on the bug Yilmas has experienced. I\u0027ve run into the same problem and it took hours of troubleshooting to find the cause as AGExt seemed like the least likely suspect at first. Recently I updated all my mods and found that like Yilmas I was unable to place anything after the first item placed in the VAB. Nothing could be attached radially, nothing inline, the extraplanetary launchpads mod would increase the tonnage of the ship as if the part was added but it would not add the part to the ship. I believe it was the FAR update I downloaded that included an update for ModuleManager.2.0.5.dll. AGExt.dll works fine with ModuleManager.1.5.6, no issues in VAB at all. Upgrading to 2.0.5 seems to break the game, consistently on my end. I hope this info helps lead to a fix in the near future.

However, since some of my craft\u0027s AGX groups had the \u0022Observe Materials Bay\u0027 action from the KSPI Science Lab, and that ability no longer existed, AGX encountered an error. I was unable to remove the action from within game, I had to manually edit it out of my craft file, as well as the persistence file as I\u0027d already launched one of these craft. I would recommend that code be added to automatically remove actions assigned to groups that have such errors as soon as AGX loads on a craft, whether in the VAB/SPH, or flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-30T21:48:38Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2014 09:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Einarr\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EIdentified and solved the root cause of the problem.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Einarr","CreatedById":4809,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-31T16:46:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Runescope\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Runescope\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think I found a small bug working with the Kethane Addon.

Note this is not yet an update, just a rehost of version 1.3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, my apologies for leaving the mod as rough as it is. I knew I would be disapearing for a while and rushed version 1.3 and it shows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKnow issues in priority order for me to fix:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003E1) In editor, after picking up an object with actions assigned, you sometimes can not place the piece down effectively locking the editor up as you can not free your mouse cursor.\u003C/span\u003E Fixed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003E2) Fix flight mode so if the scene loads with AGX hidden, action groups still work. Currently you have to show and then hide AGX to get action groups working.\u003C/span\u003E Fixed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003E3) Any changes made in flight mode do not save. You can make changes in flight mode but they are lost as soon as you switch to another vessel or leave the flight scene.\u003C/span\u003E Fixed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Eedit:3a)Small parts not selectable in flight scene to edit actions.\u003C/span\u003E Fixed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Action Names changing. I populate actions automatically and there seems to be some differences between editor and flight mode. (See post at top of the page.) Note that I can\u0027t guarantee I can fix this one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Remove Modulemanager dependency. I can do what I need to in a cleaner fashion completely within my code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Fix integration with the default 10 action groups. Ideally for smaller vessels you can use the default action group editor and only show mine for larger vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Fix assigning Joystick buttons not working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) Add staging support for an action group. (Like spacebar, but allow multiple staging queues on different action groups)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease let me know of anything else I\u0027ve missed, or features you would like to see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-07T15:02:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2014 03:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Diazo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
