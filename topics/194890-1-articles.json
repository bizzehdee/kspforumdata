It\u0027s in the same category as using Anti-de Sitter geometry\u00A0to describe some of the properties of quantum chromodynamics. There is \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdS/QCD_correspondence\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eclear correspondence\u003C/a\u003E, but it\u0027s only practical in so far as a tool for studying QCD, not explaining something new. When correspondence is partial, as is the case with String Theory, and it makes predictions that repeatedly fail to be confirmed, it\u0027s a good indicator that it won\u0027t be a theory to explain things. LQG is younger, and might actually turn out to have a closer correspondence to standard model, but I doubt it will overcome the main problem of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renormalization\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Enon-renormalizable\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0gravity. I\u0027m not an expert in LQG, however, so I might be entirely out of date on what\u0027s new there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thing to keep in mind, however, is that we do have a non-renormalizable theory of gravity that, other than being entirely useless, is perfectly solid. By useless I mean that lacking renormalization, you can\u0027t compute anything. Everything turns into infinities and you can\u0027t do math on it. Which, as far as models of the universe go, is somewhat problematic. The good news about our understanding of gravity is that we can take standard model representation of gravity as a gauge force, quantize, it, and then develop a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_field_theory\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emean field theory\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0on top of it. That mean field theory effectively is General Relativity with QCD thrown over it. And we have practical uses of it. Some branches of astrophysics\u00A0are making testable predictions on particle dynamics inside neutron stars using this model. Inside the neutron star, gravity is so strong, that we simply can\u0027t treat it as flat space-time. At the same time, individual quantum fluctuations make no difference to overall gravity. So if you plug in the expected density as function of distance from the center, you can first compute the space-time metric throughout the core of the neutron star, and then do particle theory in curved space-time as a fixed background, which helped explained such things as why some neutron stars are more massive than we thought was possible, and it has to do with quantum mechanics in extreme gravitational and magnetic fields.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo saying that we don\u0027t have a theory of quantum gravity is a bit misleading. We have a base model that we know has to be satisfied based on symmetries but we can\u0027t do practical math with, and we have approximate models that we can use that we know are numerically correct under most practical conditions. The only place where this kind of approach fails is at regions of absolutely immense curvature and extreme energy density, and the only known places for that are big bang and event horizon of a black hole. These are places where we would like to have a better description of quantum gravity, one which still works under these extreme conditions, and does not lead to infinities in computation. It\u0027s almost certainly not going to be String Theory and probably not Loop Quantum Gravity either. It\u0027s not even guaranteed that such a model can exist. But if it can, it\u0027s probably going to be something else that we haven\u0027t thought of.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
