Please, come in, come in!\u0022\n\nIt was an odd bit of formality at this point, she was already deep inside the palatial residence. Having been inside an *actual* palace before, she felt uniquely qualified to use the term and, well, this place might just be nicer. \n\nIt had taken Valentina some time to actually *find* it, despite its size, after the bored-looking security guard at the main gate had let her right through. That... did seem odd. Anyway, she had then spent who knows how long wandering about fragrant manicured gardens and large, tinkling ponds filled with brilliant ornamental fish. When she finally found what she assumed was the front door, before her hand even reached the ornately carved hardwood slab it swung open silently on well-oiled hinges. \n\nThe enormous Kerbal waiting behind had made her do a double take. He was as big as Igor, possibly bigger. He even *looked* like Igor... sort of. If Igor had been beaten as a kerbling until his face was a misshapen lump. But while Igor\u0027s grasp of language was remedial at best, this fellow didn\u0027t seem to speak at *all*. He had simply nodded, and motioned for Valentina to follow. \n\nSo she did, noting the finely tailored cut of her guide\u0027s suit; it must have cost a fortune in material alone. He had led her through a veritable maze of expansive hallways and exquisitely furnished passages. Rich wood paneling, burnished metal ceilings, brilliant marble floors made of solid blocks that surely weighed thousands of kilograms; and everything polished to a mirror shine. Except for the things that weren\u0027t. Matte painted walls that highlighted the wood and brass, furniture with exotic leather upholstery to compliment the walls and floors, and aquariums seemingly everywhere one could be squeezed. That, too, seemed rather... odd. They were filled with all manner of beautiful and terrifying fishes and other sea creatures, but... Valentina never remembered Edmund having such a thing for aquatics. \n\nThe huge... butler..? Assistant..? had shown her to a room in the heart of the house, and once again, the door opened before she\u0027d had a chance to knock. \n\n\u0022How long has it been?\u0022 Edmund Kerman now grinned. Valentina felt a tinge of shame that she had to force a smile onto her own face. Behind yellowed eyes spotted with red blotches, his face seemed to be a contour map of bruises. Dark, fresh ones overlaid faded browns and pale greys, like the surface of some macabre alien moon. \n\n\u0022Too long, my friend,\u0022 she said, offering a hand, \u0022you are looking well,\u0022 then winced.\n\nEdmund stared at her outstretched right hand for an uncomfortable moment, then at his own, clad in a black leather glove. It didn\u0027t look... right. \n\nAt length, he turned, \u0022you\u0027ll have to forgive me,\u0022 leaning heavily on a cane with his other gloved hand, he motioned her into what must be his office, \u0022I... haven\u0027t quite been myself lately.\u0022 He grunted as he moved, slowly, stiffly, \u0022I see you\u0027ve already met Arnold, there.\u0022\n\nFrom the corner of her eye, Valentina saw the huge Kerb step forward... plugging the doorway as he did. The room was filled with a palette of subtle but unsettling odors. Something pleasant, to mask the astringent-like tang of hospital, and beneath that, barely perceptible, a scent like rot. The same lavish dark woods were here, but the textures seemed to make her eyes slide off when she looked. Strange brightly-colored fish covered in long spines bobbled in lazy circles in a long aquarium built into one wall. Against her chest, the M\u00FCnstone was growing ever colder.\n\n\u0022Best assistant a Kerb could ask for,\u0022 Edmund crept slowly along around an expansive wooden desk in the center of the room, \u0022be lost without him,\u0022 finally reaching the far side, Edmund leaned back against an upturned black leather chair and pressed a button. With a whir of motors and a long groan, it lowered him back into a seated position. \n\n\u0022And you may dispense with the pleasantries,\u0022 he said, laying his stiff right hand on the desk, \u0022I look like sh--\u0022 his words decayed into a brief fit of coughing. \n\n\u0022Please,\u0022 he gestured, \u0022have a seat.\u0022\n\n\u0022Edmund, what has happened to you?!\u0022 Valentina exclaimed as she sank into the offered chair. It was so soft it seemed to suck her in. \n\n\u0022XKCD. Stage III. I\u0027ll spare you the gory details, suffice to say I wouldn\u0027t wish it on anyone,\u0022 he grinned an awful grin again, \u0022but I do believe I\u0027ve stumbled upon a way out. But that\u0027s not why you\u0027re here.\u0022\n\nHe leaned forward and raised an eye... no, it didn\u0027t raise. It jiggled for a moment before falling limp, and another bruise bloomed before Valentina\u0027s own eyes. \n\nEdmund didn\u0027t seem to notice, \u0022so... what *can* I do for you?\u0022\n\nShe sensed Arnold\u0027s shadow looming over her, \u0022um... is a matter of grave importance...\u0022\n\n\u0022Grave, you say?\u0022 Edmund said, flatly. \n\nIt was far too late for Valentina to heed the alarm bells that had been shrieking in her head since she\u0027d arrived. Have to follow this thing through, wherever it goes. \n\n\u0022On my last mission... in orbit, I saw something very large. Something I cannot find record of.\u0022\n\n\u0022Large, eh? Are you sure it wasn\u0027t...\u0022\n\nHe looked at her. She looked at him. The blotchy hemorrhages in his eyes made the latter quite difficult. She swore they had shifted position. *P\u0426TI\u0419S \u0417\u0414\u042FS*, how could he even remain upright in his state?\n\n\u0022No, I guess you *would* know the space station,\u0022 Edmund said at length, \u0022standard equatorial orbit?\u0022 Valentina slowly nodded.\n\nEdmund grinned, giving her the peculiar impression of flesh pulling apart inside a bag of skin, \u0022well, let\u0027s find out.\u0022 From somewhere, he produced a slim keyboard. Valentina couldn\u0027t see a monitor, it took her a moment to realize it was somehow built into the desk surface in front of him. He raised his mannequin-like right hand, then using his left, curled the fingers into a loose fist, with the index sticking out. With this, he picked slowly and deliberately at the keys. \n\n*Tap.*\n\n*Tap.*\n\n*Tap.*\n\nHe frowned; she could almost *hear* flesh tearing, \u0022nothing in the registry. Biggest thing the KSA has in orbit right now is the second stage of an old *Isfjell* test launch that didn\u0027t go quite right.\u0022 \n\nHe pushed they keyboard aside, \u0022but you didn\u0027t really come all this way for that, did you?\u0022\n\nValentina felt the hairs on the back of her neck stand up. She wondered if Arnold could see them. \n\n\u0022Oh and I love what you\u0027ve done with your hair,\u0022 Edmund grinned that horrible grin again, the perfectly-trimmed mustache he had once been so proud of was nothing but scraggly stubble, now, \u0022not an easy look but you make it work.\u0022\n\n\u0022Er, yes... thank you... um, the other matter,\u0022 she stumbled at a cold blast from the M\u00FCnstone, \u0022your crew mate... from the M\u00FCn mission... Mister Billy-Bobrim--\u0022\n\nA hair fell from his lip as she watched, \u0022damn shame what happened to him,\u0022 Edmund nodded, \u0022good kid. He\u0027s getting the best medical care money can buy. I\u0027ve seen to that.\u0022\n\n\u0022Yes, well,\u0022 the chill had worked its way to the base of Valentina\u0027s spine, now, \u0022what I am trying to know is, what *did* happen to him?\u0022\n\nEdmund grinned wider than ever, and this time the skin at the corners of his mouth really *did* split open, \u0022I\u0027ll show you.\u0022\n\nBefore Valentina could even tense, the hand was around her throat. Arnold\u0027s thick fingers clenched around her chin, neck, and shoulders, and his strength was *incredible*. She punched and kicked at him, but he might as well have been made of iron. *P\u0426TI\u0419*, it didn\u0027t even feel like *skin!*\n\n\u0022Edmund,\u0022 she gasped, \u0022what are you doing?! We are friends...\u0022\n\n\u0022You\u0027ll understand in a moment,\u0022 he said, \u0022you\u0027ll understand more than you ever wanted.\u0022 Then, to his brute, \u0022hold her.\u0022\n\nShe grunted as Arnold picked her up by her head and shoved her onto the desk, still trapped in his vice-like grip. Motors whirred and whined as Edmund\u0027s chair slowly rose. Valentina kicked backwards with both feet, driving them hard into her captor but he remained as immotile as a mountain. Holding himself up by the edge of the desk, Edmund crept toward her. She strained against Arnold\u0027s grasp, but couldn\u0027t move her head a millimeter. The M\u00FCnstone flashed to ice beneath her dress as the hideous visage of her old friend filled her gaze. \n\nShe could smell the stink of decay on his rasping breath. His face pressed closer. She couldn\u0027t avoid looking into those grotesque, stained eyes. Where the crimson blotches on his tarnished corneas touched his pupils, they ran up along the edges like bloody crescent M\u00FCns. She realized with horror that his eyes had no irises, that the yellowed scleras and hemorrhages just seemed to disappear into pools of darkness.\n\nCloser, they came closer. Panic thrashed against her mind. Her feet scrabbled pitifully against the polished desktop. Any hand she raised was carelessly batted away like an errant insect. \n\nCloser, and closer still. His pupils seemed to fill her vision. Before her own eyes, the M\u00FCn-like moats of blood surrounding them began to collapse inward, falling down into their darkness in sanguine cascades. \n\nBut not darkness anymore, not shadow. Nothing. *Nothing*.  Not blackness but ***nothing***. Terror beyond comprehension filled Valentina as she stared down into two pools of *nothing*, that now seemed to swell... engulfing Edmund\u0027s  eyes until they were entirely consumed. She could feel them drawing her, *pulling* her into them... and within them, something *else*.\n\nIt *came forward.* Something alien, something *other*, picked at the surface of her mind, pried at it. She could feel its greasy tendrils slithering, searching for a rift... a way *inside*. And beyond... past the tendrils... past the *presence*... within that womb of *nothing*...\n\nShe wanted to scream, but had no mouth.\n\nEdmund\u0027s mouth split in victory, \u0022do you see?\u0022\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-09T05:28:55Z\u0022 title=\u002209/09/2016 05:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 9, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"Alpha 360","CreatedById":166007,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-09T06:26:29Z","Content":"Now that was purely freaky.
