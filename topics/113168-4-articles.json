Controls - How the heck are you going to fit all those controls on to that controller? The only way I can come up with is multiple-button combinations being used for single inputs, which is just plain cumbersome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Performance - As is relatively well known, the PhysX engine used by the Unity game engine runs ONLY on the CPU, without even the possibility to run on the GPU. Seeing that the physics is what bottlenecks this game even on desktops, the PS4\u0027s 1.6ghz AMD cpu does not bode well for framerate at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven full multi-threaded physics support (of the more than one thread per single vessel type) wouldn\u0027t help much. It simply doesn\u0027t have the computing power required to get a reasonable and/or playable framerate, especially with large part count ships. Even a 250 part vessel (normal for many stock large launch vehicles with payload) would likely send framerates to sub 5fps on a PS4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd desktop CPUs are available for less than 100$ USD with 4 cores and roughly double the speed (~3.2GHz Intel I5, IIRC)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Mods - There is simply no way that Sony will let unsigned software run on a game that runs on their console. And they won\u0027t devote the manpower needed to verify that all those mods don\u0027t do anything nasty when put on the PS4 version. And there would be people making mods for the sole purpose of doing \u0022something nasty\u0022 to the PlayStation Network accounts of players, or the PlayStation Network itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Updates - Sony will require the source code for every single update, tear it apart, and go over every single line of it with a microscope, before they even think about letting it on the PlayStation Network.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis takes time. Lots and lots of time. Expect the PS4 version of KSP to be behind the PC/Mac/Linux versions by at least one major version. (If it existed right now, the PS4\u0027s version of KSP would be 0.90 or 0.25.x)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat means by the time the update is ready for PS4, people who are actually interested in the game will have seen all the videos of the new stuff on the PC version, and at least some of those will have bought a PC version of KSP for the simple reason of keeping up to date with the updates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHolding back PC updates until the PS4 version of the same update is ready would generate so much hate in the PC KSP fanbase that it would make all the previous negative press combined look like an ice cube compared to Eeloo. In other words, it would be PR suicide to hold back updates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if the controls and performance problems are solved, mods will NEVER be a thing on a console version, and updates for games on current generation consoles are always checked by the console maker no matter which console it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and I just thought of another reason it won\u0027t be as good as the PC version of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP was developed for PC/Mac/Linux.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPorts of PC games are never as good on consoles as they are on the PC.
