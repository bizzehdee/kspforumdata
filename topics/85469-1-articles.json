Since there are 2 Aluminum atoms stuck to every molecule, you\u0027d have two moles of aluminum for every mole of the given compound. In other words, you\u0027d have 0.80 moles of Aluminum in 0.40 moles of your compound.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"andrewas","CreatedById":24662,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-26T21:24:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESimple enough.

I\u0027m not a chemist but I believe that mol is supposed to measure the number of particles. So you have to be careful and specific about what you\u0027re talking about. For example, if you somehow decomposed this hypothetical compound and recovered just the oxygen, then the question \u0022how many mol do you have of oxygen?\u0022 is not really valid. Oxygen \u003Cem\u003Ewhat\u003C/em\u003E? Oxygen atoms, O2 molecules, or O3 molecules??\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerpenWolf","CreatedById":83222,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-26T21:27:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help!
