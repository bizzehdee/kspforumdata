I have played many games that attempt a space simulation, everything from Orbiter to more SciFi stuff but nothing had what I wanted. Nothing had the ability to really let me build a rocket, launch it and land on more then just the moon. There was a few games that allowed you to do this but they either were focused on the landing part or building the rocket part, you skipped entire sections/features of the game to where they was fun but not what I was hoping for. I even went so far myself to write an entire Game Design document for this idea alone, a game where you picked parts put them together to build your rocket, your pobes, everything. All it did was sit there and gather more idea\u0027s as at the time I hadn\u0027t the capability to bring it to life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I find Kerbal Space Program.... that not only gave me everything I would have wanted... and honestly this is why KSP is so popular it appeals to all area\u0027s of Space travel and provides game play for that.
