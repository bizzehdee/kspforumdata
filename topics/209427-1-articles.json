Get a station in Minmus orbit, put down a miner/refinery and use a tanker to ferry fuel up to the station. Stations around Kerbin and Mun and a fuel tanker or 2 to distribute fuel to them from Minmus orbit. I include a science lander on the Minmus and Mun stations to farm science points, usually I can get enough science to build miners by the time the stations start running out of their initial fuel reserves. Meanwhile I get every single \u0022Save Kerbal from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0022 contract I can and start rotating them through Kerbin/Minmus/Mun to plant flags. That makes them level 2 and they will be level 3 as soon as they reach solar orbit. Mun and Minmus ferries can be incredibly cheap because they can refuel after every transfer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this point I can start re-using ascent booster stages as interplanetary stages by refueling them in orbit which saves a lot on the cost of launches, the boosters typically end up as orbital tugs, fuel storage for stations, communication relays or seismograph science impactors. The only things I throw away from this point on are stage 1 SRBs or spare fuel tanks. I\u0027ll also start aggressively hunting for Class E asteroids, usually I put a bunch of them in Kerbin orbit and plug a refinery in them so I don\u0027t have to ferry fuel from Minmus anymore.

This is usually well underway before my first probes even reach the outer planets. Once I\u0027ve got sustainable refueling going at a planet I will take tourist contracts and save Kerbal contracts for it and of course each station comes with its science lander. Empty seats on tourist flights I fill with Kerbonauts to rotate crews and build up levels. Interplanetary ferries are always fully reusable thanks to being able to refuel at every destination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen it\u0027s pretty much end game with all science unlocked.

A typical tourist contract is for 4 persons (6 if you\u0027re lucky, 2 if you\u0027re not) and takes multiple years to complete. With only 15 contracts and wanting to keep a few slots for short term stuff like rescues, it simply isn\u0027t worth it to take a tourist on a multi-year trip. You could make double the money and rep if you just used those slots to constantly fulfill \u0022Get science from orbit/surface of X\u0022. Upping that to 45 allows me to take enough tourists to fill up ferries and still have some slots left for short term contracts.
