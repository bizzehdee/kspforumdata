A simple camera you could attach to the crafts body, but with a catch. It can only broadcast when it\u0027s in RemoteTechs signal range, making it more realistic. And since you don\u0027t need do control it via wasd keys anyways, only via code in K-OS, you don\u0027t loose any functionality. I think. \n\nI don\u0027t know how hard implementing this would be, but I think it would be pretty cool. \n\nThank you for your time,\n\ncikamatko"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T00:01:36Z","Content":"You might look at CCTV WiFi camera [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107397-Kerbal-CCTV-1-1-now-with-WiFi-camera](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107397-Kerbal-CCTV-1-1-now-with-WiFi-camera) or Hullcam VDS [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/46365-0-23-Hullcam-VDS-Added-new-cameras-by-Rubber-Ducky-Updated-30-Dec](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/46365-0-23-Hullcam-VDS-Added-new-cameras-by-Rubber-Ducky-Updated-30-Dec) maybe ProbeControlRoom [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/67450-WIP-IVA-PLUGIN-ProbeControlRoom-1-0-beta8a-IVA-All-the-things!-new-3D-RPM-17](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/67450-WIP-IVA-PLUGIN-ProbeControlRoom-1-0-beta8a-IVA-All-the-things!-new-3D-RPM-17)"},{"CreatedByName":"cartman","CreatedById":132294,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T00:04:21Z","Content":"Perhaps try requesting this feature from the HullCam mod dev.
