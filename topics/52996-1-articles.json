I kill all velocity so I\u0027m falling straight down. I keep the prograde marker perfectly in the center so I know I\u0027m falling straigh... But I\u0027m not. As the ground gets close I notice I\u0027m moving horizontally. I check engineer and it says I have over 50m/s of horizontal speed... wtf? Navball is wrong.. dead wrong. And it gets worse the closer I get. The prograde/retrograde markers are showing me the wrong information. Ten meters off the ground and I still have a lot of horizontal speed. But again the navball shows that I\u0027m falling straight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I have to ignore it. And visually have to kill the speed. Very sloppy. Not fun. What\u0027s going on?
