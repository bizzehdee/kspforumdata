I\u0027m not actually ask devs to make a translation of the game to some language, but merely ask how hard would it be to make game \u0027localizable\u0027 by others? So, while most ppl are happy with original English texts, nonetheless it would be good to give means to make translations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat i\u0027m actually mean is KSP have no speeches so its localization is pretty simple. All you need is to translate all the texts and probably redraw some textures which are found separately lying in game data folder - almost everyone willing to do that can handle. But the KSP itself is not compatible with those not english texts, and even not totally incopatible but only partially. For example, parts description translations works, but if you try to translate StoryDefs.cfg - you end up with empty strings in Mission Control Center. This looks very weird \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E Game description files are UTF8 so problem is not there and something in the KSP cuts off localization attempts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks and excuse me my not perfect \u0027write in English\u0027 skill.
