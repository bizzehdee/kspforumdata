Steam DOES allow DRM-free games, and KSP is one of them. If you have the Steam version, you can run it without going through Steam, or even being logged into Steam. Just run the KSP.exe. You can even copy the whole folder in your Steam directory, paste it somewhere, and treat it just like the regular ZIP version. I didn\u0027t realize this until AFTER I paid the extra $23 for the zip version, but I\u0027m not too upset since I\u0027ve gotten/will get far more than $46 worth out of it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully this helps some of you out \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sir Nahme","CreatedById":57378,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T00:02:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Every old news but thanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"freedomispopular","CreatedById":67616,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T00:05:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s what I figured, but I\u0027m seeing a LOT of people that aren\u0027t aware of it.
