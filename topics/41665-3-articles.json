In real life the disadvantage is the cost of building it, the quality of materials needed, the ruggedness of the spacecraft being launched due to the g-forces involved, and the cost of powering it, oh, and maintenance would be a bitch. Maybe make it only fire-able once per day, or week, its basically recharging and resetting during these times, or make the weight limit kinda small, like 10 tonnes or so max.
