If they can bend relativity/realism to make a story seem the least bit reasonable, they will. The paradox here seems to be of a psychological sort, where the need to do something is negated. In principle, it is a paradox. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf someone went back and killed some horrible massmurderer before he got to do it, would the posterity then still think it would be necesary to do it? The paradox does however not follow the person who went back in time and did it, wich is the person that conceviably will go back to his/her/its rightfull place in time, and the resulting history will have been changed.

Not saying everyone would be seahorses or a nuclear bomb would blow up your city, but even just people being in the tiniest different place at different times would cause different coincidences to occur, when someone conceived a different sperm would get to the egg, that\u0027s a whole different person born, some people would never meet, other people would meet, a person would not arrive at work at the same time, which means that they will not get in the way of a man walking perpendicular to him, which means that man will not walk a bit to the left, which means he won\u0027t notice the cafe, which means he won\u0027t order a coffee, which means that the person the server would have screwed up the order for will go to another server, which means he won\u0027t get yelled at, which means he won\u0027t go and complain about it to his friend later, which means he won\u0027t get into a conversation with that friend about music, which means that the friend won\u0027t get a song stuck in his head, which means that he won\u0027t be humming it in the middle of a lecture, which means he won\u0027t meet a girl who he would date for a while, which means she won\u0027t influence him and cause him to change his career path to fine art, which means he won\u0027t fail to achieve his goals and become homeless and that the girl won\u0027t be broken up about their relationship and decide to go for a drive in the country to calm her nerves, which means her car won\u0027t break down, which means she won\u0027t hear a story from someone at a diner while waiting for her car to be repaired, which means she won\u0027t turn that story into a bestselling novel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, if time travel worked, things wouldn\u0027t fit together. They would surely diverge into different timelines. And it wouldn\u0027t be like in movies when it only affects things relevant to the plot and the rest of the world stays more or less the same with the same people in the same relationships as long as it\u0027s not the central character\u0027s relationships.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T18:14:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe time travel paradoxes only appear in classical mechanics. Any field theory completely resolves grandfather paradox. I can go into details, but there is a lot of math. In practice, the easiest way to think of it is the alternate time lines explanation. E.g., if somebody travels back in time to prevent a catastrophe that led to him being sent into the past in the first place, you can think of it as there being two worlds, one where things are bad and one where things are good. Person from the \u0022bad\u0022 world comes back and ensures that the \u0022good\u0022 world can exist. It\u0027s kind of up to interpretations whether that\u0027s what is actually going on, but if you use this sort of logic to sort through what would actually happen, you should get the right outcome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of where we are with understanding of time travel, the particular field theory we use to resolve paradoxes is Quantum Field Theory. And because we understand how time travel works in confines of General Relativity, we can actually solve a certain class of time travel problems on paper. Specifically, ones where the time machine exists regardless of any choices made, but whether somebody uses it to go back in time can depend on the circumstance. Unfortunately, if the very creation of time machine is subject to changes you make by time-traveling, the exact solutions are not known. Using the aforementioned tools, we would need theory of Quantum Gravity to do that. But in general, it should behave the same way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, I\u0027m oversimplifying a lot of this. Just explanation of how time travel in GR works is rather involved, because there are all sorts of rules and limitations. But this is the gist of it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
