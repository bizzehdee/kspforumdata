I watched a video showing how one could build a rocket, and in that video he used a 2 metre fairing plate, and then attached 2 metre fairing walls to it. The problem is just that I don\\\u0027t have these parts which are appparently supposed to be included in this mod. The biggest I have are 1,25 metres. Does anyone know where I can find the 2 metre one?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 1,25 one is way too small, and any payload I have within will show through the walls - It looks stupid.
