I watched a video showing how one could build a rocket, and in that video he used a 2 metre fairing plate, and then attached 2 metre fairing walls to it. The problem is just that I don\\\u0027t have these parts which are appparently supposed to be included in this mod. The biggest I have are 1,25 metres. Does anyone know where I can find the 2 metre one?\n\nThe 1,25 one is way too small, and any payload I have within will show through the walls - It looks stupid. Stupid, I tell you. Stupid!"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-30T15:43:12Z","Content":"Did you download NovaPunch 1.2a? There are over a dozen fairing pieces in the zip file, their names start with NP\\_Fairing\\_\n\nIt has the small 1.25m set, but they\\\u0027re slightly different than the other fairing sets, though they\\\u0027re all in the same area in the Structure menu.\n\nThere is a 1.75meter, 2meter and 3meter fairing set, made up of base-plates, half and full walls, and 2 different styles of nosecones.\n\nIf you are using NovaPunch 1.0 and the demo version of the game; I am afraid that was before the fairings were added to the pack, and the newer versions do not work properly on the demo version. That also means the Odin1.0 version you downloaded won\\\u0027t work completely in the demo as well."},{"CreatedByName":"Felsmak","CreatedById":27187,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T13:26:57Z","Content":"The strange thing is that I am using the latest version of NovaPunch, as well as the full game. It seems like it just won\\\u0027t show up, because I don\\\u0027t have any plate bigger than the 1,75 meter one. But it\\\u0027s okay, I guess. I can still use those wheel like things and the walls!"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T13:29:28Z","Content":"The wheel-like-things *are* the larger plates."},{"CreatedByName":"Felsmak","CreatedById":27187,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T15:34:57Z","Content":"Oooh, I thought it was supposed to be like the red 1,75 meter plate, only bigger. How embarrassing."},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T18:06:43Z","Content":"Yeah Jeb had been watching a Western movie right before designing those, and decided he needed to make some wagon wheels. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"}]}
