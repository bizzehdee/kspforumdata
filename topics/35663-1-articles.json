In the real world, this is helpful because it means that at a certain time, the satellite will be at a predictable point in the sky over a predictable location and thus it can synchronize with ground stations easily. This is not a factor in RemoteTech.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor your approach, you should make the orbits as eccentric as possible, like you said. This allows the satellites to spend most of their orbit on one side. I\u0027m not sure what you perceive to be the advantage over a geosynchronous orbit, though; surely the two opposite satellites in the same orbit will drift apart just as much as your geosynchronous constellation will? Unless, for some reason, you are placing these more accurately than your geosynchronous satellites.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-02T20:57:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe reason the Molniya goes for half a sidereal day is to keep the ground track stable over the high-latitude region you want to service.
