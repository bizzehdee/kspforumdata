While I was still playing with only the stock parts i managed to build relatively stable and reached Eve, Duna, Jool etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I recently decided to upgrade my KSP experience with some different Part Packs (primarily KW), which contains fairings and much bigger tanks and parts. It\u0027s all very nice until I launch one of these things and they disintegrate on its way out of the atmosphere. With some of the smaller engines there doesn\u0027t seem to be any problems, so the only obvious explanation to this is that there is a certain limit when it comes to how much thrust a rocket can tolerate. Now I am, of course, using a lot of the extra strong struts, which I btw hate because they are ugly and we don\u0027t see them in real life, but even with these struts it always breaks apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know some if not most of you would just think \u0022try building a proper rocket\u0022 but i am building it properly.
