You can get a PSU tester for ~$20 that will let you plug in the 24 pin and a molex connector, but this kind of testing is useless for a multi-rail design. Not only will you not be able to draw the PSUs total output, but if loading up one rail causes another to droop, you\u0027ll never see it. I also have a hard time believing one of those cheap devices would handle a high end PSU that can dump 60A\u002B onto a single rail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith all this in mind, here\u0027s my step by step PSU testing process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Short green pin to ground. Did it turn on? If not, throw it in the garbage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Swap suspect PSU into another computer and stress test. Does it crash? If so, throw it in the garbage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. It\u0027s not the PSU. Put it back in the original computer and move on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T18:06:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s worth mentioning that having a proper A-brand PSU is always worth the trouble. Cheap units, even when operating normally, tend to cause all sort of trouble and vague problems and can damage your expensive hardware. Subpar PSU\u0027s often are not even capable of delivering their supposed wattage. Rather than providing their power over a sustained period, they can only push out their rated power for milliseconds, spelling trouble as soon as you actually load it. A-brand power supplies will happily deliver everything promised and often a lot more for extended periods of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI consider the PSU the most important part of a computert, together with storage (and backups, which is part of storage).

The closer this number is to the PSU\u0027s rated wattage, the better the PSU is. Cheap PSUs will inflate their power by making tons of amps available on the 5V and 3.3V rails, which it won\u0027t be utilized.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, I\u0027m using the SeaSonic X650 Gold, a 650W power supply. It has 54A on a single 12V rail, for 648W, or 99.7% of what was claimed. Cheap PSUs will often deliver 60-70% of the rated power, and if you try to draw more, then it\u0027s not going to handle it very long, if at all. If the PSU manufacturer is going to such great lengths to deceive you, it\u0027s not because their PSU is a fine piece of equipment that will last you years and years.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T18:48:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LaytheAerospace\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LaytheAerospace\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf the PSU manufacturer is going to such great lengths to deceive you, it\u0027s not because their PSU is a fine piece of equipment that will last you years and years.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExactly, this was what I was trying to convey.
