Plus I\u0027m sure there\u0027s more to krakensbane and the coordinate system than Squad has explained. We have here a collision detection error of some kind, and barring weirdness like dangling pointers or such (not supposed to be possible in these buzzword-laden, performance-killing 90s languages, right?), that kinda puts suspicion on anything that has anything to do with coordinates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally though, I think Squad probably needs to do a full-press manual code and design audit, challenging every assumption that every line of code makes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(By the way, I\u0027ve actually implemented something not unlike Krakensbane in my own historical and more modern designs, and there\u0027s ALWAYS some crazy little gotcha waiting when you start nesting coordinates.

Having the wing break off from hitting the VAB while still on approach destroyed my mission and upset me enough that I now that that precaution. Now if I make a mess of a landing, the temptation will be to quick-load. I think I will be strong enough to resist it but if the mission is involved and complex, I don\u0027t know. Perhaps I\u0027ll falter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems to be consistently happening with a radially attached wing part and the children of that part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere seems to be a verifiable constancy.
