Me personally, I do not prefer Avast. I personally prefer Microsoft Security Essentials along with another program called EMET (Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit), a combo that will prevent most malware from getting onto your computer and that does not interfere with games if EMET is set to default settings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
