Someone posted some stats that I had never seen before, and I noted that they were very unbalanced.  Now through some kind of mental gymnastics, you\u0027re starting to (publicly) fling random accusations and conspiracy theories.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If your goal was cooperation and interop, you\u0027re really taking a weird approach.  You might want to take a step back, because all you\u0027re doing now is throwing all goodwill down the drain.\n\u003E \n\nWow...to say that the level of hostility and agressiveness of this reaction made me literally speechless would be a huge understatement.\n\nI indeed referred to the passage ValPal mentioned:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Quote\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I published pretty clear balance guidelines for this reason.  While I totally get that it\u0027s your game, etc. when stuff pops out as mods, it results in a weird and unbalanced \u0027race to the bottom\u0027 where people just use the most unbalanced parts, or have to restrain and intentionally hobble themselves in their game.  And since they are USI-LS compatible parts, I end up fielding the whole \u0027why is X so heavy, or why is Y so hard?\u0027 because someone\u0027s pushing a set of stuff that\u0027s completely unbalanced from the original intent and balance of not only this mod, but the other ones that tie into it.\n\u003E \n\nThis passage read like i\u0027m either too stupid to read and comprehend these pretty clear instructions or made the greenhouse unbalanced on purpose for the sole purpose to outdo other mods. Neither one is the case, it was an oversight. The implication that using unbalanced mods with USI-LS is not really desired wasn\u0027t that far away."},{"CreatedByName":"VaPaL","CreatedById":150974,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-13T22:45:59Z","Content":"Come on guys, [@RoverDude](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/) and [@Nils277](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/122414-nils277/). For me, viewing this from the outside, it\u0027s more than clear that this is just a mere misunderstanting. I agree with [@goldenpsp](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/113874-goldenpsp/) and [@Andem](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/155578-andem/), that everyone should let you two solve your business and you\u0027d probably get over it soon.

RD said what I quoted, and at first I thought exactly as Nils, but I know RD better now, I know it\u0027s just his way with words and he didn\u0027t meant what I thought at first. But since the topic was KPBS Nils took it personal and stick with the first impression, which it\u0027s totally understandable, I would probabl do the same. So he said those \u0027accusation\u0027 that RD was \u0027attacking\u0027 him and his mod. Since RD didn\u0027t meant that, he got offended and surprised and \u0027fought\u0027 back. From this point on, it\u0027s just a snowball that will keep getting bigger and bigger. I\u0027ve been on both sides of that, and I\u0027m sure you both been there too.  \n\nThis arguing doesn\u0027t do good to anyone, nether the community and nether and especially you two.

Just bear in mind the upper tier manufacturing bits are generally 3.75\u0027s, so I\u0027d need to noodle how that could be compressed (realistically) into a smaller form factor without unbalancing everything (i.e. the form factor for that last tier is part of the balance).\n\n(a small edit after sleeping on it)\n\nTho this is better for the UKS thread.  The reason why balance RE form factor/volume/mass is important and why I am not sure linear scale balances is because even if efficiency is plummeted, and output is drastically curtailed, you can just timewarp your way to whatever you need (and effectively bypass a major gameplay element of UKS... at which point, you don\u0027t have UKS... you have something else).\n\nI think the only way to sort it without a weird unbalancing would be to somehow split the functionality across multiple parts through some really creative use of efficiency and mandatory efficiency parts so that it landed in the same space.  i.e. you could (in theory) create a smaller fabricator that required X number of additional modules on the base to function, and construct the subcomponents on site.  I may have the tools to do this in the next major cut of OKS/MKS with the new tundra modules, but those are still pretty WIP.\n\n![DrH77z9.png](http://i.imgur.com/DrH77z9.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-14T12:48:32Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2016 12:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by RoverDude**"},{"CreatedByName":"invultri","CreatedById":92101,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-14T16:37:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 6/7/2016 at 6:24 PM, tsaven said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Could someone double-check my math so I\u0027m clear on my understanding of how recyclers and greenhouses work?  I\u0027m trying to design a ship for 12 Kerbals with a 10-year mission lifespan (Roundtrip to Sarnus and back).  I\u0027m using KPBS hab and greenhouses, which (as I understand) have similar mechanics to USI\u0027s stock modules.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E My understanding is as follows:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 12 Kerbins \\* 16.2 Supplies per day per kerbal = 192.4 supplies consumed per day.

I assume that\u0027s per second, so per day each greenhouse will consume 112.32 Mulch, 17.28 Fertilizer, and produce 129.6 Supplies.  So . . . wow, I don\u0027t need three greenhouses on this ship.  BUT GUYS THEY LOOK SO COOL.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Anyway, if my math works out the greenhouses need 6.5 Mulch \u002B 1 Fertilizer = 7.5 Supplies.
