One of the episodes involved playing the stock market, and I thought \u0022Why not have that in KSP?\u0022 I mean, there are different agencies, and then there\u0027s your own agency, most likely named \u0022Default\u0022 for you sandboxers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea I\u0027m pitching here is a stock market in-game that mostly depends on the reputation system. If your rep is in the neg, then there is no chance for investment. The higher it is, the higher your chance. If you buy parts from another agency, they gain the profit for the sale, unless your agency builds it\u0027s own parts, either requiring EPL, or just a simple toggle\u00A0option.\u00A0Of course, this could lead to a career mode that is just too rich,\u00A0especially if you\u0027re the Astrogamer, Scott Manley.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps there\u00A0could be a button found in the Administration building to access the economy, or maybe even\u00A0another building added in. Maybe RemoteTech\u0027s developers could have a helping hand in this, with certain areas of Kerbin needing connections because of\u00A0where other agencies are located at.\u00A0Maybe even some world record contracts for gaining however much money from the market would be a great addition to a great mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
