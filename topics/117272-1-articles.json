Lift is also a factor of velocity, so the faster you go the less wings you need and the less wings you have the faster you can go. But less wings also means higher slowest speed and less glide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the shock cones have the least drag per air intake as of 1.0.4 AFAIK\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Violent Jeb","CreatedById":130681,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T22:42:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Epfft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etime to let MJ shine over KER.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy friends, MechJeb has an \u0022atmospheric drag\u0022 value, which you can have visible through your entire flight!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo need to get the terminal velocity and do the maths.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt provides your atmospheric drag value in m/s much like the nav speedo. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFWIW, typical flights will experience anywhere between 1-15 m/s drag.
