this is why i think having vague models of planetary exploration that can be mixed around on each play thru would be beneficial for immersion. needing multiple magnetometer satellites in various polar orbits in the jool system one play thru and on the next maybe you need multiple resource maps of the smaller moons and gravioli detectors on the larger ones, some thing like that. so i can\u0027t preplan my entire space agency from the first contract is all. i have an issue where i start a new game, get half way thru the opening missions and go \u0027why bother, I\u0027ve built these rockets a

they train you to be a great rocket scientist and then tell you to explore at your own leisure. to me, that first moon landing better be on a contract, and it better have felt like a difficult thing to accomplish. i want that to be true no matter where i am or what i am doing. like each mission got harder and prepared me for the previous one. but obviously in a more generalized way that fits the

2 cents on how things could be improved. the career system as is does not facilitate anything about acquiring science, nor does it encourage unique designs or flight paths, nor does it do a reliable job of even guiding me on amy exploration (see the exploration contracts that skip moons and planets seemingly at random). the contract system would be a great way to encourage full exploration of various biomes and worlds usually untouched by a casual player while also rewarding the player directly for this action rather than giving science points you may or may not need.\u00A0i recognize much of this can be solved with a mod or two, or by me learning to code, but in that sense, why not leave the entire game as a string of 1\u0027s and 0\u0027s we have to encode directly from a PDF. my argument is that the base game can be better than it is in a few simple and easy ways. idk. i feel like you\u0027re purposely being an antagonist on this if at the end of it you actually agree with me
