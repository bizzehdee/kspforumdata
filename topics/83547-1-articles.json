Not saying you shouldn\u0027t ofc just wondering why when a properly set up APU ( auxiliary power unit) would provide EC on demand or by throttle control. As you have no objection to plugins maybe check out the Kerbal Foundries thread a s a range of such power units are shortly to be released, and theres always \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90438-WIP-New-parts-landinglegs-Beam-Axles?p=1383546\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1383546\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emy version\u003C/a\u003E which will come out at the same time, for those of a more agricultural leanings and it require no hacky universal resource generators, no EC, no fuel = no engine start = no EC .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso what do you really want in wheels , all the stock ones are less than amazing, although reworked versions can be transformed once thrown back to unity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
