There are couple important things though:\n\n1) You can now have more than 1 sequencer per vessel, so you can have a sequencer for Legs separate from sequencer for Arms for example. It is achieved by moving all sequencer logic to PartModule and is for now attached to probe-cores. This sequencer stores its States and corresponding Sequences and manages their proper execution.\n\n2) For each sequencer module only one state-changing sequence can be executed at any given time, although if you have non-statechanging sequences, any number of them can be ran simultaneously as long your sequencer\u0027s current state matches their start state and they don\u0027t lock each other\u0027s servos\n\n3) Although you can have multiple sequencers, keyboard shortcuts are shared between them, so you can use one shortcut key to start/stop multiple sequences across multiple sequencers, but only sequences with proper Start State will be started, depending on the current state of each of the sequencers on your vessel.\n\nP.S. All this was made possible thanks to [@ZodiusInfuser](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/76163-zodiusinfuser/), who poked me enough about this feature although he is really busy IRL.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-29T13:54:59Z\u0022 title=\u002202/29/2016 01:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Ziw**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tirehtoori R.I.P","CreatedById":149732,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-29T14:02:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 minutes ago, Ziw said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\ni know ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022) and im poking zodius for more parts to tinker and experiment ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022) also i noticed that i cannot put a picture of one of my leg schematics here that i think would be usefull in your testing of the new features :,D"},{"CreatedByName":"ZodiusInfuser","CreatedById":76163,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-29T20:57:19Z","Content":"Yay!\n\nEdit: BTW, once this is out I recommend people draw our their state machines using this webpage first before transferring it to the sequencer: [http://madebyevan.com/fsm/](http://madebyevan.com/fsm/)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-29T21:01:31Z\u0022 title=\u002202/29/2016 09:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by ZodiusInfuser**"},{"CreatedByName":"ZodiusInfuser","CreatedById":76163,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-01T03:35:26Z","Content":"FYI, the reason I pushed for Ziw to add such a feature to the Sequencer is because often (at least in my creations) you have sequences that are intended to only be played when something has deployed first, e.g only allow a Canadarm to be extended when a cargo bay is open.

I was merely telling you how could you improve your videos and you shove me in the face that you took over 3 years to learn how to do a pair of legs for a walker. As for the pic, you can see it above. Would be rather cool you post it here instead of send it via mail, as people could get an use of whatever youre going to send. Oh that and I dont get into my mail very often \u003Csub\u003Eit\u0027s a mess.\u003C/sub\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Tirehtoori R.I.P","CreatedById":149732,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-21T09:18:36Z","Content":"![jv4mm2w3b](http://postimg.org/image/jv4mm2w3b/) well here is one of my, most basic 2 legged sequencer leg design possible using only rotatrons, and if your design is that one upthere i see the problem there imidiatly and i will make a schematic soon and post it, so atleast try mine in the meanwhile ^^ but usually problem with legs go when you try to make not symmetrycal movement like 180,180,360,360 using 2 different angled things, too long step will also fell the craft, too slow step too and too fast will just make it jump uncontrollably, so keep the step angles in area of (15-15     -     45-45) decrees, and most important part is the \u0022FEET\u0022 too large will always \u0022hit its toe and fell\u0022 too small doesn\u0027t have the area of effectiviness to hold the mech stable when step is taken and will result into falling backwards, forwards, sideways, depending on the feets design.   and you can\u0027t make a walker using only 2 rotatrons in one leg ^^\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-21T09:23:16Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2016 09:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Tirehtoori R.I.P**"}]}
