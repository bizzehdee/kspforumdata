One is four stage, the other eight. I did this purely by re-staging the decouplers, didn\u0027t touch the existing fuel-lines. The original had a payload, which I removed. I use a few mods (KER, RT2 - I removed the antenna, the above mentioned ARP, no others that I think will interfere).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould any rocket boffins help stop me going crazy, please?
