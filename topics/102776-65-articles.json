I know where all the biomes on the Mun and Minmus are without having to scan anything, I\u0027ve built colonies all over, I\u0027ve done Jool with tier 1 tech in Career mode. I love the game but the regular Kerbol system has nothing else for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNH is exactly what it\u0027s named - it\u0027s a whole new take on KSP and while I\u0027ve got about 30 mods in CKan loaded and ready to go they\u0027re there to add to my exploration of NH. I played NH in 1.0.5 but it came down to either leaving out \u0027quality of life\u0027 mods I really love or buying the Unix version and playing the game off a thumb drive... so I decided to wait for the 64bit version to be fully stable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo KillAshley if you\u0027re powered by props know that your mods are literally the only reason I\u0027m really excited to play KSP again. Going to start with New Horizons, crawl into every nook and cranny and corner until I can make most transfers from memory and then I\u0027ll start on Uncharted, then swing back to Kerbol Plus Remake. That\u0027s probably another 500\u002B hours by which time I\u0027ll start over with KASE and when that\u0027s done I\u0027ll reinstall everything, grab a good interplanetary drive mod and start into Galactic Neighborhood.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo thank you for the huge time investment you\u0027ve done but don\u0027t forget that you\u0027re essentially refreshing KSP as a game. Regular mods, ships, parts, science, they\u0027re all great. Tons of fun. I can\u0027t play without the full USI suite of mods anymore, and EPL and several others. However once you\u0027ve figured out how to do return missions to Eve, set up large self-sustaining colonies on Laythe, mined Karborundum from Eeloo until every ship can run a torch drive there\u0027s nothing new to do in the stock Kerbol system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot trying to rush, no pressure in that way but know it\u0027s hugely appreciated and for many of us you\u0027re making the game what we are excited to play even after a crazy amount of playtime.
