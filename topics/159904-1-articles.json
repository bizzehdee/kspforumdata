I am trying to leave the Kerbin system with a DT Vista Fusion Engine, but I keep running into the same problem over and over. Out of the blue, my thrust drops to 0. I check Kerbal Engineer and it says that my fuel is burning and all other resources are being consumed as normal. Check the engine itself and it says it has 600Kn of thrust, but my orbital speed isn\u0027t changing at all. There is a constant supply of power coming from the Nuclear fusion generator, keeping the power above 2.5Gw. This isn\u0027t happening right when I start my burn either, I will use 1,750DV\u00A0in a certain direction with perfect output from the engine, but after that it just stops, with 250 more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E required to finish my burn correctly. I have been looking over this all night and I cannot for the life of me figure out what is causing this constant failure in engine output. Any advice?
