The only way for it to not overheat too fast would be to put radiators around it.\n\nThe active cooling thing :\n\nIt would be a piece that in order to work would use electricity and cool things pretty fast, BUT because physic is not very nice with us, if we cool something, we have to heat something else in return. So it would be a piece to cool for example engines and would have in exchange to heat other part of the vessel.\n\nFor example, we have a part of the vessel that is near overheating, we would then active the active cooling piece to cool down the part very fast and in exchange, would heat up the rest of the vessel. \n\nWe could also have something to produce electricity with the heat produced in the vessel : in fact it would be a piece that in contact with a hot part and a cooler one, would produce electricity (in fact, a stirling engine). Of course the cooling rate would be lower than any other technique, but would produce electricity in exchange.\n\nHere is a gif of what nasa came upon electricity production in space with a stirling engine [http://www.photology.fr/moteur_stirling/strllinear/infinia_linear.gif](http://www.photology.fr/moteur_stirling/strllinear/infinia_linear.gif)\n\nP.S : sorry for the grammar, i tried to correct all the mistakes I could"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Kerman","CreatedById":166398,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T04:02:55Z","Content":"I\u0027m all for a radiator part like the foldable style mentioned in this thread.\n\n\u002B1"}]}
