Even then, most of them will just be prop and not as interactive as ALCOR (have you ever try activating the emergency electricity generator? it actually works and will consume monoprop to create EC, that is how awesome ALCOR is).\n\nThere were [Many props](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/500/ManyProps) and [Modified IVA](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/252/Modified%20IVA) that both uses those props for buttons and panels in other IVA, but they are for 0.90. May or may not work now."},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T19:06:58Z","Content":"Alex (The creator of ALCOR) is supposedly working on adding his ALCOR props to the stock IVA\u0027s.

I started populating stock pods with props, however, with the latest release of RPM, ALCOR props need an update to the latest code.\n\n*It was me who placed the RPM monitors in new cockpits of KSP 1.0*\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nI\u0027m curious which of the ALCOR props you like the most? Which of them are the most useful?\n\nMany pods just don\u0027t have enough space in them to place everything and I have to choose.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-14T17:53:10Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2015 05:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Enceos**"}]}
