So I changed the max thrust for 1m, because it says in the cfg file to make that higher for more powerful per diameter (makes sense, since it is diameter^2 times maxthrust at 1meter or something like that). I changed it, but the thrust remains the same. I do have RO, realfuels. Any help?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERealFuels has a completely different system for working out thrust. It\u0027s designed such that you should be able to get a just higher thrust to diameter ratio than the best thrust to diameter ratio of any SRB ever made. Which IIRC is the shuttle boosters. Not entirely sure how to change that, will look into it.
