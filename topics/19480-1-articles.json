I even spent a while killing Kerbals by dropping command pods onto the launch pad while \u0027assisting\u0027 their descent with SRB\u0027s pointing towards the floor. Needless to say, many Kerbals perished (and I am a terrible person) but there was no sign of Bill, Bob or Jeb. I actually currently have 3 or 4 kerbonauts named \u0022Dilney Kerman\u0022 all on active mission.

They were the first guys to orbit, first guys on M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and Minmus (since the saves got reset in 0.16) and I still haven\u0027t killed them! They now spend their days retired, living on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn in what used to be my M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn Research Lab. The lab was later replaced by the more sophisticated M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnLab 2.0 and was sold as real estate.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-17T02:06:01Z\u0022 title=\u002209/17/2012 02:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 17, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by sporkafife\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
