I will also point out, on a linux 64bit configuration i have, this mod and planetshine SEEMED to play well together no problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso since i had to admit this, i would also like to admit since i have the dev of PS\u0027s attention: I LOVE YOUR MOD. You did a fantastic job of picking up the reins of mods that handled realistic planetary darkness factors. You are doing a fantastic job!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
