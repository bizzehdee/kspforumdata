It worked fine one hour ago, and since then I made an insignificant modification to it (adding a ladder).\n\nWhen on the runway, the pitch controls are normal (Z to go down, S to lift up, I\u0027m using an AZERTY keyboard layout)\n\n![3406b3924b.jpg](http://puu.sh/jqycd/3406b3924b.jpg)\n\n(Here I\u0027m pressing S)\n\nAnd suddenly, for no reason at all, the controls got reversed (Z to go up, S to go down). I tried to remove the ladder, the controls are still inverted. Switching to a stock plane fixes the issues (However, switching back to my plane reverse the controls again), rebooting the game too (Albeit temporarily).\n\nIt\u0027s pretty annoying and probably has nothing to do with the CG, as the plane worked fine one hour ago when first tested. Please, help.\n\n**EDIT : I think I know what\u0027s causing this. I previously controlled the ship from a Mk2 probe core. My issues happened after I decided to control my ship from the reversed Mk2 cockpit. Please ignore all of this. It would be nice to have this bug fixed, though.**\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-05T19:13:56Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2015 07:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LethalShade**"},{"CreatedByName":"danfarnsy","CreatedById":67183,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T19:24:13Z","Content":"I\u0027m glad you figured it out!

In your case, with cockpit upside down, raising the nose lowers the AoA, decreasing lift. \n\nTL;DR\n\nIt\u0027s not a bug, it\u0027s a common aviation standard.

The default in the SPH is for a control to be active in pitch, roll, and yaw. The reversal option affects all three, and that situation is a rotation about the roll-axis. It wouldn\u0027t affect the polarity of roll direction"}]}
