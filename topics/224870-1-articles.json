At the moment it just warns the player in advance that a \u0022warp-in\u0022 is imminent with some special effects, so one can prepare for the stutter, but ideally it would be much more interesting if they show up with as little warning as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-05-22T20:55:02Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2024 08:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022May 22\u0022\u003EMay 22\u003C/time\u003E by kimiko\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
