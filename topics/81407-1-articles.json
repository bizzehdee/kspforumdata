I haven\u0027t disabled revert or quicksave/load simply because KSP has a fair amount of bugs.

That\u0027s all there is to it - you just need the self-control to not revert after any mishap. If I get to LKO and realise my probe doesn\u0027t have solar panels, I\u0027m not going to revert, I\u0027m going to send up a rescue mission and attach some panels to it with KAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeeing as recovering on the runway/launchpad gives 100% refund, it\u0027s functionally no different than reverting when doing a test. That\u0027s the big problem with your idea - if it costs to do a test, then launch a \u0027real life\u0027 mission and make sure you recover it on the runway/launchpad. Depending on the test (no staging or consumption of depletable resources), no money is lost and the \u0027simulation\u0027/test is complete. Sometimes, my tests are as simple as \u0027is this probe core facing the right way?\u0027 In those cases, I\u0027m not even going to go anywhere, just load it up, look at the navball and revert. Much quicker than loading up, looking at the navball, recovering, waiting for the mission overview screen, hoping KSP doesn\u0027t crash, clicking the SPH, waiting for it to load, hoping it doesn\u0027t crash and then loading up my craft again.
