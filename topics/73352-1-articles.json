In this shot it misses 8x Sabre M Engines at each one of the smaller black tips at the sides, which is needed to obtain orbit with reasonable fuel to take you Minmus, and then refuel through some Kethane Extraction(that takes 400k exactly) if you\u0027re lucky, Minmus will have 1-2 deposits of that size!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/HwINxCV.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HwINxCV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe VTOL Van-\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCber transport and kethane extraction vessel.
