It\u0027s quite captivating (especially for a sandbox game, as these usually can\u0027t hold me that long).\n\nI\u0027m currently playing a normal career mode and after several restarts (and various explosions) i think i have a fine grasp on the basics (currently finetuning my fuel-usage to get into orbit).\n\nHowever i have some questions, which i couldn\u0027t answer via the wiki or by browsing the forum, so i hope it\u0027s ok to ask here.\n\n1. During the trainings-mission when activating SAS i get these vector-nodes besides my navball to tell my pilot to automaticly target this node. So far i have gathered that in career mode, how much of theses vectors turn up depends on the level of the pilot.\n\nMy question is, do i also get these icons when using a probe-body (with SAS) on an unmanned vessel? Currently i have only unlocked the first probe body with SAS (the one after the sputnik) but no icons appear. Am i\u0027m out of luck (as i find these quite usefull when executing maneuvers) or do higher tech probe-bodys have these little helpful icons?\n\n2. Transmitting science data after conducting an experiment gets usually less science then keeping the data and returning the vessel. Until now i have witholded transmitting any data in fear that it would lower my total science i could get out of an experiment/situation-combination. But after reading a bit up i\u0027m not so sure anymore. So can i safely transmit all material studys i conduct in high orbit (for example) and still reach the maximum science cap for that experiment? (Though it would take me more experiements then if i return it)\n\n3. How to control a plane?\n\nI\u0027ve unlocked only the first tech to build planes and thought i might try building a small one - after putting a lot more wings on it (so much that i didn\u0027t have enough parts left to put on some parachutes..) i finally managed to get one into the air, for about 20sec before i crashed it into the water. I know it\u0027s probably difficult to answer this without a concrete example, but most of the time i\u0027m not sure if i crash because the design has some errors, or if the design could fly, and i just can\u0027t control it. Any general tips to found out?\n\n4. Delta-v and return home\n\nI\u0027ve read several nice tutorials here about delta-v and it\u0027s importance and since i installed kerbal engineer my rockets are becoming a lot better. Since after i got a good design to launch a satelite into orbit (with properly planned fuel usage - currently i have to burn to much of my last stage) i want to send a probe to the mun i\u0027m thinking about how much delta-v i need. Figuring out how much i need for the trip to mun is not a big deal, but it seems the delta-v maps never contain the required delta-v for the hometrip. Or do i just need the same amount i needed for the first trip? (Lets say orbit -\u003E orbit)\n\nOk i think thats enough questions for now, since this is in the welcome-forum after all. Anyway thanks in advance for helping me out."},{"CreatedByName":"Ten Key","CreatedById":123319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T20:45:08Z","Content":"Welcome to the forums Magic. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 3. How to control a plane?\n\nThis is a great place to start when it comes to aircraft design basics. It helped me out quite a bit when I was first getting into the game. \n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52080-Basic-Aircraft-Design-Explained-Simply-With-Pictures](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52080-Basic-Aircraft-Design-Explained-Simply-With-Pictures)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 4.

So a trip from LKO to low Munar orbit and back again might look something like 860 m/s --\u003E 210 m/s --\u003E 210 m/s--\u003E 860 m/s. That last 860 m/s is avoidable if you use Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere to slow down instead of burning."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T21:28:01Z","Content":"1. You may get some or none of them depending on the model of probe core. \n\n2. There is a certain amount of science to be had from each experiment in each biome. Transmitting or returning the data only changes how much of it you retrieve at a time, but the total available is the same either way. \n\n3. This is a pretty complex question. Check the Gameplay Questions/Tutorials subforums for helpful answers from other players. \n\n4. The dV cost to go one way is the same as the cost to go the other way, except in situations where one end of the trip has an atmosphere which can help you do some of the braking. \n\nWelcome to the forum. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Goddess Bhavani","CreatedById":14001,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T03:57:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 3.
