Each of these vehicles, (ship truck and car) is essentially a warp bubble and the fly is Jeb Kerman. In fact there could potentially be thousands or millions of warp bubbles all mere millimeters thick allowing the vessel to travel at almost (but not quite) infinite speeds from A-B yet the bubbles themselves would only be moving a fraction of the speed of light. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease discuss.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wahgineer","CreatedById":59292,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-24T15:14:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile possible, you forgot several things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.)

The inside one is NOT moving relative to the outside shell. This is because both shells are generated from the same point in space (your ship) so you would never have any difference in speed. Incidentally, trying to onion your shells is an interesting technical problem, primarily because the actual boundary of your shell will probably be warped space that would rip apart any structure you tried to poke out of it. So both your engines end up being in the central shell, which results in the warping effects basically occupying the same space. Shifting the \u0027warp emitters\u0027 away from each other just ends up changing the space of your field, but any speed boost you gain is likely to be additive as you are just doubling (if using two of the same engine) the warp output.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-24T20:09:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould the \u0022speed\u0022 of a space warp bubble even make sense, relative to the the speed of light (i.e. the mentions of 10c and 100c, etc.)?

The size/intensity allows you to derive things like speed and power, but the speed is quite necessary for things like navigation. Of course, the trick is that with the ship itself, it can only really guess how fast it is moving (compared to an outside point of view) based on how much power it is throwing into the engines. So in a way, the size/intensity are important BECAUSE they let you calculate speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally the warp factor of Star Trek assumes a physics system that there is no evidence exists when it comes to real life warp tech. The whole factor 1-10, is a power vs speed chart with exponentially more power required to gain more speed until you reach an asymtote of infinite power (beyond which the power draw drops to next to nothing, allowing transwarp infinite speeds). Currently there is no indication that the power/speed relationship of real warp tech is anything but linear (IE, doubling the power should double the speed assuming the volume remains the same).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LawnDartLeo","CreatedById":61230,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-24T20:31:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs it a bubble or a wave?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy understanding is that warp travel is more like cosmic surfing, a ripple in space where you surf down the wave with a trough in front (pull) and a peak behind (push).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mazon Del","CreatedById":32991,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-24T20:38:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETechnically both.
