Want to do \u0022a small step for [a] man, a giant leap for mind kind\u0022 ? Strap a CSM and a LM into a Saturn V using AMSO to \u003Cstrong\u003Elaunch yourself to the Moon\u003C/strong\u003E. Want to bring \u0026lt;Random Module\u0026gt; to the ISS ? Take one of the Shuttle Fleet (that\u0027s the Mod name, yes) and go \u003Cstrong\u003Erendezvous with the outpost\u003C/strong\u003E as the sun rises over the horizon. You are more in a \u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022suicidal\u0022 mood\u003C/strong\u003E? Seat into a XR2 Ravenstar and make a speed suborbital transfer from Canaveral to Wideawake. Want to colonize Mars, Mercury or even Titan? Okay, go with your DGIV in the Arrow Freighter and wait for the window, then unpack all the base modules and place them as you wish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow if I do these tutorials, it will cover the journey to outer space from just after install (how to install mods as they are sometimes creepy, what to install first, what does what things, etc...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eto Saturn flights using a Jupiter slingshot, passing by free-return trajectories, aerobraking, and for the Ultimate Milestone, the Voyager Grand Tour, with Voyager. I may or may not do a \u0022build your space station\u0022 part too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, are you interested in getting to the fictional solar system which contains Mercury to Neptune, go answer this poll (answer it too if you don\u0027t want, you may just want to choose an other option \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ), and I\u0027ll be glad to teach you how to orbit, the Earth way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA bit more about the format:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese will be video tutorials on my YouTube channel (SolarLinerGames), the length will entirely depend on the time I\u0027ll take. Some episodes may be separated as parts, to keep the video file low (bandwidth restriction :/). So I think the max length of an episode or part will be 50min to 1hour (avg 2 Go of upload, quite good, the best I can do for file size/video quality balance). I have no clues on when and what upload frequencies, as I manage my channel in my free time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, good flights to everyone, and may some Kerbal will meet Earth guys \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-13T16:51:54Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2013 04:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SolarLiner\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SuperWeegee4000","CreatedById":71621,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T15:17:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInteresting.
