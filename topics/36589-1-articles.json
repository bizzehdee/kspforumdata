No explosions!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also do the skycrane thing if needed. I had to earlier today when a landing went tits-up. Dumped the rover, lander hit the ground a ways off and tipped over. Both are alright; the rover is just sat on it\u0027s nose, while the lander ended up sitting perfectly upside-down when I tried to right it by fiddling with the legs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, for attaching the whole thing to the rocket, I suggest attaching the middle of the rover along the rocket\u0027s axis, and holding things together with struts. The small cubic strut bits work great for strut attachment points, to get struts past the rover and a decoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-10T21:28:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould also put a set of stack separators on the sides of any pre-existing standard Mun lander you\u0027ve got and attach them that way. Use BZ-52s set radially on the lander\u0027s sides and attach the seperators to them, then stick the side of the Rovemate you\u0027re using to the seperator. Wheel-side down, of course.

If you want to be able to get that rover off the planet and back to Kerbin, use a lander that uses a docking port system, or a KAS docking port system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use a KAS docking port system for my Speed Rover\u0027s Lander.
