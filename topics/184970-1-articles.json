I\u0027ve got everything set up properly with the controller in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, it all works as intended when I run tests there. But once on the pad, or the runway in case of a spaceplane, the parts don\u0027t move. I\u0027ve tried everything, so unless I\u0027m missing something critical, there\u0027s a bug here? Or, one of my mods is somehow preventing this from working as Squad intended. I\u0027m not sure which mod that would be, as I was not using Infernal Robotics.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OrbitsR4Sissies","CreatedById":192100,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-01T12:43:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027re all new at this, of course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just made a test rover this morning.
