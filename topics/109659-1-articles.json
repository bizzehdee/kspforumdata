I\u0027ve not seen numbers anywhere near that high from experiments around the Mun, loading them into a lab in low Mun orbit.\n\nWhatever the reason, Snark is correct, it\u0027s a hard limit of 500, unless you mod the game."},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T02:38:52Z","Content":"Yeah, a mod or an edit to \u0022dataStorage =\u0022 in GameData/Squad/Parts/Science/LargeCrewedLab/largeCrewedLab.cfg would do it in a pinch."}]}
