Ubuntu has oodles better performance than any recent version of Windows, is more stable, and on top of it all, will let you use 64-bit KSP (assuming you had a 64-bit processor). Even if the 64-bit KSP isn\u0027t an option and your hardware really is that old, still consider it. Windows XP, Vista, and 7, all have significant amounts of overhead that further reduce the amount of memory 32-bit applications can use before they crash (the theoretical limit is around 4GB, but Windows bloat reduces this to under 3.4). You\u0027ll get a fair bit more out of your PC with Ubuntu than XP, especially where KSP is concerned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes I know the memory thing is more complicated but for the purposes of running KSP, I think I gave a good approximation of the difference.
