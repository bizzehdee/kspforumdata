This allows them to redirect the thurst of their engine forward instead of backward and therefor breaking way faster than with tire breaks and aerobreaks alone.\n\nHow would you like such a feature at the jet engines in KSP (at least the J-33 and the J-X4)?"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T16:49:50Z","Content":"There\u0027s actually some mods that do this already, but I\u0027ve only seen it as an option for the new engines provided by the mods, not for the stock engines.\n\nI don\u0027t see why the stock engines couldn\u0027t be modified however, and I would also appreciate having thrust reversers on the stock engines.\n\nI think that the firespitter plugin provides the necessary code, all the mods that had the option required the firespitter dll."},{"CreatedByName":"nholzric","CreatedById":7793,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T18:59:04Z","Content":"I\u0027ve noticed landing speed is ridiculously low these days, even with aircraft that don\u0027t have oversized wings. Rather than add complexity to the stock parts, you could probably employe some maneuvers (S- turns) to show down and then exploit the low stall speed to stop before the end of the runway."},{"CreatedByName":"KrazyKrl","CreatedById":65849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T23:33:55Z","Content":"Thrust reversers are one of those features you didn\u0027t know you needed; until you have lost it.

Do high-performance military aircraft like fighters have them? They\u0027re pretty heavy, and I believe the cert requirements for commercial aircraft that have them is they must be able to stop on brake power alone. The \u0022real\u0022 answer is longer runway (whether that\u0027s a good gameplay choice is another matter\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6),\n\nThe primary shuttle landing strip is 4.5 km long.
