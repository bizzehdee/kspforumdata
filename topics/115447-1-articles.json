I wish that you will delete that one since I\u0027ve been trying to find this account for ever. Though here I am! 2011 member, I remember the good old days back in 0.13 and I looked through my posts, my last post when we got 10,000 members, started tearing up because of how much squad grown over these years \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I\u0027ve been following Squad ever since 2011 and I\u0027m just happy to know that I\u0027ve been with Squad this whole time. The addiction to achieve my goal to become an astronaut has grown deeply because of Squad and I\u0027m happy to know that Squad made me make up my mind and set a life goal, I will forever act as a time capsule of memories if Squad ever vanishes for no reason since I\u0027ve seen the game, the moderators like Sal_Vager when he only had around 200 posts on the forum go from 10,000. Its been a fantastic time spent and I have to thank Squad for making me make up my mind to become an astronaut and spend my time to blow up kerbals!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RAINCRAFTER","CreatedById":127524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T01:19:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi brody, welcome back!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T08:33:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome back brody, yeah things really have changed around here, and your duplicate account is no more \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwi1960","CreatedById":81697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T09:45:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou... blow up....
