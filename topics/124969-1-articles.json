Seems odd though that Squad would add a ramp when it\u0027s main use is unfeasible. Maybe it would be possible for them to fix it by assigning cargo-bay parts to a special layer like they did with jettisoned fairings to give them specific properties, or maybe I\u0027m being an idiot and all parts of a craft have to be the same layer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T21:22:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea if that will work, the fairings become their own vessel when staged so collisions are active\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T21:26:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne way to fix this would be some kind of deployable struts, there are a few mods around with things like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKJR might be of some help here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know this says unmodded support, but there aren\u0027t many stock only solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T21:39:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMultiple docking ports works at times.

Not only does it prevent the rover from hanging too much it also (apparently) somehow allows collision detection between parts of the same ship: The wheels rest firmly against the floor without clipping and don\u0027t freewheel like before. When deploying the gears they briefly start clipping trough the floor but then abruptly retract a bit so that they contact the floor and support the rover. The same is partially true of the small landing gear - although that is a bit hit or miss. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/B73Qxee.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B73Qxee.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a bonus I learned that adding small landing gears at the right angle plus RCS allows correcting for misaligned docking-ports without having to live with a high CoM or an unpractically low bay port. Either way, the wheels do tend to get shredded (about two-thirds of the time) when undocking regardless of deployed jacks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I guess problem solved?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T22:42:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, or worked around, either way it\u0027s not a problem for you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
