Fuel tank modules with more partitions have poorer mass ratios.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand the following options for each partition:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Adjust partition size: change the fraction of the fuel tank module\u0027s volume allocated for a partition. The interface for this would have 1 freely adjustable value, 1 dependent value, and N - 2 locked values.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Set fuel type: Set the fuel type to be stored in a partition. Performing this anywhere other than the Space Centre requires a \u0022fuel tank scrubber\u0022 module, and can only be done for an empty partition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Adjust slosh baffle density: a higher slosh baffle density gives a poorer mass ratio but also restricts how far the partition\u0027s COM can wobble when manoeuvring under thrust or gravity while the partition is partially full. A lower slosh baffle density gives a better mass ratio, but will be less stable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bgraves","CreatedById":58780,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T19:42:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is planned.
