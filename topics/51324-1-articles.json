Specific resources (fuel, monopropellant, etc) are now required at the spacedock in order to build your vessel in orbit. Tanks can be built dry or partially filled, if enough resources are not available. No more building fuel/monopropellant/xenon from RocketParts!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Detection of spacedocks for users with a large number of vessels/parts in the game is markedly faster. Spacedock detection is automated \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 no more button click \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 and only spacedocks with enough RocketParts to build the dry mass (hull) of the vessel are displayed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) RocketParts and other resources can be used from any container attached (either directly or via a docking port) to the spacedock. In prior releases, only direct-attached RocketPart storage was available for use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Kerbals are automatically removed from a vessel before constructing it at the spacedock. It didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t make sense to have Kerbals constructed in orbit with the ship\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Kerbals will need to make their own way off of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) No more 25% RocketParts penalty for constructing in orbit! With the addition of resource-specific construction, this penalty has been removed. Vessel dry mass is constructed from an equivalent tonnage of RocketParts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Career mode compatible. The small warehouse and small spare parts module require Heavier Rocketry, the large warehouse and medium spare parts module require Very Heavy Rocketry, and the Spacebuilt identifier, SpaceDock, and 3D Printer all require Meta Materials.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Textures updated to .tga format (and reduced slightly); assembly re-named from KerbalTestOne.dll to OrbitalConstruction.dll.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstallation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Extract the archive into your KSP root folder and merge/replace files and folders when prompted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Important: If you have previous OrbitalConstruction installations, run the CleanOC.bat script in your KSP root folder to remove the old plugin and any old textures.

Make sure you include a docking port for re-supply missions. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s also a good idea to include plenty of fuel, monopropellant, etc storage on this vessel, but you can always supplement later by docking other supply ships/stations to this space dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) You\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll also probably want to send up a shipment or two of RocketParts using the SpareParts \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CSmall\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Module or SpareParts \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CMedium\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Module.

If you need launch clamps to keep your creation stable on the pad, add those as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Put the craft on the launch pad or runway, and follow the GUI instructions. NOTE: if your space dock does not have enough RocketParts to build the craft, it WILL NOT show up in the list. If this happens, send up more RocketParts. Select your target space dock and adjust the amount of each resource to include in the vessel when building in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) If using launch clamps, make sure to check the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cstage before building\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 radio button, and place all launch clamps in a separate stage group which will fire first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Click \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cbuild\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 and enjoy!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELicense: this work is licensed under \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGPL v3\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECredits for the original work:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbitalConstruction and OrbitalConstruction Redux:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZorkinian, evilC, NovaSilisko, Interfect\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtraplanetary Launchpads:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESkykooler, Taniwha\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-02T20:40:18Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2014 08:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by attosecond\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpeach","CreatedById":34566,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T18:22:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELook cool!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill download it as soon as I can!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boberts314","CreatedById":69216,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T21:40:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t suppose you\u0027ve managed to get the ships to build *at* the spacedock, the way that EL ships will build on the launchpad?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T21:49:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill get this one soon!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"attosecond","CreatedById":79130,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T22:14:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022boberts314\u0022 data-cite=\u0022boberts314\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t suppose you\u0027ve managed to get the ships to build *at* the spacedock, the way that EL ships will build on the launchpad?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s for the next version, Orbital Manufacturing.

Orbital Manufacturing [WIP] will be much more solidly constructed, and won\u0027t use spacedock identifiers. It\u0027ll operate much like EL, and build vessels directly at the dock.

I\u0027ll lay out a framework for the back end and post the part model requirements this framework mandates, and then anyone with modelling know-how can go to town with their own realizations for manufactories and accessory parts.
