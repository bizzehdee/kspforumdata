Getting up to \u002B23KM is not an issue. The beast handles incredibly well in atmo. Transitioning from atmosphere to orbit is....well....a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen igniting the rocket motors the craft will immediately begin to pitch up. Obviously, or not so obviously, balance is the issue...I\u0027m pretty sure. Even as the craft is coasting to \u002B38km with the motors off I\u0027m able to correct the attitude. I start the engines up and again its pitching in the same direction. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExamining the line of thrust and the CoM they appear to be aligned. I will admit that viewing the CoM and line of thrust is a fair guestimation within the VAB. Does anyone have any tips for getting it just perfect? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re thinking uneven fuel burn might be the culprit, I\u0027ve made sure that the fuel tanks are along 4 axis and burn counter to each other. So, tank left top burns front to back, right top back to front, left bottom back to front, right bottom front to back. Jet fuel is set up similarly and opposite to rocket fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor your advice, thank you in advance! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/8BQgMvy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMantis 1\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/7ikmGBO\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMantis 2\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"breakthrough","CreatedById":75359,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-01T10:54:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35996-0-23-RCS-Build-Aid-v0-4-3-blizzy78-s-toolbar-support\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERCS Build Aid\u003C/a\u003E plugin has an \u0027engine\u0027 mode that displays the offset with great precision.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-01T15:07:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow bad of a pitch up are you experiencing? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy own experience, by the time you have to light the rockets you\u0027re at least close to orbital velocity (1900-2000 m/s or so; I start noticing it around 1500). If that\u0027s where you\u0027re at, there\u0027s nothing wrong with your design - what\u0027s happening is that Kerbin is rotating underneath you and you\u0027re traveling fast enough that your pitch relative to the planet is changing.
