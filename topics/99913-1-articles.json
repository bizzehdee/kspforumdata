Give them a system that is supposedly balanced and a set of scripts to verify it and they can tell you if it passes or fails. They are supposed to try and make systems break. Establishing a balanced system framework is the result of an integrated architectural, design and implementation decision. Establishing that the system framework \u0022works\u0022 as designed (or not) is a function of testing and validation.

It is not that any game developer will say to their testers \u0022Here is the RC we\u0027ve done and that will most likely hit the streets. Give it a go for 3/4 weeks, play it as the hell you like and then come back to say how do you feel about overall balance\u0022. As Wallygator pointed above, testing is done to ensure rule subsets are not broken and that the game does not crash when you do crazy stuff and it is done against specific and defined by the devs scenarios. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat makes that stuff that is broken but needs a long time/big conscious effort to pull off can and most likely will pass through the test phase, especially if it is something that the devs couldn\u0027t easily predict. This is why most of open ended and strategy games ( that is, games that are not tightly railroaded to a very small and determined set of \u0022endings\u0022 ) have only a semblance of balance if you keep near of what the devs could predict , that , depending of the devs ability to do so, might be more or less than the expected for that particular game. OTOH the fan community, being fans and all ( that is, people that want to dedicate a lot of time to play the game ) will find those issues in a quite fast way ( they might not offer good solutions for it, though \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBringing it to the current 0.90-\u0026gt;1.0 transition, we know the devs will add a lot of new subsystems to the game , that will surely shake whatever balance the game has ATM. I\u0027m pretty sure that the devs will ask the testers to check if those subsystems are balanced enough by themselves, but that doesn\u0027t mean that those systems will work together well in all situations. Say, you can easily have a engine that, if you don\u0027t leave Kerbin mini-system, will generate a avalanche of easy test contracts, or, for another example, that fuel mining is too cheap/too expensive compared with bringing fuel from Kerbin to tilt the balance to one of the sides, or that one particular part is so cheap to unlock science wise compared with the alternatives that no one uses the other alternatives ... This kind of stuff is very hard to detect by testers, simply because their function is normally not that one and even if it was, they most likely do not have the time to play a full streak until the issue comes along.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL-DR version: Game balancing is hard, even if you are not adding new stuff and there are things testers will not get in their tests, because it is not their job to do so and they don\u0027t have the time for testing them anyway. If you add new subsystems, it is even worse ... and most of those issues will be only caught by the fans after release, period\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-17T18:21:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Wallygator \u0026amp; r_rolo1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that most of the time the testers try to find bugs and break the game (and then writing down exactly how they did it).

After a few launches you reach orbit and learn about \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMid Career Mode:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ve earned and unlocked all of the level 1 buildings and are starting to work on level 2 buildings. In all cases the building upgrade costs should be reasonable and proportional.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ve probably initiated a strategy that helps you with your play style, but now are thinking about changing strategies and commitment levels. Strategies can be generally more expensive to kick off at higher commitment levels, but should for sure be approachable - some of them are still so prohibitively expensive they are useless until much later. If you want certain strategies to be later-game only, they should not be available until a certain building upgrade level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re beginning to take manned modules into orbit around other planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResource gathering contracts begin to appear, offering a good balance of reputation, science, and funds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELate Career Mode:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ve unlocked level 2 of all buildings and are starting on level 3 unlocks. Building upgrades in this tier can be pretty expensive, and require some \u0022grinding\u0022 to get to, but not too much grinding please.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterplanetary resource gathering contracts become the most lucrative ones, but yield little rep or science, so that deeper in the late-game players a really challenging set of tasks for experienced interplanetary explorers to earn their tier 3 upgrades.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnd-game:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it is now! Once you\u0027ve unlocked all the tier three stuff and the entire tech tree, the solar system is yours to explore, colonize, and mine for resources - pretty much like Sandbox mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-17T20:13:40Z\u0022 title=\u002202/17/2015 08:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by EtherDragon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r_rolo1","CreatedById":26192,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-17T20:00:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022*Aqua*\u0022 data-cite=\u0022*Aqua*\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E@Wallygator \u0026amp; r_rolo1\u003Cp\u003EI know that most of the time the testers try to find bugs and break the game (and then writing down exactly how they did it). But as I said they also have to make sure that the player \u0027feels\u0027 the games working right. IIRC this is stated in some of the dev blogs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the next version will be the release and up till now there was no major balancing. That must be on their to-do list. The devs (will) put so much new stuff into the game like re-entry heating and new aerodynamics - they\u0027ll have to balance stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I never said that you were wrong in that the game is being tested. I was just pointing out that the testers job \u003Cstrong\u003Eis not\u003C/strong\u003E to give input on the game balance, atleast if the devs don\u0027t ask specifically for that. A tester job is normally \u0022Test 12345 - Do X and see if Y happens ( or not )\u0022 and that means that normally testers are not asked to play a full game for a test ( if the version tested is still unstable, it might be even impossible to play a full game at all ). Thus testers normally have no sense of game balance and even if they do, they are normally not asked about that. Game balance is normally the realm of the devs and even if there are tests to game balance, they are constricted to the issues the devs can foresee ( that, depending of the devs ability, might be more or less than the needed to foresee the more serious balance issues ). OTOH fans are normally much better at spotting those issues, simply because they are willing to spend time to play full games ....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut let\u0027s put that aside and talk of the on topic stuff. I would expect:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A overall costs rebalance. Besides the inter parts balance ( some engines are way overvalued against others and let\u0027s not talk about the ridiculous price some structural parts have ), the buildings are \u003Cstrong\u003Eway\u003C/strong\u003E overpriced, especially between tier 2 and 3 . If you can build 1000 Apollo missions equivalents with the money you need for a VAB upgrade, you know that stuff is way off target \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Engines will surely need a rebalance, especially given the changes on the Isp formula and the atmospheric model ... not mentioning the cost structure I\u0027ve talked above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Contracts also need a nudge. The situation is surely better than in 0.25, but weird stuff still happens if you refuse to go out of Kerbin mini-system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I can\u0027t talk much about strategies ( never seen the need to use them ), but the overall structure of funds vs science vs reputation in game is still skewed vs the needs. While in 0.25 you had far too much funds than the ones you needed, now you are funds starved and you need to grind on cash stuff . This might be a intended result, but it feels a little too punishing for good balance \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The tech tree. Seriously, the tech tree was changed in all updates since it was introduced in one way or another, but it is still way off. Add that to the parts that will be added due to the resource system and it is a sure thing that stuff will shuffled around again ...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
