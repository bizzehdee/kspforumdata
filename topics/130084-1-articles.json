Almost all of the front wing is ahead of your CoM; however that is where your missiles are mounted so releasing them will necessarily move the CoM even further back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, it looks like half of your front wing\u0027s control surfaces are ahead of the CoM, and half are behind. I don\u0027t know what the game makes of that (does it even try to use them to control pitch?) but it makes them useful only for roll. If those control surfaces are used for pitch control, they will merely increase the drag of the wing and maybe even precipitate a stall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the only real solution that I can see is to abandon the double-wing arrangement. CoM should be centred on your wing, and the sweep of the wing will put CoL just behind CoM. Then you can load the wing with weapons without changing the distribution of weight. Control surfaces at the rear should provide 100% control, as should the canards. Anything less than 100% is simply going to resist your turns, then stall as soon as their max AoA is exceeded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried removing a set of wings (while keeping CoL and CoM in roughly the same position), and the results was that while the plane was able to change the direction of its nose faster, the reduced wing area (combined with its mass, which was still over 40 tons)\u00A0meant that the forward motion\u0027s ability to respond to the change of direction was much slower. Simply put, that made its maneuverability overall worse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the single winged config, I tried a comparison between using only canards and rear fins to change the aircraft\u0027s pitch, and also using the wing\u0027s control surfaces. The addition of the wing\u0027s control surfaces improved its ability to change its pitch. Roll rate was also obviously increased with usage of the wing\u0027s control surfaces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-20T18:01:28Z\u0022 title=\u002201/20/2016 06:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by drtricky\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
