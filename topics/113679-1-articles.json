While enjoying a nice evening, I went outside to see if the moon was out yet. To my great amazement, I saw some kind of large-ish reddish, almost flaming object, streaking across the sky. I got a very bad picture, and I was wondering what it could be! You can see it in the top of the picture, it was moving pretty fast and disappeared before I could take a good shot, and this was taken with zoom!
