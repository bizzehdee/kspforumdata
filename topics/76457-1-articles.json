Much of that debris is also small enough that it takes much longer (less surface area plus rarified atmosphere equals less drag, meaning much slower speed loss than something as massive as the ISS). On a long enough timeline, everything in LEO will deorbit due to a combination of 1.) micro-atmospheric alterations, 2.) gravitational inconsistencies, and 3.) human inattention or inability to station-keep, but that timeline could easily span thousands of years for some of that debris. Kessler Syndrome can easily cause near-space to be untenable for launches for the entire lifespan of a civilization if allowed to manifest on a large enough scale.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-02T16:23:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA Whackjob vacuum cleaner!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWait, it \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E a vacuum!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurn it round - Whackjob leaf blower!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rowsdower","CreatedById":91811,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-02T18:30:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf the ESA got in touch with us with interest to work on something in the same way NASA did, I don\u0027t think it\u0027d be out of the realm of possibility.
