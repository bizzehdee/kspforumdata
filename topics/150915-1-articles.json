How can I update KSP 1.2? Is the first time I had a update and I had two folders on the \u0022Common\u0022 Folder of Steam. I had, One of KSP 1.1.3 and the other of KSP 1.2. But when I open the KSP 1.2 it opens and then it closes quickly or even instantly and I can just open the KSP 1.1.3 Folder. Did someone knows how to update and to enjoy KSP 1.2? Please. I think most of you knew how to do it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-26T22:01:45Z\u0022 title=\u002210/26/2016 10:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by SpaceastronautX\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-27T01:19:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved over to Technical Support.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should not have two folders in the Common folder. I would copy both to someplace else on your hard disk, then have Steam delete the local content. After that, remove any KSP folders in Common, then have Steam install the game fresh.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
