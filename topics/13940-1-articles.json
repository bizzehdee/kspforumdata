It is a member of the class of altitude compensating nozzle engines. A vehicle with an aerospike engine uses 25\u00E2\u20AC\u201C30% less fuel at low altitudes, where most missions have the greatest need for thrust. Aerospike engines have been studied for a number of years and are the baseline engines for many single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) designs and were also a strong contender for the Space Shuttle Main Engine. However, no engine is in commercial production. The best large-scale aerospikes are still only in testing phases.[1]\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022wikipedia, sabre\u0022 data-cite=\u0022wikipedia, sabre\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe design comprises a single combined cycle rocket engine with two modes of operation.[2] The air breathing mode combines a turbo-compressor with a lightweight air precooler positioned just behind the inlet cone. At high speeds this precooler cools the hot, ram compressed air leading to an unusually high pressure ratio within the engine. The compressed air is subsequently fed into the rocket combustion chamber where it is ignited with stored liquid hydrogen. The high pressure ratio allows the engine to continue to provide high thrust at very high speeds and altitudes. The low temperature of the air permits light alloy construction to be employed which gives a very lightweight engine \u00E2\u20AC\u201D essential for reaching orbit.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theflyingfish","CreatedById":17741,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-24T17:08:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022shadowfax\u0022 data-cite=\u0022shadowfax\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo meanwhile as you\\\u0027re flying around with the jet, you\\\u0027re burning fuel.

The ship would bring along lots of low-mass LH2, but only enough L0X as needed to attain orbital speed and circularize. And those tasks would be made easier because you already gained most of orbital speed in the atmosphere, using the scramjet/ramjet and the oxidizer already prevalent in the atmosphere.
