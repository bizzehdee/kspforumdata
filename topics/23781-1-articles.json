Once I\u0027m in orbit around Kerbin, I need to undock it and redock it into a different configuration so as to be able to drop some empty fuel tanks that would otherwise be stuck between the command module and base/lander module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, once I redock into the new configuration, I can\u0027t turn SAS off, and thus can\u0027t do anything but orbit the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also can\u0027t seem to use SAS on the \u0022lander\u0022 portion of the ship when it\u0027s disconnected from the main section.

I\u0027m using 3 RemoteTech dishes on the base portion of the craft, but otherwise the ship is from stock parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny clarification of what\u0027s going on here would be helpful, although I\u0027m thinking that it\u0027s a bug, because not being able to turn SAS off is a bit of a game-killer, hahaha.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Panichio","CreatedById":2858,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T02:47:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs it possible to not turn on SAS before docking? Or does it automatically enable itself when docked? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not familiar with RemoteTech, but there might be an issue with that, and for some reason it wont let you toggle SAS because it thinks the ship isn\u0027t controllable. At least just the SAS. Try relaunching, but this time don\u0027t use the RemoteTech dishes, and see what happens. If that doesn\u0027t work, maybe try removing the plugin from the plugin folder and see if it helps. The problem is probably something else, but I think this is worth a try, seeing that RemoteTech can make things uncontrollable if it wants.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Uh oh, look at my post count.

When I undock the top part of the ship from the base/lander, the engines no longer work. Everything is turned on and shows green, however, the ship cannot take off. If I keep it docked to the lander, the throttle and engines work fine, but if I undock it and try to leave the base behind, the engines don\u0027t work. Anybody have any ideas?
