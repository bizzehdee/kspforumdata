I\u0027ve built an orbiter that\u0027ll complete another contract (get into orbit) and figured I could mod that to also do this engine test since the -45 is perfectly fine for final lift into orbit. I\u0027ve got 4,700m/sec of Delta-v which is enough for a basic orbit and then some...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the life of me, I cannot get a combination of engines that will get me that altitude and speed combination. The closest I\u0027ve come is three RT-10s, which get me almost there, but the speed and altitude is wrong and popping those things off under burn is bad for mission health, so throttling them down is no good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre there tools out there for helping someone figure out delta-v requirements to put a rocket into the conditions required to do these early in-atmo contracts or are they just a waste of resources?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T22:05:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor future reference, this is the subforum for tutorials (i.e. if you\u0027re trying to help out other folks). General questions like these should go in the parent \u0022Gameplay Questions and Tutorials\u0022 section. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, that said, since you\u0027ve got a rocket that will make orbit, you\u0027ve got a couple of options here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Launch your orbital rocket. When it reaches 7k ASL, fly it along the horizon - you\u0027re not trying to make space, you\u0027re trying to build up the speed you need. Hit the staging controls to activate the T45 when they all light up (note that you don\u0027t actually have to fly with the engine - you just have to activate it via staging controls, so if need be you can simply add one to your stack somewhere and turn its thrust limiter down to zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. If the problem is getting too much speed before you reach 7k, lower the throttle settings and don\u0027t let them get too high. You should still have sufficient TWR to continue climbing with less than full thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. If you really can\u0027t get going fast enough on the trip up, try testing the engine on the way back \u003Cstrong\u003Edown\u003C/strong\u003E. You might still miss the target altitude/speed range, but it may be worth a go. Maybe try a combination chute/braking engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Mount the part to be tested on an airplane, if you\u0027ve got all the tech required. Even a Basic Jet powered aircraft would be capable of hitting the target altitude and speed easily enough.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qoonpooka","CreatedById":134904,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T23:35:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBah. Thanks for the mis-filing tip. I think I got lost in my searching to see if my question had come up before and didn\u0027t remember where I was.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy problem, ironically, isn\u0027t that the rocket can\u0027t make speed. It\u0027s actually making speed round 5-6km, and then going too fast through the entire bracket. I might not have described this correctly before, but essentially I hit the speed green-check and then the altitude green-check flicks on just as the speed one flicks off. Normally I\u0027d tweak down the boosters, but kicking out solid boosters while they\u0027re under burn destroys everything but the command module in the best of times. I\u0027ve tried a number of ways to keep the solids away from the main body and coasting to the target (collision/explosion), as well as reducing the solid stage and going with a lower-powered liquid stage (not enough power) to get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe aircraft suggestion is probably the way I\u0027ll have to go. I\u0027ve never done aircraft design, but then I guess I can grab those visual survey contracts too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T01:26:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou problem boils down to this- you TWR is too high. That\u0027s why you\u0027re having problems with making speed too early.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimply pile a few more fuel tanks on the rocket. You\u0027ll increase your Delta-V budget \u003Cstrong\u003EAND\u003C/strong\u003E reduce your TWR.

If you haven\u0027t unlocked action groups yet, then radial engines and/or a single Rt-10 SRB with an appropriate-sized (read: comparatively LARGE to the SRB) rocket placed on top of it will work... You will have to appropriately (read VERY small/light) size your payload to make orbit with nothing but a single RT-10 as your launch stage though (with a T-45 kicking in as a sustainer in the contract window).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qoonpooka","CreatedById":134904,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T17:27:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome, thanks for the tip.

Your speed at a given altitude varies, among other things, based on your ascent profile (i.e. how early and sharply do you start pitching over; when do you stage, etc.) You\u0027re best off trying to fulfill as many contracts as possible with planes since it\u0027s easier to predict speed at a given altitude with a plane once you become sufficiently experienced with them, and very easy to throttle down or go into a dive to increase/decrease speed at a given altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qoonpooka","CreatedById":134904,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-12T14:42:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh well.
