In fact, I\u0027m pretty awful ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) I\u0027m just starting to explore beyond Kerbin \u0026 its moons but I\u0027m finding my rockets just aren\u0027t up to snuff. I\u0027ve ready plenty of posts on the forums about making sure I have the right dV by using MJ, etc, and indeed I do use that. But that\u0027s not my problem. I\u0027m terrible at actually constructing the rockets. \n\nRight now, I\u0027ve been looking into using the LV-N Nerv as my second stage for interplanetary transfer. As I understand it, the LV-N is best used when provided with a lot of fuel so that its initially high cost in weight is offset compared to lighter but slightly less efficient engines. **My problem, however, is that I can\u0027t seem to create a design that will actually put a rocket with LV-N(s) to orbit!** \n\nIf I use a single LV-N below 2 or 3 LF tanks in the 2nd stage my rocket is too skinny in the middle and has some stability problems, but I can make it to space ok most times. However, I\u0027ve been relying some on my 2nd stage to fully reach Kerbin escape velocity because I guess my first stage is not that great either (6 orange tanks mounted radially around another orange atop mainsails) and the LV-N simply isn\u0027t powerful enough to finish the job. \n\nSo my other idea was to use a Mk1 Stack Tri-Coupler just below my third stage, 3 LF tanks x 2 (or 3) down, followed by 3 LV-Ns and finally a TVR-300L Stack Tri-Adapter to couple the 3 LV-Ns to my first stage (and orange tank). But this rocket is even worse than the last because it wobbles at the start and falls apart shortly after liftoff. It\u0027s very unstable at the connection points between the tri-coupler/tri-adapter. It seems the tri-coupler/tri-adapter does not bind itself well to what it\u0027s attached to on the other side (not sure how to explain that better).\n\nCan anyone link some pictures of rockets they\u0027ve designed that have successfully used a LV-N in their second stage or provide some advice on how I can best use them structurally?\n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"Yuriznikov","CreatedById":141002,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T10:29:14Z","Content":"I usually make 3 stage rockets when going interplanetary,and only use the LV-N\u0027s for when i am close to full orbit.\n\nMy first stage would boost me trough the thickest part of the atmosphere, up into the higher atmosphere where you begin to pick up speed (usually around 1000 m/s is where it depletes). Then my second mid-stage comes in which usually has something along the lines of a skipper engine (depending on payload). I use a quite small tank for this engine as it only has to get me into a near-full orbit. \n\nI cut it off at about 70km x 15km orbit so it would fall back to earth and not litter space. Only above 70km i then fire my LV-N and complete the orbit.\n\nThe LV-N\u0027s are best used above 70km obviously, as they are more efficient there. They dont really pack a punch but last a long time.\n\nAlso don\u0027t forget that they only require liquid fuel, and no oxidizer.\n\nIf you would want to build a 2 stage rocket i would suggest trying to make a first stage that will last you a long time to get your apoaps up above 70km only to use the second stage after that."},{"CreatedByName":"nigelvn","CreatedById":143368,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T10:31:18Z","Content":"Hopefully you can find some usefull tips:\n\n- try not to use the LV-Ns to get your transfer stage in orbit, instead make sure your lifter can get the transfer stage in orbit.

The NERV is weak. Three tanks? And I guess you mean LF Fuselage Long, the huge ones? That\u0027s good for a retrograde solar orbit rescue mission, not plain interplanetary travel; a definite overkill. It\u0027s not \\*that\\* heavy. Seriously, make a craft consisting of a probe core, one small (1.25m) LF fuselage tank and one LV-N. You\u0027ll have something of order of 5000m/s of delta-V.\n\nIf you plan interplanetary travel, one LF Fuselage Long is a plenty. And if you want more - stick 3 side-to-side with the flat sides, then attach (through a decoupler) one with one Nerv on top, then one consisting of several thin LF fuselages with a Nerv on top of that. I think I got some 30,000 dV out of such a contraption.\n\nAlso: asteroid of minmus mining, launch empty(ish) tanks, refuel in orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"Coga19000","CreatedById":125394,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T12:03:11Z","Content":"First of all, what kind of fuel are you using? Normal rocket tanks hold both fuel and Oxidiser - the combination needed for all rocket engines... Except for the Nerv, which only needs Liquid Fuel. Therefore, hauling Oxidiser on your interplanetary stage is basically empty weight. \n\nSecondly, the tricoupler has a serious problem when used like that ; when you attach an upside down tricoupler to four fuel tanks the way you described, it will only attach to one node, not all four of them. The oscillations (wobbling) are caused by the other three tanks swaying free. \n\nThirdly, stick with 2.5m tanks. A 1.25 Nerv stage that can compare to a Terrier has to be absurdly long ; 2.5m can be much shorter before the Nerv is more efficient."},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T12:52:14Z","Content":"You say you have MJ? Good, that will make things easy. \n\nHere\u0027s one easy way to build a rocket...\n\nBuild your top stage that has the nuke(s) as you like it. The only advantage in more than one nuke for a transfer stage is how long the burns will take. The downside of more being more mass and so less dV available. \n\nNow slap on a separator and whatever you think looks good for the next stage down. Check what MJ says about TWR for this stage. Aim for between 1.2 and 2.0. Adjust the design until you get that. \n\nSlap on the next stage and repeat. \n\nHave a look at the dV now for just these lifter stages. Does it add up to more than 4000? Then you are good to go. \n\nSlap some fins on the bottom and you might need some small ones on the 2nd stage too.\n\nGo fly your kite rocket!\n\nOne last tip: Try to keep your rocket skinny, don\u0027t make it too wide with lots of stuff bolted on the side and stick nosecones on the top of exposed horizontal tank tops."},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T13:23:28Z","Content":"All craft in KSP are built like trees - when you place a part you attach it to one, and only one, existing part. That\u0027s why you can\u0027t use the tricoupler to join three stacks back together.

It\u0027s not a feature, it\u0027s the result of multiple rigid bodies being glued together to approximate a single rigid body. [Kerbal Joint Reinforcement](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55657) puts an end to all that. I also prefer to use a 2.5m nuclear engine ([NovaPunch,](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/3870) [Modular Rocket Systems,](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93067) [Atomic Age](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104855)... and some others) to avoid the weird skinny profile. Otherwise, use struts to prevent disintegration and endure the wobble. \n\nSecond cent, assuming you\u0027re using three 2.5m fuel tanks on top of that Nerv, you\u0027re over-engineering a bit for your first ventures out of local Kerbin space. A round trip to Duna can be safely and easily done with ~4000 dV (Less if you\u0027re confident in your skills). Building big is tempting, but it really just complicates things if you don\u0027t need the extra girth.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-28T15:51:39Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2015 03:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"radonek","CreatedById":84077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T15:52:14Z","Content":"Use nerva onto separate tug.
