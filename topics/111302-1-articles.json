I\u0027ve been lurking these forums for some time now but have yet to come out and introduce myself. My handle is Lt Whiskers and I\u0027ve been playing ksp for the last year or so (since .25). I had taken a recent break from the game but with 1.02 out now, I\u0027m being quickly sucked back into a highly infatuated orbit. Right now I\u0027m working on upgrading/combining my previous designs into a solid interplanetary ship capable of completing long journeys (Jool 5 challenge types, for instance) with the new features of 1.0. In the past I\u0027ve dabbled with colonization projects, mining and life support mods, and even some stock space warfare thanks to Macey Dean\u0027s inspirational videos. Anyway, I hope to get some good craft files up soon and, as always, enjoy the awesomeness that this community continues to produce for its members.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T20:52:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETen-hut!
