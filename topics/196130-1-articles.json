Then, that plasma is accelerated to extremely high speeds via an electric field, which is what produces thrust. However, plasmas are by their very nature extremely thin and light affairs. Have you ever stood facing a blizzard and gently exhaled through your mouth? That\u0027s about what happens when you attempt to create a plasma jet inside an atmosphere.

And then you have the single most fuel-efficient engine in the game on your hands, by a big margin. Still, plasma continues to be thin and light, so the thrust is pretty low.
