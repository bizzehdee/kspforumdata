I know KSP has some built-in support for joysticks, but is it enough to start using a stick with no additional drivers?\n\nI actually bought that stick for when I finally get Elite Dangerous (or possibly Star Citizen) but in the mean time I\u0027d love to try it a bit on KSP.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T23:22:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 11:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PTNLemay**"},{"CreatedByName":"FasterEd","CreatedById":156275,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-01T20:51:24Z","Content":"I\u0027m having the same problem. I am using AFBW and it works - kinda. My hat switches don\u0027t work properly . I can assign the button but the button does nothing when i use it. There are remote instances where it does work - but mostly doesn\u0027t. I\u0027d really like the hat switches to work for EVA\u0027s and docking otherwise the whole thing is too clunky to use. The axis controls work but there is too much hysteresis in the mechanical action to be very useful for fine movement like docking.   \n\nI really love this game but the controls are less than awesome. The devs really should do something for the controls on this game it would be the best space game by a long long stretch if the flight controls were tight. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-01T20:51:42Z\u0022 title=\u002201/01/2016 08:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by FasterEd**"}]}
