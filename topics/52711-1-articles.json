I like the idea of using science to upgrade parts but I\u0027m not sure how much extra upgrading parts would want to make you keep playing. It doesn\u0027t quite have the same feeling as that NEW PART feeling. It would be good to be able to spend science upgrading parts during the tech tree climb so that you had to choose between a new type of part or making everything slightly better. All the parts could be slightly reduced so that they had a bit to go but fully upgraded would be better than before. This way by the time you get to the highest tech you would have already spent twice the points to get there. I would also like to see a larger tech tree. I did make a set of parts to add more tech parts to the game, but I\u0027m not going to spam the link unless someone asks for it as it only uses stock welds for part graphics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"minerman30","CreatedById":63054,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T05:27:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure this was discussed a while ago, and it was decided that this would limit the sharing of craft.

It is only one piece of the career mode puzzle. Once resources are implemented (both financial and natural) you will have other constraining factors that force you to structure your space program so as to generate enough revenue, and extract enough natural resources. Your overall motivation in the game won\u0027t be limited to the collection of science points, and collecting them will most likely become more difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, over the course of a very long term game, if science and all resources are limited, then you will eventually completely run out of reasons to fly missions. Actually, running out of resources will pretty much mean the collapse of your space program if you did try to keep flying; a sort of natural game-over scenario, and a not entirely unrealistic one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UberFuber","CreatedById":90736,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T23:32:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInstead of changing parts performance, I would imagine that additional science could be invested into making the parts cheaper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, once you unlock enough tech trees, you get additional research nodes that can reduce your parts/fuel (and whatever other cost you have with spaceships) by a certain percentage value each time you \u0022research\u0022 it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Research New Construction Paradigm\u0022 - Reduce part costs by 10%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Improve Fuel Manufacturing Efficiency\u0022 - Reduce fuel costs by 10%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis way, spacecraft flight behavior don\u0027t change, but you can keep using science to make your spaceship cheaper and cheaper to build.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Killerdude8","CreatedById":73130,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T23:39:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBy the time of full release, I\u0027m 110% certain we\u0027ll have like 20x the amount of parts we currently have, So I\u0027d imagine getting all the way to the end of the tree would take some time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T23:39:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Crusher8000\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Crusher8000\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is the game loses a reason to play the moment you unlock everything, it can be delayed with money and missions but you will still reach that point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECouple of points:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPeople seemed to be happy playing sandbox for the last couple of years without any tech tree providing a \u0022reason to play\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe tech tree has been described by devs as \u0022chapter 1\u0022 of career mode, so they\u0027re clearly intending to provide plenty of things to stimulate gameplay once the tech tree is complete.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general the devs seem quite keen to allow lots of freedom even in the finished game.
