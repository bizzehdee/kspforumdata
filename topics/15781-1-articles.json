Back then tho there was a way of bringing back the original three (Bill,Bob and Jeb), by just crashing your rocket a couple of times and the new crew would come, but now however i can\\\u0027t seem to make it work, because i have surely crashed a rocket for over 25 times and i can\\\u0027t see Bill, Bob and Jeb. And plus that i can see that some crews are the same just not in the same order. So my question is how can i bring back and fly with the old crew, because the old way doesn\\\u0027t seem to work (for me at least)?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-31T14:29:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\\\u0027t have any craft that you want to keep persistent, just delete the persistence file and they will come back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr you can edit the file and set their status to 0 which makes them available again.
