Like, \u0022done in 60 seconds\u0022, to parody a well-known movie title. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Well okay, a bit more than 60 seconds if you first have to research where precisely you want it to be around Jool, but the act of writing the config is done really quickly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, there\u0027s more to it than just placing Kerbin there. The game actually calculates many things in reference to Kerbin (or rather, in reference to whatever the \u0027homeworld\u0027 is). For example, all solar panel output is defined to be the values given in the part configs, at the sun distance of the homeworld, and scaling with the natural square-cube-law from there. So if you put Kerbin in orbit of Jool, then you will have full normal solar panel output at Jool, not the greatly reduced amount you would expect to get at Jool in a stock game. In the inner solar system, solar panel output will be massively increased, and out at Eeloo, you\u0027ll still get pretty good performance. This means that if you were to make such a config, you would then have to think about rebalancing solar panels. And that is only one of several such things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, because the game is so dependant on Kerbin\u0027s position, you may encounter visual bugs. For example, if Kerbin is in orbit around anything other than the sun, then the sun will not visibly move in the sky in the space center view. It will reset to its proper position whenever you load the space center (come out of a building or return from flying a ship), but as long as you stay in the space center view, it will remain fixed in the sky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-10T08:08:39Z\u0022 title=\u002202/10/2017 08:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 10, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"birdog357","CreatedById":150790,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-10T13:04:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure, but it wasn\u0027t just a simple move.
