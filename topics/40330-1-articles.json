In real life, they are a proven technology. They work by passing a fuel by a nuclear core and allowing the heat from the core to cause the fuel to expand to produce thrust. Unfortunately, they have never been used. The reason for this is due to the risk involved in launching a NERVA into orbit (they can\u0027t power themselves in the atmosphere due to radioactive fallout.) The question becomes: what is the launch vehicle used to launch a NERVA suffered a catastrophic failure? I would like to see what some people have (or will) create to address this problem and recover a NERVA without destroying it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERules: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The engine and its abort system must be on an LV capable of carrying it to orbit. I\u0027ll take your word that the rocket carrying it can place it in orbit, so you don\u0027t need prove it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. You must have a NERVA a minimum of 100m away from the LV with in 3 seconds after hitting to abort button. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. If any supporting parts (parachutes, probe cores, ect.) are broken off (i.e. not jettisoned with decouplers) your design will be disqualified.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.

Your system must be versatile. It must be able to abort the launch on the pad, at 10km ASL, and above 10km ASL while pitched 45 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no scoring as of yet. I just want to see some designs. My mom just told me to wash the dishes and I have stuff to do latter tonight.

Of course in KSP it doesn\u0027t matter, but in real life, a Nerv that comes crashing down or explodes in mid-air will cause a serious radiation hazard.
