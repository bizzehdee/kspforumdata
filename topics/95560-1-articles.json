If it\u0027s for realism (and the mods related to it), I\u0027ll name it Kerbal Space Program - Realism. If it\u0027s for interstellar, I\u0027ll name it for that. If it\u0027s for looks, I\u0027ll create one for that. I\u0027ve never had issues adding a multitude of mods to any one install, and usually when I do, I take the time, read the in-game debug or error files associated with the issues, and get it situated. As it stands, my largest Game Data folder contains almost 4.63 Gb of mods (for a 23.5 installation). All it took was custom ATM config additions and careful trial and error (as well as repeated backups of the ENTIRE KSP folder associated until a mod giving me an issue got resolved).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy point is, until 64bit is stable, and if/when they update to the next version of Unity, you\u0027ll have bugs (especially when adding multiple mods). Don\u0027t get me wrong, I\u0027d love if the 1.0 version of KSP had NovaPunch, KW, B9, Texture Replacer, EVE, KSPi, etc. fully integrated, but Squad will stick with their vision of the future of KSP, which I doubt includes integrating something of that scale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027m just glad they work \u003Cstrong\u003Ewith\u003C/strong\u003E the modding community and every time I hear a modder has been added to the team it makes me smile.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
