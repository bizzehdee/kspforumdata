You have user XYZ and they ask for their name to now by ZYX. Ok cool, an available moderator catches sight of the request and does what ever switch flips yall do and they have their shiny new name. How does the user in question learn they have been granted said new name? By chance or does the forum send a message to them similar to the notice you get when you get a pm? I know its an odd question from me since I doubt I will ever avail myself of the name change system, but i figured Id ask and perhaps a user considering it will learn a bit more of the process ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)\n\n042611022022"},{"CreatedByName":"Deddly","CreatedById":62955,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-02T13:13:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, AlamoVampire said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E How does the user in question learn they have been granted said new name?\n\u003E \n\nI\u0027m not *completely* certain about this, but I don\u0027t believe a notification is sent out.
