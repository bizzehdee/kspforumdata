(because otherwise it\u0027d be too easy!)\n\nSo basically, the goal is to have something leaving Kerbal (that part can use a **detachable** launcher), then hop from moon to moon (and planet if you insist) until it visited every moon in the system.\n\n**Rules ;** \n\n- You can refuel, but you NEED to drop your own refinery, or drag it with you.\n\n- **Whatever that get you in Kerbin orbit can be detached**, but your lander has to leave kerbin in one piece.\n\n- You cannot leave anything on any planet (well, except unfortunate accident, of course). **No litter on planets/moons!**\n\n- Need either enough scientific experiment for each mun, or a scientist to store/reset them.\n\n- Landing can be done with detachable lander, or with whole craft. In any case, all tourist need to be able to land too.\n\n- Stock. No \u0022special\u0022 engine, or tank. Everything need to be stock.\n\n- Clipping is OK. \n\n- Need to be able to return to Kerbin\n\n**Reward ;**\n\nBeginner (10 pts) ; \n\nLand on Mun, Minmus, Gilly and Ike\n\nAdvanced (50 pts) ; \n\nLand all Beginner \u002B Dres, Moho and Duna\n\nExpert (100 pts) ; \n\nLand on Every.Single.Planet and Moon. (except Jool, Duh!)\n\n**bonus Tourist ;** \n\nBring 2 tourist (1 pts)\n\nBring 4 tourist (10 pts)\n\nBring 8 tourist (20 pts)\n\nBring 16 tourist (30 pts)\n\nBring 32 tourist (40 pts)\n\nBring 64 tourist (50 pts), and be refered as the bus driver.\n\n**bonus conception ;** \n\nless than 50t lander ; 20 pts\n\nless than 100t lander ; 10 pts\n\nless than 125t lander ; 5 pts\n\nTo be considered as complete, show a picture on the launch pad and of each planet/moon landed. (if you\u0027re missing one or a few, we\u0027ll refer to the gentlemen agreement that nobody cheats on those challenge and let it slide).\n\n**Good luck!**\n\nI\u0027ll try and post my poor attempt tonight.\n\n**Leaderboard**\n\n**1-**\n\n**2-**\n\n**3-**\n\n**4-**\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-18T00:46:32Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2015 12:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Enkiel**"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T20:31:12Z","Content":"1 don\u0027t think you can do 1 stage to the Mun, unless you got a great Rapier SSTO"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T20:36:49Z","Content":"Seriously?

My goal was to give a lot of XP to my two crew members (an engineer and a scientist) who have never been into space.

I came up with such a vessel in 1.0.2, it should still work. However, the science rover sat on KerbalFoundry tracks because stock wheels suck, I used Scansat to better scout out ore deposists, and most importantly, I modded my nukes to deliver 360kN and weigh 20t. With a pair of skippers slapped on, it could go everywhere but Eve.\n\nNow, using stock nukes would actually increase performance, but it would also inflate part count by some 50% and the beast was lagging enough already.
