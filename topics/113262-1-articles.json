It\u0027s... clunky.

And all in all, it handles the launch quite well. The aerospike has a trim feature courtesy of Klockheed Martin, and that\u0027s being used to help keep the pitch loads within the limits of the design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, most of the time, anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout 5 seconds before fuel depletion in the external tank, there\u0027s a spike in the pitch moment that cannot be compensated for by the trim and the engine gimbals combined. I get a maxed out nose down control from MechJeb, and I pitch nose up about 90 degrees. Then, I run out of fuel, drop the tank, and go back to flying to orbit normally... I have plenty of fuel available to make up for this... it\u0027s just ANNOYING.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have any experience with this kind of situation? And if you did, how did you fix the issue?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T00:20:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn stock, you can tweak the thrust limit on the booster motor down a bit before you get to that critical point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith mods, you can use something like Throttle Controlled Avionics or Davon Throttle Control to automagically vary the thrust to control attitude.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T00:44:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn stock, you can tweak the thrust limit on the booster motor down a bit before you get to that critical point.\u003Cp\u003EWith mods, you can use something like Throttle Controlled Avionics or Davon Throttle Control to automagically vary the thrust to control attitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHuh. I\u0027ll have to look into that. Until then, I just cut loose the ET with some seperatrons and an engine shutdown command. It worked better than waiting for BECO, but I still flipped around some due to the engine trim.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
