The movie is pretentious, slow and boring, don\u0027t see it. Minor spoilers ahead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nAn antenna built to search for extraterrestrials(?!?) is built to reach way up into the upper atmosphere. Humanity has bases on both the Moon and Mars, with commercial flights routinely making trips to both. Why bother building such a large antenna on Earth, if that\u0027s the case?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA tiny little space station near Neptune can apparently send \u0022electromagnetic surges\u0022 that wreak havoc on Earth and \u0022threaten the stability of the solar system\u0022. Antimatter is involved. How it\u0027s obtained, nobody knows. Why the Earth\u0027s magnetosphere doesn\u0027t redirect it, nobody knows. And apparently a guy on that station has been trying to turn the transmitter off for thirty years without succeeding.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe entire center core of a rocket (think a full Saturn V stack with side boosters for getting to LEO) is sent to the Moon. Where a tiny, Orion-style capsule detaches from it and lands. Why bother with the giant translunar stage?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWho is the best suited man to guard a VIP on a tour from Earth to Mars? An octogenarian, of course!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe best way to travel from one lunar base to another is by Apollo-style lunar rover. Just beware of pirates. The way they are dealt with is hilariously pathetic, a combination of words you don\u0027t see often.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLunar gravity is only weak outdoors. If you are indoors, gravity will be exactly like on Earth. Who knew!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFor some reason, Brad Pitt needs to go to Mars to record a message being broadcast to Neptune.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe words \u0022why are we stopping?\u0022 are uttered on a flight between the Moon and Mars. Stopping in space, that\u0027s a good one. A few minutes later, the audience will also wonder what the hell the reason for that scene was. A research station was in distress. We never find out what happened to the station, but a baboon on board kills the captain of Brad Pitt\u0027s ship so that Brad Pitt can be the hero and land it safely when the second-in-command panics over having to do a landing on Mars.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMartian gravity isn\u0027t weak at all. Too bad Mars is a bit of a hellhole.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAn anechoic chamber is used to record a message for Dad Pitt. Anechoic apart from the large glass window into an operator\u0027s booth, that is. Kinda defeats the purpose of the padded walls in the rest of the room.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSaid message is sent \u0022by laser\u0022 from Mars to Neptune. Everybody is bummed out that they don\u0027t get a reply in 30 seconds. Neptune is 2.5 light-hours from Mars even under optimal planetary alignment.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe way to hijack a space ship launching from Mars is to climb in via the flame trench (which is filled with water - \u003Cem\u003Efull of leaves\u003C/em\u003E) as it launches. A funny background detail: some numbskull apparently put a high-voltage electrical cabinet in the flame trench too.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA zero-G fight scene ensues inside the hijacked space ship. During launch. The three stooges on board mostly manage to kill themselves while Brad Pitt tries to reason with them. The firing of a gun is involved, and a canister full of toxic gas.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFlying from Mars to Neptune will always send you past both Jupiter and Saturn. Talk about convenient planetary alignment! At least they skipped\u00A0Uranus.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLocating a space station parked in an orbit of Neptune is easy. Brad Pitt can do it manually, while government search probes have failed repeatedly.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nApparently the rings of Neptune are only a couple hundred meters thick! Who knew! You can park your ship above the rings, see a station parked below the rings, and jump between them through the ring itself. It is filled with debris, tennis-ball-sized rocks every half meter in every direction, but that can be easily overcome by holding a metal plate in front of you as a shield while you jump. Won\u0027t the impact with the rocks slow you down, or throw you off course? Rather the opposite, in fact, you will hit the station at greater speed than you left your ship!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSpace stations are equipped with big, spinning radars now. You know, for searching in a flat plane. It is mounted right outside the crew hatch, close to the main hub node of the station.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you cry in zero G, a tear will stream down your face.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOne guy can maintain a space station for 30 years alone after all his crew mates have been killed. Makes you wonder why they bothered giving it a crew of 27 in the first place...\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou can surf the shock wave of a nuclear explosion in space, and use it as a method of propulsion to get back to Earth from Neptune. Never mind the hundred-meter thick debris field/Neptune\u0027s rings between the explosion and yourself.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nBad movie. Bad, bad movie. Not for the science (mind you,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EGravity\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0is full of bull too and still great), but for its overly repetitive narration, complete lack of emotion, and slow pace.

Then to jump-start Godzilla again they set off a multi-megaton nuke literally in its face. I know it\u0027s not exactly trying to be realistic with the whole radiation-powered monsters, but still...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Sunshine: the sun is fizzling out\u00A0and Earth is freezing, so let\u0027s fly a ship really close and chuck a fusion device a few hundred metres wide into it to try and reboot it to exactly the same level it was at before, by flying to Mercury and orbiting for a while, having an oxygen garden module with windows (which immediately goes on fire when the sun shield points the wrong way and the sun shines in- so why have the window at all!?) and the entire ship somehow has full gravity in it so the guy in the heat shielded suit manages to trip and faceplant in a compartment open to space.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Geostorm: to counter catastrophic climate change, all you need is a space station the size of a town, a globe-spanning network of weather controlling satellites (including one that uses sound waves, in space!) all linked together by what looks like girders and which would be a real hazard to fly through, which can somehow freeze tropical oceans and airborne planes instantly and create lightning storms, and almost no efforts to counter the cause of said climate change beyond a handful of electric self-driving taxis. And the space station has full gravity inside it AND you can fly a shuttle into a hangar and as soon as the doors close the gravity instantly turns back on and the atmosphere reappears.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Gravity: if George Clooney hadn\u0027t wasted so much propellant in that jetpack chair he could easily have made it into the ISS. How did he keep floating away from the space station when they were already stationary to it and why did those parachute cables ping back like elastic bands when he let go? How did they even get to the ISS from Hubble in the first place, and why tow Sandra Bullock at the end of a really long cable when she could just hold on the back of the jetpack and wouldn\u0027t keep pulling them off course, wasting more propellant and ultimately leaving Clooney to drift away in space. Apparently the Kessler Syndrome event wiped out direct communications with the ground too for some reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Oblivion: Sorry, but how did the Moon get split open and how could that then cause earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions if nearly all of the material stayed where it was? Where did all the sea water go after those floating rigs hoovered it up? Why are the drones so poorly equipped with just one \u0027eye\u0027 and one sensor on the back that will cause the drone to spin out and explode if it gets shot? Why are there glaciers just outside New York and yet there are deserts less than 50 miles away? And who in their right mind would try and set up a colony on Titan!? It\u0027s covered in seas of liquid methane with mountains made of water-ice, over a billion miles from the Sun so photovoltaics are useless, and is orbiting a gas giant that throws out considerable radiation and makes navigation trickier, and which will pull passing comets/asteroids towards it potentially causing a collision with Titan in the process. Mars is much closer, has more favourable gravity for human survival, plenty of raw materials including water and in some areas is above freezing during the day; melt the CO2 caps at the poles and you\u0027ve got a slightly thicker and warmer atmosphere to work with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Oblivion and Independence Day, and to some extent Edge of Tomorrow but that\u0027s not targeted at Earth in particular: so you\u0027re an interstellar space-faring alien civilisation/robotic-type thing that needs resources to survive. There are literally HUNDREDS of moons in the solar system you could harvest and nobody would really care- in fact, they could probably have removed the entirety of Uranus and Neptune, moons and all, and gone away without us particularly noticing or really caring. But no, they HAD to go for the one planet that\u0027s actually inhabited even though they don\u0027t need its habitability and actually want to destroy it, which is harder to get to from outside the solar system and also harder to leave the solar system from, apparently for no better reason than spite.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Star Wars: sooooo many massive hollow things with nearly infinite drops and yet no guard rails anywhere! Why have so many hollow spaces inside space stations etc. anyway, they\u0027re literally a waste of space and presumably the bottoms of them are littered with stormtroopers that slipped on a freshly-mopped floor and plummeted to their deaths. How can the Death Star go at hyper-speed or indeed move at all when a) there are no thrusters and b) it\u0027s the size of a small moon, and if the weapon in Star-Killer base is faster than light, why can people see it coming? Star-killer base is a big problem for me: it somehow pulls material out of a sun from tens of millions of miles away, which would take hours to get there, and yet is completely frozen and actually depletes the sun after just the second time charging it up- what use is that? It\u0027s effectively drifting in empty space at that point, but yet it\u0027s still light enough to see outside. In Episode 8, why wait until you\u0027re running on fumes AND 3/4 of the shuttles have been destroyed before going all Ben-Hur on the flagship- why not move everyone to the main rebel ship and immediately warp the two smaller ships at the First Order fleet, causing immense damage and forcing them to slow down while the main ship gets away, or at least has time to drop off the shuttles unnoticed and lure the surviving FO ships away before ramming them in empty space? (Not really a bad science point so much as a poor plot point but it\u0027s always bugged me)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Interstellar: again, Mars colonies, or in this case Moon colonies since that\u0027s vastly closer to Earth and easily accessible (relatively speaking). But no, flying to a wormhole beyond Saturn and going to a star cluster in another galaxy with a supermassive black hole in the vicinity then hoping to find a vaguely habitable planet there instead is a much better idea even if it takes hundreds of years, so let\u0027s throw a dozen people at those planets with nothing but a robot for company in the hope that one of them can be used as a colony. The backup plan for Endurance is to use 5000 frozen embryos with some kind of electronic wombs to grow babies in batches, leaving the crew of 4 to somehow create a functioning colony while looking after dozens and then hundreds of babies and children of varying ages at the same time, on another planet that might turn out to be unsustainable after all. Instead of doing something sensible like starting a colony on the Moon and moving hundreds of people there at a time in a 3 day trip, building underground/domed habitation facilities and growing food using hydroponics etc. and with everything being thoroughly sterilised to remove this strange nitrogen-breathing plant pathogen that\u0027s apparently depleting oxygen from the atmosphere and destroyed every crop except corn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Meteor Apocalypse: that might not be the right title, I can\u0027t remember it as I only watched it once and laughed at the outright nonsense in it. First, throwing dozens of nukes at a comet (NOT a meteor, as the title suggests!) manages to not only fail to divert it from its collision course to Earth at all but also create a cloud of shrapnel that travels ahead of the comet itself but straight at the Earth as well, raining fireballs in all directions at regular intervals and somehow poisoning the water supplies with something that was chemical, or possibly biological depending on who was talking about it. And of course the only place on Earth affected by the fireball rain (and indeed hit by the comet itself) was the area of California directly around Los Angeles, which conveniently is where the main characters were at the time. And of course the main character manages to stumble across a lab which happens to have an antidote ready-made and then blunders around in the mountains for a while before miraculously finding his missing wife/daughter and deploys that same antidote to save said daughter with seconds to spare. Then they have a big happy family hug time despite literally standing and watching a comet destroy the whole of Los Angeles seconds earlier...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Passengers: The spaceship is going at half of light speed, yet everything on board occurs at real time and a message sent to Earth will take 55 years total to get a reply back despite that pesky relativity time-slowing thing that wreaked havoc in Interstellar. They also fly directly past a very large star, apparently within one diameter\u0027s distance, at half of light speed, while two people stand at a huge window and watch but don\u0027t get instantly turned to dust by the effectively compressed radiation, heat, gravity etc. along with the entire spaceship as it ablates into ions and scattered across the cosmos.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Avatar: why is the toxin used on the arrows lethal to humans AND native life? What\u0027s in the air that kills humans? Mile-high trees and floating rocks because unobtainium? Somehow life on Pandora uses the same genetic structure and more importantly the same genetic encoding system that life on Earth does (which is next to impossible in reality) and the \u00A0Na\u0027vi(?) have a very human-like social structure and behaviours, only with an Internet of Trees and a conspicuously environmentally sensitive way of life to deliberately contrast with the land-grabbing humans and their smoke-belching, hole-digging, forest-levelling industry. And a plot hole- why not immediately take out the shuttle and the heavy gunship in the first attack instead of leaving them until last? A few well-placed gun bursts by Jake to the cockpits of both and the whole plan goes out the window, most likely resulting in a brief and one-sided air battle with most of the helicopters downed within a minute and the ground troops left unsupported and with no real chance of either completing their mission or getting back to base. No need for the suicidal cavalry charge, no major characters lost (probably) and no need for the wildlife to intervene. It might not fill the time out as much or be as dramatic as the real version, but it makes much more sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- other films I can\u0027t remember the names of: there\u0027s one where a lump of dark matter the size of a tennis ball hits Mars and utterly wrecks it, but hits Earth and simply drills a very neat hole completely through it, somehow stopping the planet\u0027s rotation dead (with none of the effects you\u0027d expect from stopping an entire planet\u0027s 600\u002Bmph rotation speed, obviously, that would just be a distraction). With the spin gone, the magnetic field starts failing and only a pair of magic satellites can either restart the planet (if you\u0027re the main characters) or provide a shield for a small habitable zone (if you\u0027re the self-interested military/government types making walk-on appearances, I\u0027m not sure if this one had some recognisable actors in it or if it was some obscure thing amazon dug up to stick on prime video to fill it out) and those satellites get repositioned on a second by second basis with a gleeful disregard of orbital mechanics or any form of physics at all. Oh, and the hole in the planet causes massive storms because all the air gets sucked into it thus causing killer lightning storms with a whole lot more than the 1.21 gigawatts needed to send a certain DeLorean 30 years into the future...\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere\u0027s another (might be called apocalypse earth or something similar) which involves questionable high-speed travel, this time at 99% of light speed and yet it can slow down again when they arrive (spoiler alert) back at Earth but don\u0027t realise it because the Moon has again been destroyed and is now a large ring around the planet, which obviously means all the mountains have sunk and the whole planet is jungle.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere\u0027s another one, might be apocalypse now or deep impact or something similar, where a comet is going to hit Earth (again) and the only way to stop it is to fly around the moon in two space shuttles, fly through the comet\u0027s tail (which is full of random chunks of debris that wipes one shuttle out) and land on the comet itself, then drive a rover to a specific site and drill several miles into the comet to drop a nuke in and break it in half, which despite a few setbacks like one rover getting launched into space by a random gas burst and the drill breaking repeatedly, manages to succeed and split the two halves to travel either side of Earth with, as ever, seconds to spare.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother one I can\u0027t remember the name of had a manned mission going to mars to find out why the algae and cyanobacteria they had bombed it with a while ago had disappeared (the obvious answer, because they couldn\u0027t live on a planet with negligible atmosphere, no surface water and sub-freezing temperatures pretty much everywhere, wouldn\u0027t make a good plot it seems). The orbiting ship had a huge fire on board and had to vent all the air which put it off course, the lander crashed miles from the landing site, the pre-deployed surface outpost was destroyed but somehow the atmosphere had oxygen in it and could support humans with no breathing gear. Turns out there were little insects all over Mars that were eating the algae and emitting oxygen (because science, apparently) which then ate most of the astronauts on the surface too, leaving the one survivor to hotwire a Russian sample return mission to get back into orbit and intercept the spaceship before it either crashed or had to return to Earth. Oh, and there was a military robot on board the lander that got dumped to save the crew capsule, but survived the crash with some damage and went to \u0027military mode\u0027 and started hunting the crew down one by one. A cameo from Pathfinder and some dubious DIY fuelling of the sample returner rocket later and of course everything ends fine with the two surviving crew heading back to Earth with some little oxygen-emitting beasties to save the Earth from some kind of climate disaster that meant the oxygen was running out (they never bothered to explain that bit).\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd to cap it off, what\u0027s the best way of staving off a tectonic cataclysm that will end humanity? Why, shooting nuclear torpedoes at the fault lines under the sea of course! Never mind the fact that the submarines are literally sailing through the deepest trenches in the ocean, many miles deep\u00A0when the best military subs out there don\u0027t go more than a few hundred metres down, or that they travel straight into the blasts from their nuclear torpedoes without ill-effect but yet one of them gets hit by a rock fall that smashes a hole in the hull while somehow not immediately imploding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve seen plenty more dodgy sci-fi films but can\u0027t remember them due to their mediocrity or plain rubbishness, if you want some really questionable science in films then amazon prime video has loads of low-budget and low-credibility sci-fi stuff, or just scour the movie channels on TV for anything vaguely sci-fi-ey as odds are it\u0027ll be heavy on the \u0027fi\u0027 but cherry-pick the \u0027sci\u0027 bits for the sake of what little plot there is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-24T18:18:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223669453\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022170269\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221568061284\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002227914\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 9/9/2019 at 9:34 PM, Vanamonde said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, it did appear that some of the escaped dinos were single examples of their species, leaving one to wonder how they might breed and take over the world.

The orbiting ship had a huge fire on board and had to vent all the air which put it off course, the lander crashed miles from the landing site, the pre-deployed surface outpost was destroyed but somehow the atmosphere had oxygen in it and could support humans with no breathing gear...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s Red Planet. Funnily enough, during the production, they actually consult an expert about Mars condition for advice, but the plot writer and the expert keep arguing between each other about \u0022what\u0027s interesting for plot\u0022 and \u0022that isn\u0027t possible on Mars\u0022. Eventually the expert gave up and say \u0022screw this, you want make a movie, make your own, I don\u0027t care anymore\u0022 (which also results on bad science it delivers)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd now, for my review of bad science, a thriller monster movie: Deep Star Six. The plot is like this: The crew of\u00A0DeepStar Six, an underwater naval facility tasked with deploying nuclear missile launchers on the sea floor, explosively opens an undersea cavern (with nukes no less) while hurrying to complete the last week of their tour. In doing so, they unleash an\u00A0extremely large, aggressive arthropod\u00A0that proceeds to make mincemeat out of the facility and the crew. Here\u0027s some of the bad science the movie delivers:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-20 megatons worth of nuclear bombs going off within knife-fight distance would have\u00A0vaporized\u00A0the base. Even if the fireball didn\u0027t reach them, the resultant shockwaves caused by the collapse of the bubble would have absolutely shredded it. Either would have put the whole crew, as well as the\u00A0audience, out of their respective misery (of enduring the rest of bad science).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-When the base\u0027s nuclear reactor coolant loop is compromised, they start talking about it going \u0022super-critical\u0022 - i.e., that it would explode like the nukes they just set off. Nope. They\u0027d certainly get a steam explosion, but it would be ridiculously puny compared to the exploding 20 megaton nuclear bombs\u00A0they just set off right outside their window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Nobody seems to understand what\u00A0decompression\u00A0means. The problem isn\u0027t decompression - that\u0027ll happen as the base loses gas pressure. The problem is\u00A0keeping the atmosphere compressed enough that they don\u0027t decompress too fast.\u00A0Divers decompress at or close to the surface, not\u00A0inside\u00A0the undersea base, because you are decompressing to ambient (atmospheric) pressure. And speaking of that,\u00A0Snyder\u0027s escape capsule would have\u00A0had\u00A0to have been at base pressure or explosive decompression would have resulted, and would have had to maintain that pressure as it rose, no problem for a heavy steel box. If someone got it attached to a decompression chamber topside, he would have been fine, and even if he\u0027d been stupid enough to vent the pressure to atmosphere, he wouldn\u0027t have just popped like a balloon. And also, they wouldn\u0027t have needed a JIM suit if they were at ambient pressure. If they were at atmospheric pressure, they\u0027d have had to have the armored diving suits to prevent implosion, but then decompression wouldn\u0027t have been a factor!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-The Deepstar Six base is nominally a Navy base but none of the occupants act remotely like Navy personnel. Gets really egregious when Snyder detonates the nuclear missles; triggering a nuclear detonation requires all kinds of safety interlocks and multiple officer concurrences in reality. It\u0027s possible that Deepstar was a civilian defense contractor, but the chance that the Navy would put nuclear detonation controls in the hands of a bunch of civilian wackos was nil.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-11-26T05:43:17Z\u0022 title=\u002211/26/2019 05:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 26, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by ARS\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Space Nerd","CreatedById":198691,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-26T09:00:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223709904\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022170269\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221574746872\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022168061\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ARS\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, ARS said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt first, I thought that it\u0027s impossible for lush jungle planet with plenty of oxygen to be deadly for humans, but then I realized it might be the concentration of oxygens itself that kills human.
