These motors are linked to RCS controls, but are powered by a Fuel\u002BOxidizer mix, making them significantly more powerful than MonoPropellant-powered RCS thrusters. They are fairly more bulky in comparison though, and feature only one nozzle facing outwards, although most agree that is an acceptable trade-off for the additional punch they pack.\n\n// attachment rules: stack, srfAttach, allowStack, allowSrfAttach, allowCollision\n\nattachRules = 0,1,0,1,1\n\n// --- standard part parameters ---\n\nmass = 0.08\n\ndragModelType = default\n\nmaximum\\_drag = 0.01\n\nminimum\\_drag = 0.01\n\nangularDrag = 0.1\n\ncrashTolerance = 50\n\nbreakingForce = 50\n\nbreakingTorque = 50\n\nmaxTemp = 3400\n\nfuelCrossFeed = True\n\nPhysicsSignificance = 1\n\n// --- rcs module parameters ---\n\nMODULE\n\n{\n\n name = MultiModeEngine\n\n primaryEngineID = LFO\n\n secondaryEngineID = LiquidFuel\n\n}\n\nMODULE\n\n{\n\n name = ModuleEnginesFX\n\n engineID = LFO\n\n thrusterTransformName = RCSthruster\n\n minThrust = 12\n\n maxThrust = 12\n\n resourceFlowMode = STAGE\\_PRIORITY\\_FLOW\n\n PROPELLANT\n\n {\n\n name = LiquidFuel\n\n ratio = 0.9\n\n DrawGauge = True\n\n resourceFlowMode = STAGE\\_PRIORITY\\_FLOW\n\n }\n\n PROPELLANT\n\n {\n\n name = Oxidizer\n\n ratio = 1.1\n\n resourceFlowMode = STAGE\\_PRIORITY\\_FLOW\n\n }\n\n atmosphereCurve\n\n {\n\n key = 0 260\n\n key = 1 140\n\n }\n\n}\n\nMODULE\n\n{\n\n name = ModuleEnginesFX\n\n engineID = LiquidFuel\n\n thrusterTransformName = RCSthruster\n\n minThrust = 12\n\n maxThrust = 12\n\n resourceFlowMode = STAGE\\_PRIORITY\\_FLOW\n\n PROPELLANT\n\n {\n\n name = LiquidFuel\n\n ratio = 0.9\n\n DrawGauge = True\n\n }\n\n atmosphereCurve\n\n {\n\n key = 0 260\n\n key = 1 140\n\n }\n\n}\n\n}"},{"CreatedByName":"BioRoots","CreatedById":131728,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T01:26:48Z","Content":"Not the right place for this ??"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T01:42:55Z","Content":"Technically this should go in the Add-On Development sub forum.\n\nI can\u0027t actually help you with your question, but I\u0027d double check that MultiModeEngine documentation.
