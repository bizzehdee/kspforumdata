Specifically, a countdown that shows the \u0027modified\u0027 amount of time (as perceived by the operator/gamer) until the next node is reached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I ask for this because I frequently have KSP running in the background throughout my day (not at a workplace - for those concerned). Often times, I will line up a maneuver and then return to my computer later (anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours) to execute that maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I would find it extremely helpful to be able to set a time-warp factor and be able to know how long (in people time) it will be until my next maneuver node so that I can set an alarm or something and return later after running some errands, working on the lawn, or really, anything else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I threw together an example of what I was thinking of to help prevent confusion as to which data I\u0027m asking for.
