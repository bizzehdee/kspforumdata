In Battleship Craft, players got to build their own ships with intricate detail and take them into battle against AI or other players from around the world. It was an incredible game that left its players saddened with its demise.\n\nHowever, a few months later, a successor to Battleship Craft emerged. The new game was called Naval Craft. It had far more intricate ship building and customization than its predecessor and even supported fleet combat, allowing you to take more than one ship into a battle. The game is being expanded on by its creators, and is shaping into an absolutely stunning mobile game.\n\nNaval Craft was viewed as the triumphant rebirth of Battleship Craft until another developer took the original coding of Battleship Craft and released another new game, titled Warship Craft. Warship Craft was an exact copy of Battleship Craft, and became very popular very fast.\n\nThe two rival apps are both being further developed by their creators. Both are very detailed and very fun games. I personally like Naval Craft better, but I still play both games. What do you guys think? Vote for your favorite ship building game."}]}
