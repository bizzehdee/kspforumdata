Also, a general note on Tweakscale and mass scaling: I thought realistic tank scaling was non-linear at one point myself. Turns out, this isnt the case. All tanks for space craft are actually pressure vessels, even when the contents are just at STP. Space is a vacuum, thus unless the fuel is at like 1/100th STP, it\u0027s going to scale more or less linearly because the tank\u0027s pressure increases with it\u0027s size. Strictly linearly in the case of highly pressurized gasses like Xenon and Argon whose tanks can\u0027t be built larger than a fixed size practically. The only real factors in tank weight that may not be linear are things like outer shells and structural elements. The tanks themselves are mostly linear, and at a certain point, all tanks become linear because we do not have the material structural integrity to build larger tanks, and instead tanks must simply be duplicated for more volume.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurprisingly, you\u0027re right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took some research of my own to confirm what you were saying, but apparently because the structural stresses on a fuel tank wall increase in proportion to not only the pressure, but also the volume of the tank, the tank mass does indeed scale linearly with fuel volume.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice that there is no place in the equation for the weight of the propellant- a fuel tank at STP will weigh the same regardless of whether it\u0027s holding 2 tons of LH2 or 16 tons of CH4, for instance... (which would have exactly the same volume and pressure)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, the 16 tons of CH4 will be worth a lot more Delta-V, even with the lower ISP from burning it or using it directly in thermal rocketry... (and the operating pressures using methane will be lower for the same thrust due to the higher molecular mass- meaning you can save weight on the engine or achieve much higher thrust for the same chamber pressures...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMakes me wonder why ANYBODY in their right mind would ever use LH2/LOX instead of hydrocarbons (CH4/LOX or Kerosene/LOX) for propulsion in the Earth-Moon system... The higher ISP of LH2/LOX doesn\u0027t become worth the lower fuel density and/or higher tank mass unless you are transporting them a TRULY large Delta-V gap- like to Mars or Jupiter- in which case boil-off is a serious issue... And Kero/LOX or Metha/LOX rockets will be SMALLER than LH2/LOX rockets, thanks to their higher fuel density- which means they will experience less atmospheric drag losses during ascent thanks to their better Ballistic Coefficients...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shalashalska","CreatedById":81412,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T07:37:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you might be forgetting that you need 10 km/s to get to LEO, then another 4-5 km/s to get to the moon, then another 4 to land and get back, and another 2 to transfer back.
