I think it makes sense both from a gameplay stance and for realism\u0027s sake that doing science in different but similar biomes should yield less and less science progress. For instance, if you have already studied three of the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn\u0027s craters, you shouldn\u0027t get very much science for studying more craters. While I\u0027m sure there are some unique properties of each major crater, the majority of it is crater data and doesn\u0027t look very different from one to the next. In other cases, some readings could follow a line or \u0022path\u0022 of similarity, such as the Kerbin biomes water, shore, grassland, highlands, mountains, tundra, poles. Each of these is most similar to the biomes next to it on the list, and so researching one would yield less if you have researched any of the others next to it on the \u0022path\u0022 of similarity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would decrease the maximum science that could be obtained from one planet without reducing the early amounts from initial observations. It woould make visiting new worlds more important than fully exploring each one. But min-maxers would still get a significant return from checking every biome, just less than the initial biomes of the planet give.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-24T15:57:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehumble bump\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
