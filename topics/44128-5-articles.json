It just wants to sit there at the same distance away from the active vessel. RCSing towards it doesn\u0027t do anything.

I\u0027ve burned myself out a bit. The last few weeks have been pretty busy in general for me as well. That said, there hasn\u0027t been very much progress at all. I tried to tackle the positioning but it hasn\u0027t worked out very well. Going on a bit of a vacation next weekend so hopefully I\u0027ll come back with some motivation to work on this a bit more. If anything, I\u0027ll upload some videos of the behavior I\u0027m experiencing with the positioning.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"krenshala","CreatedById":76062,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-08T22:29:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou mentioned that it tracks/transfers orbital information just fine. I would think it would be (relatively) easy to define the movement of other vessels by transferring their orbital info and when they started that orbit, so the data transfered would be the ephemerus, a timestamp, and an angle on the ellipse defined by the ephemerus. This would give you both a time and position on the orbit, and the game should calculate the vessel\u0027s current position on the orbit using its normal routines. You should only have to update the data on other clients when the controlling player performs a maneuver (an RCS or engine burn). This, of course, only covers those situations where the other players are not close enough to actually render the vessel (or kerbal) being controlled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the ship is close enough to render you would also need the rotational data (initial rotational position, plus changes), which it looks like you have done a good job of setting up already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the timewarp issue, I agree with the calls to stop beating the horse. Once this mod gets to the point where it will matter, however, my preference is for something like the mod that lets you warp at will and logs your maneuvers, playing them them back for the other players at whatever speed their clients are running at. This keeps celestial positions sane (which appears to be what some folks overlook when discussion warping) while still allowing official time to catch up when nobody is controlling a vessel at a lower speed. In my mind this does have the oddness that a player could launch a ship into a long orbit, time warp forward on it, do some things, then return to the Space Port (and \u0022server\u0022 time) to launch another ship and see himself performing actions on the first vessel from a different perspective. I like this unintended feature, but thought it should be pointed out for those that overlooked it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPwolf, keep up the good work.

Player A sends a thruster on command -\u0026gt; Player A computes the movement, and the ship moves -\u0026gt; Player A sends a command to ship in Player B computer, it computes its command, and the ships move (OpenTTD)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.
