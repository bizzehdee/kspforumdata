Computer processing power doesn\u0027t really factor into scale because scale in space is relative. I\u0027m not sure what game engine Squad is using, but this looks similar to Unity. Unity doesn\u0027t support Hyperthreading on processors so things like water and large terrain can run very slow. I think that this is a custom engine that was inspired by Unity or perhaps Unity pro. My PC is a beast and it\u0027s hard to get anything better without thousands of dollars invested into it because I\u0027m a game designer and 3D artist. Scaling things down improves on time for travel, texture size, engine performance, poly count, and animation. When you add up all of the things necessary to run a game, this game wouldn\u0027t be able to run on any computer using a single processor core for all of the calculations. As far as programming goes, an engine like this isn\u0027t anywhere near as effective as something like Unreal Engine 4 or even Unreal Engine 3, but again I think that this is some sort or Unity clone engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Black_Tomcat","CreatedById":63718,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T17:09:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only computer processing power that is needed in addition to make a bigger solar system is for the graphics card to load bigger textures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you look at the Kerbin-Earth rescale you will see that Kerbin\u0027s resolution is quite a bit lower because of that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"700NitroXpress","CreatedById":90322,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T17:15:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Black_Tomcat\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Black_Tomcat\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe only computer processing power that is needed in addition to make a bigger solar system is for the graphics card to load bigger textures.\u003Cp\u003EIf you look at the Kerbin-Earth rescale you will see that Kerbin\u0027s resolution is quite a bit lower because of that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot really, you can load any sized texture you want for a planet up to 4k and over.
