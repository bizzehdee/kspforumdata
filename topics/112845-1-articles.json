I\u0027m partial to minimizing my Mk. 2s down to just a Type A Structural and Elevon 3 for main lift, but that strake probably really helps with a setup like this that has lower thrust. Nice aesthetic, too- it just looks fast without even trying to go to Mach 4.\n\n\\*reads post again\\*\n\nOK, **wow**. If you\u0027re ever looking for a challenging SSTO job, we\u0027d be glad to have you at Rockomax Heavy Industries. You did better than lift a Mun lander into LKO (as with one of my concepts)- you just said \u0022screw K-Prize specs\u0022, refuelled, and did it yourself. That is some serious piloting and building skills, there. Especially the hours of tweaking and polishing that thing must have took. Well done.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-13T18:16:07Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2015 06:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kagame**"},{"CreatedByName":"Screeno","CreatedById":141893,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T21:07:49Z","Content":"I\u0027m gonna send it to duna, as a prrof of concept that it can be a shuttle to a duna base, is 3700 Dv enough to depart from LKO, aerocapture at duna, land, takeoff and get to low duna orbit, then return home?
