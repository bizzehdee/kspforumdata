I\\\u0027m from the UK, an I just registered here. I payed for KSP on January 18th, after playing it for only a few days. I like being able to get a game for a one off price, early in development, so I paid $10 and here I am. Glad to contribute because I feel that even though it\\\u0027s early days, this game will develop into a deep, feature-rich game, which can be enjoyed past official release for a very long time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, a concern is performance. I know it\\\u0027s early in development but is there a chance that the game will be \u003Cem\u003Egreatly\u003C/em\u003E optimised? I sold my gaming rig (3.6Ghz Quad Core) last year and got a Dell XPS L702X laptop in November, with an Intel Core i5-2540m @ 2.6Ghz (2 Cores / 4 Threads) - Turbo Boost to 3.1Ghz in Dual Core Mode or 3.3Ghz via 1 Core. It has an Nvidia GT550m. 6GB 1333Mhz Dual Channel DDR3. Western Digital Caviar 7,200RPM HDD with 16mb Cache. 1600x900 17\u0027 WLED 16:9 Screen. Performance is... iffy. Fullscreen, default lighting / shadows, full res textures, 2x AA, I get decent performance but if I look back at the earth when exiting the earths atmosphere, naturally I get poorer performance, but inside the Vehicle Assembly Building, performance is dreadful. Rumour has it, that as it stands KSP is only using one core? Is this true?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m sure things will pick up, but I thought I might as well drop by here, say hello and express my main concern. Fanstastic game, highly addictive. Looking forward to future updates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeace! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-20T14:46:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe latest version of KSP (v0.13.1) has been rebuilt on the latest Unity engine which has multi-core support. More optimizations can be done, but because this is still in early development, certain optimizations won\\\u0027t be done yet. For example, the output of debugging messages can slow performance and would be something that is removed for a final release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
