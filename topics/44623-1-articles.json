I\u0027m too lazy to build my own station so I took some parts from various stations on the forums and space port and built a station in orbit. However I could only get the core part to a 72000 pereapsis and a 75000 apoasis. Is that too low of an orbit for a space station? Should I worry about my station getting sucked down to earth? If it is low what would be the optimal height for my station?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerekL1963","CreatedById":57091,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-01T21:33:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo long as you are above 69km, you\u0027re golden.
