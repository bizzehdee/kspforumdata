Quick diff for the other experiments (because now i got suspicious) revealed that MobileMaterialsLab ScienceCap was also increased from 35 to 55 (again making repeated experiments more valuable).\u003Cp\u003ETo whoever that was: Seriously wtf? If you want to make your science harvesting even easier do these edits in your personal file, this project is about enhancing variety and not about personal balancing issues. Guess its another reason why the submission system is preferrable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@OP/Proofreaders: Please correct these trolling edits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re right. Looks like some edits were made to these values before we shut off public editing. I flagged them in the file and Kyle can take care of them when he gets a moment. Good catch. :3\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
