The notebook is currently on windows but for that purpose would be changed to Linux.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestion is of course this: Is it possible AND allowed to install KSP from Steam on these two computers without buying the game a second time?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince Steam actually uses an account (and of course it would be the same account and never used at the same time), this might be possible....
