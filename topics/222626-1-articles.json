This update, the first of our major Roadmap Updates, had to achieve some big new goals for KSP2: it had to round out the core game loop with re-entry heating and buoyancy; it had to introduce a whole new progression system via the R\u0026amp;D Center and Mission Control; it had to introduce Science collection, Science parts, and dozens of new points of interest; and of course it needed to continue to deliver quality of life improvements (banishing wobbly rockets) and performance improvements. Also: there are boat docks now! In a nutshell, the addition of Exploration Mode transformed KSP2 from a sandbox experience into a proper long-form game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWorking on something with so many moving parts, there\u2019s always a little trepidation when we release a new build to the public - especially when there are so many new systems in play. We do our best to test every possible scenario, but there\u2019s always a chance that something terrifying will rear its head once we\u2019ve got thousands of people playing the game. It was with this fear lurking in the backs of our heads that we sat together in our own mission control room and waited for confirmation that For Science! had been released into the world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe nervously watched the first review videos appear on YouTube, and were relieved to discover that veteran players like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4ZdAV5wKFk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECarnasa\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhb7M9YNr7c\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMatt Lowne\u003C/a\u003E were excited about what they found in the new update.

Our stream ran over an hour longer than planned because we, too, had a bit of trouble putting it down. That\u2019s a story we\u2019re hearing a lot - you sit down to play this game for an hour, and before you know it the sun\u2019s coming up.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOver the last couple of weeks, a clear picture has emerged - there are still some bugs, as well as some big opportunities to improve the player experience - but for the most part, those rough edges have not gotten in the way of some very ambitious exploratory missions. I\u2019ll talk more about those bugs in a bit, but first I\u2019d like to highlight some of this update\u2019s biggest wins:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe music. Yes, you all love Howard Mostrom. We\u2019re going to need a bigger inbox for all his fan mail.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe tutorials and first-time user experience have paved the way for a new group of first-time Kerbal players, and we\u2019re not only seeing lots of you get to space, we\u2019re also seeing a lot more players doing interplanetary missions. In many ways, the original justification for KSP2\u2019s existence was to find a way to welcome more new players to Kerbal, and we\u2019re very excited to see that this work has begun to bear fruit. We knew that bringing rocket science to the masses wasn\u2019t going to be easy, and there\u2019s still a lot more work to do in this area... but we\u2019re making progress!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFolks are enjoying the missions! We\u2019re excited to continue adding new missions to the game via upcoming updates, and we\u2019d love to hear your suggestions for compelling new exploration goals.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIn general, we\u2019re beginning to see the flourishing of player creativity that we knew would take place once the most critical performance and usability issues had been ironed out. It\u2019s been a pleasure to visit r/kerbalspaceprogram and our #bestof Discord channel and just bask in the awesomeness. People are making magnificent things, and it feels so nice to see all that imagination unleashed.

Areas of frustration include font scale and legibility, the maneuver node interface, thermal system tuning (including the propensity of some parts to explode even when they\u2019re shielded and the insufficiency of fairings to protect their contents), as well as a few weird one-off stability issues (most of which can be corrected by reloading or restarting). We are triaging and trying to reproduce issues related to things like parachutes failing to deploy, trajectories vanishing from the map view, and Delta-V accuracy (which given the dependency of maneuver plans on accurate Delta-V projection, can result in being blocked from planning a maneuver). We\u2019ve also noted some user experience gaps, most notably the game\u2019s failure to properly communicate to new players that \u0022Revert to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0022 is different from \u0022Return to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0022 - \u00A0an oversight that has led some newcomers to lose their progress after completing a mission.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019ll also take this moment to offer a new protip that I learned today after complaining to Chris Adderley about my spaceplane wings being destroyed on re-entry: while the heavier wings are more heat-resistant, the volume of every wing (and especially the wing\u2019s thickness) affects its thermal mass. A thicker wing will be more resistant to destruction via heat! I\u2019ll be trying out the \u0022fat wings\u0022 approach tonight after work. Procedural wings sure are cool.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, back to bugs.
