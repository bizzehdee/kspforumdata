The only things I can do are go to the space center or tracking station, though I can look in the map (just can\u0027t click anything). If I go back to the tracking station and change there, I can\u0027t access the seismic data. Any thoughts on what\u0027s going on or what I should do? I\u0027m not really landing close enough to use [ or ] to change ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERe. 3: I saw that in the wiki. It works, but I can\u0027t switch vessels without going through the tracking station. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again - I really appreciate it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Hmm - reinstalling the mod might fix it. Maybe? Do you have any other science-related mods like the remote data thingy? The magnetometer doesn\u0027t have a right click menu to extract data like the stock mods; you just right click it while piloting the craft and it should work. You do have an \u0022activate magnetometer\u0022 that extends it out and starts showing sciencenumbers right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: I always go back through the tracking station then select my lander.
