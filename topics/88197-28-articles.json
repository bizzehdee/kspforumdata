That is, as I said, the one area where Eagleworks is at an advantage. They were not aiming to prove the existence of \u003Cem\u003Ethrust\u003C/em\u003E as a \u003Cem\u003Econcept\u003C/em\u003E. They already know that thrust is a thing that exists, so when their results show that there is thrust, they know that something is happening. Blondlot had to prove that he wasn\u0027t, as it were, \u0022seeing things\u0022 first. \u003Cp\u003ELike I said, I don\u0027t know if anyone tried to do any follow-up experiments to determine \u003Cem\u003Ewhat\u003C/em\u003E, if anything, the experiments were actually detecting before. But unless the creator of the concept of N-Rays admitted that he made the whole thing up, I think it was a thing that could have been looked into - at the very least so that whatever that factor was does not interfere with any future experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry about taking some time to reply to this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had just spent several posts explaining why all this is dead wrong and useless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey haven\u0027t really measured anything. Nothing. Zilch. (Nothing that can be trusted anyway.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstand that as long as you are near the limits of detection, all sorts of errors creep into the data and that makes it really hard to validate anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example. The Hubble mirror is famously out of whack. When they were making the mirror they had to account for the traffic in the parking lot.
