I can see no reason for there to be 3 seconds of delay to move from the root menu to the \u0060load game\u0060 menu.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there are serious calculations being done at this point please ignore this suggestion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there are not then please allow me to reduce the transition time in the menu before the game is loaded. It should be a quick, easy thing to add to the options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI expect the usual \u0060I would not use this feature so I do not see the value\u0060 but for those of us who do a lot of testing and switching of mods which requires reloading the game and going through the menu it is very noticeable and an option in the settings to reduce this time would be a boon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-04T13:45:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I don\u0027t see the point as that 3 seconds is insignificant compared to the actual loading time, but if you want to switch between save games it would probably be pritty significant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yes, I don\u0027t see a downside to this\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
