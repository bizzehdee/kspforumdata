I\u0027ve found many of the posts in here to be really helpful and occasionally hilarious (space humor - who knew). So before I ask my question, thanks KSP Forum!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow: After updating to 0.2, I\u0027ve been building an interplanetary ship in orbit, using a design similar to one that was successful in 0.19. Basically, the biggest difference is that I\u0027m using clamp-o-tron senior. And I cannot get the blasted thing to dock. I park it gently, less than \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BD m/s, really well aligned, and yet the two parts just bounce off each other. Now, the design does have five clamps that must align, but that didn\u0027t seem to be a problem with the standard size clamp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have any ideas as to what\u0027s going wrong? Any known issues with the new clamp?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"carranty","CreatedById":67479,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T09:42:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having exactly the same problem. I spent an hour trying to dock two station parts last night, even though they were almost perfectly aligned they just bumped off one another like they were simply bits of the hull. The maglock certianly showed no signs of engaging like it does with the smaller clamps. I\u0027m thinking these are actually just hull pieces and not functional docking ports, either that or they have to be so perfectly aligned they\u0027re all but impossible to use.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wayfare","CreatedById":52072,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T09:43:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only trouble I\u0027ve had with them was when I put one on backwards \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E It\u0027s an easy mistake to make in the VAB because they have no obvious top or bottom when seen from the side.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"carranty","CreatedById":67479,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T09:54:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWayfare, Can I just confirm which way round your using them\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.flickr.com/photos/76360777@N08/8813104665/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis side\u003C/a\u003E, or \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.flickr.com/photos/76360777@N08/8823694266/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis side\u003C/a\u003E facing out\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been using the side shown in the first photo facing out.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-25T09:57:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2013 09:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by carranty\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ben Kerman","CreatedById":49475,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T09:56:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just performed a docking with two rovers, and it worked perfectly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs said above, don\u0027t put them on backwards, you can easily tell if you\u0027re looking at the docking side because of the small hollow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022carranty\u0022 data-cite=\u0022carranty\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWayfare, Can I just confirm which way round your using them\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.flickr.com/photos/76360777@N08/8813104665/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis side\u003C/a\u003E, or \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.flickr.com/photos/76360777@N08/8823694266/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis side\u003C/a\u003E facing out\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been using the side shown in the first photo facing out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou were right.
