I was using a lander with a probe, landing it and then activating the seismometer. I would then switch vessels to the booster stage of the same rocket in orbit, and deorbit it and crash it. It also has a probe core. It seems to me the trick is to make sure the impactor is named as the \u0022probe\u0022 and not the lander with the instruments. This can be done by renaming the lander\u0027s core before separation in orbit. Prior to this I had tried every combination of active vessel, not active vessel possible, no luck.

I can see fusion or antimatter working with a plasma thruster. You could also use microwave power if you don\u0027t have FAR and don\u0027t mind the fact that it looks silly. I didn\u0027t build an SSTO but I did make a thermal turbojet plane and you need to put your engine and reactor in the middle since they\u0027re so heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PringleMan","CreatedById":1396,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-24T23:22:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022EasyAce\u0022 data-cite=\u0022EasyAce\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve been trying to find and answer to this, but it seems nowhere to be found.\u003Cp\u003EI installed the latest KSP Interstellar, but KSP crashes right between the loading screen and the main menu of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone knows why, or have a solution for me to try?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhat other mods do you have? That is a common problem that occurs when you have ~just~ the right number of mods to max out the RAM available. Remember that KSP is a 32 bit program, so you are limited to 3.9 gigs in normal game usage, plus unpacked parts and plugins.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
