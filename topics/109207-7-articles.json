I think some optimization in how that\u0027s processed might fix it. I\u0027m not a mathematician, but if you described the parts to be retroactively scanned as a line of the path of the orbit traced over the map with the width of the line being a function of altitude (a lot of ass pulling going on here but it makes sense in my head), that would allow the calculation to be done as a (relatively) simple math problem, which computers are really really good at.\n\u003E \n\nWell, the path isn\u0027t exactly \u0022straight\u0022. When you project the path onto a 2D map, it is quite curvy (unless you are exactly equatorial). I can take another look at the code for retroactive scans, but to make sure can you see if you get the same problem when you turn retroactive scanning off in the options?\n\nThe massive data grids getting created and put into memory as a result of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E could be causing a memory-based crash as well."},{"CreatedByName":"MusicMetalHead","CreatedById":172040,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-05T03:51:10Z","Content":"Working on getting a relay network setup right now for a Moon mission, but I\u0027ll put survey back up and try it out again once I finish that.

They are generally mutually exclusive, and I\u0027m not entirely sure what happens when you install both (it might not crash or anything, just be broken/weird/confusing/whatever).\n\n**Some reasons to use SCANsat:** You want maps besides the planet overlays that are interactive and allow you to place waypoints, you want different types of scanners for altitude maps, biome maps, resources, etc., you (possibly) want to skip the narrow band scanner or ground-truthing phases of resource scouting, and you generally crave more complexity and a more fleshed-out planet mapping and scanning experience.\n\n**Some reasons to use OSP:** You generally like the stock resource system, you want to stay stock-alike, you don\u0027t crave much more complexity but the stock M700 Survey Scanner\u0027s instant reveal drives you insane. Or you like the stock system and simply want a biome overlay without using the cheat menu.\n\nHope that clears things up a bit.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-23T17:48:00Z\u0022 title=\u002203/23/2017 05:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 23, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Wheffle**\n  \nstuff"},{"CreatedByName":"maculator","CreatedById":122127,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-16T19:57:30Z","Content":"Nice mod, really helps track down biomes I wan\u0027t to visit.\n\nSmall suggestion: maybe add a legend to the mapoverlay to tell wich biome is wich.\n\n(I hope map-legend is a thing in english too.

I don\u0027t know if the colors are associated with biomes anywhere in the system. I might look into it when I get to working on this mod again.\n\nUnfortunately sometimes having the biome map up on a not fully scanned planet can cause some narley lag in some cases, it\u0027s not always easy to predict when. I\u0027ve resorted to using some pretty hack-ish methods to intercept KSP\u0027s overlay textures and modify them before they get deployed, and unfortunately ever since they cleaned up the biome map to give it more resolution it has gained the potential to hog resources, again only sometimes. Fortunately this isn\u0027t a problem for the ore overlay. It\u0027s something I will address when I have time to work on OSP after finals, I sincerely apologize for it.\n\nEdit: In the meantime, if the biome map lag is consistently wrecking your framerate, you can uncheck the \u0022biome map requires scan\u0022 option which will alleviate the lag. Of course this means that, well, the biome map doesn\u0027t require scanning, so that kind of sucks, but the ore map still will.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-17T03:20:48Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2017 03:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Wheffle**"},{"CreatedByName":"maculator","CreatedById":122127,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-17T09:16:00Z","Content":"Only got pysicks slowed when looking at it, I can stand that.
