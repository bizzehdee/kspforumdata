Otherwise how do I know that Jeb\u0027s not going to just sink into the soft, delicious surface of Minmus, or that Pol is not actually made of antimatter? Same for orbiting anything but Kerbin itself; we need to make sure that big pink creatures from planet Dirt aren\u0027t going to try to shoot us down. This rule gets particularly interesting when playing with Remotetech.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- For kerbaled flights that are longer than a there-and-back to Minmus, multiple kerbals have to be sent, as solo kerbals tend to start going a little strange when they\u0027re alone too long. Two isn\u0027t enough, it has to be three; someone has to break up Bill and Bob when they start having slap fights over who gets to date Valentina when she joins the KSP. (I think they\u0027re both going to be rather disappointed...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- More of a rule that a lot of people do but I don\u0027t follow: It\u0027s okay when using Remotetech to have insufficient batteries to be able to handle the full duration of passing through Kerbin\u0027s shadow, especially for the first constellation. The flight computer for those probes can do far more than Jeb can do before he leaves Kerbin\u0027s SOI; it should be able to switch to a low power mode for 95% of the time and just power up occasionally to see if it needs to do more. Someone can pay me if they want something to relay their TV signals, otherwise what I\u0027m putting up is for KSP use only and doesn\u0027t need to be running full speed all the time!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sandworm","CreatedById":66244,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T21:34:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1.
