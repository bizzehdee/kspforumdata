Even an extra structural item such as a Rockomax Brand Adapter can give a kerbal some room to stretch, as it would be silly to think those things are solid.\n\nLately, with my career I have been making it mandatory to include a probe core with every craft. That way, in case of emergencies, the probe AI can return the craft to the KSC with whatever science has been stored on it. And if the flight is crewed by only one kerbal, it gives them someone to play chess with and pass the time.\n\nI do try to keep space litter down, and if I can\u0027t lose a stage in atmo, I will try to release it as low down as possible. That way after a few orbits, I can terminate it with the thought that gravity and eventual friction from any materials in planetary orbit would bring that stage down. Which also encourages me to put any satellites or orbital stations in higher orbits than 100k. The trade-off in dV is minimal, and the view is even better the higher up you are.\n\nAnything that can get sent into solar orbit is just as good, as it won\u0027t be around to cause any sorts of concerns.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Always have a way to get kerbals back home (even if it\u0027s going to be a permanent base, I still want the *ability* to get them back home)\n\nI don\u0027t mind the thought of one-way missions with the plan to send a follow-up recovery mission, but it definitely requires some thought to habitation for the initial crew. Especially making sure there is more than one kerbin on such a flight. Don Cheadle\u0027s character\u0027s experience in Mission to Mars gives me the heeby jeebies.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Include a pilot, a scientist, and an engineer on every crewed mission beyond Kerbin\u0027s SoI, even if their abilities aren\u0027t going to be needed\n\nA PSE crew is always going to be necessary.

While a good probe core can fill in for a pilot, it can not fill in for scientist or engineer...not yet, anyway.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* After a major interplanetary ship is decomissioned, keep it in orbit as a \u0022museum\u0022 (and rename it as such--\u0022Phoenix II Orbital Museum\u0022 or suchlike) so the little kerbals of future generations can visit it on field trips\n\nI like this one. But if I can\u0027t keep it in orbit, I can always commission building a replica to keep at the KSC, as NASA has done with their Saturn V rocket. Such achievements should always be remembered beyond a craft file.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Ones I like to use often:\n\u003E -two or more kerbals for crewed missions beyond LKO.\n\u003E \n\u003E -when landing on bodies that are the size of Mun or bigger I need a seperate lander and CSM.\n\u003E \n\u003E Basically my missions don\u0027t have to be apollo style, but will require some form of rendezvous.\n\nI find a separate lander is most handy with interplanetary missions. With the Mun and Minmus, it is practically child\u0027s play to land and return to Kerbin in one craft, but having a separate module to get the crew back from the likes of Duna is ideal. Especially since you wouldn\u0027t need to send the whole crew down to the surface. One wonders how difficult it was for the command module pilots to repress the thought that they might need to go back home to Earth alone....\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-12T19:37:48Z\u0022 title=\u002203/12/2015 07:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by samstarman5**"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T19:45:34Z","Content":"My rules:\n\n- Make it look at least *somewhat* realistic (no flying pancakes for serious missions)\n\n- Extra leg room for long trips (each kerbal gets minimum 2 seats if the trip is beyond Kerbals SOI)\n\n- Pack about 500 extra d/v per manuever (orbit, landing, rendezvous, etc)\n\n- Docking without RCS earns double points (just like \u0022Whose Line Is It Anyway?\u0022 the points mean nothing except for amusement\u0027s sake)\n\n- Since I use TAC-LS, I try to keep at least double (if not more!) the amount of supplies needed (minimum 40 days worth... even for LKO)\n\n- Interplanetary?
