I\u0027ll probably even put it on the (ever growing) list of ideas to look into and develop on in the future.  \n\nFor now though, I have way too many things to finish (and several more planned...) and cannot afford to spend time re-doing already functional parts.  \n\nMight not be as big of a deal in a month or so, and I might be able to revisit it at that point. I\u0027ve been pretty generous with my scheduling, so might have some free time in some of the release windows. I\u0027m also getting much faster at many parts of the modeling process (especially texturing), so I might also be able to eek out a little extra time there as well. No promises though.  \n\nHow about this... -if- I can finish up the upper-stage stuff before 1.1 is released, I\u0027ll see about spending some time reworking pods / fixing/re-adding Apollo-derived stuff. I was going to do more engines, but... there is only one of me, and only so much time.  \n\n[quote name=\u0027blowfish\u0027]It wouldn\u0027t fix any of the issues parachutes have by themselves, but it might be simpler to write a new generic animation module that doesn\u0027t affect drag cubes. Especially for something as simple as a light animation, the module should be pretty short.[/QUOTE]  \n\nYep, and I\u0027ll probably be writing one up anyhow for other unrelated reasons. I think the stock method of unity-created animations is... overkill.. for simple lighting, and intend on doing a fully-procedural mesh-based lighting system very similar to the one used for the engine-emissives. Would add ability to also control a light source/transform, but otherwise the basis would be the same -- using float curves and config parameters to alter the light settings. Allows for faster dev time as I don\u0027t need to muck about with the unity animation system, and also allows for post-compile editing of the lighting animation (a big plus!). Will also allow me to do cool stuff like blinky lights/repeating/reversible light animations... and probably a ton of things that I haven\u0027t even thought up yet :)  \n\nSo yeah, by the time I get around to reworking existing parts, that likely won\u0027t be too much of a hurdle anymore. Might still implement a custom parachute (or derive a custom one from stock...) to allow better control of multi-cap-single-part parachute setups (if the problems I ran into are still... problems; don\u0027t even remember what they were at this point)."},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T02:01:47Z","Content":"So no Apollo CSM? :("},{"CreatedByName":"VenomousRequiem","CreatedById":137373,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T02:06:29Z","Content":"[quote name=\u0027davidy12\u0027]So no Apollo CSM? :([/QUOTE]  \n\nPlease, Shadow? :b"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T02:53:13Z","Content":"LoL, do I really need to quote myself?  \n\n[quote name=\u0027Shadowmage\u0027]  \n\n[...snip...]  \n\nHow about this... -if- I can finish up the upper-stage stuff before 1.1 is released, I\u0027ll see about spending some time reworking pods / fixing/re-adding Apollo-derived stuff.

This segment will grow/shrink to allow for customization. Undecided if this will be a procedural mesh or multiple pre-compiled model.  \n\n[B]Blue \u002B Red[/B] = \u0027fixed\u0027 mesh for tank caps for that tank diameter. Will move in response to middle section of that tank growing  \n\n[B]Black[/B] = selectable mesh intertank structure. Will be able to select at least a solid and skeletal type intertank structure  \n\n[B]Green[/B] = mesh-swich-selectable mounting option. Will likely have a few varieties and sizes available. If RCS is included, they will likely be mounted here (rcs on an upper stage is not for translation, but for rotation, so direct com balance is not needed, and you actually want them as far away from com as possible). Might possibly have a \u0027solid\u0027 variant as per the intertank structure.  \n\n[B]Yellow[/B] = Fairings = I\u0027m going to make them auto-size to the bottom node of the part below them / visible size of the part below them / user adjustable height, so the upper stage will provide the fairing for the engine cluster. Will also be adding the ability to set the number of fairing segments in the VAB, where it will auto-switch from \u0027stuck to part below\u0027 to \u0027jettison to the sides\u0027 (to clean up issues of the upper stage being used above a payload fairing/interstage petal adapter). Might also add an override to the engine cluster to auto-disable its own\u0027 fairing if attached to an upper stage (so the user doesn\u0027t have to do it every time).  \n\n[B]Engines[/B] = bring your own (byoe) (naked/mount-less clusters fully supported)  \n\nBoth of these upper stages would be achievable through a single part in the editor (e.g. 2.5m split-tank upper stage part...), and there should be a single part for each upper stage type, per supported stack size.  \n\n(sorry for the terrible lighting, I have no idea how to set blender up to do pure non-directional/unshaded ambient lighting)  \n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/u9GgOWX.png?1[/IMG]  \n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/GiOTpnO.png?1[/IMG]  \n\nThese are just a couple of examples. You will be able to change each part individually (as in the custom fuel tanks/caps); at least the lower mount (1), interstage structure (2), and tank length(3). I\u0027ll probably be keeping the oxi and fuel tank lengths \u0027linked\u0027, to maintain the illusion of proper LH2/LO2 ratios.  \n\nThe bits I haven\u0027t quite fit in yet are where to potentially include solar panels (if they should even be an option), and potential ullage/retro rockets (not really needed for stock though...).  \n\nSome of those might go on another new part that I had been discussing with Jose - a semi-procedural interstage decoupler, which just became alot more viable/less messy with the some of the 1.05 changes (able to remove decouplers from staging... finally!).  \n\nEdit:  \n\nSomething else I just thought of... I can add the new S-II / S-IVB mounts (or really, any/all of them) as end-cap options on the existing fuel-tanks, so that they can include fuel that way as well :)  \n\nAnd... if I were to add vernier capability to the existing fuel tanks... hmm... kinda sounds like a common-bulkhead upper stage to me :)  \n\nHmm.. and more hmm... but probably not.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-21T03:06:32Z\u0022 title=\u002211/21/2015 03:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"JoseEduardo","CreatedById":127759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T03:37:24Z","Content":"would the common bulkhead version allow to make something like this?  \n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/oVxIIBd.png[/IMG]  \n\nabout choosing between procedural x pre-compiled, I would go with procedural, Upper stages are very unlikely to be big enough for the textures to look blurred and weird"},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T04:39:26Z","Content":"[quote name=\u0027VenomousRequiem\u0027]Please, Shadow? :b[/QUOTE]  \n\nThank you for supporting a CSM Sister :D"},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T07:47:04Z","Content":"Those upper stages are almost exactly what I hoped they\u0027d be :)  \n\nThis is pretty trivial, but I\u0027m curious how you\u0027re going to handle the fuel lines - are you planning a single generic setup or switchable options to cover different numbers of engines being mounted on the bottom?  \n\nAnd re: solar panels - I think they\u0027re unnecessary for a stage that\u0027s probably not going to be used for more than a few hours.

Won\u0027t be independently switchable; I\u0027m going to abstract the last-mile routing through the thrust-plate.  \n\nFuel cells -- I think I like that idea :) Greatly simplifies the power-gen part of what I was looking for.
