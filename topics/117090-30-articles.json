I\u0026#39;ve been pretty generous with my scheduling, so might have some free time in some of the release windows. I\u0026#39;m also getting much faster at many parts of the modeling process (especially texturing), so I might also be able to eek out a little extra time there as well. No promises though.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHow about this... -if- I can finish up the upper-stage stuff before 1.1 is released, I\u0026#39;ll see about spending some time reworking pods / fixing/re-adding Apollo-derived stuff. I was going to do more engines, but... there is only one of me, and only so much time.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[quote name=\u0027blowfish\u0027]It wouldn\u0026#39;t fix any of the issues parachutes have by themselves, but it might be simpler to write a new generic animation module that doesn\u0026#39;t affect drag cubes. Especially for something as simple as a light animation, the module should be pretty short.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYep, and I\u0026#39;ll probably be writing one up anyhow for other unrelated reasons. I think the stock method of unity-created animations is... overkill.. for simple lighting, and intend on doing a fully-procedural mesh-based lighting system very similar to the one used for the engine-emissives. Would add ability to also control a light source/transform, but otherwise the basis would be the same -- using float curves and config parameters to alter the light settings. Allows for faster dev time as I don\u0026#39;t need to muck about with the unity animation system, and also allows for post-compile editing of the lighting animation (a big plus!). Will also allow me to do cool stuff like blinky lights/repeating/reversible light animations... and probably a ton of things that I haven\u0026#39;t even thought up yet :)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo yeah, by the time I get around to reworking existing parts, that likely won\u0026#39;t be too much of a hurdle anymore. Might still implement a custom parachute (or derive a custom one from stock...) to allow better control of multi-cap-single-part parachute setups (if the problems I ran into are still... problems; don\u0026#39;t even remember what they were at this point).\n"},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T02:01:47Z","Content":"\nSo no Apollo CSM? :(\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VenomousRequiem","CreatedById":137373,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T02:06:29Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027davidy12\u0027]So no Apollo CSM? :([/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\nPlease, Shadow? :b\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T02:53:13Z","Content":"\nLoL, do I really need to quote myself?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[quote name=\u0027Shadowmage\u0027]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[...snip...]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHow about this... -if- I can finish up the upper-stage stuff before 1.1 is released, I\u0026#39;ll see about spending some time reworking pods / fixing/re-adding Apollo-derived stuff.

Will likely have a few varieties and sizes available. If RCS is included, they will likely be mounted here (rcs on an upper stage is not for translation, but for rotation, so direct com balance is not needed, and you actually want them as far away from com as possible). Might possibly have a \u0026#39;solid\u0026#39; variant as per the intertank structure.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]Yellow[/B] = Fairings = I\u0026#39;m going to make them auto-size to the bottom node of the part below them / visible size of the part below them / user adjustable height, so the upper stage will provide the fairing for the engine cluster. Will also be adding the ability to set the number of fairing segments in the VAB, where it will auto-switch from \u0026#39;stuck to part below\u0026#39; to \u0026#39;jettison to the sides\u0026#39; (to clean up issues of the upper stage being used above a payload fairing/interstage petal adapter). Might also add an override to the engine cluster to auto-disable its own\u0026#39; fairing if attached to an upper stage (so the user doesn\u0026#39;t have to do it every time).\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]Engines[/B] = bring your own (byoe) (naked/mount-less clusters fully supported)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBoth of these upper stages would be achievable through a single part in the editor (e.g. 2.5m split-tank upper stage part...), and there should be a single part for each upper stage type, per supported stack size.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n(sorry for the terrible lighting, I have no idea how to set blender up to do pure non-directional/unshaded ambient lighting)\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/u9GgOWX.png?1[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/GiOTpnO.png?1[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThese are just a couple of examples.
