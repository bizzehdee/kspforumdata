That when we NEED to go to space, we\u0027ll be lacking the technology if we hold back on it now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I think some or maybe even most of you have gone into a discussion just like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you have any good arguments for space exploration you\u0027d like to share here?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aescwulf","CreatedById":51988,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-09T13:19:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESpace exploration is really important because the Internet , phones etc strive off of satellites being sent to space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will never be able to repair our planet and with every mission into space is a step closer into making space exploration cost effective its like SpaceX rockets only cost a few million dollars compared to the Russian Soyuz costing almost a billion per rocket.
