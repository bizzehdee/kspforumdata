I can also fit the capsule with the ability to perform an ion landing, or possibly just bring a separate ion lander to do Pol and Bop. So, today I decided to work on a transfer stage and Vall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first version of the transfer stage was probably far too big to launch full, and I didn\u0027t at the time try launching it empty. At any rate, the Kerbodyne lifter rocket I built was unable to get it out of the atmosphere. So I used an abort system and returned the capsule to the ground safely. I made the next version smaller, and I\u0027ll probably see if it is capable of the journey closer to the launch window. Otherwise, it\u0027s launching an empty and fueling up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for Vall, I took the first version of my multistage Mun lander (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/29533-What-did-you-do-in-KSP-today?p=1160370#post1160370\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E) and uprated it some. More thrust and fuel on the ascent stage, and the ability to fire the ascent rockets in descent if necessary. Just the lander, of course - the orbiter was not required. The descent and ascent stages have the same amount of thrust here, provided by three Rockomax 24-77s on each. Using just the descent set, the lander is capable of rising on Kerbin a couple of thousand metres, and settling back down safely, so Vall should be relatively trivial, thrustwise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, I made three identical tiny ion lander probes which will double as a mini-transfer stage to get the Vall lander from Laythe orbit to Vall orbit. One of these probes is intended to land on Bop, one on Pol, and one on Vall. The Vall one is... a little debatable. A quick back-of-the-envelope calculation puts the ion lander probe\u0027s TWR at 0.95 when full and at 1.21 when empty, on Vall\u0027s surface. I somewhat doubt that it will be capable of such a feat, but it\u0027s just a probe. The Pol and Bop probe landers are intended to transfer from Vall orbit to Bop and Pol, land and return to Vall, then dock, and help push the ascent stage back to the main capsule. No pictures, unfortunately.

It took so long, because the arm had to be at the right height to allow docking the cargo, and of course a counterweight was necessary as well.
