(and by \u0027decided\u0027 I mean accidentally clicked on) What I found there was pretty cool. There were plenty of ships that didn\u0027t work and were barely half finished. Many of them were something inspired by a craft I saw on the forums, and decided to, quite literally, build on. Many more were things I got frustrated with when they didn\u0027t work, and then abandoned them. With all the new stuff in 1.0 and 1.02, I had entirely forgotten about some of my older crafts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESo my question is this. What are some of your best (or worst) unfinished/old crafts?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t have pics yet, but I had a base that I wanted to put on Duna. Unfortunately, the thing was so heavy that I had to custom build a giant asparagus stage rocket (I usually build non-asparagus lifters) just to get it into orbital height. Then Mechjeb decided to not to boost at apoapsis and it plummeted through the atmosphere as I distractedly read a book \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E I probably should have turned on the sound. The ineptitude is strong with this one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, after that I just forgot about it as it sat in the back of my hanger gathering dust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother design I had was from... .23? .24? I don\u0027t really know. I tried to build a Lear Jet from the old and heavy Mk3 fuselage. It also had only 2 of the weaker jet engines. Plus I was trying to fly it on essentially 2 or so swept wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really should stop talking. I am just going to make myself sound inept.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
