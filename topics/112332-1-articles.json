And once landed, it took grav, pressure, temp, seismic, and material bay readings. The only two scans the mission missed were goo pod on surface (because I goofed and only put 1 pod on it), and mat bay in atmo, because that would have made the ship heavier. Total science 1310, at a mission cost of $102,050. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NJC5RwC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NJC5RwC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T02:35:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow.
