Doing this would then allow calculations about the stresses the connections between parts endure as the thing spins. But the reason this is a problem is that having a higher part count is the LAST thing this game needs. It\u0027s already maxing out what peoples\u0027 PC\u0027s can calculate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order for the physics engine to calculate the strength holding a chunk of material together it has to model the solid object as several separate elements glued together and calculate the stresses on the joins between them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, if you make a rocket body out of several separate tanks around a center, the centrifugal force already IS calculated. To test this use the 4-way splitter connector to make a rocket fuselage out of 4 clustered tanks, then DON\u0027T strut them together, launch and hold \u0022Q\u0022 or \u0022E\u0022 down to spin faster and faster. It actually WILL separate the clustered tanks apart and bust the rocket that way. So the calculations you\u0027re talking about are already handled by the physics engine, BUT the only reason they don\u0027t trigger for central-axis tanks is that the entire tank is just one atomic part in the calculation which is located with center of mass ON the axis of rotation.
