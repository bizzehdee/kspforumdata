Panning to look under the craft doesn\u0027t seem to suffer this problem and works as expected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt \u0027feels\u0027 like the camera is hitting an invisible ceiling so I wondered if that was something to do with the smaller t1 sph, but it happens in sandbox in the fullsize sph. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made a gif (webm) to show the effect;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9436261/camera_pan_bug.webm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9436261/camera_pan_bug.webm\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T16:42:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know exactly what you are talking about and I can confirm that it is intended.
