Much appreciated. I\u0027ll just estimate or calculate things manually for now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile you\u0027re online, I had a quick question about the FAR-\u0026gt;Stock, atmo only setting? I\u0027m using FAR and want to counteract the easier orbiting caused by the reduced drag, but I don\u0027t want to deal with increased fuel requirements in space. I would use the 0.38/1.0 setting, but that seems like it would penalize atmospheric flight a bit much. Since you did the math/testing behind the settings, I thought I\u0027d ask - that 0.38 multiplier only \u0022exactly\u0022 counters the reduced drag when going into orbit, right? Which means that atmo-only flight is heavily penalized compared to stock, right? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you happen to know which multiplier would strike somewhat of a balance between correcting the fuel requirements for orbit, but not penalizing in-atmo planes extensively?

A multiplier of 0.5 means that your DeltaV is halved, because you burn twice as much fuel in the same time, at the same thrust. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Vacuum Isp Multiplier: This is your main reason for using this mod. It dictates the size of your upper stages and the complexity of your landers. Various mods might require various settings, but the best value I\u0027ve found, by eyeballing the DeltaV for various rockets is 0.81 (same as Far To Stock KSP, Universal setting for KIDS). Anything less is game breaking if you plan to use most mods (nevermind trying to land on the Mun in stock career).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Atmo Isp Multiplier: Same as for vaccum, but it only works in atmosphere. This will usually only affect your first stage. On Kerbin, that\u0027s below about 30km. Normally, this value has to be as big, or smaller than the Vacuum value. This is very much up to personal taste and it\u0027s also affected by the next settings. If you don\u0027t enable the thrust settings, a value of 0.61 seems to work nicely. You can easily get an Apollo style rocket that has a 3.75 meter first stage, without the need for any boosters or asparagus. However, if you enable the thrust settings, a value of 0.65 seems to work best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Extend curve to 0 ISP: no harm in leaving it on, it will only affect you if you go into atmosphere heavier than 1atm (Kerbin sea level).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrust varies with ISP: if you don\u0027t use this, thrust and TWR will be the same as stock, both in vaccum and in atmo. If you use it, at sea level, your engine thrust will be multiplied by the Atm Multiplier. So, a setting of 0.5 for that will halve your TWR. Again, this usually affect only your bottom stage. If you don\u0027t use powerful enough engines, you will spend more time below 20km (because your speed raises slower). This means you loose fuel because of more time spent in air friction AND gravity turns are slower AAAND your gimbaling is not as effective anymore so it\u0027s harder to control your rocket during the gravity turn. With FAR, you will usually throttle down your big engines anyway once you reach 200m/s so it\u0027s not THAT bad, the hard part is getting to 200m/s. Normally, even stock 1.25m engines are more than powerful enough to get you off the ground and into orbit. Just use some solid boosters for help. Mods like MechJeb will not show a correct TWR, until you actually launch. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Engine Rating settings: I don\u0027t use these. Unlike the other settings, these don\u0027t make the game harder, but easier. If you don\u0027t use them, all engines will be affected by the \u0022Thrust varies with ISP\u0022 equally. That means that all engines will loose thrust in atmosphere. Why wouldn\u0027t you want that? Well, here\u0027s a reason. What if you want a real replica of the Saturn 5? 5m bottom stage? Well, in that case, a vacuum multiplier of 0.81 would be HUGE, so you\u0027d have to lower it. You might think that the added weight of fuel would not matter so much in vaccum, where TWR is not important. But even the most powerful engines will just cough up and die on the launch pad. The solution? Break up the engines in two categories:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- vaccum rated engines (that have low thrust and high isp) that will continue to work as normal, having reduced thrust in atmosphere and reaching their maximum rated thrust as you pass 30km altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- armo rated engines (hight thrust, low isp) that will start at rated thrust on the launchpad and INCREASE their trust, reaching a new maximum as you pass 30 km altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it stops you from using the KW Vesta VR-1 in your launch asparagus \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo why don\u0027t I use them?

And it\u0027s all because of KIDS and the \u0022Vacuum Isp Multiplier\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, let\u0027s assume that I play in STOCK and the only mod I use is KIDS. I want to crash into the Mun. Whatever rocket I put into orbit, the payload needs a fixed 900 dV to reach the Mun and crash into it. In stock, maybe that\u0027s just a small tank of fuel with a small engine. Simple, light. But if I reduce the Vacuum Isp (and Atm to the same value), I need more fuel to get the same dV in space. That 900dV suddenly requires an extra tank of fuel on my Lunar Impactor XS. So I need to make the payload bigger. That means that I have to put a bigger payload in orbit in the first place. That means an even bigger middle stage, heck, maybe so big that I have to put a more powerful engine in it just to keep my TWR above 1 to be able to circularize before reaching Ap at 70km. That means that my first stage now becomes humongous with the biggest engine that I have, just to get it to 15km. Even so, I might need to put some extra boosters now, pushing my launchpad weight limit to the max, my max parts number beyond max. Even with a seemingly high value of 0.81 for the KIDS multipliers, I\u0027m always barely able to continue in career mode. And I like that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s assume that then I install FAR. The only thing that changes is what happens in the first 30 km or so. Suddenly, my \u0022barely able to reach orbit\u0022 rocket has fuel to spare. Suddenly, I can reduce the size of my first stage, and my second stage (but not my payload). A difference of 5-900dV that FAR saves you means that suddenly your game isn\u0027t \u0022at the edge hard\u0022 anymore.

Methinks you might need to rethink your build or your ascent. Should be able to get about a ton into orbit with a T800/LV-909, a couple 800s and an LV-T30, and then six BACCs staged 4 and then 2. (i.e. first stage 4 BACCs, second stage 2 BACCs, third stage LV-T30, fourth stage LV-909). Maybe you\u0027re playing with ~LOLSOKERBAL~ TWRs?
