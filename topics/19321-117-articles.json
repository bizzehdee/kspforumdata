The Center of Pressure is defined as the point where all the aerodynamic forces act without any extra moments to balance the system; it moves heavily with changes in angle of attack, is harder to use to determine stability and often can take an excursion outside the vehicle due to the moment arm necessary to balance any aerodynamic moments. The Aerodynamic Center / Center of Lift is where the forces can be modeled using forces and a \u003Cem\u003Econstant\u003C/em\u003E moment, and is much easier to use to balance forces.

Here\u0027s one I made for a small rover I built:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VKypAD8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VKypAD8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring reentry testing it flipped itself around nose first, despite me desperately trying to keep it facing heat shield down, once it hit the thicker layers of the atmosphere. As you can imagine, this resulted in Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T22:59:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1.

Otherwise, just try to make sure that the CoM is very, very close to the heat shield so that it\u0027s stable. If you\u0027re doing a skycrane design it might make sense to send it in upside down so that the heavy fuel in the skycrane helps orient it properly, but then you\u0027ll have to bring along drogue chutes and RCS to flip it upright once you ditch the shield. If you\u0027re integrating the landing rockets into the rover, make sure that the fuel tanks are as low to the ground as you can manage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
