The hours and minutes ticked away, and with them departed the last fleeting moments of the Kerbal 17 mission, the final ultimate mission of the Kerbal program, and the culmination of a hectic decade of deep sacrifices, and terrific achievements.

All around him the bright regolith of the munar plain stretched away in stark relief to the perfect blackness of the empty gulf of space that is the munar sky. The silence here is more perfect than the stillest winter day; only the sounds of his suit fans and his own breath reach his ears. Jebediah gazes upwards at the distant blue sphere suspended motionless and beautiful in the all-encompassing darkness, an aqua-marine jewel in contrast to the cold, dry, radiation-blasted magnificent desolation of the Munar surface. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWhat now?

As a secretary led the inconsolate President out, the administrator turned his attention to the huge chalkboard which dominated the office. It was covered in a chaotic tableau of engineering sketches, equations and unrelated doodles. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ahh yes\u0022, he said aloud, \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Integrated Plan\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe basic idea of the Integrated Plan was to develop in parallel a modular and reusable space infrastructure using standardized hardware. Reuse and commonality being the guiding principles/marketing buzzwords of this space infrastructure, the hope is that an infrastructure composed of mass-produced reusable modular elements would have greater economies of scale than one composed of specialized throw-away elements and thus make the program \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153relatively inexpensive\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2. This infrastructure would consist of a fully reusable surface to orbit space shuttle to ferry Kerbalnauts, light cargo and propellant to Low Kerbin Orbit, a large LKO space station with attendant robotic LKO propellant depots, a fleet of robotic space tugs which could do double duty as a Munar Modules, and blutonium powered cis-munar Reusable Nuclear Shuttles for efficiently transferring large cargo payloads to all points in cis-munar space, and eventually to interplanetary space as well. These systems would be designed from the get go with maximum interoperability in mind. Ultimately this space infrastructure would support a Munar Orbit Space Station, a Mun surface base, and manned missions to Duna and perhaps, Jool\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s moon Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update1/nasaNAS9961827165674.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nasaNAS9961827165674.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update1/nasaNAS9961804165651.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nasaNAS9961804165651.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update1/Cargo_transport_from_Space_Shuttle_with_the_space_tug_to_Nuclear_shuttle.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Cargo_transport_from_Space_Shuttle_with_the_space_tug_to_Nuclear_shuttle.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe LKO Space Station is the binding element of the plan, and is its single most critical component. Based on a Standard Space Station Module (SSM), the space station will be of modular construction, this way the space station can be continuously expanded as more and more SSMs are coupled together. The bulk of the orbital assembly will be done by fully autonomous and tele-operated Space Tugs, with some Kerbalnaut EVAs necessary for more dexterous construction work. The long term plan calls for the LKO Space Station to gradually evolve into a large \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Spacebase\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 with living quarters for at least a 12-kerbal crew and an array of general purpose laboratory facilities featuring a sea-level ambient pressure \u0027shirt-sleeve\u0027 atmosphere (though one wonders given even this amenity if the Kerbal astronauts will ever feel comfortable outside of their space suits). There would also be multiple standard docking ports for further expansion of the station, including science, habitation and cargo modules as well as surface-to-orbit and orbit-to-orbit transfer vehicles. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Spacebase\u0027s raison d\u0027\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00AAtre may be vaguely defined, but it would likely include the conduct of microgravity physics and life sciences experiments, astronomy, Kerbin science and weather observation. Freefall and high vacuum conditions would also allow all sorts of neat tricks in manufacturing and materials science; for instance the rapid and inexpensive formation of large single-crystal metals, foamed metals, and thin films of extraordinary quality. You even get levitated induction smelting as a free bonus. The LKO Spacebase would also function as a primary node for the planned deep space network of surface stations and communications relay satellites. It would serve as a logistics base and command center for manned and robotic cis-munar and planetary operations. And naturally the Spacebase would be a platform for spying on the pesky Kermunists. The common SSM design would be reused with some modifications for the future Munar Orbit, and Synchronous Orbit Space Stations, as well as mission modules for planetary missions and as building block for the Munar surface base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Space Station Module and an experimental Space Tug prototype fly on a standard HLV stack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update1/2013-03-08-14-48-13_1.png\u0022 alt=\u00222013-03-08-14-48-13_1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe core of the future space base on orbit.

The engineers had originally envisioned a small orbiter that would ride up to altitude on the back of a huge carrier-jet, before decoupling and burning its own little engine the rest of the way to orbit, but it was decided, in a sudden fit of sanity and good sense, that such an ungainly contraption was too monstrously complicated to safely pilot. After many, many design iterations a hybrid air-breathing scramjet/liquid fueled rocket SSTO space plane concept took shape, though the program was not without casualties. Many persistent design issues plagued the large delta-winged space plane, among them an unstable center-of-lift, a too heavy front end, structural issues, insufficient RCS monopropellant, and that perennial concern of the engineers \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153not enough ram intakes\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2.

With unfortunately high frequency the engineers and test pilots chanted this calming ritual benediction; owing to the alarmingly high rate of fatal testing accidents it seemed as if the fate of the entire Integrated Plan was being called into question. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnter hotshot test pilot Bill \u0022penalty weight\u0022 Kerman. Expertly handling the controls of the experimental Valkyrie Mk3, Bill opened the throttle. Unable to keep up, the escort flight of Aeris 3A chase planes was left behind. Variable geometry inlets engaged the scramjets at Mach 4, powering the Valkyrie shuttle upwards towards space through the quickly rarefying atmosphere with horrifying velocity. Though unoriginally named, the Valkyrie shuttle eventually proved itself to be a capable and reliable design. The Mk3 is highly pitch and yaw stable, has a large delta-v budget for quite muscular orbital rendezvous maneuvers and can reach over 1500m/s on its air breathing engines alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update1/6996760322_5ec5411103_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226996760322_5ec5411103_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update1/original%20%287%29.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022original%20%287%29.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update1/original%20%285%29.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022original%20%285%29.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update1/7142848027_494ea72eb9_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00227142848027_494ea72eb9_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update1/original%20%288%29.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022original%20%288%29.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update1/6996760728_5f560610c3_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226996760728_5f560610c3_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EValkyrie Mk3 Prototype in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update1/2013-03-11-14-19-40_2.png\u0022 alt=\u00222013-03-11-14-19-40_2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update1/2013-03-11-14-19-40_4.png\u0022 alt=\u00222013-03-11-14-19-40_4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update1/2013-03-11-14-19-40_5.png\u0022 alt=\u00222013-03-11-14-19-40_5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Mk3 cockpit interior.

The drone\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s mission would be to cruise at supersonic velocities over kermunist territory at basically tree top height and play obnoxiously loud heavy metal music over loud-speakers, all the while spraying screaming hot fissioning blutonium all over the place and just being generally all-around awesome. Spirits were high at KSC as Project Plutino began accelerating down the runway, nosing up and discarding its SRB trolley. Alas due to a slight design flaw regarding the relative positions of center of lift and center of mass, and also the pathetically insufficient amount of thrust and sea-level specific impulse of the LV-N, the prototype drone entered a high-speed uncontrolled spin, whereupon the atomic motor promptly snapped of the end of the aircraft, the rest of which initiated a rapid unplanned disassembly and descent into the ground. Ultimately, the easily distracted KSC engineers chose not pursue the concept further.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update2/2013-03-17-21-01-27_17.png\u0022 alt=\u00222013-03-17-21-01-27_17.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update2/2013-04-28-13-38-26_4.png\u0022 alt=\u00222013-04-28-13-38-26_4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-06T02:52:15Z\u0022 title=\u002210/06/2013 02:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by architeuthis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"architeuthis","CreatedById":57137,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-27T20:49:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update3/2013-03-24-15-47-53_1.png\u0022 alt=\u00222013-03-24-15-47-53_1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPresently noting the lamentable lack of rockets and rocketry beyond LKO, KSC Mission planners decide the time is ripe indeed to advance to the next stage of the Integrated Program\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s inexorable march of exploration and conquest of trans-Kerbolar space: the long delayed return to the Mun!...Well, sort of.

Basically you pump liquefied molecular propellium through the reactor core, where the awesome might of the atomic fission in its interior heats propellium to indecently high temperatures and it expands outwards through the rocket nozzle at incredible speed. Unlike a chemical rocket there is no oxium reacting with the propellium, so the unreacted propellium keeps its naturally low molecular weight. Why is that important? Recall that heat is just the average kinetic energy of molecules, and in the case of the propellium molecules they have lots of that thanks to the LV-N reactor core.

Or even just transfer fuel from the shuttle or HLV tankers directly? You\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d only need to pump gas once per cycle, which is all the less opportunity for propellium to leak out during transfer.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah sez, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CA depot assuming it is modular and expandable in design can continue to accumulate propellant with launches from Kerbin. In a way it is the crux of the whole reusability shtick the Integrated Plan hinges on. Propellant alone accounts for a small fraction of gross mission costs, but back in the days before docking and proponent transfer had been perfected we had to essentially throw away an entire hideously expensive spacecraft just because it\u0027s gas tank was empty. Nowadays we can we can do the whole space exploration thing allot smarter thanks to infrastructure like these orbital propellant depots. We could in principle still do the \u0027reusability\u0027 thing without the depots but then surface to orbit shuttle flights would become a huge bottleneck.Therefore the advantages of propellant depots are thus: The RNS needs only a single rendezvous to refuel, and it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not constrained by HLV or shuttle launch timetables. This also means the whole operation is less complex and there are fewer issues with nuclear radiation. Additionally, a dedicated propellant depot has the high-mass luxury of fancypants zero-boil off cryogenic refrigerators. Putting those on a RNS would be a little bit like putting a roof mounted bike rack on a Ferrari.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a real trick to long term storage of cryogenic propellium in space. The damn stuff is just so volatile it wants to wiggle its way out through any gasket, tiny crack or seam in the tanks. As we all know, liquid propellant is best stored at 20 K, but due to heat influx the liquid propellium is always slowly boiling away. Boil-off is anywhere between 0.03% loss per Kerbin day (6 hrs), which doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t seem like very much now, but in the long run it really adds up, all the way up to 10% per hour! The standardized modular design for the robotic Orbital Propellant Depot is based around a core Rockomax Jumbo 64 Fuel Tank. The propellant depots are miracles of thermodynamic engineering. A combination of high-tech cryocoolers, plus propellant prechilldown, and space-age multi-layer metalized plastic film insulation\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6and the patented Rockomax Jumbo 64 grape flavored spray-on insulation is used to keep the propellium cryogenically cold and achieve a zero boil-off losses. Prechilldown is a means of taking advantage of the very high specific heat of liquid propellium by cooling it down close to its freezing temperature prior to launch so that it can act as a heat sink. The cryocoolers act to continually recondense the propellium as it evaporates.

But here we must vanquish the problem of \u003Cstrong\u003Eullage stratification\u003C/strong\u003E. Down on Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s surface gravity conveniently makes the propellant puddle at the bottom of the tank where the turbopumps can feed it to the rocket motor, as often seems to be the case, in space it is not so simple. Liquid propellant behaves very differently in free-fall depending on its viscosity and surface tension. In the time that passes between burns the damn stuff might settle over to the to the walls of the tank leaving a large void or gas bubble in the center, or it might ball-up and float away in a random direction. Either way it is very bad if you can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t feed the propellant into your motor, doubly so if you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re working with an atomic rocket, as the propellant also happens to be the reactor coolant. It turns out that this basic problem still applies even if we are only try to \u003Cem\u003Epump\u003C/em\u003E the propellant instead of burning it. Basically the damn propellant is not at all compelled to move through the fuel lines. Gauge pressure within the tank is rather low, so you cannot \u0027suction\u0027 the fuel out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt turns out that there are only a few ways to approach the problem. For instance, you can linearly accelerate by turning the rocket motor on to provide some false gravity. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s definitely the most easy way to settle the propellant down where it belongs, but using this approach for propellant transfer is wasteful, needs a tricky load-bearing hookup for the transfer line, and changes your orbit in unwelcome ways to boot... and in the case of the RNSs you don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t want to light that Jool thrice-cursed nuclear thermal candle any more often than you absolutely have to. For the propellant to properly settle you need around 2E-3 g minimum of linear acceleration, and since the fuel transfer takes quite a while to complete (say 10 hours for this low acceleration... hey we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re working with laughably small fuel lines here... the tyranny of the rocket equation remember?), you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re looking at 700 m/s or so of good propellant being flushed down the toilet. You can land on the Mun with that much delta-v! Since we are in effect moving a whole space station (the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153hot rod\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 RNS plus the propellant depot), 700 m/s is \u003Cstrong\u003Ea lot\u003C/strong\u003E of propellant. Also, we have to do the burn perpendicular to the orbital plane so that we don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t accidentally deorbit or fly off into space. It would be so much easier if the KSC engineers could figure out a way to transfer fuel \u003Cem\u003Enigh-instantaneously\u003C/em\u003E but what can you do huh? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also use a pressure fed system, or one that relies on a mechanically contracted internal bladder, but these systems don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t tend to work very well with ultra-cold cryogenics, or they require infeasibly massive pressure tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively there is dielectrophoresis. Cryogenically cool propellium is a dielectric material, so it can be polarized and repelled by an imposed electric field into a collector. The advantage here is that there are no moving parts and the required machinery is low-mass. Unfortunately it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s incredibly slow. Propellant transfer using dielectrophoresis makes refuelling via linear acceleration seem as quick by comparison as if it was a hyperactive toddler with a fire hose, ADD and too much coffee pumping the propellium... bring a book. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s angular acceleration, wherein you use the RCS to put a spin on the ol\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 can and turn the whole prop tank into a centrifuge essentially, with its inside diameter being made up of a mesh of capillary channels. You get a little dizzy, but it works. In the case of the propellant depots though the axis of symmetry for the depot is not the same as the axes of rotation for the individual prop storage modules, so the propellant is spun on a bearing inside an internal double hull instead. When one of the modules is spun up for transfer or thermodynamic venting the depot would begin to rotate in the opposite direction if not for \u003Cstrong\u003Ea huge moment control gyro\u003C/strong\u003E being used to compensate. No rockets required here but mechanically this is the stuff of engineer\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s darkest nightmares.

For one thing my specific vision is to recreate, with some artistic license, NASA\u0027s 1969 Integrated Program Plan and I want to focus on that. I think it would be really cool if someone else wanted to follow the Soviet side of the alternate history though! Also, I tend to prefer using stock parts (I would love it if squad would add more \u0027soviet\u0027 looking parts to go along with the Stayputnik in future expansions).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said you started me thinking and there were a lot of \u003Cem\u003Eremarkable parallels\u003C/em\u003E between the Soviet Union\u0027s future space vision, if they could be said to have a single one, and NASA\u0027s IPP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe MKBS (Multi-module Cosmic Base Station) was remarkably similar to the NASA space base. It was in the 250-300 tonnes class, with artificial gravity sections and was powered by 2 100kW nuclear reactors mounted on an extensible boom. The NASA Space base would have been a bit bigger; in it\u0027s completed form it could have supported up to 50 astronauts whereas the MKBS, in its most grandiose form, was designed for not more than 30.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESoviet space planning was much less unified and coherent than NASA\u0027s (believe it or not). NASA\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s structure was relatively top-down and centralized, but in Russia by contrast there were a number of competing design bureaus effectively each persuing their own independent space programs. The MKBS was part of the MOK (Multi-module Orbital Complex) which was an \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153integrated plan\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 of sorts for a low-earth orbital infrastructure. It was the brainchild of the OKB-1/Korolev/Energyia bureau.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe MKBS was to be serviced by a fully reusable space plane. As originally envisioned this was to be a SSTO derived from N1 first stage if you can believe that, but the Soviets were also developing multi-stage carrier-space planes similar to those initially planned by NASA, though their program started somewhat later. Of course after the demise of the N1, there was the Buran/Energyia program which got going a few years after the Space Shuttle.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe MOK also called for an autonomous manned station in geosynchronous orbit similar to the IPP.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe Russians essentially ceded the Moon and cis-lunar space to NASA by 1972 (ironically right as the Apollo program was ending), and chose to focus on LEO instead. As a consequence they racked up much more substantial achievements in the realm of space stations than NASA did. However they did have some plans for manned Mars missions. The MEK (1969) mission design used nuclear-electric propulsion rather than an NTR as in NASA\u0027s plan. Of all the Soviet plans this was the best developed.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThere was also the MK-700 Aelita Mars mission design (1972) which used a NERVA style solid-core NTR. While not as far advanced as the Project Rover precursors to NERVA, the Soviets were able to complete some working hardware such as the RD-0410. They ever were in the preliminary stages of desinging a gas core NTR with isp in the 2000 seconds range. Again, as with space planes, Soviet technological development in this lagged behind NASA\u0027s. When it was determined that the Americans wouldn\u0027t be going to Mars after all Soviet funding for NTR also dried up.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThere were several competing architectures for Moon bases. There was Barmin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s DLB or \u0027Barminograd\u0027 which was based around the L3 spacecraft (the Soviet moon lander), but it was nevertheless a flight of fancy, even in comparison to the other bold space plans of the day. Chelomei\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s KLE Lunar base would have used the UR-700 super booster instead of Korolev\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s N1, but work stopped on this rocket when it became obvious that the moon race was lost. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAccording to the plan there was even a modified Soyuz 7K with robotic manipulator arms to serve as a Space Tug for the MKBS (though it was not built to double as a Lunar lander like NASA\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s space tug).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAs a whole the MOK was not as ambitious as NASA\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s 1969 IPP. Like the IPP some elements of the plan ultimately did see the light of day (Soyuz, Progress, and Mir were the legacy of this plan, just as the Space Shuttle, and arguably, the ISS were of the IPP).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMost of the Soviet plans rested on the N1 HLV, which being perhaps the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153most kerbal\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 rocket ever built, never actually made it to space in real life (but it \u003Cem\u003Edid\u003C/em\u003E manage to create the largest artificial non-nuclear fireball in human history; 6.5 kt of TNT equivalent). Therefore most of these plans met their end with the last N1 in 1974. In comparison Nixon, and the apathetic American public, had quitely strangled the IPP by 1972.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/18a-2_bolsh-stan_corr.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002218a-2_bolsh-stan_corr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/410.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022410.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-08T18:08:41Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2013 06:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by architeuthis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-01T22:13:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI remembered this one from before the crash.

From the general pandemonium which immediately ensued the double threat Pilgrim 2 orbiter/ Ragamuffin propulsively landed surface rover was the final product. Pilgrim 2 was actually not the first probe to visit Duna, as the lovingly named Vermilion Varmint probe which somebody had assembled out of duct tape and beer cans captured that honor a year earlier. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPilgrim 2\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s mission objective, besides being a golden opportunity to play with what is in essence a billion credit RC miniature-truck, was to search for clues to the presence of life on Duna past or present. This search yielded inconclusive results. But it was not without a herculean effort! Precautions had to be taken to prevent the spacecraft from carrying a cargo of microbial invaders from the planet Kerbin that might unintentionally contaminate the red planet. Prelaunch everything was carefully UV sterilized, and the engineers even took extra special care to not let anything untoward grow in the office fridge, as is usually wont to happen. After encountering Duna, aerocapture and braking took 7 orbits over roughly 5 days. The lander did a deorbit burn, discarded its heat shield and opened its parachute, but over eager mission controllers, in spite of the 12-second light speed delay, had been repeatedly mashing the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153cut chute button\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 at mission control. Suddenly chuteless, and still several hundred meters up, the terminal descent retrorockets fired, but having only 3 seconds of fuel at full thrust, what occurred was an accidentally textbook suicide burn. That Ragamuffin survived its landing, being the cobbled together rush job that it is, is frankly something of a miracle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExploring Duna takes teamwork; trying to optimize mass to the surface, engineers decided that instead of making a heavy and power hungry high-gain antenna required for direct communication with KSC integral to the rover, that the rover would instead depend on the orbiter for support. The Pilgrim 2 orbiter acts as a mothership for Ragamuffin and as a comms relay with Kerbin. Ragamuffin has a UHF transmitter and omni-directional antenna for downloading telemetry data to the orbiter, which then beams it back to the Spacebase, its relay satellites in LKO, and the big tracking stations on Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s surface. The Pilgrim 2 orbiter features an ultra-high bandwidth data rate: 1000 bits per second at opposition! Ragamuffin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s central computer \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153sleeps\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 during the nights, because damnit its tired after a long day of space exploration, and also to help conserve power for keeping the critical heating elements alive that warm the rover during the long, frigid Dunan nights. The little rover would likely perish trying to weather a Dunan dust storm, however, should one arise. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna has so many anomalous features. A chain of what appear to be small impact craters lie centered on a great north-south axis canyon and its web of vein like channels and arroyos. Are they relics of an ancient orbital carpet bombing by fragments of a comet? What formed the datum maria, are they ancient seabeds dry for a billion years? By the fact that the datum maria have so few impact craters they must be extraordinary young by geological standards. Perhaps only 100 million year ago or so Duna had cold, sparkling oceans of its own. What caused them to dry up? Due to its small mass, Duna has a low escape velocity which makes it difficult for the red world to retain much thickness to its atmosphere. Given the low atmospheric pressures scientists had imagined that the Dunan sky would appear black or perhaps deep blue, but surprisingly the sky has a pink hue. It is thought that this is caused by extremely fine dusts suspended in the upper atmosphere. The orbiter\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s first impression of Duna was of a heavily cratered world, implying the world has been geologically dead for eons and that the rusty surface rocks are incredibly ancient, perhaps going back nearly to the original formation of the red world. Duna\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s moon Ike by contrast is odd in that it has so very few impact craters. More tests are needed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERagamuffin is currently investigating a medium sized crater near Duna\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s North Pole, while Pilgrim 2 is currently walkabout visiting Ike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update6/6002624311_c12db64ae7_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226002624311_c12db64ae7_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update6/6002621469_8576e1e4bb_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226002621469_8576e1e4bb_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update6/2013-05-05-17-22-48_7.png\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-05-17-22-48_7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update6/2013-05-05-21-14-42_6.png\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-05-21-14-42_6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update6/2013-05-05-21-14-42_8.png\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-05-21-14-42_8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update6/2013-05-05-21-14-42_9.png\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-05-21-14-42_9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update6/2013-05-05-21-14-42_11.png\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-05-21-14-42_11.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update6/2013-05-06-10-58-31_5.png\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-06-10-58-31_5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update6/2013-05-06-10-58-31_8.png\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-06-10-58-31_8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update6/2013-05-11-23-04-28_9.png\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-11-23-04-28_9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update6/2013-05-06-16-20-16_3.png\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-06-16-20-16_3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update6/2013-05-06-19-17-03_4.png\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-06-19-17-03_4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update6/2013-05-06-19-17-03_10.png\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-06-19-17-03_10.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update6/2013-05-06-19-17-03_15.png\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-06-19-17-03_15.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update6/2013-05-06-19-17-03_34.png\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-06-19-17-03_34.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update6/2013-05-08-20-04-13_3.png\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-08-20-04-13_3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update6/2013-05-08-20-04-13_14.png\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-08-20-04-13_14.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Vagabond 1 spacecraft was a Jool Flyby and Laythe Orbiter. This was the first mission launched of the robotic precursor program and among the last to arrive at its destination. The Space Tug booster did not have enough delta-v to return to Kerbins SOI and so it was expended for this mission. With its propellant tanks empty the poor workhorse was left to silently sail away from Kerbin into a lonely Kerbolorcentric orbit, there to remain... forever. This mission suffered from a regrettable series of poor design decisions. Because of the position of the docking ring fairing that Vagabond 1 required to mate with its Valkyrie shuttle and Space Tug carrier craft the maneuvering engine could not be placed along the main axis of the spacecraft. Instead the motor was mounted radially, and the heavy boom mounted RTG powerplant positioned to balance the center of mass. Nevertheless the thrust vector still ended up located along a line of action not passing though the center of mass, and this made the vehicle want to tumble wildly under thrust. Additionally the maneuvering engine\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s asymmetry with respect to the probe core made for very problematic navball references. Several harrowing mid-course corrections were required since the Vagabond 1 had to \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153eyeball\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 a star as a fixed point of reference for the probe core and then rotate with respect to it until the engine was pointed in the correct position. With the aforementioned torque acting on spacecraft, the difficulty of maintaining attitude during a burn without even the help of useful navball was basically a nightmare. Though solar power would have been technically more efficient for this mission, the RTG was brought along just to be safe (engineers can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t shake their primitive superstitions that solar insolation should drop exponentially with distance from Kerbol rather than linearly as has been repeatedly determined by experiment).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJool is an incredibly alien object compared to more familiar rocky planets like Kerbin or Duna. The world is humongous: it holds 100 times the enclosed volume of Kerbin, and it exceeds the combined mass of every other body in the system by a factor of 16. It reigns over a solar system in miniature; several of its myriad of satellites rival Kerbal itself in size. Its dark and hugely turbulent atmosphere flows in an unending gale of slipstream velocities, plunging to murky depths truly unfathomable to the merely Kerbal mind. It is difficult not to wonder whether there is even any solid surface at all under those cold green clouds. Scientific instruments were unable to directly measure the temperature of the giant planet, but a value of between 30-80K has been estimated for the upper clouds based on the supposition that Jool\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s escape velocity must greatly exceed the rms speed of gaseous propellium (which is believed to make up the bulk of the titanic green world\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s mass) for the planet to not gradually boil off its atmosphere. It is thought that far below the outer layers of green chlorine\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 ...uh\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6chlorineium clouds, there exists a shell of metallic propellium congealed around a small core of incredibly dense exotic matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe light-speed lag problem compelled the engineers to push a number of technological envelopes for this mission. Unlike rudimentary self-test and repair electronic circuits used on previous missions, Vagabond 1 features a digital microcomputer, with a \u003Cstrong\u003Efull 10kB\u003C/strong\u003E of memory! These truly automatic probes will be able to \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153think for themselves\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2. Naturally, appropriate precautions are being taken to prevent a revolt of the robots against the {harsh taskmasters} REDACTED enlightened benefactors of KSC mission control. Considering the lengthy Jool transit time (229 days) the microcomputer will come with solitaire preinstalled to help it cope with the boredom. Telemetry is transmitted and command uplink is received via a 1-meter X-band high-gain paraboloid; it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s almost big enough to get signal on your TV antenna back home on Kerbin! Actually no, don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t get excited, the last sentence was a lie. Vagabond 1\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s onboard thermoelectric nuclear power provides about as much power to the communications system as is needed to light a small lightbulb: 20W. At Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s distance from Jool, the power flux density from Vagabond 1\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s transmissions is only 1.13E-18 W/m^2. If you had a parabolic dish the size of Kerbin itself it would take 82 years to accumulate the energy of released by a single burning match (it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s amusing to imagine a world sized antenna dish all wired up to a solitary AA battery). Therefore a phased array receiver equivalent to a 28 meter diameter parabolic antenna is required for good telemetry. The KSC engineers were heartbroken to discover that they couldn\u0027t use the dish to steal the Kermunists\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s wifi.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal scientists were quite curious to study Jool\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s hypothesized magnetic field and trapped radiation belts. It is thought that Foucault currents within the metallic propellium core of the world power a terrifically strong magnetic field which traps charged particles from Kerbol. Trapped, these cosmic rays clang around, tirelessly ricocheting of the interior of the great magnetic field and presenting a major radiation hazard to any would be gallant space explorers flying close by to Jool to aerobrake.

We must feel some regret at the peril facing Vagabond 1: 54 million kilometers from home, alone but for a great and horribly ancient entity, a god who though totally ambivalent to the probe\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s tiny existence, the merest lingering proximity to whom is death.

Transit time for the Hohmann transfer was 323 days. Questions regarding the distant, Kerbol forlorn snowball abounded. Is Eeloo an escaped moon of Jool? Given its eccentric orbit does Eeloo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s albedo change as it swings by its closest approach to Kerbol produce a fleeting tenuous atmosphere? Also, how to explain Eeloo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s relatively large size; is it representative of the dark shroud of icy worlds though to exist far beyond Jool\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s orbit? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat made this mission unique was its pioneering use of a 2-stage \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153mostly reusable\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 mission design. Two Space Tugs are used in this mission profile. The 1st Space Tug in the stack burns till it has just enough delta-v left to return to LKO, whereupon explosive bolts on the launch separation fairing are fired and the tug burns retrograde back to Kerbin while the 2nd-stage tug continues the burn prograde. When the desired transfer orbit is achieved, the 2nd tug demates from the probe, which is left to continue on its merry way, while it follows its sibling down a long elliptic back to the homeworld. Compared to the Vagabond 1 Jool flyby, this mission profile expends roughly twice as much propellant but this is compensated by the fact that all of the Space Tugs were recovered to be reused another day, and we all know how important this reusability shtick is to the Integrated Plan. Frankly KSC engineers are baffled that this maneuver works without the tugs possessing a dedicated heat shield, but it is speculated that should a Kerbin aerocapture ever prove infeasible for some reason, a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153hot-rod\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 RNS could rescue a Space Tug stranded in a highly eccentric Kerbin orbit, though it is currently unknown how economical that this procedure would be. Mission planners are hoping to use this style of mission architecture as inspiration for a much larger scale manned planetary mission to Duna featuring outboard flyback RNS kick stages. After the Eeloo encounter flight controllers initiated a bi-elliptic sundive transfer which utterly fried all of the delicate deep-cold adapted instruments. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CUhhh\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6why were we thinking that would be awesome again?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 On the bright side\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 literally\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 the spacecraft reached a velocity of 28 km/s at periapse as it swung by Kerbol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update6/2013-05-05-17-22-48_2.png\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-05-17-22-48_2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update6/2013-05-11-16-04-25_4.png\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-11-16-04-25_4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update6/2013-05-11-16-04-25_6.png\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-11-16-04-25_6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update6/2013-05-11-16-04-25_7.png\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-11-16-04-25_7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update6/2013-05-11-16-04-25_11.png\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-11-16-04-25_11.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update6/2013-05-11-16-04-25_14.png\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-11-16-04-25_14.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update6/2013-05-12-13-17-05_18.png\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-12-13-17-05_18.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to confusing mission naming conventions, Pilgrim 1 actually launched later than Pilgrim 2.

Eve is a world wreathed in enigma. Since the dawn of time Kerbals have gazed upon that bright morning star and wondered. Was Eve a sweltering, humid hothouse of continent swathing tropical rainforest and swamp? Was it a boiling hellhole crushed under the tremendous pressure of a world\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s worth of evaporated oceans? Well, neither it turns out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve is a deep indigo marble covered with what look like seas of liquid metal. This makes the planets lack of clouds easier to explain considering the lack of water oceans; given Eve\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s relatively rapid rotation it was posited the world would poses a magnetic field that would keep atmospheric water from being ionized and blown away by Kerbol\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s wind. But the shining metal oceans are tantalizing to say the least. Some have suggested that oceans are composed of molten blutonium. If this is true it means not only that you probably wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t want to let the kiddies swim in it, but that the whole damn planet of Eve would be in essence one huge nuclear reactor!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s atmosphere, while dense, appears to be composed of inert gases, which sadly means no flying around with air breathing engines for future Kerbalnauts, unless the greatly missed Project Plutino nuclear-ramjet blueprints are retrieved from whichever Tartaruian hellwell an intern errantly tossed them in. The inert atmosphere also renders difficult an explanation of Eve\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s perplexing purple color; afterall it might have been expediently explained as a result of some strange oxidization chemistry. Given the multitudes of organic chemical reactions that can produce a purple color, planetary scientists are very anxious for a follow up mission to include a surface probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update6/2013-05-11-16-04-25_24.png\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-11-16-04-25_24.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt any rate Pilgrim 1 continued on to flyby sunblasted Moho. With the unprecedentedly low mission perkerbolion, of 0.38 KU, the spacecraft design had to somehow deal with the solar heating problem. Because the intense radiant energy flux from Kerbol at Moho\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s orbit, the number of solar arrays needed (in theory) was one half to one eighth of those required at Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s orbit, but due to the questionable literacy of some of the engineers at KSC engineers the design requirements documentation was read upside down and double the number of arrays was installed instead\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 \u003Cem\u003Ewhoops\u003C/em\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo keep the heat from building up to intolerably high levels, the spacecraft was spin-stabilized such that its spin axis remains normal to the plane of the solar elliptic and therefore the solar panels present the smallest angle to Kerbol. Thanks to the magic of angular momentum, the spin stabilization would also help keep small torques from throwing off the probes attitude. That was the idea anyway, but unfortunately it was realized rather late that the solar panels rotate on bearings, utterly defeating this plan. Ah well. Anyway, for good measure any reasonably useful scientific instruments such as spectrometers, or magnometers were left at home as well, as is now the custom. Not even a proper telescope, alas. It does turn out that Moho is not tidally locked to Kerbol after all, so there is one mystery solved, though it does have very long days: only 1.3 of them in its whole year.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update6/4211h.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224211h.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update6/2013-05-11-23-04-28_11.png\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-11-23-04-28_11.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update6/2013-05-11-23-04-28_14.png\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-11-23-04-28_14.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat does the future hold for robotic precursor missions?

The Space Tug was one of the last of NASA\u0027s Integrated Plan (IPP) schemes to die, the last design document I can find for it is dated 1975, but I don\u0027t think they fully gave up on the idea until the Challenger explosion in 1986 (of course the design by then had transformed into the somewhat smaller OMV). Anyway the specs were pretty consistent from 1969 to 1975 and between the different bids put in by the big aerospace corporations; 29500 kg gross weight (the design constraint here was the assumed maximum payload of the Space Shuttle at the time), 3000 kg burn out weight and 1400 kg payload (delivered to \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E returned from synchronous orbit to 185 km 28.5 degree inclination standard low Earth orbit) gives a propellant mass fraction of .9 (sans payload) and R=6.7 with payload included. Even in 1969 design specs called for the airframe to be constructed of space-age graphite-epoxy composite. One RL-10 derived motor with a specific impulse of 470 s gave the tug a maximum of 8773 m/s of delta-v, a requirement which was defined by the synchronous orbit mission. The Space Tug, in essentially the same configuration, would have been used for Lunar surface sorties, though the documentation for that is somewhat confusing... because NASA realistically expected the Tug would mostly be used for moving satellites to synchronous orbit, the level of serious inquiry into the Lunar mission role was at a substantially lesser lever than that of the synchronous mission mode. The first designs were an in-house NASA space tug and one designed by North American Rockwell. After the demise of the IPP General Dynamics, Boeing, McDonnell Douglass and Martin Marietta submitted bids, and though the lunar lander mission was kaput the overall design specifications remained very similar to the IPP era ones, particularly in terms of mass fraction, wet mass and specific impulse. Some of the IPP documents assumed a mass fraction of .8 whereas other assumed .85 or .9. The is a lot of variability in the payload to lunar surface numbers, because of sensitivity to the assumed mass fraction. Also the Space Shuttle ended up actually being a bit more powerful than originally assumed in 1969; the big bird was theoretically capable of hauling 65,000 lb payload gross weight, so the later tug designs are a bit heavier than the IPP era ones which had assumed a somewhat smaller orbiter. The lunar mission profile would have the tug Hohmann transfer from a 111.2 km circular orbit (60 n.m., the orbit of the Orbiting Lunar Station) down to about 15 km above the Lunar surface before burning off its tangential velocity. This mission profile was very similar to the one used by the LM for the Apollo missions, which is why the Space Tug was fittingly also referred to as the LM-B. One RL-10 only gives enough thrust for a \u0027lithobraked\u0027 terminal descent mode, so with additional motors added (4 in total), plus the requisite landing gear it is likely that a Lunar Space Tug would have a lower mass fraction than the .9 NASA doggedly insisted upon. This mission requires about 2200 m/s delta-v and so the we get a mass ratio of R=1.6. If we reserve enough propellant for the Space Tug to return and rendezvous with the OLS, unless I\u0027ve fubar\u0027d the algebra (certainly a possibility), then this would\u0027ve enabled the Space Tug/LM-B to bring 38,500 kg of cargo down to the lunar surface, which is in the specification range examined by Bellcom in 1971. The NA Rockwell designs would have had disposable propellant drop-tanks to enable an even heavier payload capacity. If we assume the more conservative numbers (\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00BB=0.8, Isp=460) we end up getting a surface payload of 17,200 kg for the unmanned tug (with 2900 kg propellant reserved for the return trip), or 12,000 kg for a tug with a 3200 kg crew module (and 4900 kg reserved propellant).

The new design will make use of the newly introduced Clamp-O-Tron Sr. as well as the PPD-12 Cupola Module with the core being made up of standardized SSM modules. The Clamp-O-Tron Sr. allows for a substantially more rigid docking of the large 2.5m SSMs enabling a truly modular approach to space station design. As equipment becomes obsolete entire modules can be straightforwardly replaced by shiny new ones shipped up from Kerbin. Thus the Spacebase can constantly renew itself rather than being deorbited wholesale when is approaches the limit of its service life. Also should lawmakers ever find a way to throw off the budgetary shackles of the space program, a modular system is an inherently more fiscally flexible one. This new Spacebase will feature downright swanky accommodations for up to 38 Kerbal astronauts. There will also be two sets of docking trusses for free-flying experiment modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update7/6996813872_0a85c871d2_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226996813872_0a85c871d2_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update7/stateroom.png\u0022 alt=\u0022stateroom.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Cupola modules will take advantage of the Spacebase\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s scenic new 190 km orbit. In theory this will also mitigate the heretofore unobserved effects of atomic oxium corrosion, and atmospheric drag on the space station. These KSC engineers are a superstitious lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the announcement of the new project the ever persistent din of demands for artificial gravity is again heard. Though scientists would prefer pure free fall for their experiments, to placate the artificial gravity zealots the new Spacebase will be built around a central hub with RCS thruster ports positioned such that they can spin the station about its long axis. Concerns regarding the vexing lack of bearings which would allow the habitation modules to be spun independently of the hub were brushed aside. Ideally the hub would be non-rotating for ease of docking, and the furthering of zero-g science. With the station rotating at 4.5 rpm, the centrifugal acceleration at the ends of the roughly 13m long attached Cupola and Hab modules is enough to simulate gravitational acceleration of 2.94 m/s^2 : Duna\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s surface gravity.

The KSC experimental physics lab\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s ongoing experiments with time acceleration leave the potential station inhabitants with a feeling of unease however. Perhaps unease is too modest a word. Basically, the instantaneous angular deceleration which must occur when the Spacebase ceases spinning stokes primal fears in the Kerbal astronauts of horribly grisly blood splattered death on the interior walls of the SSMs. Again, primitive superstitions die hard. Regardless, scientists have not detected any adverse biological effects on the body of the Kerbal astronaut due to prolonged stays in a zero G environment, so perhaps this particular experiment can wait\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 for now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngineers were initially divided between two alternative space station designs. One was for a high-power station with four nuclear power systems mounted on two booms and a single large hab module whereas the other would have a much longer zero-g core section for experiments and manufacturing activities as well as at least four hab modules with artificial gravity. Eventually the quandary was resolved in favor of the second camp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update7/spacebase2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022spacebase2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update7/5975604935_3d222a51a9_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225975604935_3d222a51a9_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update7/ss_variants.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ss_variants.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update7/shuttle_ssm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022shuttle_ssm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update7/space_base.png\u0022 alt=\u0022space_base.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update7/sb50md.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022sb50md.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update7/power_module_config.png\u0022 alt=\u0022power_module_config.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67872682/KSP/Update7/program_interface.png\u0022 alt=\u0022program_interface.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to provide adequate power this expanded Spacebase? Well, nukes naturally. Was that really a question? And we are not talking about scrawny little RTGs here either, but honest to Heinlein Space Nuclear Reactors. Nuclear has big advantages over solar for space applications: it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s potentially scalable to very high power outputs drastically above what\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s practically achievable with solar, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not dependent on Kerbol-angle or occultation period, and it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not degraded by trapped Van Allen or solar radiation. The real question here is what type of electrical conversion process to use. Heat pipe thermoelectrics, the Brayton cycle and thermionics all appear to be contenders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the thermoelectric approach heat pipes are used to extract thermal energy from the core and transport it to electrical conversion equipment. The heat pipe is a tube containing a working fluid that is vaporized in the heated end and liquid at the electrical converter end. A wick in the flow path along the tube wall returns the liquid by capillary action to the reactor. Thermoelectrics at the end of the heat pipes generate electricity on the same principle as the venerable RTG. Additional heat pipes form radiator panels which remove waste heat from the electrical converters. This reactor architecture requires no moving parts, but thermoelectric generators have laughably low efficiency and generally do not scale well. You wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t want to use these for your multi-megawatt ion drive Duna missions, and for similar reasons the KSC brass refuses to consider the technology for the Integrated Program on grounds of that most hallowed of guiding principles: \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153moar power\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext up are thermionics. In a thermionic reactor electrical power is produced by direct conversion of heat to electricity, essentially by boiling electrons from a hot cathode surface to a cooler anode collector surface. Since this is technically a heat engine it is limited to something below Carnot efficiency but it is still substantially better off than a thermoelectric generator. Other advantages to this approach are that they work at much higher temperatures than thermoelectrics, they are compact and they don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have pesky to maintain moving parts. High temperature radiators with eutectic NaK liquid metal working fluid are required to remove the large amounts of waste heat generated by the reactor. But there are a couple of problems with thermionics. One is that if your thermionic cells are interior to the reactor the then they tend to become embrittled by neutron flux. Also the heat may cause warping in the gap between electrodes; you can avoid this by cladding the surfaces with refractory materials but then you pay a penalty in voltage. Another issue is that it is difficult on general principle to wrangle both high current and high voltage out of thermionics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly there is the Brayton cycle. Similar to the more well known Rankine cycle, in the Brayton cycle a working fluid is driven through an adiabatic compressor to the reactor which heats it. The single-phase working fluid is free to flow so the heating in the reactor is a constant pressure process. The heated high pressure working fluid drives a turbine before being run through a heat exchanger to discharge waste heat. The Brayton cycle has higher efficiencies by far than either thermionics or thermoelectric generators but vibrations from the compressor and turbine may ruin your fragile zero-g science experiments. Alas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause it is difficult for a space station to maintain a constant aspect with respect to many orbiting bodies at once (Docking ships, distant satellites, free floating experiment modules, EVA\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d Kerbals, etc.) the reactor will need a big side shield in addition to the requisite shadow shield. Lithium hydride is used for neutron attenuation and tungsten for gamma attenuation. But who\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s afraid of a little radiation?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engineer\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s endearing enthusiasm for nuclear power aside, research is still ongoing into space nuclear power, and alas the technology remains immature. Therefore the Spacebase will be powered by an array of 8 RTGs producing less than 2kW electric in total, with the SSM core\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Gigantor solar array on hand for auxiliary power.
