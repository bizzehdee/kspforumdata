Cause id really like to play the game with these things enabled, but i dont want to have to hack funds and science in career to get access to these abilities. My KSP heavily focused on combat between factions, something that is just completely against science and career modes, so what id love is sandbox with extra optiuons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeck, what id ideally want is a career style game, but without any funds or science to bother with, allow the RND center, contracts, ect, just with no funds at all. Is something like this doable? Is there a mod? Cause if so id love to enable all the crew xp and stuff without the bother of funds or science collection (how am i supposed to make capital ships to shoot at without at least 50% of the tech tree unlocked lol.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-25T20:21:55Z\u0022 title=\u002208/25/2015 08:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"windows_x_seven","CreatedById":112926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T20:13:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/128800-K100-Completed-Tech-Tree-Save-Funds\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDownload this\u003C/a\u003E.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T20:21:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThats a good temporary solution, ill jsut hack myself all the funds i feel like (since capital ships get expensive!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts just sad that squad added all this stuff, only to make it only work with career mode, they really shouldve given us a difficulty option on start, say do you want probes limited by their stats (as in not all have autopilot modes enabled), do you want kerbals limited by XP and or roles? ect. That really should have been a difficulty thing, as i can also see the opposite opinion, someone wants to play career but without these limits.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Peppe","CreatedById":51446,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T23:11:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like this mod to remove tech tree from career mode, but have the experience, contracts, money:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETree Toppler\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-05-04T15:36:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2021 03:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Snark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ELink to defunct website removed by moderator\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
