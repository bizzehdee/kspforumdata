I fixed the aforementioned problem, as you can see.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs per usual, politics should be kept out of the comments as much as is possible without impeding proper discussion. Discussing things like how certain countries could employ AI as a weapon against, say, the US, is not for this thread. Discussing how AI itself could take over the \u0027certain countries,\u0027 the US, and the rest of the world \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E, however.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I say \u0027take over\u0027 with the broadest range of possible interpretations. Whether this relates to the field of medicine and how machine learning could revolutionize diagnostics and treatments, or how AI could in some way solve all our problems and usher in the technological singularity.....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell. That\u0027s up to you.

There\u0027s a point where machine learning will get so advanced that it will inevitably outrun human intelligence and our capacity to learn. Assuming that all goes well from that point on (and we don\u0027t all die), the AI would presumably grant us access to unbelievable quantities of knowledge, and with great depth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat may sound utopian, but I personally feel like we should not make something that will then out-compete us in every single aspect of our lives, only to turn around at the epitome/ pinnacle, build us some steps, and glide us over to where it\u0027s at. And by that I mean that I don\u0027t think AI should solve our problems for us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure, it has a great many beneficial applications in many fields, but I think we should push the frontiers of knowledge and technological advancement through actual human intellect, not because we made something that ran ahead and granted it to us for free.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my (very very humble) opinion, AI should be used to make the most of what we already to know - to improve on existing processes and boost efficiency, but not to solve the things we are still pushing for as a species.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat, I think, we should do collectively, as humanity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-09-16T20:25:16Z\u0022 title=\u002209/16/2018 08:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 16, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Earthlinger\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HansonKerman","CreatedById":185809,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-16T20:55:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Lucida Sans Unicode\u0027, \u0027Lucida Grande\u0027, sans-serif;\u0022\u003EI support this, and I think that yes, AI shouldn\u0027t be overtaking us, but they would make nice\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cfont face=\u0022Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Grande, sans-serif\u0022\u003Eresearch tools.\u003C/font\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cfont face=\u0022Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Grande, sans-serif\u0022\u003E\u0022\u003Cem\u003Ech-ch this is Mimas (\u003C/em\u003Enot Minmus)\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EExplorer 12-Q2 reporting, we\u0027ve found \u0026lt;\u003C/em\u003Einsert stuff here\u0026gt; \u003Ci\u003Ehere,\u00A0patching it i-\u0022\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cfont face=\u0022Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Grande, sans-serif\u0022\u003E\u003Ci\u003EAnd at that moment, the probe\u0027s antenna cracked from a large hill that it crashed into\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"0111narwhalz","CreatedById":110660,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-16T22:11:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that, while AI safety is a very important subject, \u0022AI being better people than we are\u0022 is not a failure mode.

Only dedicated AI on a supercomputer could get to that extreme point, but even then, more processing power doesn\u0027t mean higher intelligence, let alone godlike intelligence; and you will almost certainly get diminishing returns after awhile. So they\u0027d be lugging around wasted space for a long time just... figuring stuff out. I don\u0027t think they would want that, since I presume they have sapience. And with that, all the bells, whistles, and existential crisis\u0027s prevalent in our budding species.

Initially, it \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E be representative of humans because humans directly made it, but the moment it starts to surpass what we can do and have done, it becomes a separate entity, and it loses representative status. Once it sets off on a runaway quest of self-improvement, we as a race no longer influence what it does. Will any prodigies and geniuses that would ordinarily revolutionize their fields be relevant or significant to human advancement if a machine is already doing what they do, and better? Not really.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImagine it like a bar jump.

The suit is simply making things easier, more efficient; faster.

We have technology and don\u0027t know how it works. Just because this trend would continue with AI doesn\u0027t mean much. It\u0027s already happening, for better or worse. For example, how many people actually do anything with relativity? Or quantum physics? A lot of people are involved, but compared to the total population it\u0027s a small number of people. Another, more ubiquitous example would be computers. Hundreds of millions, if not billions, of people use computers. But how many of them could actually build a computer? Sure, a decent number of them may know what computers are and have knowledge of how they generally work, but so few have the skills required that there is already a disconnect between most humans and the humans that create technology.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223452791\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022178346\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221537204632\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022166940\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Earthlinger\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Earthlinger said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E(Philosophical rant below)\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition, I think comparing scientists and engineers to an AI is a bit skewed. Today\u0027s scientists and engineers are representative of humanity because they \u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E humanity, and while an AI can be made to mimic that humanity to the point that it\u0027s practically indistinguishable (and far superior), it won\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Ebe\u003C/em\u003E human.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery innovator, designer, inventor and thinker of human history has defined that history, and by consequence they have defined the human race.

Initially, it \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E be representative of humans because humans directly made it, but the moment it starts to surpass what we can do and have done, it becomes a separate entity, and it loses representative status. Once it sets off on a runaway quest of self-improvement, we as a race no longer influence what it does. Will any prodigies and geniuses that would ordinarily revolutionize their fields be relevant or significant to human advancement if a machine is already doing what they do, and better? Not really.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImagine it like a bar jump.
