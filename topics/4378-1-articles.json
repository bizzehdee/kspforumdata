I just finished this amazing book series by Joe Haldeman (author of the Forever War, and if you haven\\\u0027t heard of that book it is definitely worth checking out as well). Basically it is about a girl who discovers life on mars by happenstance and this has far reaching consequences for the rest of humanity. It is interesting to explore these consequences in detail but there is still plenty of mystery and a very gripping character drama.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\\\u0027re interested, it\\\u0027s called Marsbound, and it is part of a recently finished trilogy containing the books Starbound and Earthbound. The reason I am mentioning it is because I really appreciate good science fiction and I wish there were someone out there who had told me this series existed long before I discovered it on my own. Unfortunately, like most hard (realistic) science fiction, it is relatively obscure... But I know the KSP community can appreciate it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS you should totally check out the tvtropes page I made for it. It really needs some updating!

I was disappointed to find that the titles for the first two books are ____ Mars (Mars Trilogy) and the last one is just ____ Mars. The OCD in me is rebelling, but I cracked open the first book and it looks like a really interesting read! Hope it fills the hole left in my heart by the Marsbound Trilogy. :\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
