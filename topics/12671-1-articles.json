Unity appears to have done everything it was supposed to so I think something went wrong in the original modelling process. ??? I may just have to start the capsule over. Original texture was a .png file, alpha channel created as per instructed by a previous post about tinted textures. Not sure how that works since either Gimp or Artweaver (don\\\u0027t remember which one) tells me it\\\u0027s going to flatten the layers anyway.
