Kipard that \u0027that analysing a Minmus soil sample can somehow give you access to a longer-range antenna,\u0027 is irksome.

Yes I agree that the Tech Tree needs an overhaul. I don\u0027t agree with what you proposing with regards to how to progress along said tree. You\u0027re saying that you would progress by achieving pre-set goals, that\u0027s what it basically is at core, achieve this to progress this far. Another point against it is how far can you go under this system. You say that your idea allows the player to play organically and unlock parts as they go naturally. And that it won\u0027t force the player to have to do x to get y parts (go to Duna to unlock antenna). But how many situations can you think of that will all allow you to unlock all of the parts without forcing them to do specific tasks/goals.
