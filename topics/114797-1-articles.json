Just set up my joystick (Logitech x3D pro) and I have no right roll input. It works fine with keyboard \u0027q\u0027 and \u0027e\u0027, I get full response to left roll. It also shows a slight roll left input in the bottom left of the screen with a dead stick. I have tried increasing dead zones, resetting the axis, and verify cahce which resulted in 2 files missing but no impovement with this issue. Any insight into this? I know it\u0027s not the plane as I can fly normal with keyboard, just not very well.\n\nThanks for your help."},{"CreatedByName":"Whizzkid","CreatedById":126892,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T21:17:24Z","Content":"I have had this issue with my joystick as well, probably something to do with how unity handles the joystick input as a raw input instead of a calibrated input. Try the vJoy virtual joystick driver: [http://sourceforge.net/projects/vjoystick/](http://Here)\n\nThis allows you to remap the joystick to a virtual joystick, which you can calibrate and select in game. Just set the deadzones as usual in the joystick setup in the controls menu. This has worked great for me.\n\nUse this in conjunction with UJR (Universal joystick Remapper) [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/26379-UJR-Universal-Joystick-Remapper-Fixes-problems-with-sticks-in-KSP](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/26379-UJR-Universal-Joystick-Remapper-Fixes-problems-with-sticks-in-KSP) which should help with the remapping.\n\nTo use this, when the joystick is being set up in game, make sure that when it is binded that it is binded to the vjoy joystick.\n\nHope this helps.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-05T22:02:53Z\u0022 title=\u002207/05/2015 10:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Whizzkid**"}]}
