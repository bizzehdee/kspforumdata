From what I have seen looking around aluminum is essential to orbit-capable propellants, and would need a large discovery and electrical industry to get it, as well as complex blends of crude oil derived petroleum products. Liquid fuel, while requiring some special alloys, could have been produced quite early or much more efficiently than any solid fuel.

However, storing, pumping, pressurizing, and combusting in a bipropellant\u00A0liquid-fueled\u00A0rocket is going to require a set of tolerances far in excess of what we will be able to build without vast, vast industrial capabilities.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd even if we could build such a rocket within the required tolerances, it would be so much heavier than modern designs that it would be pointless. Solid fuel rockets have excellent thrust to weight ratios, while liquid\u00A0fuel rockets require extremely precise machining in order to get even decent thrust\u00A0to weight ratios. I doubt a liquid rocket engine built any time before the 20th century would have sufficient thrust to get off the ground with any\u00A0meaningful amount of fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sanic","CreatedById":149920,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-29T17:30:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI chose the Renaissance...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lobe","CreatedById":78710,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-05T03:22:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222435123\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022132588\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221456753632\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157695\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sevenperforce\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 2/29/2016 at 8:47 AM, sevenperforce said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd even if we could build such a rocket within the required tolerances, it would be so much heavier than modern designs that it would be pointless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy would the tolerances matter in terms of weight/mass?
