This behavior was the same for KSP 1.6x, 1.5x and 1.4x as well. The primary difference being that the 1.73 install has some sort of global scaling factor applied to the entire window (not the individual elements such as UI_SCALE_XXX values), bringing the window size up to a reasonable size, while having all of the the UI elements sized reasonably well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the 1.73 instance, in the Settings|Graphics tab the Screen Resolution is set to \u0022custom\u0022, while the settings.cfg file values are SCREEN_RESOLUTION_WIDTH\u00A0=\u00A01280 and SCREEN_RESOLUTION_HEIGHT\u00A0=\u00A0720. The various UI_SCALE_XXX values are \u00221\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the 1.8 instance, in the Settings|Graphics tab the Screen Resolution is set to 1280x800, while the settings.cfg file values are SCREEN_RESOLUTION_WIDTH\u00A0=\u00A01280 and SCREEN_RESOLUTION_HEIGHT\u00A0= 800. The various UI_SCALE_XXX values are \u00221\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m guessing that it is something to do with the Unity upgrade, but don\u0027t know where to start looking for a fix. Is it possible to somehow add a scaling factor in KSP 1.8 to the entire window?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-10-17T04:57:22Z\u0022 title=\u002210/17/2019 04:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 17, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by CaffeineAddict\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Efinished post after accidentally hitting submit :(\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheShadow1138","CreatedById":53694,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-20T02:47:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe I\u0027m experiencing the same issue on OS X El Capitan. \u00A0I run in windowed mode at 1280 x 800, which was sufficiently large in 1.7.x, but in 1.8 the window is annoyingly small at the same resolution. \u00A0Apparently it is halving the window size as setting the resolution to 2560 x 1600 gives a window the size of 1280 x 800.\u00A0 The only workaround I\u0027ve found thus far is to set the resolution to 2560 x 1600\u00A0, and the UI scale to 1.5. \u00A0The only issue I can find with this is a drop in fps because it seems to behave as though it is displaying at 2560 x 1600, but is shrunk down to about the 1280 x 800 size. \u00A01.7.2 runs smoothly at 1280 x 800 on my late 2015 MacBook Pro, and the high screen resolution is the only difference between the two instances.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-10-21T02:40:41Z\u0022 title=\u002210/21/2019 02:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 21, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by TheShadow1138\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
