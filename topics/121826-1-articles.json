After a few hours of playing with my installed mods, I\u0027ve realized that the ScanSat mod makes me unable to preform science.

Installing all other mods allows the game to run fine. Right clicking on parts or going through the part selector in vessel viewer does not allow me the option to run science experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOddly, removing Science defs from Scan sat seems to solve the problem, but then I wouldn\u0027t get the science I want.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-27T17:23:42Z\u0022 title=\u002209/27/2015 05:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lock-Os\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-27T17:56:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat other mods do you have installed?
