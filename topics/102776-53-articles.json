I have a reputation of 88% right now. So 74% might not be a milestone to unlock contracts or my save is bugged. I did some more reading on the subject and it seems that even with stock game the unlocking is buggy, some people never get the interplanetary contracts. I might start a new save or switch to sandbox. Actually I might try contract filter first.. might be able to force it this way.

I have a reputation of 88% right now. So 74% might not be a milestone to unlock contracts or my save is bugged.\n\nI used to believe reputation mattered for contracts because I had read it somewhere, I no longer believe that is the case. If I create 2 new saved games and give one 0 reputation and one 100 reputation the only thing that matters is the FlightGlobals that tracks what they have done and where they have been. I have not been able to get the contract system to work as I would expect, I have never had station building/rescue/mining/tourist/asteroid contracts outside of the Sonnah system and it seems most of the exploration or science contracts will not appear for a body until I have been in its SOI.\n\nEvery so often (if I have visited more locations) I purge the contracts from my persistent file and that appears to make it more likely to get science contracts to new bodies I would previously not get contracts for. As you mentioned, people feel even in stock it does not work like they want because it is possible to NOT get contracts to go visit milestones like Minmus or Duna- simply because of how the contract system works. From my experience in New Horizons it seems like the contract system does not advance well, combined with the randomness that is simply part of the system and what appears to be no reduction or limitation on contracts that are no longer relevant (IE I\u0027ve orbited every body around Laythe/Sonnah/Lave/Titanus and I still get contracts to rescue a Kerbal from orbit around Kerbin or do a temperature scan on the Mun), leads me to believe the system becomes incapable of generating contracts that make sense for the progression that has happened.\n\nIf you consider the problematic chances to get advancing contracts like you want as part of the stock game with only 17 bodies... you have experience what happens when you add 19 more ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Nookos","CreatedById":144067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T17:05:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I used to believe reputation mattered for contracts because I had read it somewhere, I no longer believe that is the case...\n\nI thought so too.. But indeed it seems like it only affects the amount of prestige for the available contracts. I just cheated my way to 98% and it didn\u0027t unlock anything regarding progression. I tried to fiddle about with contracts settings and didn\u0027t do anything good. As you mentionned purging contracts from persistent file I tried that too. It did unlock 3 new contracts for bodies I already visited but it was progression contracts ( gather scientific data from.. and land on...) And then back to normal = stuck. I give up. I guess the way to fix it would be to create a contract pack for New Horizon. I\u0027ll look into that if 1.0.5 doesn\u0027t fix it.
