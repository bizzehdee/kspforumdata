If I create 2 new saved games and give one 0 reputation and one 100 reputation the only thing that matters is the FlightGlobals that tracks what they have done and where they have been. I have not been able to get the contract system to work as I would expect, I have never had station building/rescue/mining/tourist/asteroid contracts outside of the Sonnah system and it seems most of the exploration or science contracts will not appear for a body until I have been in its SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery so often (if I have visited more locations) I purge the contracts from my persistent file and that appears to make it more likely to get science contracts to new bodies I would previously not get contracts for. As you mentioned, people feel even in stock it does not work like they want because it is possible to NOT get contracts to go visit milestones like Minmus or Duna- simply because of how the contract system works. From my experience in New Horizons it seems like the contract system does not advance well, combined with the randomness that is simply part of the system and what appears to be no reduction or limitation on contracts that are no longer relevant (IE I\u0027ve orbited every body around Laythe/Sonnah/Lave/Titanus and I still get contracts to rescue a Kerbal from orbit around Kerbin or do a temperature scan on the Mun), leads me to believe the system becomes incapable of generating contracts that make sense for the progression that has happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you consider the problematic chances to get advancing contracts like you want as part of the stock game with only 17 bodies... you have experience what happens when you add 19 more \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nookos","CreatedById":144067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T17:05:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tynrael\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tynrael\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI used to believe reputation mattered for contracts because I had read it somewhere, I no longer believe that is the case...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought so too..
