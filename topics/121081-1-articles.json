This is particularly relevant for study of xenobiota since we are not likely going to find ants, nematodes or other forms of life. The mostly forms of life we will find are in the transitional or pretransitional phase. Its not about, or has nothing to do with elaborate images of what our minute instances of life look like. Terraforming on any scale would require a knowledge of the basics, you can easily eradicate all higher lifeforms on a planet, but getting rid of the basal forms and early transitional forms would be the hardest.

Science is what expands the boundaries of science, not contracting it. One professor at my school once confided that every time she excluded a regulatory patway in one tissue, some other researcher would find that pathway in another tissue. 30 years ago scientist were convinced that only proteins could be a enzyme. Such fixations are not neccesary. Sure some pathways are water tight, overall evolution is a very leaky business. I personally don\u0027t want to live in exclusive landscape anymore, one tends to get buried with ones fixtures in their epitath. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERed blood cells also loose their nucleus. But I think the issue is more abstract, because there might have been many different types of inclusion, plants are exemptlary. But you could\u0027ve had cells in the intermediate phase picking biotes/biochemistry like picking candy from a vending machine, later processes of assimilation bringing their unique genes into the genome and washing the cell of contents.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn example of a nearly absurb argument would be the nitrogen fixing cyts of certain cyanobacterium. These particular units have a biochemistry that is highly toxic to other forms of life. Nitrogen fixation in nature is classically left to certain procaryotes. In fact if we look at all life there is a something somewhere that can take advantage of just about any source of potential chemical energy. wouldn\u0027ve it been interesting if some early singke cell plants has variants of the cyts that was poisonous but a lipid bilayer protected the host, and the cyst were exchanged between different cells, so that cells in a psuedo colony had the oppurtunity to pick up bioavailable nitrogen before they got intoxicated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the papers model this is possible because the cell membrane would be drafted each generation, a procaryotes do have forms of DNA transfers. In this case instead of exchanging nuclear DNA they exchange cynobacteria, robbing the cyanos environment of nitrogen and forcing them to fix. When the cell gets too affected it seeks out a mate that then takes the cyst and leaves the nitrogen enriched cyanos behind. The cyst would then grow cyanos in the recipient cell. The donor cell would slowly degrade the cyanos by dilution in daughter cells or through apoptosis. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut this does not explore other possibilities, because the subclass of archea can also be considered a fixation of the argument, we could also look at cells that had pairing with markedly differnent types of archea whose dominat status dependent on the environment, sort of like a binary star system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-19T10:42:39Z\u0022 title=\u002209/19/2015 10:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-19T18:08:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI take that if said the dinosaur subclass resposible for birds ......... this would also upset you? try not to be too ........\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m just being technical... its in my nature.

I have classifed every site within mtDNA according to its rate of evolution, every five years or so i reallign then with the new DNA so that the branch points. This is so when they discover a new human mtDNA group or new hominid mtDNA i can immediately guess when it branch. It was originally aligned with clustalw and then converted with visual basic to abd excel sheet. Its got the little genes marked off according to tRNA genes and the enzymes. I did this because there was a debate about a decade ago whether the elevated rate in humans was due to purifying selection or directional adaptation. It turns out some specific lines in humans show an extensive series of mutations that are very uncommon in other eutherians. one of the branches dated based on the slowest evolving sites is around 2mya, the population that Tishkoff says is under neutral selection dates to around 250ky. This evolving mtDNA population appears to have traveled from africa to india to the west pacific rim to alaska and to south america. Each time it migrated to a new different temperature habitat certain genes tended to change. So the general rule of purifying selection appears not to be true in specific examples of adaptive selection. These mutations allow me to dice out in much older branches which mutations are indicative of clock acceleration and which are indicative neutral drift. I had to give it up a few years ago because of the limitations of my health and the machine i was using, but with the new machine, updated system i can get back to it. When it comes to evolution in mammals partularly durind embryogenesis and early development I had been well read on mtDNA. Things like the prospect of recombiation or paternal inheritance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually tried to draft mtDNA from other reptiles, the branch times are pretty hideous and the differential evolution is hard to resolve at the genomic level. My real interest in the project however has passed since more interested in functional demes than mtDNA and the new ancient genome sequences have managed to address many of the concerns the locus i work on evolves oddly in humans, if i can get more alligned DNA from the desinovan group I actually can begin to evaluate some of the selection coefficients in that locus, I have 2 64gb memory pens full of desinovan DNA overlaps but no computer yet capable of processing it, hopefully withbthe linux on a quad core I will be able to covert a VBA to C and finally parse out the region of chromosome 6 I am interested in. Not doing anything now because stuck on hideous Ipad for 2 weeks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point I was making is that when you get into the patent stuff, the stuff the scientist are doing now for medical science and food industry its alot of processing, not very elaborate stuff, it does get published, I should know, but much of it is trivial. Variant X does this and Y does that. the comment is not about your Ph.D. work at all, when you comb the literature for patent research you will see a horriffic amount of trivial studies that are simply sticking a flag on the mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-21T08:17:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYea, but its better pay, more stable work, and I don\u0027t have to be in a lab working with radioactive P32 and S35, and toxic chemicals like Ethidium Bromide, Chloroform, formaldyhyde, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENor do I need to work with Lentiviruses...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it seems to have many advantages...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-21T11:54:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYea, but its better pay, more stable work, and I don\u0027t have to be in a lab working with radioactive P32 and S35, and toxic chemicals like Ethidium Bromide, Chloroform, formaldyhyde, etc.\u003Cp\u003ENor do I need to work with Lentiviruses...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it seems to have many advantages...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEtBr no problem\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChloroform/ DCM worked with, causes liver disfunction and anxiety.

Then remove the filter fiberglass down and lime layer up. As long as the humidity is over 80% you should be able to trap carbonic acid.
