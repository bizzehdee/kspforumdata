Rotate the camera view to make sure that the COT is not wobbling to one side or the other. If that is OK, the instability problem may be related to twisting of a booster during launch which will require bracing to fix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample, this design would spin out of control if it didn\u0027t have a SRB break off during flight.

If all the engines can gimbal, their combined thrust vectoring (particularly if using mainsails) can overwhelm the SAS\u0027s ability to hold your course. It will ask for a small course correction and get 12MegaNetwons of force applied at a 45 degree angle which it then has to correct with a massive swing of the engines the other way, which it then has to correct and so on and so forth.
