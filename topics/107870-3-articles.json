Literally. Governments have tons of funding, or at least a certain red, white, and blue one DID have tons of funding in those days, but just like the Apollo program was eventually killed by budget cuts, other government-backed space programs are subject to the money flowing wherever the higher-ups deem the money goes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in that regard, private space companies now, with financial backing from wealthy sources who are 100% committed to studying and exploring space, are much more likely to accomplish what official programs cannot.
