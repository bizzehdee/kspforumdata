It was fairly necessary in the 1960s, when rocketry was still evolving (though I concede that it absolutely is still evolving!) and the costs and know-how required to do things were astronomical. Literally. Governments have tons of funding, or at least a certain red, white, and blue one DID have tons of funding in those days, but just like the Apollo program was eventually killed by budget cuts, other government-backed space programs are subject to the money flowing wherever the higher-ups deem the money goes.\n\nSo in that regard, private space companies now, with financial backing from wealthy sources who are 100% committed to studying and exploring space, are much more likely to accomplish what official programs cannot. Because they have a surefire source of funding, they can more reliably continue their research and put the things where they need to go simply because they want to go there rather than having the program be some sort of political statement. \n\nSo in short, yup, I believe that private companies, such as SpaceX, are much more likely to do things than government programs are."},{"CreatedByName":"Voyager55","CreatedById":70945,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T14:34:48Z","Content":"International collaboration is most likely in my opinion.
