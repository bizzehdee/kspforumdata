The issue is that conduction rates into the LH2 tank are quite high, it\u0027s basically trying to cool the entire service module down to 20K. You probably wouldn\u0027t notice with a propellant tank due to the everything already being really cold, but the service module is only carrying a few tens of kilos of LH2 to run the fuel cells- the rest of contents are relatively warm storable stuff. When I tried removing the LH2 storage inside the SM and relying on the servicemodule type external tanks, the boiloff rate went from 0.01L/s to 0.17L/s because the starting temperature of the SM was higher. Replacing those servicemodule type tanks with a procedural cryo tank took boiloff rate to less than 0.01L/s (is there any way of making the resource list show more decimal places? It was displaying 0.00), but not low enough to prevent all the LH2 boiling off within 2 days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I need more effective insulation for this application. For one boiloff is just too fast and secondly if freezing was modeled my storable fuel and oxidizer would be toxic snow.

The issue is that conduction rates into the LH2 tank are quite high, it\u0027s basically trying to cool the entire service module down to 20K. You probably wouldn\u0027t notice with a propellant tank due to the everything already being really cold, but the service module is only carrying a few tens of kilos of LH2 to run the fuel cells- the rest of contents are relatively warm storable stuff. When I tried removing the LH2 storage inside the SM and relying on the servicemodule type external tanks, the boiloff rate went from 0.01L/s to 0.17L/s because the starting temperature of the SM was higher. Replacing those servicemodule type tanks with a procedural cryo tank took boiloff rate to less than 0.01L/s (is there any way of making the resource list show more decimal places?
