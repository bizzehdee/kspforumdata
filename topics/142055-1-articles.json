So I moved my saves over, but didn\u0027t do a good enough job of moving the mods over. I exported CKAN\u0027s config file and imported it to my laptop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBUT - the \u0022Surface Mounted Stock-Alike Lights\u0022 mod apparently changed hands, and didn\u0027t get moved over to my laptop, because the old version of the mod wasn\u0027t in the CKAN database.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo when I loaded the game, it conveniently deleted most of my space program.

Perhaps the game can do a pre-loading check on the savegame and provide me with the opportunity to back out?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr perhaps hide the spacecraft until the user has the right mods installed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnything is better than this :(.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Waxing_Kibbous","CreatedById":151611,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-19T20:30:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree, I\u0027ve had some infrastructure nuked because of this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*I\u0027d also like to see an option to select what mods to use for a savegame as opposed to having multiple installs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CobraA1","CreatedById":18757,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-20T03:43:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222637584\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022142055\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221466368257\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022151611\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Waxing_Kibbous\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, Waxing_Kibbous said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*I\u0027d also like to see an option to select what mods to use for a savegame as opposed to having multiple installs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat may take a bit of engineering effort (can mods be unloaded reliably?), but would definitely be a cool feature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf possible, it would be nice to at least be warned if a savegame file is going to be incompatible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
