Floating point numbers are represented (in binary) with a mantissa and an exponent, sort of like scientific notation (1.234x10\u003Csup\u003E56\u003C/sup\u003E, where 1.234 is the mantissa and 56 is the exponent.) Each floating point format (32-bit, 64-bit, etc) has a standardized (IEEE 754 is the standard) number of bits in the mantissa and in the exponent. The number of bits in the exponent determines how large the number can be while the number of bits in the mantissa determines how \u003Cem\u003Eprecise\u003C/em\u003E the number can be. To represent time in KSP, there is some degree of absolute precision that is necessary: I suspect hundredths or thousandths of seconds at minimum in order to render successive video frames correctly. This basically means that the exponent is almost useless; it\u0027s the mantissa that determines how much time can be stored in the number. For singles, you get a little more than 7 decimal digits, and for doubles you get not quite 16. If you need thousandths of a second, that ties up three of your digits, which means that singles would only give you about a day, while doubles would get you out to about 3 million years. I\u0027m not exactly sure how KSP handles time, but it\u0027s more complicated than \u0022I can represent 10\u003Csup\u003E38\u003C/sup\u003E in a float.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kethevin","CreatedById":64466,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-08T19:58:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magico13\u0022 data-cite=\u0022magico13\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECuriously, the issues Kethevin and thrandisher are seeing are due to my other mod, StageRecovery.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry about that, I usually keep my mods pretty well updated.
