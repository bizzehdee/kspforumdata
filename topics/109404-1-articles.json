This mod would be most useful while on the process of putting a vessel in orbit, especially after 30km for scenarios where the vessel only starts gaining surface speed late in the launch process (which is often happening to me in the 1.0.2)\n\n![0xCuvaw.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/0xCuvaw.jpg)\n\nSuch warning could simply be a change in the displayed icon so that it is not intrusive ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)."},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T02:12:55Z","Content":"Wouldn\u0027t using the notification system (the icon in the top-right corner) make more sense?"},{"CreatedByName":"Deovandski","CreatedById":144104,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T04:12:23Z","Content":"Well, this approach definitely goes well with the stock notification. However, during a vessel launch I believe that a similar AppLauncher notification like the one implemented on the [ScienceAlert mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76793-0-23-5-ScienceAlert-Experiment-availability-feedback) would be a quicker method in notifying the user that something went kerbalistic... ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"}]}
