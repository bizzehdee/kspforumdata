I\u0027m running 0.16 because of the larger mod base, but the explosions lack the black smoke effects, and instead are simple just orange explosions. I\u0027ve looked in the graphic options, and couldn\u0027t find a fix, and i\u0027ve also confirmed that these explosions should be implemented in 0.16... So if anyone could tell me why my explosion effects are lacking, and how to fix it, I would be greatly appreciative...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-04T18:02:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi strutman12345, welcome to the community \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure about the explosions, though they were changed a while back to help reduce frame rate problems, it might help if you could post a screenshot of your explosions so we can compare them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theflyingfish","CreatedById":17741,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-04T18:17:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe explosions were changed in .16.
