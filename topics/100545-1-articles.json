You may also want to browse through some of the others as well, whether you need help with other matters or just to get some new ideas. And, of course, if you run into anything that gives you particular trouble, feel free to ask questions -- undoubtedly someone among our helpful and well-informed users will have answers for you.\n\nHope this helps!"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T02:52:33Z","Content":"I made a tutorial specifically about docking and station-building.
