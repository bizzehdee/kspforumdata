This is a place to show your story, and I will show mine, including a past you may not have known \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou probably thought I joined in Aug 2012, like my user desc says.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI originally joined back when the forums weren\u0027t even in vBulletin, back in the good old 0.14.3 era. It was one user.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esss.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComing from the Minecraft forum, I wasn\u0027t exactly a good of user as I should\u0027ve been, I didn\u0027t captialize properly, and expected instant answers to threads. I developed stupid mods like cfg edits \u0022creeper corp\u0022. One good thing I did do was bring the Google picture war over here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy am I TD now?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood question. To be honest, I ask that myself. I don\u0027t remember why (probably due to my attitude at the time) got infractions, and eventually got muted. I originally created a joke account \u0022shhhilent1\u0022 long before, so I used that. Eventually I found out I was banned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeck, just telling you that I had two previous accounts might get me banned, but maybe it was long enough ago. I don\u0027t know. Anyway, a friend kept me up to date with the latest mods, including DYJs crewtank. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen vBulletian happened. I saw I could view the forum, and came on as you know me, The Destroyer. Took inspiration from Terraria. I\u0027m not sure if it was the ban or just aging, but I came back a better forum member. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou probably started to know me in the \u0022Bobcat Golden Age\u0022. I was a tester there. Perhaps your favourite \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E I admit, I really just joined to play with the parts. When I got it, I played with it, and I wasn\u0027t sure how to test, they were flawless. I miss the good old bobcat mods, especially the MK5 Ant. I told you about progress, and shared videos and screenshots. I was more or less PR and not a tester \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, I tried taking on mods. Real mods, not cfg edits. Back on my old rig, I tried to make a single part FAR 100 ton lifter. It was so ugly. But hey, it was my first mod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then became pretty much a normal KSP forum member, but I tried to take inspiration from Danny and summoned the Kraken... a lot. I made a stickyed \u0022Nooby-how-to!\u0022 guide, that vanished in the forum Wipe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for recent times, you probably know me from when I made a little sound overhaul mod \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I discontinued it as I generally have a hard time finding good sounds and tuning them for KSP. I gotta hand it to KW though, their sounds are excelent! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack to me. Since then, I haven\u0027t really done anything ground breaking. My youtube channel continues to get views and has reached over 100 subscribers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s my story.

I \u0027discovered\u0027 KSP by shear fluke... my cousin\u0027s son plays KSP and used it for a project in school... it was her mention of his project and my review of it that got me interested. I downloaded the demo, played for a few hours - and from then on I was doomed. lol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find KSP tons of fun and quite a challenge... even those moments of utter hair-pulling frustration. I would love to see what Celestia IS incorporated into KSP. I know the Devs have likely heard this many times before (I read the forums), but I believe it could be done - multiplayer KSP. Where there\u0027s a will, there is a way. I have ideas. If the Devs ever get around to such a thing, I\u0027ll throw them their way... until then however, I\u0027ll stay on their good side lol.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sun","CreatedById":66710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-23T03:13:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI joined this forum as Sun after the Kraken Attack, which I was not here for, and usually kept a pretty quiet life on these forums.
