I\u0027m hoping in this thread we could discuss new manners in which we interact with the mechanic of unlocking parts and how science experiments should be conducted\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my personal opinion I would like to see greater involvement with experiments to a degree, and certainly more intuitive uses derived from them. I would like there to be an in game catalog that would update with data archived through experiments. This catalog would update and hold characteristics of bodies which have had experiments conducted on them. For instance, doing a\u00A0barometer experiment\u00A0could give a profile to the atmospheres density vs altitude possibly in the form of a graph in an in game wiki or even filling out the air pressure bar (that could previously be left blank) giving the experiment real practical use. Another example could be having a somewhat empty tracking station with only a few nearby planets tracked to start, then a telescope could be launched to track undiscovered bodies to find their orbits and other characteristics. All of these experiments would more actively engage players if there was a direct and usable benefit from them, though I still think gaining points to unlock parts could be a dual function.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI personally think having multiple tech trees would be an interesting way to go, each with 1 type of science point. Possible different trees could be as follows:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCommand - new command pods and habitation facilities\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPropulsion - engines and fuel tanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAerodynamics - wings, adapters, fins, etc... all things structurally related\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGround - landing gear, rover bodies and accessories,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nElectronics - batteries, solar panels, science experiments, unmanned command modules, etc..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would like to hear any\u00A0ideas from anyone else, criticisms of those I brought forth or new ones of their own\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-10-18T21:32:30Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2019 09:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by mcwaffles2003\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eaccidentally posted thread before it was complete....\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mcwaffles2003","CreatedById":180102,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-21T09:10:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry to bump my own post but I\u0027m really curious how everyone here really thinks about how science is addressed in this game and ways they think it could get better.

I wish science could be useful in the ways of how science is actually useful. We visit planets and moons with everything essentially already discovered, we know where\u00A0an atmosphere begins and its thickness vs altitude, we know what temperature it is and the composition of its atmosphere before ever launching a rocket. This is why I originally suggested creating a game catalog where in data is captured and maps out all the systems.

Perhaps you might want to set up an industrial mining colony and send back your product to kerbin to be sold to the market. What bodies have materials worth mining and where are they? To find out we should send a probe to spectroscopically observe the the planets soil for trace rare minerals, followed by landing at areas of high concentration and taking core samples, after this one could set up a prospecting colony to begin small scale excavation to see if this venture would be lucrative. If all looks well ship 100 kerbals there, expand the operation and take in the profit (advancing technologies and interstellar transport isn\u0027t cheap you know). Perhaps thats also how we could create upgrades... if you want tech advanced it costs money, a lot of money, I\u0027ve never heard of cheap R\u0026amp;D at least.
