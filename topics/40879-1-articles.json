Or, you can check out the \u0027SelectRoot\u0027 plugin. It allows you to change which part is treated as root, on the fly. Makes building complicated rockets a lot easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/43208-0-21-1-Jul29-SelectRoot-Let-another-part-be-root-Fixed-Action-Groups\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/43208-0-21-1-Jul29-SelectRoot-Let-another-part-be-root-Fixed-Action-Groups\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
