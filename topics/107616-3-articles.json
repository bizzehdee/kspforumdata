Like other great games of this ilk-- SimCity (pre-5) springs to mind-- there\u0027s no \u0022win condition\u0022 or specific objective that has been artificially imposed by the writer of the game.

Because I\u0027m \u0022done\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, as it stands, there\u0027s no such thing as \u0022done\u0022-- or, rather, I get to decide what \u0022done\u0022 means, and I can change my mind again and again to play it over and over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, \u0022unlock all the nodes in the tech tree\u0022 is one form of \u0022done\u0022, and I did that. But then I just pick other \u0022done\u0022 conditions, such as \u0022get all the science possible out of the Kerbol system.\u0022 (this was back in pre-0.90 days when only Kerbin/Mun/Minmus had biomes). Or \u0022fully exploit Jool system\u0022 (after biomes added).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll sorts of variants possible:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Install Kethane. Add self-imposed restriction \u0022no orbital debris, no throwaway hardware\u0022 (e.g. discarded boosters from Kerbin ascent need to be soft-landed with a \u0027chute). Visit every body in Kerbin system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Same deal, but do a grand tour that visits every body in the system without returning to Kerbin or shipping any supplies out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Install RemoteTech, try everything that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Install Karbonite \u002B Extraplanetary Launch Pads. Work up to \u0022launch my first small workshop \u002B miner\u0022, then complete the game (whatever I\u0027ve decided that means) without ever launching anything else from Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Pick some arbitrary win condition (e.g. \u0022land on and return from body X\u0022), with a goal of doing it in as few total launches from Kerbin when starting from scratch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Same deal, but goal is \u0022complete by earliest possible calendar date.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Same deal, but \u0022with the least amount of tech researched.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...it goes on and on.

A couple of ways to win, and one or two to lose. And a couple of incidents the story would be hung on:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Once you have upgraded the mission control (? the one that shows your ongoing flights) building to the top tier, an amount of time is randomly chosen within a certain range (say 6 months to 3 years), after which an asteroid with collision course to kerbin is discovered. You need to prevent impact or the game will be over after it hits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Once that is done, or at the start of the game, another time is chosen by the game, at which kerbol will go nova (this could be in the range of 25 to 50 years maybe). Notification of this is given in due time in the game. This can be prevented, by discovering the anomalies (we\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4d need something like scansat for that) and ulimately finding some alien tech that can stop kerbol going nova. You\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4ll have to do some hard mission with it, to save kerbin (think spock in Star Trek XI). You do this for extra points/time, as you can (IF you can) skip right to the ultimate goal of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Build a ship that can hold and sustain many (like MANY) kerbals and bring it to a well defined trajectory at a certain speed (\u002B many other possible requirements, like a drill or whatnot), leaving the kerbol system, thus \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4emulating\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 colonization of another star system. After which the game tells you, you won. Imagine having to assemble some real monstrosity for this, running multiple fueling mission, after dozens of assembly missions. Then you start bringing up the passengers - again hardly doable in just one go. Finally comes the crew... i can imagine the tension being quite high when you actually start the burn...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1\u0026amp;2 would give a some mild time-pressure - just enough to make it matter in the long term.

The biggest difference between Civ and KSP is that Civ has a significant random element from the start. What the world looks like, where you start, what other civs are in the game, which ones ended up close to you, what resources you get, etc., not to mention the huge variety of civ choices you have that change how the game plays regardless of those other elements. That\u0027s what makes doing the same ending a hundred times still fun, because it may still be the science ending, but a science victory as Babylon on an archipelago map is a very different game than a science victory as Greece on Pangaea with the Huns planted on your doorstep from year 1. KSP doesn\u0027t have that. As it stands, there is nothing, no starting choices nor random elements, that would force you to approach that asteroid collision or sun explosion or resettlement project differently from the game prior. This is already a problem with career mode, where there\u0027s very little to differentiate one game from the next that would make you want to start a brand new game after \u0022finishing\u0022 one. That\u0027s something that needs to be fixed first before victory conditions could really add anything to the game, in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kobymaru","CreatedById":107372,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T12:36:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022fairytalefox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022fairytalefox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMan, I was like you until I tried that.
