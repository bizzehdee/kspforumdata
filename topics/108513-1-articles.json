I\u0027ve been trying to build a new interplanetary mothers-hip and designing a brand new Heavy- Life vehicle to take it into orbit. Though it\u0027s a little different, there\u0027s nothing that wrong with it. Everytime I\u0027ve tried to launch it, when I start the gravity turn it spins itself out of control. Every single time. I\u0027ve looked into center of gravity but everytime (just about when I\u0027ve spent half my fuel on the first stage) when I start turning, it continues and spins itself out of control. At first I thought it was just an error in my design, but I\u0027ve tested similar Heavy-Lift vehicles I\u0027ve made before the new version came out and it does the same. Even though they worked perfectly fine before. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what\u0027s up this. Did those bone-heads from Squad add some new changes to the game that make previous designs/or design strategies not work or is it a bug? I just need help...it ticks me off that its doing and I just want to go back to launching, exploring and landing again with having to deal this. If you guys want I can show pictures of my rockets if it matters. Thanks for any help, seriously.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Curveball Anders","CreatedById":107529,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T01:27:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022aeromike221\u0022 data-cite=\u0022aeromike221\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEverytime I\u0027ve tried to launch it, when I start the gravity turn it spins itself out of control.

Many of us have made that mistake and regretted it once we figured out what to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new aerodynamic model is much more sensitive to the mass distribution of the craft than the old, less accurate model was. Before, only winglets would affect the center of drag, so as long as those were behind the center of mass you would be stable. Now, ALL parts contribute to drag, so as your rocket burns through the fuel at the top, the top tanks continue to apply drag while the center of mass moves down. Eventually the ship has a center of mass near the bottom and a bunch of empty tanks causing drag at the top, and without massive amounts of winglets it\u0027s doomed to flip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a solution! You have to design the rocket with the direction of fuel drain in mind, as is done with real rockets. Look for a way to make it pump fuel from the bottom to the top, or at least roughly evenly, and observe what the center of mass does in the VAB with different fuel levels in the tanks. The rocket should keep its center of mass closer to the front while flying. Unfortunately there is not currently an indicator for the center of drag, so you just have to estimate it and run some tests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re at the beginning of Career Mode and don\u0027t have the fancy fuel flow stuff, have a look at this: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119232\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119232\u003C/a\u003E (No this is not just a plug.
