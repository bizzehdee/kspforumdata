Still trying to get used to how to SSTO now as velocity heating is brutal at times (punishes jets for trying to do Mach 6 yet doesnt care about a direct entry returning from Duna without a heat shield) but I do enjoy it. Now . . . when coupled with the stock engines getting their knees taken out with a frickin machete, the picture changes.

I played FAR for a while, and while I loved it I got tired of having to endlessly tweak my planes. I switched to NEAR for 0.90 and it was a good balance between realistic and being able to just build and fly. I\u0027ve been doing stock aero since 1.0 and so far my annoyances with it are largely due to trying to play it like NEAR, which was much more \u0022slippery\u0022. My first spaceplane return landed in the desert to the west of KSC with my normal NEAR approach ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif).

I haven\u0027t even needed airbrakes on my planes, I just roll 90 degrees and start pitching like crazy if it looks like I\u0027m about to overshoot and my velocity drops off *fast*. A couple times back and forth of this and I can land from 20km altitude at the mountain range. On the other hand, if it looks like I\u0027m not going to make it to the KSC pitching up to stay high in the atmosphere also kills my velocity, and often leads to me landing where I would have if I had just pointed prograde from the start (or even sooner).

Planes in 1.0 where very stable when flown at 4x physics warp and I think that is important in order to make exploring Kerbin something that\u0027s fun to do. While 1.0.2\u0027s aero may be more realistic, I think 1.0 was more forgiving -\u003E a bit more fun/accessible to new players while still being much better than it\u0027s soupy predecessor. \n\nBut pods in 1.0.2 don\u0027t flip around on re-entry as they did in 1.0 so that\u0027s a pro for 1.0.2. As other have said re-entry heat is disappointing (but it was irrelevant in both 1.0 and 1.0.2)\n\nSmall planes are a joke, you can turn hard and go from 400m/s to 50m/s in a second without any adverse effects. \n\nI love that you can glide in from orbit and still be doing over 100m/s as you reach the runway, that is much more fun than it was in the soup.\n\nSo overall I like it, but I do have some issues with it, but on the whole it\u0027s better than 0.90.0 and before."},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T03:27:37Z","Content":"I like it, but I still use FAR for the improved drag model and the amazing analysis tools."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T15:00:38Z","Content":"Love it.

Nothing fancy, just a check when parts change. Or at the very minimum struts and fuel lines didn\u0027t cause such absurd amounts of drag - struts are workarounds for engine limitations after all, and IRL you generally route fuel lines through the interior of the craft, if at all.\n\nOther than that, I quite liked the 1.0 aero model, and personally think that 1.0.2 is hideous.

As long as your craft is fairly streamlined you should get into orbit with little effort. be aware it wont work well if your TWR is exceptionaly low while a particularly high one will end up with a steeper accent profile than is ideal. 1.5-1.7TWR seems to still be a sweet spot from my experience."},{"CreatedByName":"moogoob","CreatedById":118251,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T15:53:29Z","Content":"Overall I very much like it.
