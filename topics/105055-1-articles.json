Are there any good mods I should know about to make career better? They don\u0027t have to be strictly career mode mods; they just have to be compatible with it. Of course it\u0027s impossible to know which mods will be updated at any given time, but which ones work nicely right now? I\u0027m looking for a mostly stock-alike implementation, so no major overhauls like Real Solar System.\n\nOnes I\u0027m thinking about are, roughly in order:\n\n- Kerbal Construction Time (to make time a factor)\n- Outer Planets Mod (more planets to explore)\n- TAC Life Support (to add more complexity to missions, especially early-game)\n- Possibly [Kerbal ISP Difficulty Scaler](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52882-0-90-Kerbal-Isp-Difficulty-Scaler-v1-4-2-12-16-14), to make it a tad harder. Maybe changing the multipler to 0.90 or something.\n- ...and of course KER and Kerbal Alarm Clock, couldn\u0027t live without them.\n\nThoughts? What add-ons have you used to make career mode better in 0.90?"}]}
