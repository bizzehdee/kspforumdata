This will make it very elegant indeed.\n\nFinally, Thanks.   I will never give up on a problem until it is solved ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022) ..."},{"CreatedByName":"Papa_Joe","CreatedById":10788,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-30T18:54:15Z","Content":"Update.  Testing so far shows that CLS is working.  There may be an edge case when using inline docking ports, as they do not have one of the fields that CLS expects, but I think I have it accounted for.\n\nI will be releasing an update today.  I will call it good, but as with all releases, there may be issues, and possible issues with existing saves that previously had CLS in place.  Be sure to back up your game save if you had CLS previously installed on the game save from KSP 1.1.3\n\nI appreciate the patience everyone has demonstrated, and Look forward to hearing about the results of the build.  good or bad ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)"}]}
