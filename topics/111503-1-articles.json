I like to build minimalistic and efficient, so the least weight per kerbal. Now in the old versions there was no need to bring more than one kerbal into space, but now with the 3 different classes it makes sense to have one of every type on board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery single time in the last 2 years when i start building a new rocket it goes like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 lander can, monoprop out, 600 kg, 1 kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt isnt aerodynamic but that was never really an issue. Now there is aero but also fairings, problem solved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor cheap missions its ok to take a MK1 pod with 800 kg and put a 100 kg parachute on top, perfect aero for 200 kg more weight... acceptable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now i want to take 2 or 3 guys on a lander... HOW ?!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i start with 3 small cans stacked, 3 kerbals, 1,8 t weight, parachute on top... where to attach the fuel ? Bottom ? \u002Bengine its a really long one and has a bad CoM regarding landing gear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other option, one center fuel can with engine below and 3 cans attached to the side of it. Landing gear at the side of the cans, perfect. But now i need 3 nosecones and it doesnt really look like a rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, a thing that wide is VERY troubling for fairings or cargo bays, sure it could be done but only with major overkill for a small mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what else is there ? Mk2 capsule, looking good! It has aero, chute on top, flat fuel can below, wide base for landing... all good but...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 tons! thats 1.33 per kerbal, TWICE the weight of a small can. Usually when u make a bigger container you have less weight because you only need certain stuff ONCE, like a door. But here we have twice the weight per kerbal and for what reason ??? It has 45 m/s \u0022crash tolerance\u0022. WHO ever needs that ? I dont plan missions that include dropping a cockpit from orbit hoping it will survive the impact!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReentry heat ? I can build around that, thanks, i just want a LIGHT WEIGHT cockpit that is aerodynamically slick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about a big lander can ? Place for two, 2.5 t EVEN WORSE. 1.25 per kerbal and for WHAT ??? It has the same resistances as the small one, so where does the extra weight go ???\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is one better one, the Mk3 cockpit, 3.5t for 4, that is 875 kg per kerbal. But its not exactly a lander can or rocket cockpit but a rather a plane cockpit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame goes for the Mk2 cockpits with 1 t per kerbal, they are not suited for a slim lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo is it that no one ever bothers balancing the most important parts of the rockets ??? I want 2 or 3 kerbals on board and still be able to build a lander that doesnt look freaky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes i know, i could just install mods... mods mods mods.

With the Mk16-XL parachute you\u0027d expect the capsule to slow down to about 4 m/s right? In 1.0.2 with 1.0.0\u0027s aero it turns out that parachute only slows the capsule down to 14 m/s.

It\u0027s clearly meant to be a successor to the Mercury style Mk1 capsule and among the rocket parts it holds the most kerbals, barring the Hitchhiker. If you want to bring one or two kerbals from orbit, don\u0027t have any available landers in orbit and don\u0027t have any viable spaceplanes yet you\u0027re probably going to use a Mk1-2 capsule to get those kerbonauts home.

Again, its crew capacity makes it a good command module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeyond that I don\u0027t know why I would use a Mk1-2 capsule. It\u0027s heavy, so I wouldn\u0027t use it in a lander that has to take off again. On that note it\u0027s actually lighter than the Apollo capsule that it\u0027s clearly inspired by, which was 5.5 metric tons, but the other capsules in this game are also lighter than their real life counter parts. The weight of the Mk1-2 means it\u0027s not a viable capsule until you can build 2.5 m rockets. But these rockets are more expensive, so you\u0027ll probably continue using the Mk1 capsule for contract work anyway, unless you can find a way to combine missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t use it for a space station again because it\u0027s heavy, but also because its ladder is in a weird place. It\u0027s the only capsule or part in the game with a ladder that\u0027s not normal to its flight path. When you launch a capsule the ladder is normally facing due north, but the ladder on the Mk1-2 capsule is facing southwest. I don\u0027t know why, it\u0027s just the way the part was made. And if you rotate the capsule to compensate your compass will not be facing north like it normally does when you launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally it\u0027s ugly. The capsule door is in a strange place and there are two upwards facing windows which mess with the conical geometry of the capsule and make it a pain to place radial parachutes. It has widgets and gunk painted on which serve no purpose, and overall it doesn\u0027t look like something that belongs in KSP 1.0.2 alongside the new spaceplane capsules like the Mk3 cockpit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely the first change I would make would be to make it lighter. A lighter 2.5 m capsule would be a better contender for all the roles I mentioned and make it suitable for use in landers and situations where deltaV conservation is necessary. It would also fix the problem with parachutes not slowing it down, eliminating the need for goofy solutions like using solid rocket motors to slow it down the instant before it hits the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also think it needs an aesthetic change. I think a lot more people would use a capsule with a ladder in the expected position. It would also be nice to reposition windows so radially attached parts don\u0027t block them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T14:06:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy opinion : \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEver since Kerbal got roles, we are lacking a 1.25 two-seat pods.

Command modules are command modules, landers are landers. The Mk 1-2 is heavy but designed for the atmosphere. Lander cans save fuel when landing. Lander cans are already unaerodynamic but I would be perfectly fine with lander cans being weaker to heat to prohibit their use as a re-entry vehicle. It should be just strong enough for Duna but not Kerbin, Laythe, or Eve.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really like this idea because lander cans, even with a heatsheild have lots poking out to they will still burn up unless you a oversized heatsheild.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
