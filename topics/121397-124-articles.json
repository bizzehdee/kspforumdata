This ensures it will stay relatively stable in most driving conditions. The posts above this one also mention things you can (and should) do in regards to available torque.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as an initial base-seeding kit goes, you might want to look at OSE Workshop Reworked (a mod that has very recently been patched so it works with Pathfinder once again) and/or Extraplanetary Launchpads as complimentary mods if you don\u0027t have them already. The first one allows you access to the Pondarosa/Casa Blacksmith module, allowing you to print up new parts on site - including additional base structures). The second one allows you access to Pathfinder\u0027s Rangeland launchpad, allowing you to print up \u003Cem\u003Ewhole new craft\u003C/em\u003E on site\u00A0and allowing your base to act as a remote launch site. While OSE was non-functional, I relied on EL to print up the bits I needed for base expansion. Either one of these mods will let you go with a relatively small initial craft to seed a base and then expand it out to greater capabilities later. I suggest a rover for the job in most cases so that if your initial landing site is garbage, you can go look for a better one. Rovers aren\u0027t practical in some bodies in the system though (particularly the ones like Pol and Gilly, where the gravity is particularly low)\u00A0and in those cases you\u0027re fine with a Conestoga-based lander instead. You\u0027ll want to pack a Blacksmith in your initial base equipment if you go with OSE. With EL, you\u0027ll want a Hacienda Ironworks (the default module) as well as a Rangeland in your initial kit. If you use both mods, why not go with all three...?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd nothing says you have to go with either one. I\u0027m just saying that utilizing the ability to build things on site is going to save you a lot of headaches in the \u0022getting all that crap to the site\u0022 front. Rocket equation mathematics and all that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027ll want to have a pair of Hacienda Claimjumpers in your initial kit. Aside from Ore production - which will be important - these allow you to bring up Precious Metals (or Rare Metals in CRP Mode, which is what I\u0027ve been with since I\u0027ve first started using Pathfinder) and Minerite (Minerals in CRP Mode). Both of those resources are absolutely critical for base expansion. I would go so far as to suggest you \u0022scout\u0022 whatever world on which you\u0027re planning to establish a base with a polar-orbiting probe equipped with a narrow-band scanner\u00A0 before you put boots on the ground, and search for a biome that contains both of these two resources.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake three or four Chuckwagons in a kit. They have good Storage capacity for when you\u0027re getting your base set up and they\u0027ll give you some flexibility. In particular, I like to transfer over the Equipment from my rover to the base once I\u0027ve got everything else offloaded - this way I can move the rover into a support role once it\u0027s done with its delivery job.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost of these, incidentally, will fit nicely into a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E Storage-configured\u00A0Buckboard or four...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI find a Micro \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E unit to be a nice addition to a kit, mainly as a means of accessing a portable\u00A0OmniConverter (i.e. a single part that can be reconfigured to make whatever it is you need it to make). I don\u0027t leave Kerbin without one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIMHO, you\u0027ll want to bring along some SAFER reactors. For the amount of power your base will need to do certain things, I\u0027ve found it\u0027s better to rely on nuclear power sources over solar. The SAFERs will give you a leg-up on that and ensure you\u0027ve got plenty of power while your bases are still in their infancy. Even later on, when you can build Nukeworks (assuming a supply of Uraninite at your base site), the SAFERs will still supply a respectable amount of\u00A0reliable power, and it\u0027ll be a while before they get depleted.\u00A0 The \u003Cem\u003ETBDs \u003C/em\u003Ecarry six. Only downside is that they do take two kerbals to deploy thanks to their mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat should do as far as starters are concerned.
