It\u0027s mostly about piloting. Do it right, and it takes very little fuel. Do it wrong, and You Will Not Go To Space Today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWanderfound\u0027s Spaceplane Piloting Guide\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(written with FAR/NEAR in mind, but the technique in stock is basically the same)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Get to 20,000m however you like. Around a 45 degree climb is probably most fuel efficient, but jet engines use so little fuel that it doesn\u0027t matter much. If the plane has enough power, I usually climb at 75 degrees or so just to get it done quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) When you get to 20,000m, level off and build some speed. You want to pile on as much horizontal velocity as possible while you make a slow ascent to 30,000m. Keep your angle of attack (the angle between where your nose is pointing and the direction in which the plane is actually moving, shown by the prograde marker when in surface mode) and climb rate low; by the time you hit 30,000m, they should both be around 10 or so. A low angle of attack reduces drag and helps your intakes work better. The low angle makes you climb slower, but that\u0027s okay; you need that time to get up to speed. As you go faster, the angle of attack required to maintain a given climb rate reduces, but as you go higher, the thinner air means that the angle of attack required to maintain a given climb rate increases. If you do it right, these two factors will roughly balance each other out and you should gain the necessary speed and altitude in a single smooth climb. However, a plane with some aerodynamic or piloting flaws may need to bounce up and down between 20,000 and 30,000m a couple of times while building speed before the final push.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Somewhere between 20,000m and 35,000m (exactly when depends on both plane and piloting), you\u0027ll start to run short of air. Don\u0027t switch to rockets immediately. If you\u0027ve got multiple engines going, shut some down to concentrate the available oxygen into the ones you keep running. If you\u0027ve already shut down as many as you can, throttle back a bit. You can dramatically increase your jet-only altitude by doing this, and once you get up to serious height the thin atmosphere means that you only need a tiny amount of thrust to accelerate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Keep this going for as long as your plane and your patience can tolerate. A well-built and -flown plane should be able to get over Mach 4.5 and 30,000m in a single attempt on jets alone. Once you\u0027ve wrung as much speed and altitude out of the jets as possible (you want at least Mach 4 and 30,000m), force the nose up to 45 degrees and light the rockets. If you have both jets and rockets, don\u0027t shut down the jets immediately; the thrust of the rockets will drive a ram-air effect that kicks the jets back into life for a while. Keep the rockets burning until your apoapsis exceeds 70,000m, then shut off and coast until it\u0027s time to circularise. Point prograde and close your intakes while coasting to minimise drag\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good plane and pilot should be able to get the apoapsis to 70,000m with less than a minute of rocket power. Done properly, it requires very little fuel. But if you try to brute-force it from lower speeds and altitudes, the atmospheric drag is going to drain your oxidiser tanks before you get anywhere near orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re having trouble with design rather than piloting, have a poke at the designs linked in my .sig.

(not sure if thats a bug or intentional). The result is a good 500 m/s difference, which saves a ton of fuel/oxi. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt depends heavily on whether you\u0027re in stock aero or FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the time the RAPIERs swap over to oxidising mode, I\u0027m usually on the edge of hypersonic (Mach 5\u002B). Due to the way FAR has altered the speed/thrust curves on air-breathing engines, turbojets (and air-breathing RAPIERs) are virtually useless at those speeds (realistically; there are limits to how fast you can effectively spin a turbine, which is why scramjets exist). Even at full throttle and with a generous air supply, they\u0027re only going to put out about 15kN each.
