Tomorrow, September 15th, it\u2019ll have been 28 years since the \u003Ci\u003EMagellan\u003C/i\u003E spacecraft began its primary mission, so it is as good a time as any to talk about this cool Venusian orbiter. Aptly named after the sixteenth-century Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, known for his exploration, mapping, and circumnavigation of the Earth, the spacecraft\u2019s main goal was designed to make quality radar maps of at least 70 percent of Venus\u2019 surface, providing a clear look at the topography below the planet\u2019s thick, perpetual cloak of clouds.\u00A0\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso referred to as the \u003Ci\u003EVenus Radar Mapper\u003C/i\u003E, the \u003Ci\u003EMagellan\u003C/i\u003E spacecraft was launched by \u003Ci\u003ENASA\u003C/i\u003E on May 4 1989 aboard the \u003Ci\u003ESpace Shuttle Atlantis\u003C/i\u003E, making it the first interplanetary mission to be launched from a shuttle. It was also the first one to use a solid-fuel motor called the \u003Ci\u003EInertial Upper Stage\u003C/i\u003E booster to continue its journey as it was released from the shuttle\u2019s cargo bay, and the first spacecraft to test aerobraking as a method for circularizing its orbit. \u003Ci\u003EMagellan\u003C/i\u003E was the fifth successful \u003Ci\u003ENASA\u003C/i\u003E mission to Venus, and it ended an eleven-year gap in U.S. interplanetary probe launches.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cfigure data-orig-width=\u00221280\u0022 data-orig-height=\u00221274\u0022 class=\u0022tmblr-full\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://78.media.tumblr.com/42ce47c8db2f823b6f42a255238663cf/tumblr_inline_pf2crgSqxA1rr2wit_540.jpg\u0022 data-orig-width=\u00221280\u0022 data-orig-height=\u00221274\u0022 alt=\u0022tumblr_inline_pf2crgSqxA1rr2wit_540.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/figure\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe spacecraft carried a sophisticated imaging radar, called \u003Ci\u003ESynthetic Aperture Radar\u003C/i\u003E (SAR), \u00A0which was used to make the most highly detailed map of Venus ever captured during its four years in orbit around Venus from 1990 to 1994. After concluding its radar mapping, \u003Ci\u003EMagellan\u003C/i\u003E also made global maps of Venus\u2019s gravity field.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EMagellan\u003C/i\u003E mapped 98 percent of the planet\u2019s surface with a resolution of 100 meters or better. The radar images showed that most of the surface was covered by volcanic materials, that there were few impact craters (suggesting that the surface is relatively young geologically), and that there was no evidence of plate tectonic activity or water erosion, although there was some evidence of wind erosion. Despite the high surface temperatures (475\u00B0C) and high atmospheric pressures (92 atmospheres), the complete lack of water makes erosion an extremely slow process. As a result, surface features can persist for hundreds of millions of years. The \u003Ci\u003EMagellan\u003C/i\u003E mission also determined the topography of the Venusian surface, measured the Venusian gravity field, and provided suggestive evidence that the planet\u2019s interior differs in major ways from Earth\u2019s interior. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn Oct. 12, 1994, the spacecraft made a dramatic plunge into the thick, hot Venusian atmosphere, and was crushed by the pressure of Venus\u2019s atmosphere. \u003Ci\u003EMagellan\u003C/i\u003E\u2019s signal was lost at 10:02 Universal Time (3:02 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time) that day.

The team is currently working on some cool features regarding one of our favorite Celestial Bodies: Asteroids! As you know, before the \u003Ci\u003EMaking History Expansion\u003C/i\u003E, it was very hard to get an asteroid within the atmosphere of other Celestial Bodies, at least without mods or some sort of cheats. When Asteroids were originally introduced into the game, only space interactions were in mind, but that changed with the expansion as now players can easily spawn asteroids on collision routes with other Celestial Bodies. In light of this, \u003Cb\u003Ewe have been working on ensuring that asteroids behave properly whenever they enter the atmosphere of a Celestial Body\u003C/b\u003E, similar to a spacecraft. So far, we have added VFXs as they go through reentry heat and included explosion effects when they actually collide. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://gfycat.com/ConfusedBadCleanerwrasse\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECheck this Gif\u003C/a\u003E to see the progress. \u00A0\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn other news, \u003Cb\u003Ethe endeavor of revamping parts continues!\u003C/b\u003E Each week we gather insightful feedback from the community as we show the new look of some of these parts, but we haven\u2019t shown you everything just yet.

The new look of these command modules was based on the ones used in the Mariner Program, and to achieve that our artists made completely new texture maps using diffuse, normal and specular maps. They also retouched the geometry and added a new shader to the module\u2019s tops to make them shine and interact with light, just like they did with the HECS modules. On top of that, with resource optimization in mind, they put both textures into a single map. Moreover, the collision mesh was tweaked to better fit the shape of the probes.

I think this is just down to the implementation of the texture in where you have shown the \u0027foil\u0027 to be pinned down/retained in segments; exactly as per the feedback that was given on the previous HECS prove core. This \u0027retaining\u0027 of the foil gives the surface shape much like the foil is bulging out in these segments giving the, technically, flat surface much more visual interest and stops it looking flat... and therefore actually believable that this is a real life shape. It still could be tightened up in places as HebaruSan has mentioned above (I think the texturing may just have been done with a slightly too softer brush) but overall much better than previously implemented.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe radiator louvers on the sides of the OKTO probe core are very nice compared to the old part which features very little visual interest. The great thing about these louvers is that they have been modeled into the the actual mesh of the part itself rather than simulating the geometry with a diffuse and normal map. These extra details don\u0027t add too much to the tri count but really give the part that extra detail to make the part look interesting.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe Mk1 pod variants look fine, not too much going on here aside from what you\u0027d kind of expect from a recolour and its always nice to have more texture variants if they are done well, HOWEVER, I am slightly worried about the artifacting and compression that the textures have obviously gone through judging from the preview image. There is a lot of colour compression which has induced a large amount of green and purple artifacting on the sides of the white variants (which is a common issue) but I feel like efforts should be made to try and reduce these compression issues as much as possible. You can see this issue here when zoomed in on the preview:\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00224YIwXOZ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022630\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/4YIwXOZ.png\u0022 width=\u0022840\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nI appreciate that this could also be compression induced through the image-preview creation stage or by Imgur during the upload process but I am also aware that it is a common issue when saving textures into the .dds format.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt is nice to see the Dev team taking on feedback to reintroduce the Warning message on the Mk1 capsule as it was a very long standing detail that the community has grown to love.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe increased detail into the end caps is a nice touch. Certainly an improvement over the usual, cookie-cutter end cap that has been used across many parts.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe underside of the Mk1 capsule/heat shield looks a bit simple and I am not sure as to why there is a very bumpy, normal map being used on this area:\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022JUdz34f.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022553\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/JUdz34f.png\u0022 width=\u0022737\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nPresuming it is pseudo-simulating a heat shield, it looks more like heat insulation material found on cryogenic fuel tanks rather than heat resistant tiles or segmented PICA heat shield. I\u0027m not quite sure on the intent of the design here but I would suggest that it could be improved, even if the strength of the normals were just reduced somewhat.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAll in all, quite a positive\u00A0showing this week which I hope gives the community a little bit of positive feeling and excitement seeing the standard of the parts shown to us being of a higher caliber.

The team is currently working on some cool features regarding one of our favorite Celestial Bodies: Asteroids! As you know, before the \u003Ci\u003EMaking History Expansion\u003C/i\u003E, it was very hard to get an asteroid within the atmosphere of other Celestial Bodies, at least without mods or some sort of cheats. When Asteroids were originally introduced into the game, only space interactions were in mind, but that changed with the expansion as now players can easily spawn asteroids on collision routes with other Celestial Bodies. In light of this, \u003Cb\u003Ewe have been working on ensuring that asteroids behave properly whenever they enter the atmosphere of a Celestial Body\u003C/b\u003E, similar to a spacecraft. So far, we have added VFXs as they go through reentry heat and included explosion effects when they actually collide. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://gfycat.com/ConfusedBadCleanerwrasse\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECheck this Gif\u003C/a\u003E to see the progress. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn other news, \u003Cb\u003Ethe endeavor of revamping parts continues!\u003C/b\u003E Each week we gather insightful feedback from the community as we show the new look of some of these parts, but we haven\u2019t shown you everything just yet.

The new look of these command modules was based on the ones used in the Mariner Program, and to achieve that our artists made completely new texture maps using diffuse, normal and specular maps. They also retouched the geometry and added a new shader to the module\u2019s tops to make them shine and interact with light, just like they did with the HECS modules. On top of that, with resource optimization in mind, they put both textures into a single map. Moreover, the collision mesh was tweaked to better fit the shape of the probes.
