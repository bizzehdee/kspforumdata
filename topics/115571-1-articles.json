Because of the obvious language translation, the Hyoomahn word for Sol is \u0022Sun.\u0022 Isn\u0027t that cute, they think their star is the Sun. Of course, the Deep Space Kraken would never permit such heresy.

It\u0027s only barely a star at all, but every few hundred thousand years it comes down and wreaks havoc on the planets of the inner solar system by flinging comets. It won\u0027t come down for another few hundred thousand years, so we have that at least. The name comes from the Hyoomahn for \u0022Enemy.\u0022 Jeez, why not use a simple Kerblish word like Enemy, anyway? Maybe it\u0027s easier for them to pronounce, with their limited vocal chords.

It is so close to Sol that it almost warrants destruction under planetary formation laws, similarly to Moho. Unlike Moho, Murkyerry has a very interesting geology. It is covered in weird terrain marks from a crater that has a diameter almost bigger than the circumference of the planet. At least, we heard that on a documentary once. It would seem to explain all the strange stuff going on with the terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EViness\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EViness is, put simply, Hell. With a toxic superpressurized atmosphere of death gas, and a temperature hot enough to melt some metals. Apparently it also melted some hyoomahns\u0027 hearts in the past, because they named it after their goddess of love. They say that opposites attract, right? Well apparently Aerth and Viness didn\u0027t know that because they are almost exactly the same size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAerth\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027re almost certain we spelled this one right! Aerth is a glorious blue marble floating at just the right distance for the atmospheric pressure at the surface for saltwater to be liquid at some places. This means that it has heckuvalotta life. Also a strange form of life called \u0022mammal.\u0022 They give their own children fluids from their own body. Hyoomahns happen to be Mammals, and Aerth has one major problem from being the perfect Kerbal colony. Aerth is filled with the Hyoomahns. They\u0027re territorial, and they have covered their planet in a lot of VABs and Astronaut Complexes that people live in instead of residing underground like any reasonable species. The Aerth also happens to be undergoing a new geological era. They call it the Anthropocene, we call, it \u0022The time when one species of animal changed the planet way faster than it would have otherwise.\u0022 They have one thing going for them at least, they have a pretty decent space program. Way better construction than ours. They use something called \u0022flight-grade aluminium.\u0022 There is a lot more to say about Aerth, but there just isn\u0027t enough time. Check another section of the textbook for info about Hyoomahns and Aerth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Aerth also has a large satellite, called Muna or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMoers\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA somewhat small planet similar to Duna, Moers has no atmosphere. Well, essentially none. Such a small atmosphere that you need a styrofoam boomerang flying at twice the speed of sound just to get any lift. There\u0027s so much atmosphere that it presents a heating problem from orbit, but not quite enough to actually slow you down much. Still, if you use a combination of lithobraking (actual lithobraking, not crashing) and aerobraking, you can land on Moers for less delta-v than landing on Murkyerry, even though they have about the same gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJoviter\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe giant of the Sol Sytem, Joviter is like a multicolor brownish Jool, except that it is the size of Kerbol. Orbited by over 60 moons, Joviter has the most moons of any Solar System planet, though most of them are small Gilly-like moons. It has a lot of storms, a thick atmosphere, and probably helps protect the inner planets from some comets and asteroids, on account of its huge hill sphere (A fancy word for sphere-of-infuence!). Joviter also happens to have a Jool-sized storm that has been going on for centuries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Four major Moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESahtirn\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe were very surprised to find that there was more than one gas giant in the Sol system. Sahtirn is not nearly as massive, but it is only a little bit smaller. It has gorgeous ice-particle rings that shine in the sunlight, projecting huge planet-sized shadows on Saturn\u0027s cloudtops. It is cloudy, but not as stormy. There\u0027s a cool hexagonal storm on the north pole. We like hexagons. Sahtirn also has 60 or so moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Seven or so major moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYourinus\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of the Hyoomahn pronounciation of the word, it gets a lot of jokes, because Hyoomahns have some kind of [REDACTED] [REDACTED][REDACTED] [REDACTED] that they think is funny, and sounds similarly to the word when pronounced. All we hear is \u0022You are in us.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYourinus is a cool planet. Literally. The coldest planet. It\u0027s a gas giant like Sahtirn and Joviter, but smaller and made of more \u0022ices\u0022 which are not ices at all in this context, but gasses that are cold. No, it doesn\u0027t make much sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-No notable major moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIneptitune\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIneptitune is a deep blue wonder.

Howmaya is a very fast spinning dwarf planet, similar to the old science fiction story \u0022Rendezvous with Kragrathrea,\u0022 where a fast spinning planet was found to be an alien observation ship. Unlike the Inaccessible planet from the story, Howmaya is not a very oblate spheroid, it is a very very oblate, very elliptical ellipsoid. It buldges out, and it\u0027s gravity on the tall end on the equator is less than at the poles, because of centripetal force.

How did it get there?

So attractive that, much like the Kerbal attraction to the shiney Mun, the Hyoomahns have wanted to go there for centuries. And they did eventually. A lot of hyoomahns don\u0027t believe this, claiming that it was all faked, even that it is impossible. Kerbalkind can rest assured, however, that the hyoomahn nation known as Armerhika did indeed send massive rockets to Loonah and back over the course of three years. The Kerbal Space Commission launched a survey drone that took pictures of the Loonah lander descent stage \u0022Eegal\u0022 and even set down mere meters away from the furthest of the footprints.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFohboes and Daymoes of Moers\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmall gilly-like asteroids of Moers, presumed to be captured asteroids. Fohboes is the larger and Daymoes the smaller. Fohboes the closer and Daymoes the further.

It is the second smallest of the moons known as the Gallehleio Moons, discovered by the ancient Hyoomahn of the same name. Eyeo is highly volcanic, the most volcanic in the solar system, mostly because it is so close to Joviter that it is constantly being squeezed by its gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYouropah of Joviter\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYouropah is the smallest of the Gallehleian Moons, and perhaps the most interesting.

It is made of rock and ice, and has no measurable atmosphere. Eyeo, Youropah, and Geneymead exist in a 4:2:1 orbital resonance, which aids in their stability, much like Laythe, Vall, and Tylo of Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECalestoh of Joviter\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECalestoh is the second largest of the Gallenleian Moons. It is made of ice and is sort of a fourth wheel. Actually, no that doesn\u0027t make sense. Four wheels are good. It\u0027s a third wheel, but where there\u0027s already three? Anyway, it is left out of the orbital resonance of the other three major moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMymass of Sahtirn\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe smallest object in the solar system to be a ball only because of gravity.
