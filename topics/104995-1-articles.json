While not an essential tweak, this would make the appropriate science instruments more valuable, and give the player a reason to do more than just land a probe and make two recordings of each instrument, then abandon the probe forever."},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T04:01:46Z","Content":"Interesting.

The thermometer is an obvious candidate for where it should work, but all the others are upto debate. I am not an environmental scientist, so i cant tell, for example, if there are siginificant pressure differences to be expected from any body\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s day side to the some body\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s night side, for example (atmophere provided, of course).\n\nThe goo container and the materials bay are special candidates concerning this, and maybe their SCI-output should not depend on \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4biome\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 (please Squad, again, check your terminology) at all, but rather on parameters like temperature and pressure (and g-force). This means, that they would have to be \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4behind\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 the thermo-/baro-/accelerometer in the tech tree, cause their application would depend on prior readings of said parameters. If you already have a goo-reading at temp/pres/accel x, y and z, there is nothing new to be learned from doing it again under the same conditions, no matter where you take the data. Knowing said parameters first, would then be a requirement to actually use the goo-container (to full effect, at least). OTOH, you\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4d be able to change these parameters (yielding new science from the goo, once you have measured said parameters under the situation) in novel ways: To change g, simply do a burn. To change T, intentionally overheat the container a bit..."},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T12:20:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Personally I don\u0027t see the need to further break down geomes (a word eventually to be adopted into exoplanetology!
