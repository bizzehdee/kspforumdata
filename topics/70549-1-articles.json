These stations we\u0027re mobile, That\u0027s how they we\u0027re able to move. So once they were doing their rendezvous burn a freak space kraken tragedy happend, Twirling them both and making all the parts undock and fly out everywhere, One of the peaces hit station 12 sending a chain reaction before the chain reaction started both stations and all kerbals aboard, Dissapeared out of nowhere, It could only be explained as space kraken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo after that horrible tragedy... We made a station in memory of them, And launched a special probe into the heart of the sun to remember these two brave kerbals aboard and these two Brave Stations with many merit, I knew that they would have wanted us to make a new station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you enjoyed, Space kraken really happened before i could snap any pics... Darn you space kraken!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-26T04:48:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo Krakens for the KSSP!
