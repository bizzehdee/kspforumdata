Indeed, it was recently announced (14 April 2014) that NASA had signed a contract for a 20-year lease of pad 39A to SpaceX for Falcon 9 v1.1 and Falcon Heavy launches, including the use of a horizontal assembly facility adjacent to the pad itself similar to that used CCAFS SLC-40 and VAFB SLC-4E. Plans are to use a new launch pedestal that they\u0027ll build atop the existing pad, rather than a mobile platform, and to use the existing Shuttle-era Fixed Service Structure, extended to accommodate the longer boosters\u0027 requirements. Presumably, they\u0027ll be either installing a new hammerhead crane atop the FSS, or building an equivalent to the old Apollo Mobile Service Structure, since SpaceX\u0027s contracts with the Defense Department specify vertical integration of payloads rather than horizontal. The anticipated first SpaceX flight from 39A is the first Falcon Heavy launch, currently scheduled for sometime in 2015. 39A will also be the sole planned site for Dragon Rider launches, as it\u0027s easier to man-rate its modified configuration than man-rate SLC-40.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E39B will be, for the foreseeable future, the pad for all launches that use the VAB, including all SLS launches and launches by any commercial provider that cares to rent it during the (currently very long) slack periods when it\u0027s not needed for SLS operations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
