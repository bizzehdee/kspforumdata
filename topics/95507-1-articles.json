I\u0027ve been to Eve, Duna and Jool multiple times, build surface station on Bop, landed on laythe, etc. With something like 950 reputation and the entire tech tree unlocked, I am wondering what I need to do to trigger contracts to the less-visited planets. I really want a reason to build for them, because I have hardly ever been so these planets are the only real \u0027new\u0027 content for me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have any Eloo contracts and know how to get them?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ghpstage","CreatedById":129622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T14:45:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if going into their SOIs would open up random contracts for them, it would kill the exploration contracts however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExplorations contracts are ordered, and the ones for these three are very late.
