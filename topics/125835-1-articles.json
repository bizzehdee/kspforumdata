The LV-N is the go-to engine for getting kerbals out to the most interesting places in the game, like Jool\u0026#39;s moons, and the RTG is the main way to get power to vehicles where solar panels would be too cumbersome or ineffective as electrical power sources. However, at present, nuclear technology in KSP is still pretty much treated as magic - you never have to worry about fuel life, reactor control, deadly radiation, or anything more than the most basic thermal management. Furthermore, one of the most logical things to have around in a world with nuclear technology, a true nuclear power reactor, still doesn\u0026#39;t exist in KSP, which seems a bit odd given how the LV-N puts out power while burning - the technology\u0026#39;s clearly there! - and how much use there is for RTGs in large numbers when it comes to exploring the outer planets.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNuclear stuff in KSP seems like it was added as a bit of an afterthought, but given how much use it sees in the kinds of ships KSPers like to build, it might really do well with a bit of an overhaul. To be clear, I\u0026#39;m not asking for KSP to turn into [URL=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vziIgAtD66s\u0022]Rogue System[/URL], or for it to adopt KSP Interstellar into stock, or even for anything particularly fancy at all - I just think the game should provide a little bit more of a reminder to the player that nuclear rockets are not magic super-efficient thrust makers that require no maintenance or consideration for upkeep.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis could take the form of one or more of the following:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Nuclear fuel, which costs a significant amount and is slowly turned into depleted fuel by nuclear engines/reactors.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Gradual loss of nuclear engine thrust and specific impulse as nuclear fuel is used up (restoration through reprocessing optional).\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Ability to run the reactor without running the engine to make electrical power, given sufficient radiator area to dissipate the waste heat.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- A separate nuclear reactor module that only includes the electrical generation functions without the engine part (still produces waste heat and uses nuclear fuel).\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Kerbal death due to radiation - being aboard the nuclear-powered ship or far enough away from an operating engine is fine, but standing 5 meters away from an engine or reactor operating a full power is not. Non-instant acute death and chronic effects optional.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Radiation shielding for pods and hardware. Reactors and engines should have built-in shadow shields that protect the rest of the ship when mounted inline, but pods and probe cores should not be safe with multiple nuclear engines or reactors mounted radially to them.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- More nuclear engines. Need not be anything especially futuristic or overpowered, but a 2.5m nuclear engine has been a long-wanted feature. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNote that I don\u0026#39;t necessarily mean that [I]all[/I] of the above should be implemented. My argument is simply that the nuclear mechanics in KSP are, at present, very lacking, and portray nuclear power like magic, which is not something I feel is constructive or interesting. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo what does the community think? Is the game already complicated enough as-is with nuclear engines how they are, or should they be improved to add a bit more of a challenge to large-scale late-game career missions?

Instead it would be a \u0022shadow shield\u0022 in which only a small cone (the ship) is protected by placing a small, heavy shield close to the reactor in order to cast a radiation shadow on the habitat. Nearby vessels are not protected, nor are crew in spacesuits - spacesuits and multilayer insulation only provide any meaningful protection against charged particles, [I]not[/I] gamma rays, and the dangerous radiation produced by a nuclear reactor is pretty much entirely gamma rays since the charged particles don\u0026#39;t escape the reactor\u0026#39;s containment vessel anyway. Blocking gamma rays requires a lot of heavy metal, and a spacesuit won\u0026#39;t provide any protection from them at all.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOnce again, I\u0026#39;m not asking for these mechanics to be extremely detailed, just that there be something more to nuclear stuff in KSP than \u0022just another engine, this time with magic.\u0022 People have frequently accused nuclear engines of being overpowered (at least before career made them cost money) and there\u0026#39;s still talk of giving them absurd reputation penalties for their use to \u0022balance them out.\u0022 Instead of mucking around with all that, why not give the player some direct, tangible reasons - namely danger and complexity - why using them isn\u0026#39;t a perfect rainbows-and-happiness solution to every delta-V problem?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KrazyKrl","CreatedById":65849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T00:20:03Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027GreeningGalaxy\u0027]Once again, I\u0026#39;m not asking for these mechanics to be extremely detailed, just that there be something more to nuclear stuff in KSP than \u0022just another engine, this time with magic.\u0022 People have frequently accused nuclear engines of being overpowered (at least before career made them cost money) and there\u0026#39;s still talk of giving them absurd reputation penalties for their use to \u0022balance them out.\u0022 Instead of mucking around with all that, why not give the player some direct, tangible reasons - namely danger and complexity - why using them isn\u0026#39;t a perfect rainbows-and-happiness solution to every delta-V problem?[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe NERV is already pretty balanced. The dry mass is already very high; means you\u0026#39;re using lots more fuel, and mass, than you need to in most cases. And the engine does already create lots of heat, for the amount of thrust it provides.

Not in the stock game, at least. \u003Cbr\u003E\nFor now nuclear engines are mostly for orbital stuff where their ISP shines and they have little use for landing or ascending. If all of these features had been implemented, nuclear engines would still have no use beyond that. And even more, they\u0026#39;d require tons of additional components and complicate and weigh down rockets. If you by any means make them do what they originally didn\u0026#39;t do then they will become way too powerful and the rest of the game becomes too weak. They\u0026#39;d simply be better in all ways to common types of engines. For now we have distribution of roles as follows:\u003Cbr\u003E\nJet engines are for atmospheric flights, vastly superior to any other type of engines, but limited to atmospheric flight.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSolid fuel engines are for, well, gaining initial speed. They only give initial boost and act as a cheep ascent unit. They become obsolote after that, except for serpatron of course. \u003Cbr\u003E\nLiquid fuel engines is what this game is about. They are universal, jack of all trades, master of none. They are fit for every role, but they exceed at none.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIon engines are for orbital control. They are like jet engines in space (even their ISP matches jet engines\u0026#39; a bit) becoming absolutely useless at anything else.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNuclear engines are somewhat between liquid fuel engines and ion engines. They have more ISP that all liquid engines, but not as robust for orbital control as ion engines, however, they are more fit for near-body orbital corrections, exchanging ISP for thrust.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd let me repeat myself: \u0022Exchange ISP for thrust\u0022. In real world that\u0026#39;s what\u0026#39;s happening for most engines (not taking in mind Orion which is one insane idea). You either get high thrust or high ISP. Getting both of these is a wet dream of scientists out there, but the point is that currently nuclear engines (or, to be more exact, engine) are pretty balanced for their roles and adding more complexity to them requires a lot of rebalancing for them to still be where they belong. And your proposed features are mostly \u0022maintenance\u0022 part which... does not exist in current game at all. Heck, you can fly for centuries and not have to worry about your spaceship. It just doesn\u0026#39;t match game\u0026#39;s content. That\u0026#39;s why I said it\u0026#39;s fine for a mod, but it\u0026#39;s not needed in stock game.
