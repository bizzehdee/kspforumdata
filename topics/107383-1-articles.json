But its no reason to give up - with some luck we will find an in situ source of cryolite! I have updated this post on 4 May to describe another crazy idea - making the other half of APCP!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBased on measurements by Phoenix and Curiosity, it\u0027s likely that Mars has a global distribution of perchlorates, likely in the form of Ca(ClO\u003Csub\u003E4\u003C/sub\u003E)\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E. Wow! This is favorable, but still not useful...yet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou just need to find some ordinary salt - NaCl. I may bee wrong, but I suspect this compound occurs naturally in extraterrestrial rock. Dissolve it into water, electrolyze it, and bake it in UV light and you make Hydrochloric acid. If you take your perchlorates and treat it with the shiny new batch of HCl, you get Perchloric acid and calcium chloride. Precious Perchloric acid, and excavated volatile Ammonia form that wonderful salt - Ammonia perchlorate!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMix with your Aluminum, and you\u0027ve got a modern, high-performance rocket fuel!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe data we\u0027ve collected suggests that most small bodies have a fine layer of regolith, presumably including lithophile elements like there is on the Moon\u0027s surface. Among the compounds is a significant amount of Aluminium-Oxide. Hey, its modern rocketry\u0027s best friend - hi strength, lite weight \u003Cstrong\u003EAl\u003C/strong\u003E! But how do you split it from those three pesky Oxygens? I have endeavoured to find the best way!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Earth, we generally purify Al\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003EO\u003Csub\u003E3 \u003C/sub\u003Efrom a rock called bauxite, and sink it in a molten bath of a different rock called cryolite. I understand that this is because Al\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003EO\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003E has an annoyingly high melting point, but when dissolved in cryolite it\u0027s halved. Unfortunately in space, we don\u0027t have world-wide industry scouring every corner of our unique planet for all the compounds and elements to produce useful things like cryolite. So its probably best to just buck up and go the whole 2000\u003Csup\u003Eo \u003C/sup\u003ECelsius. A brief search shows it\u0027ll take 1.33 kiloWatt seconds to melt one gram. Sounds pretty high for one gram, but lets take it up a notch.\u003Csup\u003E1\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA potential configuration I found is a 22 kW solar array, basically equivalent to one of those big SAWs on Space Station, powering the smelter module. This can make 10 metric tonnes sheet aluminium in one week of sunlight. Of course, you\u0027ll also have to have rovers scooping buckets of regolith, geological probes scouting for rich areas, and geologists or probes sorting the good stuff from the junk. In my opinion, it\u0027s unlikely that this can bee done with out at least a teleoperated human presence. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut with 10 mT sheet Al and some proper machine tooling, you are on your way to a nice-sized rocket - manufactured in situ! The smelter, excavation rovers, and tooling modules can probably come in the form of 20 mT pieces landed at a piloted extraterrestrial base. For some synergy, the rovers, having scooped up a load of dirt, can hook up to a crane (a basic construction tool) and boost its stability and rated load, while keeping the crane itself lightweight!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Csup\u003E1: No its not.
