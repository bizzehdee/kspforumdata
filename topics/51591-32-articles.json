Ranges only get shorter relative to your antenna when your target has a shorter range than you do. When your target has a longer range, your range gets longer. Take a look at the table in the post I linked in #785, which shows both quantitative and qualitative descriptions of link ranges for various antennas. For example, a Comm 16 -\u0026gt; Comm 16 link has a very short range; only up to 18 km, but Comm 16 -\u0026gt; Tracking Station Level 1 gets to 120 km. Comm 16 -\u0026gt; Comms DTS is 10.7 Mm (almost to Mun) -- plenty for a small craft -\u0026gt; mothership sort of scenario, but Comms DTS -\u0026gt; Tracking Station Level 2 gets you past Duna a ways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not the most intuitive, but it \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E realistic and it rarely results in unacceptably poor performance.

There\u0027s only useful in a handful of edge cases; maybe a rover off a lander, both of which have Comm 16s. The parent ship would surely have a higher gain antenna, though; probably a Comms DTS, and both of those can be heard by a Comms DTS for a very long ways. That Comms DTS can be heard by Kerbin for a very long ways, so all the parts remain useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real question to ask when balancing your internal antennas is to ask \u0022when do I envision these antennas being useful?\u0022 For example, I want the Comm 16 to primarily be useful in a \u0022child craft\u0022 type role, that needs to relay through a bigger antenna before it can phone home. It\u0027s universally useful for landers from parent craft with DTS or 88-88 antennas, and can even do small probes throughout their Kerbin subsystem once you upgrade to Tracking Station level 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, when are the integrated antennas on your SETI parts supposed to be useful? Are they supposed to be high enough gain to phone home to Kerbin on their own? If so, from how far away? Mun? Minmus? Eve? Duna? Eeloo? Balance the part around that number and the system will do all the rest for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, if you wanted one of your parts to be useful for medium-range (Kerbin-\u0026gt;Duna) exploration in the Tracking Station level 3 phase, you\u0027d want an effective link distance of about 3.54e10 m when talking to Tracking Station level 3. Tracking Station level 3 has a max range of 2e12, so your part needs a maximum range = 3.54e10 * 3.54e10 / 2e11 = 5.94e8 m. Do you want to pair with an 88-88 to have effective communications around the Joolian subsystem? That\u0027s a range of about 2.26e8 m, so you need a maximum range of 2.26e8 * 2.26e8 / 3.7e10 = 1.38e6 m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you decide what makes your antenna a smarter choice than the Comms DTS, which at TS Level 3 can talk much further than Duna. Maybe you want your antenna to be really low power, and adjust its packet cost. Maybe you want your antenna never to suffer penalties for long range; set maxPowerFactor to 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use \u003Ca href=\u0022https://goo.gl/pM3c8Z\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis spreadsheet\u003C/a\u003E to help me with this, which you can freely copy; take a look in \u0022Symmetric Link Worksheet\u0022.
