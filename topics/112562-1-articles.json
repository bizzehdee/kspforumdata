I just got a question about this really strange invertion of the controls, they arent so much inverted as they are, well, just plain changed... Up and down just became Left and Right, but only for the wings...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i\u0027m just casually working on my space volvo that i use with infinite fuel to just have fun, but somehow i\u0027ve messed it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first 3 prototypes worked pretty well, pressing S on the keyboard mate it go up, and W down, like it should be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now, pressing S makes the rudder go left... and A and D pitches up and down (But SAS still works pefectly, basically making it unflyable, because SAS makes it go down, but the wings make it go up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, up and down just turned into Left and right, but only for the wings, not SAS... what\u0027s that all about? no mods installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epic (WIP): \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5WnuKZw.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/5WnuKZw.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help is appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brainlord Mesomorph","CreatedById":110905,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T14:57:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t see a manned unit in there.

Try moving them rearward and see if it fixes it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"envelope91","CreatedById":146026,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T15:07:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah i think something is off with the centers, the probe core was correctly placed, placing it up side down yielded some strange results, the wings pitched in the correct way, but it still steered incorrectly and is generally unstable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the best thing would be to revert to the latest functioning strage and just add more stuff until i figure out what\u0027s wrong, but thanks for all the help lads, its a really strange craft so i guess KSP is getting a bit confused.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
