I really do want to get this working for taking pics for my logbook.  Going to try a fresh download, maybe I have a corrupt copy of the mod?\n\nEDIT:  Tried messing with it again this morning, mod took one SS and then crash when it was trying to take a second.   The only thing I see in the crash log is this block...  not sure if it might be telling on what the problem is?  \n\n    ========== OUTPUTING STACK TRACE ==================\n    \n    0x00007FF6F576D584 (KSP_x64) AnimationCurveTpl::Sort\n      ERROR: SymGetSymFromAddr64, GetLastError: \u0027The specified module could not be found.\u0027 (Address: 000000002734A0E5)\n      ERROR: SymGetModuleInfo64, GetLastError: \u0027A dynamic link library (DLL) initialization routine failed.\u0027 (Address: 000000002734A0E5)\n    0x000000002734A0E5 (()) \n      ERROR: SymGetSymFromAddr64, GetLastError: \u0027The specified module could not be found.\u0027 (Address: 0000000027349D3E)\n      ERROR: SymGetModuleInfo64, GetLastError: \u0027A dynamic link library (DLL) initialization routine failed.\u0027 (Address: 0000000027349D3E)\n    0x0000000027349D3E (()) \n      ERROR: SymGetSymFromAddr64, GetLastError: \u0027The specified module could not be found.\u0027 (Address: 0000000027354DA3)\n      ERROR: SymGetModuleInfo64, GetLastError: \u0027A dynamic link library (DLL) initialization routine failed.\u0027 (Address: 0000000027354DA3)\n    0x0000000027354DA3 (()) \n      ERROR: SymGetSymFromAddr64, GetLastError: \u0027The specified module could not be found.\u0027 (Address: 0000000027354A7E)\n      ERROR: SymGetModuleInfo64, GetLastError: \u0027A dynamic link library (DLL) initialization routine failed.\u0027 (Address: 0000000027354A7E)\n    0x0000000027354A7E (()) \n      ERROR: SymGetSymFromAddr64, GetLastError: \u0027The specified module could not be found.\u0027 (Address: 00000000273548C5)\n      ERROR: SymGetModuleInfo64, GetLastError: \u0027A dynamic link library (DLL) initialization routine failed.\u0027 (Address: 00000000273548C5)\n    0x00000000273548C5 (()) \n      ERROR: SymGetSymFromAddr64, GetLastError: \u0027The specified module could not be found.\u0027 (Address: 000000002734BCA8)\n      ERROR: SymGetModuleInfo64, GetLastError: \u0027A dynamic link library (DLL) initialization routine failed.\u0027 (Address: 000000002734BCA8)\n    0x000000002734BCA8 (()) \n      ERROR: SymGetSymFromAddr64, GetLastError: \u0027The specified module could not be found.\u0027 (Address: 000000002734B7F9)\n      ERROR: SymGetModuleInfo64, GetLastError: \u0027A dynamic link library (DLL) initialization routine failed.\u0027 (Address: 000000002734B7F9)\n    0x000000002734B7F9 (()) \n      ERROR: SymGetSymFromAddr64, GetLastError: \u0027The specified module could not be found.\u0027 (Address: 00000000048B0126)\n      ERROR: SymGetModuleInfo64, GetLastError: \u0027A dynamic link library (DLL) initialization routine failed.\u0027 (Address: 00000000048B0126)\n    0x00000000048B0126 (()) \n    0x00007FFFF9954FFB (mono) mono_set_defaults\n    0x00007FFFF98A8341 (mono) mono_runtime_invoke\n    0x00007FFFF98AE72F (mono) mono_runtime_invoke_array\n    0x00007FFFF98AEA04 (mono) mono_runtime_invoke_array\n    0x00007FFFF98CE9C3 (mono) mono_security_set_mode\n    0x00007FFFF98CF41A (mono) mono_security_set_mode\n    0x00007FFFF98D30FF (mono) mono_thread_interruption_request_flag\n    0x00007FFFF9987729 (mono) unity_mono_method_is_generic\n    0x00007FF82C858364 (KERNEL32) BaseThreadInitThunk\n    \n    ========== END OF STACKTRACE ===========\n    \n    **** Crash! ****\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-16T12:24:54Z\u0022 title=\u002202/16/2017 12:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 16, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by eberkain**"},{"CreatedByName":"AstroGates6","CreatedById":175160,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-21T18:38:18Z","Content":"KOS intregration\n\nIs there anyway to get something in KOS to trigger a screenshot (maybe an Action group key)\n\nI know of a Mod thats enables KOS to switchs cameras \u0022stock flight camera position\u0022 It would be great it we could program a flyby in KOS and have it take a picture and see if are calculation are correct\n\nkind of like New Horizon Pluto flyby"}]}
