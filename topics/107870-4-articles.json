Still, the only people who currently live there for extended periods are researchers and support staff. Some tourists visit from time to time (most of them on cruise ships) but there are no colonies of 80 000 people and no plans to build them either. Things might be different if resource extraction wasn\u0027t banned by international treaty, but we also don\u0027t see large colonies of people living in equally harsh environments in the high arctic where resource extraction is allowed.\n\nWhile scientific outposts, space mining colonies and even tourist destinations may come to exist some day, it won\u0027t be any time soon.

In truth, that\u0027s pretty bloody cheap. We\u0027re denying that he can afford to colonize mars or even get enough investors excited about the project to help mitigate the costs to have 100 people die... 1 year later. Too many people are utterly ignorant of what colonization means; to them it is like a vacation in an exotic land; but colonization is extreme and pushes people to the breaking point. Computers WILL be a luxury, not a necessity and power WILL be rationed. There will be more manual labor than any \u0022mentally stimulating\u0022 jobs for quite a while; and we WILL have to leave most of our technology behind.

A tall building is not a precision structure; a huge amount of the work is driven by the costs of mass unskilled labor, and if you\u0027re paying a worker dollars per day, you\u0027re paying multiple orders of magnitude less than the work on JWST. The Burj Khalifa had much less need to consult with the top engineers and scientists who command high salaries wherever they go; most of the work was unskilled work done for less a day than a US fast-food worker makes in an hour.

By and large, construction work is something people know how to do; in contrast, just about everyone involved with JWST is someone who commands a fairly high salary.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Always the same story, *\u0022if nasa didn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t do it, must be impossible :P\u0022, \u0022if cost so much for nasa should not cost less\u0022*.

SpaceX doesn\u0027t compete with NASA; they do not do the same thing at all. NASA is a scientific research agency focusing on aeronautics and space; they also have a mandate to help advance knowledge *about* aeronautics and spaceflight. SpaceX is the beneficiary of NASA research projects to learn fundamental concepts in spaceflight. SpaceX, on the other hand, does not launch their own missions. They aren\u0027t a mission generator. All they do is take money and launch payloads to LEO, which is something that NASA does not do (because they contract that out). SpaceX in fact gets a huge fraction (I think it\u0027s the majority, but am not sure) of its money from US federal contracts.\n\nAs for cost: Since SpaceX does not compete with NASA, there is no valid cost comparison between the two. Instead, you compare them with the people who do things similar to them; in the US, that\u0027s companies like ULA. Anecdotally, SpaceX runs itself like a startup -- long hours, short terms employed there, low-ish salaries, but with the advantage of employees who believe in their work (it\u0027s not just a normal job). They also have low bureaucracy. Their competitors like Boeing and Lockheed run themselves like big companies, which often provides better working environments but costs more money (as companies grow, running them as a startup starts to work less and less well). SpaceX also has low overhead, partly because of size, partly because they do everything in-house.\n\nIncidentally, part of the reason I simply don\u0027t buy SpaceX as running a Mars mission at all is that SpaceX has done absolutely nothing to make me think they\u0027re interested in that sort of thing. They\u0027re a commercial launch provider. They put payloads in LEO. They do not launch things on their own dime unless it\u0027s a test that they can\u0027t get a payload for (if you notice, they try to combine tests with real missions whenever possible to save money). NASA, on the other hand, has an actual budget to fund missions without regard to how much profit it will make them. If SpaceX flies a manned mission to Mars, it\u0027ll be after coming up with someone to pay for it; the most likely bet is honestly NASA, which would make this a NASA mission at least as much as a SpaceX one (since NASA paid for it)."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T13:57:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Nope.

SpaceX doesn\u0027t compete with NASA; they do not do the same thing at all. NASA is a scientific research agency focusing on aeronautics and space; they also have a mandate to help advance knowledge *about* aeronautics and spaceflight. SpaceX is the beneficiary of NASA research projects to learn fundamental concepts in spaceflight. SpaceX, on the other hand, does not launch their own missions. They aren\u0027t a mission generator. All they do is take money and launch payloads to LEO, which is something that NASA does not do (because they contract that out). SpaceX in fact gets a huge fraction (I think it\u0027s the majority, but am not sure) of its money from US federal contracts.\n\nNASA has not tried landing a first stage for reuse. Even though spaceX has not recovered a stage they have proved they can control one in flight.\n\n\u003E Incidentally, part of the reason I simply don\u0027t buy SpaceX as running a Mars mission at all is that SpaceX has done absolutely nothing to make me think they\u0027re interested in that sort of thing. They\u0027re a commercial launch provider. They put payloads in LEO. They do not launch things on their own dime unless it\u0027s a test that they can\u0027t get a payload for (if you notice, they try to combine tests with real missions whenever possible to save money). NASA, on the other hand, has an actual budget to fund missions without regard to how much profit it will make them. If SpaceX flies a manned mission to Mars, it\u0027ll be after coming up with someone to pay for it; the most likely bet is honestly NASA, which would make this a NASA mission at least as much as a SpaceX one (since NASA paid for it).\n\n[http://www.spacex.com/about](http://www.spacex.com/about)"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T16:03:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E [http://www.spacex.com/about](http://www.spacex.com/about)\n\nI have written this so many times now that my phone\u0027s keyboard correctly anticipates the words already: Rome wasn\u0027t built in a day... Lots over very talented people contributed to the endeavor over the course of centuries. \n\nThe day will almost certainly come when people will live in colonies and outposts throughout the solar system. That doesnt mean it will happen soon though. SpaceX may have a noble mission statement to improve access to space so that living in space becomes a possibility, but there are many many other pieces to the puzzle. To use another cliche, the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."}]}
