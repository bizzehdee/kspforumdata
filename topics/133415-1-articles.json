It feels like everyone is fine with stuff I am about to mention and only a few people bring these things up. First of in pretext I would like to say that KSP has been and still is my No 1 game, most of the time the only game I have on my PC, and it is an absolute marvel and refreshment in video game industry. There is hardly any game so rewarding and beautiful as our beloved KSP. I have not seen any developer so engaged with community and actually willing to listen to it as much as Squad is, for me they are a shining light in the ever more profit driven game development world, which more and more often provides us with gaming titles that are not even worth mentioning and remembering, let alone playing. And that is the reason why I am feeling even more obligated to throw my thoughts in, and raise questions i feel are important in a hopefully non whining, constructive way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first question I would like to raise is, \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewhat is KSP becoming\u003C/u\u003E?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith every update, I have a greater and greater feeling that KSP is becoming more and more of a \u0022framework\u0022 for community mods, which are for me a more and more a necessary \u0022evil\u0022, hell, if you want to do something in KSP in a really enjoyable way, you are going to do it with mods, and this is great that it exists, but it also creates some unavoidable \u0022walls\u0022 which modding can\u0027t deal with or deals with in some very faint and unreliable way, due to KSP / Unity limitations. Even some mods developed by community have made it into official release, which is awesome, and I think this trend should be continued to a certain degree. I am however disappointed in Squad\u0027s focus on certain game aspects, mainly, why is so much attention given to non-flight parts of the game, there are some things which were really critical, but there are some that I cannot believe took precedence over things that are still a major issue ingame.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMainly, I want to point my finger at actual gameplay after you hit spacebar to launch a flight for the first time.I will just throw some issues out of my mind which I really cannot believe that someone in development process finds acceptable, and again someone in QA phase gives it a go for release.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) \u003Cstrong\u003EPatched conics\u003C/strong\u003E have been a nightmare for the entire life of the game, and they are a really critical element of any mission, they are getting fixed now, hopefully, so it took all this time, even through official release (1.0) of the game to even get into fixing of those.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) \u003Cstrong\u003ERocket stability / part attachment node strength\u003C/strong\u003E. Anyone who claims that spaceships are fine should try deleting EAS-4 Strut Connector from GameData and trying to play that way, It is almost impossible to design a large rocket without that part, it is the only thing that enables construction of all those awesome huge ships everybody loves, and even that fails at larger scales, Kerbal Joint Reinforcement (KJR) becomes a necessity at this point, and again, why is it implemented by community so awesomely, and developers are not taking a similar course of action, beats me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) \u003Cstrong\u003EMission and timewarp management \u003C/strong\u003E- Again, if you have 2\u002B ships in a mission that are set to execute some node in future, it becomes a real real pain to manage all those, nodes are skipped, encounters missed, missions screwed because when you switch ships once you cannot revert anymore, so here again comes an intervention from community - Kerbal Alarm Clock (KAC) or similar mods that will make the game playable at this level. Also It is great that we don\u0027t have reports of epileptic seizures when timewarping at max while on launchpad / KSC view, I look away/turn off monitor every time I have to do that, it is just nauseating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) \u003Cstrong\u003EPlanetary exploration \u003C/strong\u003E- Now this is the part that makes me want to rage, because this is the greatest waste of potential ingame of all. There are the known planets, Moho, Eve, Kerbin, Duna, Dres and Jool, and their respective moons. And there is nothing to do on them, once you land on a body, there is almost nothing that motivates you to actually stay there and dig around, do science, try to survive, you know all the good stuff that space gives you. There are anomalies that you could visit but they don\u0027t do anything but give you the bling factor when you find them, and are almost impossible to find, even worse a lot of them were removed or buried below the surface, so they are unreachable. (Magic boulder, I will miss you forever.) And then, we are supplied with parts that would enable exploration of bodies further away than Eeloo (nuke engines, ion engines, RTG-s) which have absolutely no real use, everything within the stock Kerbol system is far inside the reach of conventional chemical rockets and solar panels, so there is no real need for high tech parts like those. Regular engines \u002B asparagus will get you anywhere you can go in stock system. Some planets will break your ships by simply landing on them or even loading a craft on the surface (yes i am looking at you Eve)... So in order to remove all that dullness there are again some spectacular community made mods that will try and mask the overwhelming dullness of planets that are supposed to be places which should make your heart want to explode with excitement. Notable huge ones are Outer Planets Mod, Distant object enhancement, Environmental visual enhancments, and a huge selection of additional science mods, basebuilding mods, lifesupport and lately a visual candy - Scatterer, which try their best, but really cannot change the fact that there is nothing to really do in space once you left the launchpad, because of nonexistent base mechanics to expand on! Hell, the most interesting thing that happened on planets in stock game beside resources being introduced are actually biomes, which were painted by a community member!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5) \u003Cstrong\u003EContracts \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eand rewards \u003C/strong\u003E- This part is really done much better than anything mentioned above, but could still use improvements, mainly things like Eve and Moho should give a ton more science/money because they are far more difficult to complete than anything else. Some are just completely stupid and impossible, but hey, its really fine compared to issues mentioned above.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, I am reluctant to say \u0022KSP is supposed to be a space exploration game\u0022 because it is not only that, if I am correct, it should be a merger of a flight simulator, construction/engineering game, manager and space exploration, and if so, why oh why is so much attention given to a lot of trivial things and improvements that are tied to the management part of the game and there are close to none improvements in other aspects of the game, mainly things I have addressed above.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo what are your thoughts, am I completely wrong and am I playing the game completely wrong, or do you resonate with things mentioned and are feeling a bit undercut on these important aspects in the way I do?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThank you all for reading, peace, out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWall of text critically hits you for over 9000 damage.

I believe that having weaker joints and lots of struts is just such a Kerbal thing and that if suddenly all of your rockets were rigid and didn\u0027t explode for no reason then some of the fun would definitely be lost. What I mean to say is, Do we want Kerbal space program to become a strict simulator? Or do we want it to be a game? Personally I think that where it is right now is a pretty good medium and that adding KJE to stock would definitely take it further into the sim side, which may not be the best for play-ability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere I do agree with you though is the planets, I love going to them, designing crazy landers and rovers, but, I\u0027ve never once in all of my years of KSP set up a serious surface base and\u003Cem\u003E maintained\u003C/em\u003E it, I tried it once* but I never felt compelled to keep it up and really \u003Cem\u003Ecolonize\u003C/em\u003E the planet. I think the best way to make planets more interesting and more \u0022colonizable\u0022 would be to utilize the current ISRU system alongside with a 3D printer component, this way you can build structures from the normal parts on the surface of other worlds, they could even add some specialized buildings, or maybe just one, a factory. I think 3d printing \u002B ISRU would make you actually want to colonize these places. 3D printing is the future of planetary colonization in real life, why not KSP?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally at the end you stated that most of the updates are centered on the managerial parts of the game, and I\u0027d agree this has been true, but only recently. Most of the time I\u0027ve been playing it\u0027s all been about adding new parts and planets and just more stuff, it was only after 0.18 when the game became sandbox complete (as squad called it) that squad changed their focus to the strategic and economic parts to really flesh out the actual game, before that there really wasn\u0027t anything to it, just a big old sandbox with things to blow up and places to go. I think 1.1 will do an awful lot for KSP and that probably 1.1 is what 1.0 should have been.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll food for thought, thanks for writing such an interesting post and cheers for reading mine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*An imgur album of my only attempt at planet colonization (.18 I believe)\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/xuvUV#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/xuvUV#0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-03T15:04:38Z\u0022 title=\u002203/03/2016 03:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Amianoob\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EApparently I\u0026#039;m not a grammarian, damn.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RizzoTheRat","CreatedById":123362,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-03T15:10:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be honest I\u0027d rather they spend their time developing the game engine/mechanics/framework than reinvent stuff modders have already produced.\u00A0 I really like the idea that it\u0027s a framework that many people have developed mods for, it enables you have massive variation within the same game.\u00A0 It\u0027s relatively simple for a new player, with option to get crazily complicated with stuff like RO.\u00A0 Having such an active modding and player community presumably acts as a nice pointer to the developers as to where their customers would like to see the development going, and ensures longevity of\u00A0 the game too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy personal thoughts on your individual points:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) \u003Cstrong\u003EPatched conics\u003C/strong\u003E Yes it can be tricky to line up precise manouvres, but it\u0027s a massive improvement on early versions when you had to guess, and yes there\u0027s mods to improve the interface (Precise node, Mechjeb)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) \u003Cstrong\u003ERocket stability / part attachment node strength\u003C/strong\u003E.

It feels far more natural than rockets that seem to be made of some rubbery material. This is the part where the game does not punish you for doing something wrong, as it does with other things, it just refuses to cooperate on the level that it should, and the poor strut is caught in the way as \u0022rigidizer\u0022 for something that needs to be the job for joints. For me in general the feeling is not diminished, and there are pretty much the same amount of explosions in my gameplay, it just eliminated larger rockets breaking under their own weight and behaving like they are a piece of rubber. And with introduction of reentry effects, you have to be really careful not to push the ship beyond its design capabilities. So while they could make stuff more rigid, it would be great to make ships more sensitive to pure aerodynamic effects, and really push out those dangers of max Q for example.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt could be that Squad is a really young development team, and they have demonstrated their skills in really improving the game beyond my expectations actually, so it might be that as they are getting more and more skilled, they will squash some of those things listed.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, did anyone else notice that the \u0022planets\u0022 on the loading widget actually move in a wrong direction respectful to their in game orbits? \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steuben","CreatedById":77368,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-03T17:46:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn one hand: Bugs and balance.

Keeping the 25 thr\u00A0or 100thr variants for further away in the line.\u00A0 I never use the stock Ion in science/career anymore, by the time you unlock it, you have much better options, even for probes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy main problem with wobbliness and such is with docked/space assembled spaceship.\u00A0 Without KAS you cannot add struts and it makes the whole thing very weak.\u00A0 I have resorted to assembling it in orbit, but before launching, just remake the ship in the VAB without docking ports (unless Lander crafts and the likes), or adding them struts, then Hyper-editing the completed thing where the previous one is.\u00A0 A necessary evil until stock KAS or something done to better docking rigidity between parts (without struts)..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for your point on maintaining a Base, well without Life Support, there isn\u0027t much maintenance to be done really.\u00A0 You could set-up a science lab or 5, with a powercell, and come refill the Huge LFO Tanks every now and then (assuming Solar does not work).\u00A0 Then you could collect the researched science and move another biome into the labs (Very OP in my book, but if you edit your game to 1/10h science gains or modify tech tree to multiply the current cost of research by the tier of said research, it\u0027s pretty much perfect).\u00A0 You do it because it\u0027s fun, and then you move on.\u00A0 The only other way would be that you land a lab into a biome (or get there via rover), park it, and it can gain science 1/day/scientist/level until full biome value.\u00A0 That way you need a base for extended amount of times, and while it is running, you could go do other things.\u00A0 Much like ISRU that continues in background.\u00A0 Robotic would yield limited gains and take longer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for contracts, my biggest pet peeve with them should be going away with 1.1.\u00A0 I like to bundle my missions together.\u00A0 A mission to POL and LAYTHE you say ?\u00A0 Let\u0027s wait for the rest of the Jool system and do Jool-5!\u00A0 *BZZZZZZZZT*\u00A0 you can\u0027t do that because contract limits/availability will most likely never allow it.\u00A0 Should be OK with 1.1.\u00A0 Some rewards are too low as well.\u00A0 Landing a tourist on Eve and bring her back to Kerbin ?\u00A0 Man this should at the very least be a million kerbucks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s good to voice your concerns, it let the Devs and everybody know what you want from the game, and for the record, I did not think it was whining at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood day .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-03T19:08:56Z\u0022 title=\u002203/03/2016 07:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Francois424\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Perry Apsis","CreatedById":97519,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-03T20:22:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222439896\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022133415\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221457024951\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022133850\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022wumpus\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, wumpus said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you tried stitching in stock KSP? \u00A0You wind up on the launch pad with struts sticking out at a 45 degree angle (that were in the \u0022right\u0022 place in the VAB). \u00A0Squad either needs to fix this or put the joint fixes in stock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat!
