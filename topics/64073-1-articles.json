I could go over the details, but I just plain didn\u0027t study for tests. I did all my work with that one thing bringing me down. Something interesting also happened as someone posted a picture of a horse meme in the engineering project directory and blamed me. I understand why I did bad in that class but when someone tries to make me look like a joke, I have to do something back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

First up, study if you are serious about doing this. In engineering this is important, as you can and will mess up important stuff if you don\u0027t. It might not always be easy, but if this is what you want to do, you will find a way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConcerning the second part: my advice would be not to get involved. Do not even dignify such behaviour with a response, as it mught be what they are after. Strongly denying something might actually make you look like you were involved. Just deny any involvement once - clearly and calm - and leave it at that. Any stuff going on beyond that is for other people to deal with.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FEichinger","CreatedById":58255,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-24T01:49:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello there \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose we can all agree \u0022getting back at someone\u0022 and escalating a conflict isn\u0027t really all that much in the spirit of our [thread=30064]Community Rules[/thread].
