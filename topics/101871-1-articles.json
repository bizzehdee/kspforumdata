This would allow you to cluster contracts according to relevance, priority or specific missions.\n\n2: **Comments/description at the \u0027\u0027Rename vessel\u0027\u0027 dialogue:** I would like to see space to add comments there. Similar to the way you can add a description at the VAB, underneath the design name. This would allow us to add information that you can revisit at the tracking station. This would seem very usefull when you are directing (very) long term, complex, missions. Especially when you have multiple active missions.\n\n3: **Abillity to archive flights/missions:** Sometimes i have very long term missions or even historic, inactive, operational missions. These add up. I would like a way to \u0027\u0027ghost\u0027\u0027 them out af the tracking station. For clarity.\n\nThis could likely be combined with my next suggestion:\n\n4: **Custom flights types at tracking station:** For one reason: see suggestion 3. Others might like to group active missions, landed aircraft, satelites, manned missions, interplanetary missions, science missions, test flights, **flags!!**, failures, whatever....\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nKinds regards,\n\nRobje"}]}
