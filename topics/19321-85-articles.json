Raw power and economy for the win.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurbojets (A basic jet engine IS a turbojet) are less powerful at low speed and suffer from lacking the full thrust they can perform. But they perform wonderfully from high sub-sonic to supersonic up to about mach 2.5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter mach 2.5, the SR-71 shows us that a hybrid Turboramjet can take you all the way to hypersonic. Though with the J-57 engines, the turbomachinery was still running, so they had a limitation in the form of heat on the forward compressor fans from high velocity, which limited the blackbird\u0027s performance to a declassified Mach 3.34. Though between you and me and something a pilot once mentioned in an interview, I think they could hit mach 4 when the pucker factor was high... At the risk of a machine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERamjets start becoming useful around mach 2.5 to mach 3, and continue to be useful depending on a number of factors to around mach 6 or 7. After that, you about reach the limits of deflagration burning and you\u0027re getting too much drag just slowing the air down long enough to burn in the engine before it gets shot out the exhaust. (Effectively, the engine blows itself out like a candle.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you reach that limit, the next point really is the Supersonic Combustion Ramjet Engine. It\u0027s usable from Ramjet starting velocities on up to at least mach 9 or 10 in proven tests. Though with the right mixtures, theories say you could get up as high as mach 22 before you reach a limit where the heat differential between intake air and exhaust air are so close together that you can\u0027t effectively heat the air to produce thrust anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem of course, is that you have four types of engine with four barely overlapping regimes of flight. A turbofan\u0027s regime doesn\u0027t overlap say, a scramjet\u0027s regime. And stacking all four engine types adds a ton of weight to a vehicle. A turbo-ramjet hybrid is a good starting point, as is an afterburning turbofan... but getting all of that set up right can be a nightmare for engineering. Which is why we haven\u0027t done it yet. And of course, over with Scramjets, the limit right now isn\u0027t that we don\u0027t know how to build one or do the math for it... but that our materials science hasn\u0027t caught up with the engines. We\u0027re building working scramjets...

This is easiest to see with the big delta wing; make a simple plane with two of those wings and it flies fine, but flip the wing upside-down and it\u0027s completely unstable, despite nothing changing with the center-of-lift arrow. In practice, it appears it\u0027s flipping the lift direction, and pulling the plane downward when it should still raise the craft. So I\u0027m betting that the game thinks some of my wing components are upside-down and I\u0027m losing part of the lift that would otherwise pull my nose up off the runway at 110m/s.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally??\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo FARians have to deal with this though?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DasBananenbrot","CreatedById":70900,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T15:19:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DasBananenbrot\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DasBananenbrot\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EStill got problems with said parachute from NovaPunch pack.

No drag from the parachute and no crazy flip after start. But when I tried with docking ports on top which themselfs cause drag but not too much , the drag from the parachute fully kicked in and the rocket turned around after the smallest control input or after few seconds when reaching about 200 drag. I also tried it wiht the shielded Docking Port which is also used on your example craft (the FAR Artemis Transfer by the way)ut although it sits on top of the parachute, the parachute starts to reach drag of over 200 in a bout ten second which of course lead to disaster. It is good that I can resolve this problem with nosecone but I actually would like to use this parachute with the shielded Docking port. So I want to know, is this all intended and I have to accept it or is something wrong that it produces that much drag so fast even with ashielded docking port on top?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-25T17:36:54Z\u0022 title=\u002211/25/2013 05:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by DasBananenbrot\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T17:17:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@nothke: \u003C/strong\u003EAny situation where it seems like stalling is night and day is probably the control surfaces stalling, since they tend to stall more severely due to their greater angles of attack with respect to the airflow.
