I am assuming that this is still approximately accurate under a pressure of several hundred atmospheres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe can assume that a planet with a Venus-like atmosphere will have a nearly constant surface temperature across its entire surface, even if it is tidally locked to its star, because we know Venus\u0027s surface temperature varies by only a few degrees, and its rotation is so slow that it\u0027s solar day is over a hundred days long. We will also assume a near-circular orbit, giving a constant planetary temperature, and assume that the internal heat generated by the planet is negligible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, the planet should radiate the same amount of energy as it receives from its star, and we may use the equations \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_equilibrium_temperature\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP\u003Csub\u003Ein\u003C/sub\u003E = Insolation * (1 - albedo) * pi * planet radius\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E, and P\u003Csub\u003Eout\u003C/sub\u003E = emissivity * the Stefan-Boltzmann constant * 4 * pi * planet radius\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E * T\u003Csup\u003E4\u003C/sup\u003E. Setting these equal to one another:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInsolation * (1 - albedo) = 4* emissivity * the Stefan-Boltzmann constant * T\u003Csup\u003E4\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe original page sets emissivity equal to 1 for the black-body temperature, but we won\u0027t do that, so:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ET = ((1-albedo)*insolation/(4*Stefan-Boltzmann constant * emissivity))\u003Csup\u003E1/4\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that the temperature is measured at the altitude where the atmosphere becomes effectively transparent to thermal radiation. This should be a bit lower than the actual surface temperature, but we will set them equal for convenience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will set T = 1500 K, albedo = 0.90 (the same as Venus), and put the other constants together:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(1500 K)\u003Csup\u003E4\u003C/sup\u003E = insolation * 0.1 / (4 * 5.67*10\u003Csup\u003E-8\u003C/sup\u003E W/m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E*K\u003Csup\u003E\u003Csup\u003E4\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/sup\u003E * D\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E * emissivity)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Einsolation / emissivity = 1.48*10\u003Csup\u003E7\u003C/sup\u003E W/m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make life easier, we will change insolation to units of Earths (1366 W/m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis gives us emissivity = insolation / 10,800 earths.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a planet receiving the insolation of Venus, the required emissivity is therefore 1.77*10\u003Csup\u003E-4\u003C/sup\u003E, which is about 16x lower than it would be for Venus (half the surface temperature, everything else is the same, and this is proportion to T\u003Csup\u003E4\u003C/sup\u003E). With Mercury\u0027s insolation, this rises to 6.18*10\u003Csup\u003E-4\u003C/sup\u003E. If the planet has equal emissivity to Venus, it must be roughly 4 times closer to the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I still have some questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. How do I determine at what temperatures and pressures CO2 will be stable? Note that unless photodissociation and ionization occurs, a rocky planet of Earth\u0027s mass or larger should have no problem retaining CO2, even at high temperatures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. How can I approximate a planet\u0027s emissivity from the amount of CO2 (mass per unit of surface area) in its atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. At higher insolations, will the sulfur clouds seen on Venus disappear, raising the planet\u0027s albedo?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
