Just work out which side of the rocket is pointing forwards, then send Jeb out on EVA to that side of the rocket, and slowly push on that side of the rocket until you\u0027re down to around 1 unit of jetpack fuel, then get back in to replenish your supply and go out and do it again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T00:56:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf your periapsis is 42km you should have no problems just time-warping until just \u003Cstrong\u003Ebefore\u003C/strong\u003E you hit the atmosphere (70km).

DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO GET THE VESSEL TO MATCH WITH THE KERBAL ??? More over, i didn\u0027t at that time unlock the RCS, so i had to improvise a way to gently approach the kerbal with the vessel and then get it to at least grab the vessel... took me at least half an hour to make it... i then proceeded to make a rendez vous with the first vessel because i didn\u0027t want to leave the science behind ! ^^\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T02:55:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RafaMonteiro\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RafaMonteiro\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks everyone for the answers.\u003Cp\u003EAt first I tried to wait for my orbit to drop but after several orbits i couldnt see any changes so I thought it wasnt working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter you guys say I should wait.. well it worked!

At high time warp you can be fairly deep into atmosphere before the game drops you out warp by itself. 40km isn\u0027t too bad for a periapsis. When I return from Minmus my first braking pass is usually at around 38km and that will get my apoapsis down to about 5-6000km.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
