I\u0027m guessing He wants something with a variable height. It\u0027s very hard even with modded gear to get your plane to sit just right on the runway, have it lined up with the CoM, and still have the flexibility of trying various wing configurations (low, mid, high), while keeping the gear spaced far enough that it doesn\u0027t roll the plane on landing, and stable enough that it doesn\u0027t wheelbarrow on take off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are just so many landing gear concerns, having only 1 set of gear limits design immensely.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-23T13:11:04Z\u0022 title=\u002209/23/2014 01:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-23T13:43:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi, sounds like a great idea, unfortunately if you have a look through the modding sections you will see a lot of very time consuming development being spent just to get 1 set of gear working never mind, multiple sets , there are some very neat things in the works but in reality due to the outright complexity and variations that are really needed I doubt it\u0027s even possible to make anything but a very simple gear part procedurally, I\u0027m not even sure if procedural wheels are possible, they may be though, and that would need to be a first step on the way to a concept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short don\u0027t hold your breath\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-23T13:46:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ebiggest thing is wheelcollider doesn\u0027t scale with the mesh. if tweakscale works the way I think it works, you\u0027ll have gear wheels that float or sink into the ground when you make the landing gear bigger and smaller.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"johnqevil","CreatedById":119237,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-23T15:12:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nli2work\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nli2work\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ebiggest thing is wheelcollider doesn\u0027t scale with the mesh. if tweakscale works the way I think it works, you\u0027ll have gear wheels that float or sink into the ground when you make the landing gear bigger and smaller.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeems to work OK for me.
