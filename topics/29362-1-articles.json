Except in my case, I was performing a burn around Duna (in high orbit). I only experienced it twice, both occurred in Duna orbit and lasted for about a minute each. Both occurrences were 2-5 minutes apart. At the time I assumed it may be a bug associated to the Easter egg on Duna\u0027s surface, but now that seems highly unlikely as you\u0027ve reported it on Kerbin\u0027s surface. The beeping sound was more steady than that of the Duna beeping hill Easter egg, if I recall correctly. But it does sound quite similar.
