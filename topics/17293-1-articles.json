The first is when a Kerbal is sliding along too fast, and the game decides he shouldn\u0027t be able to get up. The other case is when a Kerbal\u0027s rag-doll animations have left him with limbs colliding with other body parts in such a way that the game can\u0027t recognise that the Kerbal has come to a stop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can sometimes fix this by switching to another craft and back, but that can also cause the Kerbal to vanish. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-19T17:08:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry turning on the RCS pack, though that doesn\u0027t always work.
