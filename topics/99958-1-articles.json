However, as soon as you start to scale things up, I end up having to use dozens of the largest solar panels available from the near future pack. Making them fit in a fairing has forced me to make ungodly infernal robotics contraptions, which would wobble, hit the spacecraft, and break the panels forcing me to relaunch ten times or more until I finally didn\u0027t break anything. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis got me thinking: there are procedural parts mods for practically every single part type \u003Cem\u003Eexcept\u003C/em\u003E solar panels. It\u0027d be great if there was a mod that did just that, where you could adjust the length and width of the solar panel, with the power and mass scaling proportionately to the area.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-18T22:20:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis would indeed be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, no procedural parts have animations and I don\u0027t think this would be possible unless they were static solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T02:22:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat Augustus said.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
