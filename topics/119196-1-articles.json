As stated in the thread title, I registered, but did not receive any activation e-mail. I double checked to make sure that the e-mail address the registration screen reported having sent the e-mail to was correct and checked my spam folder. I also attempted to reregister with the same credentials and a different e-mail address, but that of course errored out on account of the username being a duplicate of the one I had already submitted. When I subsequently registered for the forums, I received an activation e-mail at the same address instantly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure this is the best place to report issues with the bugtracker, but I couldn\u0027t find any instructions on where to report such issues on the bugtracker site itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T09:32:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi jwbrase, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/26315-Ted\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETed\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E handles bug tracker stuff so let him know there\u0027s an issue and he can sort you out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
