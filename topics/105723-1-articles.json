The player could see how much drag or DeltaV that the craft would be wasting. This could also allow the \u0027Display Aero Forces In Flight\u0027 in the debug menu to be utilized in another way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a rough idea that popped into my head when loading up a new career mode in 1.0.
