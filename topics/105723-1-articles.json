This new building would hopefully help those new players and possibly some old players.\n\n[Aerodynamic Testing Facility]\n\nIn this building you can load up a craft, be it spaceplane, rocket, or just a plain old plane, a player would be able to see how the craft would react to different angles, speeds, or forces. The player could see how much drag or DeltaV that the craft would be wasting. This could also allow the \u0027Display Aero Forces In Flight\u0027 in the debug menu to be utilized in another way.\n\nJust a rough idea that popped into my head when loading up a new career mode in 1.0. Feel free to add your own ideas to it if want."},{"CreatedByName":"ADK","CreatedById":147710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T08:43:00Z","Content":"I know this thread is old but I got to say this is a very good idea.

It would be good to have.\n\nThough wasn\u0027t SQUAD saying it will be implemented soon-ish? I think I saw Harv saying he\u0027s working on that, but no info about it was said in the last few devnotes. So I guess it already passed Q\u0026A?
