The Serran description said it had a breathable atmosphere (so I wanted no helmets!) and it appears that in addition to the atmSuitBodies flag that it uses another setting where a certain amount of pressure is required, atmSuitPressure. I\u0027m not sure what the pressure is here but I set it to 0.01 just to guarantee it would trigger- it could be something that gets added to the CFG already being used in the Stock Texture Overhaul CFG."},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T22:18:37Z","Content":"Yeah, I\u0027ve had similar issues with transfer planning in RSS. The biggest problem IMHO is that Transfer Window Planner doesn\u0027t tell you the orbital elements of your transfer orbit.
