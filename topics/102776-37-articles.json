Vanor is very nice imo. \u003Cp\u003EAnd yeah, Landcontrol seems to be totally awesome and is probably a huge help with memory, it is just very time consuming to figure all of those PQSMods out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may be time consuming, but the end result is better and more natural than using color maps. There other alternatives to LandControl though, such as HeightColorMap, and also VertexSimplexNoiseColor can be used (like it\u0027s used for 2 NH bodies).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGas giants are created however you want, but yeah a lot of custom work needs to be done to get them perfect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really recommend looking into the PQS maods more instead of relying on color maps for surfaces like NH does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022amarius1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022amarius1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAshley, PLS send me a PM because I am in big config truble and I don\u0027t know the cause...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I get time I will\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hotblack Desiato\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hotblack Desiato\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m not yet on the latest NH-version, I think, it\u0027s 2 weeks old or so...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe latest version won\u0027t help tbh, it\u0027s something I thought I fixed a while ago.
