The plants suck in CO2 and H2O and expell O2. Assuming the water is coming from an outside source (mining the water on Mars), then slowly over time the O2 will build pressure within the habitat. The only way to prevent a problem from too much pressure would be to vent or store the excess atmosphere. The problem was, on the manifest provided, Mars One did not include any machinery for separating out the nitrogen from the O2 that would be vented/stored. So over time the habitat would dilute out its supply of nitrogen, causing the atmosphere to be primarily oxygen based leading to an extreme fire hazard.
