I think this situation would be okay. I just check the launch date of the vessel vs the contract acceptance date, and I believe that when you dock two vessels, if there are two launch dates, it uses the earlier one.\u003Cp\u003ESo what would happen is that it would not count until you undocked from the transfer stage again, at which point the newer launch date would be considered. As long as any one part is older than the contract, that parameter will shut off, meaning even if the station is built to the exact specifications of the contract, it won\u0027t count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, that\u0027s what I meant. If undocking from the transfer stage sets the launch dates of both ships back to their correct values, does that mean that launch dates are saved on a per-part basis? Maybe in that case it would be possible to only check the launch dates of all those parts the contract specifically requests.
