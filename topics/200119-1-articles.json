I\u0027m not such an old gamer for I actually started playing KSP fairly recently, but the wiki shows that these engines\u0027 textures were last updated in 0.18. Personally I like these engines\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EAND\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0their textures, but there is one thing that always troubles me:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003ETheir fairings are somehow not aesthetically satisfying.\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBTW, I mean the fairing generated when a decoupler is placed underneath the engine. The textures are simply not fit with all the whitish and smooth fuel tanks, it seems to me. I would sincerely hope that this could be enhanced in the next upgrade.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Le Lynx","CreatedById":208381,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-06T10:37:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, it right.
