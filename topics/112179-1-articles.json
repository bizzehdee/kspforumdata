The Kavalier Mk V.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/Gw3iJ)\n\nSpecs:\n\n- 4,929 vac DV\n\n- Two Nerva engines, cooled by minor thrust limitation settings and six large solar panels\n\n- Valar Morghulis Lander capable of atmospheric entry and escape (not tested on Laythe yet. Definitely not on Eve, let\u0027s be reasonable ![:kiss:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_kiss.gif)). Should let you grab plenty of space sciences and glory with the ability to return home. Remember to fuel it before heading planetside!\n\n- A crew module with seating for four kerbonauts. Room for five if you pack a kerbal in the lander for the whole trip\n\n- Air brakes for aerobraking both home and abroad\n\n- Trademark detachable fuel bow with plenty of juicy liquid fuels and mono pods to keep your vessel going in the void (also one section with oxidizer in case you\u0027d like to reuse that lander)\n\n- Craft includes booster stage which will put you in orbit easily. Follow instructions noted in VAB description for turn angles and heights\n\nI try to balance practicality with aesthetics but welcome feedback. If you do give it a go, I hope you enjoy. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\ncraft [https://www.dropbox.com/s/5ojro74ba0wwkbt/The%20Kavalier%20Mk%20V.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5ojro74ba0wwkbt/The%20Kavalier%20Mk%20V.craft?dl=0)\n\n\\*Updated\\* Lander legs should now reach ground... o.0\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-06T21:10:02Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2015 09:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LtWhiskers**"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor9","CreatedById":67915,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T15:55:05Z","Content":"Very interesting concept.
