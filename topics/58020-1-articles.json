A thread appeared recently where someone was asking for a science checklist, and after some searching I couldnt find one that was both comprehensive and up-to-date.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022But Celem, 0.23 added the science archives feature! So whats the point?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E, I hear you cry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell as you probably know the science archives show science you have actually collected, whether it was returned to Kerbin\u0027s surface or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever it does not list any science that you have never sampled. This makes some sense in-game since this info is really a spoiler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so, I have designed a complete database of every piece of science possible within the game.
