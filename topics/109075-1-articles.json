MIDI!","CreatedByName":"yithpistol","CreatedById":61110,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T18:18:54Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"yithpistol","CreatedById":61110,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T18:18:54Z","Content":"MIDI surface controllers can be had for fairly cheap and I see the potential for all the knobs (potentiometers) and sliders and finger pads and buttons, if not the music keys themselves. These little controllers are just begging to be utilized for something like the ALCOR, or simple fuel transfers to say nothing of being able to assign toggle type controls to buttons and variable value controls to sliders. More complex control surfaces allow for display of digital labels over each control (little LCDs or LED displays). It would take someone with more programming experience than I, so I throw it out to the modders as an idea. To get an idea of the potential of these devices just head over to sweetwater.com and take a gander at MIDI Controller surfaces. Especially the ones without keyboards. You will see a spaceship controller board just begging to get out. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T18:33:42Z","Content":"...aaand we\u0027ve gone full circle ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nIn the past, soundblasters came with a joystick (gamecontroller) port that doubled as a MIDI interface."},{"CreatedByName":"Vorg","CreatedById":74652,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T20:01:28Z","Content":"MS as even removed the MIDI driver from 7.

Anyway, the point is that this is a potential for TONS of extra buttons and sliders. I\u0027m not talking about keyboards. Just control surfaces. A lot of joysticks do have a lot of buttons, but you can always have more buttons. It\u0027s merely an untapped input source is all. Check out this page and tell me these don\u0027t look like something fun to use in this game? They do to me, which is why I brought this up. If not, then that\u0027s fine.
