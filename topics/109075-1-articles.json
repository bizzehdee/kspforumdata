These little controllers are just begging to be utilized for something like the ALCOR, or simple fuel transfers to say nothing of being able to assign toggle type controls to buttons and variable value controls to sliders. More complex control surfaces allow for display of digital labels over each control (little LCDs or LED displays). It would take someone with more programming experience than I, so I throw it out to the modders as an idea. To get an idea of the potential of these devices just head over to sweetwater.com and take a gander at MIDI Controller surfaces. Especially the ones without keyboards. You will see a spaceship controller board just begging to get out. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T18:33:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E...aaand we\u0027ve gone full circle \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the past, soundblasters came with a joystick (gamecontroller) port that doubled as a MIDI interface.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vorg","CreatedById":74652,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T20:01:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMS as even removed the MIDI driver from 7.

Anyway, the point is that this is a potential for TONS of extra buttons and sliders. I\u0027m not talking about keyboards. Just control surfaces. A lot of joysticks do have a lot of buttons, but you can always have more buttons. It\u0027s merely an untapped input source is all.
