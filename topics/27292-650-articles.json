I wanted to build a nuclear powered vehicle with the intention of exploring a planet and/or moon, then returning, then setting off again. One ship to handle everything from now on. I built said ship and got it into orbit, but in order to do so I had to send it up without fuel, it would have been too heavy otherwise. Then I experimented with refuelling systems. First I tried a spaceplane but could not get a viable one, and got impatient (after several hours). So I built a SSTO rocket that will bring over 10,000 units of jet fuel, and about 6,000 units of rocket fuel. It cost me about 400,000 kash to launch the bugger, but I was expecting to be able to land the tanker back on the planet and recover everything but the fuel of course. Mated up with the system explorer (SysEx), transferred the fuel, returned to Kerbin where it promptly disintegrated in the heat of the atmosphere. I wasn\u0027t expecting that!!! First time one of my ships has ever been subjected to that much heat. Or maybe I hit a goose way up there, who knows.
