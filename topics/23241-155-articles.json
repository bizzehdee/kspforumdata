The solution to this is to add a precooler, they work in this case because interstellar has a heat mechanic it institutes for them, and if that\u0027s not working add multiple of them, I.E. using splitters to connect multiple intake precooler combos\u0027 this gives you higher allowance to do the maneuvers needed in space. In this case the precooler has to be connected to the intake, you also cannot stake multiple precoolers behind one intake.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESheesh, that\u0027s going to be a real hassle.
