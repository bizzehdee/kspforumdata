I\u0027m not a plane expert, so maybe there\u0027s a trick I don\u0027t know, but it doesn\u0027t look to be possible to me.\n\nAlso, is that gonna be an F-117?"},{"CreatedByName":"DancesWithSquirrels","CreatedById":138267,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T17:17:14Z","Content":"Hard to tell, but you\u0027ve got **lots** of lift surfaces sloping down to the front, which will push your total lift vector to the back *(as those exert lift both down and to the rear)*.
