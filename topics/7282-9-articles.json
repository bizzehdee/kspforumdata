Truly, this game has evolved from when I started in .18.2, from a basic space simulator of orbital mechanics, to a highly polished game with a vast array of possibilities, and more arriving every update. The possibilities are more than endless, and I firmly believe that our community has some of the best, if not the best developers in the entire industry. Some decisions they make may not please every last member, but such is the way of development. However, I think we can all appreciate their profound ability to be given a small base to work on, and accomplish amazing things with it in a very big way. The way the Devs have bent, molded, and shaped the Unity engine into something that the original Unity coders could never have imagined, and turned it into a proper game, still, to this day, boggles my mind. I will forever appreciate the development platform that KSP uses, letting the community have a direct voice in the way the game takes shape, and furthermore, the Devs\u0027 overall attitude about the development process itself. These people seem, to me, to be very dedicated to the project and face every problem with a \u0022Yes we can\u0022 attitude, as well as taking things that already exist, and refining them further and further, increasing playability on a wider scale, and decreasing the footprint on the computer. I think it is very accurate to say that the Devs have, in fact, turned Unity into the Little Engine That Could. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, I\u0027d like to give appropriate thanks to SQUAD as a corporation. While I don\u0027t know too much about them, or how they operate, I hear that they\u0027ve basically fostered this whole project from the beginning, since it was an idea in Harv\u0027s head. This really is unheard of from a large corporation, and it says something about the business when they\u0027re able to maintain a project such as this. So, thanks to the ladies and gentlemen at SQUAD who have helped the Devs make this possible, and for not being evil.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, I\u0027d like to thank my own fellow moderators, and the entire moderation/community management team who I\u0027ve had the opportunity to work with for several months now. Truly, it is a privilege. You guys put up with my antics and you keep this community running like clockwork. This forum is one of the best-moderated ones I have ever seen. Everything has its place, and every topic is approached with an open mind, taking consideration so that the opinions of users are not smothered, rather than some other forums, where there is immense disorganization, inconsistency, and a general air of frequent abuse of power. I\u0027m glad that everyone on these teams certainly strives to maintain our good reputation to the public face.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPenultimately, I want to thank the amazing game-modding community that exists. You all are seriously awesome. You take the tools the Devs have kindly given out, and create things that you want to see in the game. Current release doesn\u0027t have it? You all make it happen. It\u0027s that sort of attitude that gets things done in the world. Not to mention that you are all working for no profit at all, yet release very high-quality mods to the community. In the same light, I want to thank the people who build very high-quality craft and release them to the community, you too are a large part of keeping the community well-versed in the way of always having a good ship design to go off of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd lastly, I\u0027d really just like to thank the community. Every one of you has done something amazing here, most of you\u0027ve committed your money to a project, at the very least, and further, have done awesome things with it. It really does take a certain type of person to play this game, and I guarantee there are several people among us who will go to space, in the real world, some time in the future. But really, every one of us is on the bleeding edge of highly-refined gaming technology.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s been awesome, here\u0027s to everyone involved with this community. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaiabladegold","CreatedById":43730,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T17:17:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you so much for not only giving me a way to fulfill the childhood dream bad health will not allow me, and thank you so much for making a superb game that is both entertaining as well as smart.
