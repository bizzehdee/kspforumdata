There would still be the on the fly staging sequence in the flight scene, but in the editors, it could be a more complex thing like in a tab, like crew management or action groups. Then you could have a more complex system, with features like somewhere to put the little action squares if you didn\u0027t want that part to trigger in the sequence at any time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mitchz95","CreatedById":82292,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-21T06:11:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t mind something like this in a later release, but stage lock and actions groups do the job pretty well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temeriki","CreatedById":3039,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-21T06:21:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAction groups get messed up after docking two different craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"XOIIO","CreatedById":100854,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-21T06:55:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also like to be able to change action groups as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slouch","CreatedById":97348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-21T09:15:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can re-order staging on the fly.

It could be managed by having collapsible lists so that you only see the ones you want. There could then be an option to allow separate lists to be either merged (so stage 0 merges with stage 0) or stacked (so stage 0 gets added to the end of the other list and becomes stage x). This could be taken even further allowing existing lists to be split into two or more - allowing for the suggestion above of having different groupings for launch, mission and return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI rarely come across situations where I wouldn\u0027t want something in the staging list, but it wouldn\u0027t hurt to have the functionality to remove items.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also think action groups should be adjustable on the fly. In fact I would like to be able to add actions into staging so I can automatically raise landing gear or extend solar panels without having to use an action group, for example.
