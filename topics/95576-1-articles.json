I tried to make escape features but at such a distance to bring one kerbal millions of kilometers away it takes a lot of fuel and time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I think that the KSP Team is following a good path and the Dev Team is doing a really fantastic job of managing the game and leading it in a new path also I hope the KSP Team has a really great year this year and a happy new year for 2015 and will consider this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T01:26:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMight I suggest Kerbal Attachment System (KAS).
