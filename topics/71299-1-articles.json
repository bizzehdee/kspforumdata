What happened? Is this realistic?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe standard KSP \u0022gravity turn\u0022 is pretty much the worst way to fly a rocket with FAR installed. The 10km vertical climb followed by a 45-degree pitch over maneuver (note: this is not a gravity turn) causes the rocket to become unstable because it can cause the drag and lift of the upper sections of the rocket to overpower whatever stabilizing elements might be at the bottom of the rocket; this can also happen in real life. Do a proper gravity turn; start it low in the atmosphere and keep aiming prograde through the atmosphere. This should allow you to control your rocket even with the most finicky of designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried this, and sometimes it works but other times my payload (which is encased in dynamic farings) just topples over when executing a low altitude gravity turn (at whatever angle even when following the prograde circle). Interestingly I have found the only way to not get my payloads to topple over so often is to launch until i\u0027m on the edge of the atmosphere and then pretty much turn 90 degrees, which does not seem realistic at all.

The CoM should always be as high as possible to make it more stable. Drag should always be as low down as possible to increase stability further. It\u0027s similar to how planes work - if the CoL is too close to the CoM, it\u0027s unstable and likewise, if the CoT is too close to the CoM in rockets, it\u0027s also unstable. If you want an easy to imagine example, try balancing a broom on your hand. You\u0027ll find it\u0027s easier when the head is at the top because the CoM is further away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the payload needs to be low drag and high mass, the lifter stage should be as light as you can make it and have more drag. Easiest way is to put fins as low down as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the launch profile, you should turn about 5-10 degrees once you reach about 80 m/s. Basically, don\u0027t point your rocket outside the prograde circle, at least not until you\u0027re out of the thick atmo. Try and keep your time to AP at about 40-50 seconds. If it goes higher, point down more. If that means you\u0027re pointing down a lot, throttle down instead. But really, the perfect gravity turn should be executed without SAS on at all - once you have a good starting angle and speed and as long as you ride the throttle, the rocket will turn itself and it\u0027ll be glorious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould you post a picture of your rocket?

Additionally, having a fat and tall payload makes things even harder as the surface area of the payload is much greater than the surface area of your rocket once the main boosters are decoupled, so the payload needed to be made slimmer to increase the aerodynamic control.
