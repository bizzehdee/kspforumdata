Also I almost always leave angle snap on, there are only a few cases that this isnt useful. Also if you are having trouble placing something that you know will fit, put the part anywhere it will stick. There is a bug that messes with part placement so if you place it in a random spot, it resets. Then just take it off and place it where you want it. You can make fine tune adjustments to your parts by holding down shift and pressing w, a, s, d, q, or e depending on which way you want to tilt your parts. I use this most for getting my lights at just the right angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour second question is not as easy to answer. Do some research and maybe find a design you like and modify it to your purposes. Or since you like sending up something that is your own design, just keep testing your designs and making corrections. Ksp is a whole lot of trial and even more error. But hey thats the fun of it all! Hope I could help.

If you just want a **** load of stuff in the orbit then what you need is to get yourself a big rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built delivery platform that brings up to 90 tons of payload in to 100km orbit and can reach stuff within 700km orbit and drop off the payload then return and power land on Kerbin all without using any of the payloads fulel. Rocket is stable and uses normal trajectory during Assent so Autopilots addons will put it in to orbit without a hitch. If you want the rocket let me know I will post it. It is large 1000 tons 420 parts but hopefully sometime in the future I can improve it and bring it in to 350 part count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe design is you have a platform with delivery system below and payload on top 4 largest tanks can fit on the payload platform but only 2 can be carried in to orbit due to weight, so any rovers or big station parts easily fits. But you will need to put them together in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have 2 largest tanks(36 ton ones) in orbit you can easily deliver one 1 and change to Muns orbit drop it there and come back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem though is that once you connect more than 6 modules in this game and call it a \u0022space station\u0022 you realized how the game lacks optimization. My computer with 2way SLI 680 cards, 32gigs of ram and best intel core i7 cpu you can buy overclocked to 4.4Ghz, starts laggin as if I am playing latest visual marvel with stunning visuals at maximum graphics. All while both GPUs are falling sleep at 10-15% load CPU running at whooping 15% and ram use for entire system is 7gigs. It just goes to show that it\u0027s not the computer that matters as many think, the game is not optimized and that is sad. So be prepared to face increasing crippling lag as you put your dream station together and enjoy the **** load of fuel you delivered there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SDIR","CreatedById":59117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-07T02:52:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo address the problem about fuel, if you are willing to install some mods, refuelling will be easy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst install the Kethane mod to start mining for resources.
