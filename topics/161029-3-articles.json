It breaks the monotony because you also have cooperation, hilarity, and unexpected things happening. It was actually quite the opposite of what you are describing.\u00A0 There were no griefers, and there was no anger flying everywhere.. I think it has more to do with the mindset of people who play KSP. We aren\u0027t mostly a bunch of raging teenagers behind a simulated M16 with a bunch of noobs out in front of us to wipe out and gloat... instead we are more of a building community.. we like to experiment, build things, tweak things, see how they change, etc. Collaboration is just one more thing that makes the game wonderful. One of the reasons that this game has such a fantastic modding community, is because most are a cut above the rest in intelligence and patience. I mean.. the game does have somewhat of a learning curve.. if you have no patience, this is definitely not a game for you.

Remember that every craft in KSP is built using discrete parts that all interact with each other when they are within physics range. All the force calculations that happen with each part during each frame need to be done by that central server and then sent out over the wire to each player for \u003Cem\u003Eevery focused craft\u003C/em\u003E. This is not a flight sim where each craft is represented by, say, a single object that can have flags applied to represent damage to certain parts, this is a flight sim where every part has its own trajectory and interacts with all other parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a non-trivial problem to solve. If it were as easy as you claim it would have been done already.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 There is no bandwidth problem.. You need to think of this as a seeding framework.. when two computers with the same data have the same number input into them, they always end up with the same outcome. Hence all that has to be communicated is control input, and the amount of force.. the client will take care of the rest. Hence, You need X/Y/Z coordinates, Heading,orientation, and force applied (input) from the keyboard controls. If something does go out of whack due to one system lagging behind the other, it gets updated with the Orientation data rather quickly and continues from there..This is a very small amount of data for modern bandwidth capabilities, even if you have 100\u0027s of ship pieces floating around... Both computers end up with the same outcome. It already has been done... but it needs refined. The major problem is ghosting when docking (2 ships copy themselves then instantly collide and explode), and player control during docking (who gets control when two ships dock?)..\u00A0 Some of these work some of the time, but not always... those are the major issues that need addressed.. there has to be a fundamental set up to control it all.. Hence, why squad would be best suited to handle it. Time control for warping has also been addressed, rather well I might add.. If you time warp, and I am in the past, your data gets updated (in the future) as I make changed (in the past) then once I\u0027m ready to work with you, I simply press \u0022Sync time\u0022 It updates me to where I would be in orbit if I was at the time frame you are in..

Every client now has to calculate this closed system itself. So now it\u0027s not a bandwidth problem, it\u0027s a CPU problem based on the lowest common denominator; if someone lags out then everyone has to lag out to remain in sync? I think that might work for two people but as soon as you add another, or a larger, more complicated craft to the mix, things get slow mighty quickly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo It\u0027s scene oriented for each focused craft (see below for more details), ....as for the rest....once again.. the least common denominator doesn\u0027t matter, because of the syncing of the details I described. If Im ahead of you by one calculation, then my output becomes the basis for the entire X,Y,Z \u002B orientation, as my data was sent to the server first.. this info is passed to the server, and then It updates you accordingly even if you are slightly behind... as i\u0027ve said,\u00A0 It\u0027s already been done. there isn\u0027t much data involved. If X object collides on my screen a second before it happens on your screen, the server has recieved the data of x,y,z,orientation of the debr from mei, and the server realizes this and removed the craft accordingly on your screen, then adds the coords and orientation of each piece of debris, which is only a few variables.. Your next ping to the server will include that updated data, and pass it on and remove the craft automatically and place the new data for the debris. Even if your game completely freezes because your CPU is slow, it doesn\u0027t matter.. it will update accordingly when it unfreezes. Hence the fastest CPU simply passes on what happened before your computer calculates it. In this way, the fastest computer rules the day, not the slowest. As for the amount of data being passed by the server, it requires roughly a 56k modem for the client receiving it. lol (little exaggeration, but not by much when compared to today\u0027s standards \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E ...)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 As for each scene, you can think of each focused craft as a separate room where calculations are done. If you are on Duna, and I am on kerbin, the only thing that gets updated for me are the coords of your ship.. I don\u0027t need all your other data.. If your ship breaks apart.. I don\u0027t need all the variables of whats happening.. I only need the coords of your debris. your computer already calculated everything that happened..
