A station with an altitude of 400km around kerbin, 2 modules on the mun with more to come for my kethane Operation, a Polar orbit Probe around Mun and Minmus fitted with a GPS and Kethane Scanner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy actual task is to build a Space Tanker that will Deliver the converted Kethane from Mun to the Tanker. That Tanker will then be fueling the Raven Station for crafts on their way to interplanetary travel if I ever need to fuel a stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my main task for now since I probably want to Visit Duna. My Second task will be a Probe with an engine. A self orbit changing Probe so to say.
