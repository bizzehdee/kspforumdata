KIS adds items which Kerbals can hold and use. It adds non-functional guns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut how about making the guns functional and even adding bazookas which launch small missiles (a handheld Hydra rocket pod maybe?). Also maybe having small parts to build custom holdable items and a separate editor for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals of course should also be able to use the harpoon from KAS on EVA.

Combined with an encached IVA mod (movement inside vehicles), and with a life support mod (if the windows or the hull of a module are damaged, it gets decompressed. any kerbals which do not have EVA suits will die). If you combine it with multiplayer, you will basically have Arma 3 in KSP...Imagine...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking forward to a giant war on Kerbin and to attacking munbases with custom rocket launchers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T20:37:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI saw a screenshot of a kerbal holding a gun (looked like the screwdriver with a gatling gun barrel) on the KIS thread I believe, forget who posted it or made the item though.
