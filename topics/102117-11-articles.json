There are already a number of bugs and glitches, ranging from the mildly annoying to the game-breaking, and this number will likely increase with the release of 1.0.

That is a remarkable show of loyalty and interest; with most games, people would just want the thing to launch so\u0027s they could start a new save, but this community wants it to launch \u003Cem\u003Ewell, \u003C/em\u003Eeven if that means launching later than they\u0027d like and continuing to play careers that they know will be deleted in the great purge of 1.0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease make use of the massive testing resource this community is offering! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut as a software developer you must also know that this is not always possible. Even though we like to think of Squad as independent, they have a CEO and someone who may very well be setting deadlines for them, similar to how a publisher would be. As a result, we often get buggy software and games because it is a constant battle to implement the features of a game or software and keep it bug free. And moreso, you must know the cycle can be endless. Fixing bugs often creates new bugs. At some point you just have to put the features in, squash as many bugs as you can, and release it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to see more beta patches, but it may not be in Harvester and other\u0027s control (which it sort of sounds like it based on what they have said).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BrainiacBlue","CreatedById":118201,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T17:14:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhislt I beleive that the goal list should *cough* have been reviewed *cough* at some point in the last few years *cough* I think you should only do one additional feature: finish the Kerbol System to add those gas giants and asteroid belt that you said you would a few months ago back when we were still in Alpha.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that just add all of the polish.
