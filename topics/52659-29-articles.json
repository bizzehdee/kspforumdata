It used to be that mod developers would attempt to balance things either to stock or to \u0022reality\u0022 and also try to make them compatible with other popular mods like Deadly Reentry or FAR. Nowadays the user community has to create a MM config file to add that functionality. And who here knows enough about how FAR works to put in \u0022realistic\u0022 numbers for how a certain wing shape should perform? I certainly don\u0027t. This is just a bit of a minor rant that I don\u0027t like the state of affairs and it will probably start turning me off using certain mods. I just wish it were different. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m trying my best to balance them after stock standards. However as mentioned, sometimes stock parts seem to have some minor balance problems which I hope to improve without doing too extreme changes. For instance the stock mk2 fuselage: It has roughly the length of the fl-t 800 LFO tank, yet it can only contain 160 units of fuel, wheras the LFO tank as the name says has 800 units (360LF\u002B440LOX, same density) and then the mk2 fuselage is extended to the sides and top, so if we consider the volume alone the MK2 fuselage could hold like 10 times the amount of fuel that it has in the stock game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever - The MK2 fuselage isnt a rocket tank, even tho it uses the same fuel. For planes you probably want different structural reinforcements, seen as a higher crash tolerance in game, also some space would be required for electronics and plumbing, maybe tubing to lead your Intake Air from intakes to engines etc. All these things would take away space for fuel containers so I\u0027ve decided for the same dry weight and an amount of 600, slightly less compact storage than the rocket equivalent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in short, Aircraft Fuselage compared to rocket fuel tank:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-less compact fuel storage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-structually stronger (higher crash tolerance)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-same dry weight (aka slightly more dry weight per fuel unit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-better aerodynamic properties (little bit of lift value)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for FAR and DRE I\u0027m just as clueless as you guys how to write the configs, this is something I want to screw around with at the very end of this project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone has already written some for their own pleasure you can send em to me and I\u0027ll include em in the download.
