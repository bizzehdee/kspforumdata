It has chairs and windows and people in it. It has a thing on it that keeps it safe from the fire when the people box hits the tiny part of the air really high up until it gets to the bigger part of the air lower down. Then clothes-type stuff on it (the same type that the people who fall from the sky have in a back-pack to slow them down) comes out and slows the people box down and it lands on the ground near home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbove it is the ball-type thing that has a ring on it that puts it-self together with the space city. It can have people in it, but only when the space-car is in space. The people then go into the space-city when the space-car is put together with the Space-City. It is thrown away after the People-Box goes down home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one under the People-Box has weird wet air in it for burning, and other weird air that burns when it touches the other air. There are things on it that takes the weird air and burns it and moves the Space-Car. There are also lots of really tiny things just like that that turn the Space-Car. It is also thrown away when the People-Box goes down home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe people who made this type of Space-Car (There were others) were not happy with and racing with the people who made the type of Space-Car that went to the other world and back.

And now for my one(this is HARD). The people who once made that lander thing that broke also wanted to go to the dark place with no air. But they didn\u0027t have an up goer to get there. This up goer flies like a side goer but then keeps side going but also up a bit until it gets to the dark place with no air. It has different funny up goer push things (which up goer 5 had 5 of) that eat air but only sometimes because when there is no air they don\u0027t. They are point-like but only sometimes. When they are in the place with no air they are not point-like. It was made by the people who fought the people who went to the place where up goer 5 was made and made it for those people a long time ago but now they are all friends. It can carry heavy stuff to the place with no air and then land like a side goer.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T13:30:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECorrect!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it the Skylon \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.reactionengines.co.uk/images/spacestations/station-skylon-orbit-1024.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022station-skylon-orbit-1024.jpg\u0022\u003E?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr maybe the venture star?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tom1499","CreatedById":38308,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T16:14:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECorrect!
