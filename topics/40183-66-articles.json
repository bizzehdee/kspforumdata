I used the debug tool to actually run the program, but usually you have to wait 24 hours in game for the automated system to run. You have 4 vessels in space and I think 3 of them have the repair part on them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I did notice and totally forgot about is that the Single Mission Repair Mission in random contracts does not work anymore and all repair missions are now done from the contracts missions instead so I will have to make sure to delete that mission in random missions (randommissions mission package) next version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo things seem to be fine on my side with MCE. Have you tried the debug tool yet? Its the Find Vessel Repairs button and if you have the bebug menu open you will be able to see MCE choosing one of your satellites in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note the automated system is completely halted until you finish or dismiss your current contract, right now your contract is locked in place which actually stops the whole system from running every 24 hours in game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd last note when testing the automated system it runs like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you use time compression in the spaceCenter view or any other screen you must go to another screen for the time acceleration to take effect.

The only exception is when vessel ID changes, or your mission has an EVA goal in it.
