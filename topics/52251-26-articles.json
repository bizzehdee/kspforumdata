I misread the mass for the current leader, thus ended up .050 tonnes heavier than the leader (didn\u0027t realize it until half way through the mission). A little frustrating since I could have easily been less given:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) I brought waaaaayyyyy too much fuel. I had at least 4 tonnes too much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) I forgot solar panels on my last stage. This forced me to keep my last lander attached, which could have been used for more landings (as it was it was just dead weight the entire trip).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods: MechJeb (only used for checking delta v stats)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding order: Laythe, Vall, Tylo, Bop, Pol, \u003Cstrong\u003EDuna\u003C/strong\u003E (had to do something with all that extra fuel!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnique features: Separate lander for each moon, no RCS or docking ports\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor landers, I used a command chair with a small probe to provide SAS. Since the lander weight consisted mostly of fuel, I decided against a reusable lander in favor of separate ones. This eliminated any need for RCS or docking ports. I don\u0027t know if it actually saved weight overall but it was certainly easier to not have to dock after each landing. It also allowed me to fine tune the delta V of each lander for the specific landing. My Tylo lander in particular was nice - good TWR on the landing stage made the landing very easy. The ascent stage was minimal and had plenty of delta V. My Laythe lander was actually the worst. I didn\u0027t use a parachute and my lander wanted to tip over. Fortunately I happened to land on a high spot at 3500m because I didn\u0027t quite make orbit during takeoff. Jebediah had to jetpack it to make it back to the main ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith so much extra fuel I decided to land on Duna on the way back. It took me a whole bunch of quick loads to get the landing right (I landed a very tall ship that rested directly on my nuclear engine). Eventually got it though. I returned to Kerbin with over 900 delta V still in the tanks. I could easily have landed on Minmus with the right aerocapture maneuver, but I was growing tired of it at that point so I just landed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven how this mission went, I think a 45 tonne ship is possible.......not sure I have the patience to give it another go though.

I downloaded the FTmN engines and they look good, but they have a lot of advantage against the stock nukes, especially in fuel efficiency (fuel consumed for a given thrust), but their Isps are better too, have lower mass/thrust ratio, and they have 2.5x better vectoring ranges. And yeah, dealing with the number of parts is in the Challenge too, so this would give you too much advantage and wouldn\u0027t be fair with those who made it on stocks, so I can\u0027t allow it, sorry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut they look pretty cool and if you want to use them anyway then go for it.
