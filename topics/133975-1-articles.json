I use some mods which you can notice, but am pretty conservative and only use those that I feel mesh well with the stock game visually and functionally. Lastly, I always want to be creative and neat with the things I build. I feel there is a lot of easy or obvious ways to build craft in the game that nearly everyone does, due to convenience and the parts available, and I try to avoid those for interest\u0027s sake.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:tahoma, geneva, sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EKJ-20 Vulture Jet\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EAtmospheric survey p\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003Elane.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/3NXosZMUzuw?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the best flying plane I\u0027ve ever seen or had in KSP, it is above all simply\u00A0fun to fly. Not only does it have a high speed\u00A0just under supersonic, making it bearable for flying out for survey contracts, it can turn on a dime with huge amounts of lift and is remarkably\u00A0stable. It is suitably flyable that a non-pilot Kerbal is fine to use with it. I wanted to try making a plane that did not have a rear horizontal stabilizer, like a tiny space shuttle, and largely fluked amazing performance out of it. One interesting design note is that I have StockPlus installed, allowing me to tweak the authority of control surfaces, which I have used to align the vertical stabilizers on the wing tips to be straight into the airflow even though they are attached on an angle.\u00A0This is done by having them be \u0022deployed\u0022 with very low authority, and testing reveals that this does increase speed. I can toggle those surfaces to be \u0022undeployed\u0022, which angles them in and increases drag for\u00A0a useful landing configuration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:tahoma, geneva, sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWH-6 Helicopter\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESpace Center operations, science and recovery.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/K1mfAiJUYiA?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany respect to Kerbal Aircraft Expansion for enabling me to build a helicopter! Unfortunately, this helicopter had a bit of a rough prototype phase which\u00A0resulted\u00A0in the death of two Kerbals, including renowned engineer Bill Kerman. That was due to it\u0027s desire to flip over into a non-recoverable state while yawing at speed. The problem may have been the angle of the aerodynamic surfaces attaching the landing skids to the craft, however it\u00A0was since stabilized by incorporating new reaction wheel systems, which allow any degree of induced roll to be recoverable. Still, the craft now features an\u00A0eject-able main rotor and parachutes. This helicopter also has pontoon landing skids, as I had planned for it to be water\u00A0land-able, but my estimate for the buoyancy was not correct and it does not float at a reasonable level.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:tahoma, geneva, sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EZUREK V Orbiter\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003ELow Kerbin orbit tourism.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/32n8S/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOriginally designed as that next step up from a simple\u00A0MK1 pod for putting Kerbals into low orbit around Kerbin, it excelled in every way, and it\u0027s reliability, cost effectiveness, and ease of use led to it\u0027s usage for tourism. In fact it has launched many more tourists around the planet than it has official mission astronauts, due to lack of science equipment aboard.\u00A0The prerequisites for design were to have something more comfortable and roomy than the MK1 pod (Very little options available at the time of design), to have the final stage engine also\u00A0be part of the return vehicle for efficient vessel recovery, and to have a more interesting return system than a nose-cone parachute. As a plus it\u00A0also turned out\u00A0pretty cute. The craft features remote\u00A0probe core control, despite being crewed, which not only made the dangerous prototype stage much more Kerbal-friendly (Oh yes, the utility tower came off once or twice during the first re-entries!), but it also allows all Kerbals aboard to be tourists which is a great advantage. Due to not going into high orbits, the ship does not need a heat shield and instead uses the engine to protect itself on re-entry along with radiators to manage heat. I had just watched a video of the Orion craft landing from space before designing this, and was partly inspired by it\u0027s jettisoning cover over the main chutes to do something similar. As you can see the main chutes are tucked away behind radiator panels, which are ejected just before they deploy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#696969;\u0022\u003E________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EI\u0027m sure I\u0027ll make more things in the future, hopefully bigger and better than ever, and I hope to update this post.
