No intake spamming, just high TWR with the jets (1.3) to bruteforce its way as high and fast as possible in the atmosphere, relying only on the NERVAs\u0027 efficiency to do the rest. Some piloting skills required, as this thing\u0027s operational ceiling while on jets is somewhat on the low side (25k if you still want to be able to pitch up before the rocket switch), but the good thing is that you only need 1500m/s before the switch. After activating rockets, immediately pull up to a 45 degree angle and just stay there until you reach your desired apoapsis. 100x100 is the most I\u0027d recommend but if you put more intakes on it it should be able to go higher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh btw, if you put it to a spin, don\u0027t open the chutes and expect it to save your kerbals. Those are for landing assists, not emergency. It WILL break the ship if it\u0027s spinning.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T20:28:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022littlebattler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022littlebattler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBecause Rune\u0027s 7 kerbal minibus is still more awesome than this.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELOL!

I went for highest TWR while carrying twin NERVAs, which explains the lack of fuel and wings. On the other hand, my trial runs were mostly imperfect (losing altitude at around 15km because of stall) and the plane still manages to get to orbit, so I don\u0027t think fuel is a problem. I think an open deck version might work even better, but comfort is important \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T22:42:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img29/7882/vu6i.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vu6i.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8 kerbals to 75x75 then dock with station at 120x120.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGranted, it can\u0027t fly under FAR (wing snapage) but it does a good job at, well, it\u0027s job.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"littlebattler","CreatedById":73508,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T06:18:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Captain Sierra\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Captain Sierra\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img29/7882/vu6i.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vu6i.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8 kerbals to 75x75 then dock with station at 120x120.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGranted, it can\u0027t fly under FAR (wing snapage) but it does a good job at, well, it\u0027s job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, B9 has parts better suited for heavy SSTOs.
