It appears to have been working the whole time, and I only thought it wasn\u0027t working because something was different about the tooltip in VAB. I also play a 10x Kerbol game with RftS engines, and they show a minimum throttle on the tooltips. In RO, this shows up as a minimum thrust (not throttle) I believe. I was getting these 2 confused.
