Some of them have been suggested before but here they are grouped into a, hopefully, more comprehensive, overall system. Not all have to be added together but they seem to work well together IMO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHarmonise action groups and staging\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAction groups and staging are \u003Cem\u003Every \u003C/em\u003Esimilar. I can actually perform a launch using just action groups, without hitting the space bar to stage once. In addition in action groups I can perform additional tasks, such as opening solar panels and locking gimbals etc, which I cannot do in staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I am suggesting is that the two are harmonised so that any action can be performed in either staging \u003Cem\u003Eor\u003C/em\u003E action groups. This gives greater flexibility in staging, possibly reducing the need for some action groups, hence freeing them for other uses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also hope that having them harmonised would be easier and more efficient coding wise (but I\u0027m no dev!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMerge/Append staging modes\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen building craft currently the game decides where best to place new items in the staging list, not always in the most appropriate place. This is particularly apparent when adding a sub-assembly with several stages - these stages are merged in with existing ones possibly creating a mess that needs rearranging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion here is that there be two modes for staging: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMerging, which performs as it does now, by merging like nodes together (or by adding new parts where it thinks best)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAppending (or stacking), which adds each new part as a new stage at the bottom of the stack, and which stacks stages from sub-assemblies at the bottom of the current list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could be simply controlled by shift clicking when adding a new part, for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition this could be useful when docking two craft, instead of merging the staging lists (as is done currently) giving an option to stack them instead may produce a cleaner list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECraft specific stage, and action group, lists\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk so I guess this already exists really but I\u0027m thinking of making it more controlled. Each craft can have a root icon from which that craft\u0027s staging list, and action groups, \u0027hangs\u0027 (and can be expanded or collapsed for tidiness).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs just noted above, when docking craft, merged staging creates a mess. Using this method when two (or more) craft are docked there would then be a root icon for each craft, keeping each set of stages and action groups entirely segregated, so it is simple to see what is what. A specific craft can be \u0027active\u0027 meaning that staging list is the one that triggers on space bar. Undocking will produce no nasty surprises or rearranged lists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor permanently docked vessels (when building stations), there could be an option to merge (or stack) the two lists into a single node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere could possibly be additional options to split lists into two nodes for breaking up stations, or creating stage groups based on mission part (such as launch, transfer, landing etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs each node also has its own set of action groups this could overcome the issues that others have that there are currently not enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s about it.

Why would I have add a stage but keep it inactive? If i wanted to trigger something at a point out of staging order then I\u0027d either do it via right click, or via an action group. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also seems to me that, even if you set all the stages to inactive during docking (which sounds like a lot of clicking), they would still become merged as before - just that one set is inactive. It would prevent stages from the other ship triggering but I feel that simply keeping two separate lists would be clearer, easier to manage and without a lot of clicking during docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not really sure what you mean regarding probes I\u0027m afraid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInactive stages would be useful on space stations if staging events are still possible so you can relegate them to inactive stages.

There is no unwanted merging but allows an optional merging/stacking if desired, and without the need to manually move individual stages into inactive status. Only one list is active at any time, changeable as needed. And allowing for more than one staging list per vehicle means it would be possible to create entirely separate lists, during build, for craft that will undock during the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess the two ideas are actually very similar.
