In other words ignore it. And by ridiculous cost you mean, \u0022Ridiculous cost in the Real World with government contractor beaurocracies and political interest lobbying?\u0022 then yes.. that doesn\u0027t apply to \u003Cstrong\u003EFantasy Kerbal Land\u003C/strong\u003E at all. Think about it... do you honestly think a realistic space program would allow that many accidents, ignore safety standards, insurance, and everything else that\u0027s involved? If that were true the entire KSP would balloon up to be more expensive than their entire military budget.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the Cost number is finally relevant, and if you\u0027ve kept track of the descriptions of each KSO part (I don\u0027t expect you to since you said you don\u0027t use it?), the KSO Consortium (Murika SuperStellar, Orbitz Aerospace, Kerbal Materials Corp., and so on) made the KSO and its parts to be competitive with any other system. Think of them as a private venture similar to Scaled Composites. Their analogs being:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMurika Superstellar: Boeing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbitz Aerospace: BAE Aerospace\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Materials Corp: Scaled Composites or Textron\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVEG Design Group: General Dynamics or Lockheed Martin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor its weight, size, cargo capacity the whole purpose of the KSO consortium was to design a lifter that was cheaper but that at the same time allowed for an orbiter that could safely land at any prepared runway, used civilian navigational systems (hence the various nav radios on the side panels), and pretty much handled like a true aircraft once in the proper atmospheric pressure. The KSO does not handle like a NASA Shuttle or Buran orbiter at all. It handles like a glider and flies and lands similar to a 737 as opposed to a falling rock. Westi29 rated its stall speed at about 75 mph, landing speeds are about 90 to 100mph with 120mph being more common.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen we have the issue of program costs versus real world stuff. Obviously the startup cost for any Kerbin nation or Corporation (the KSO was designed to be a commercial vehicle, not just a publicly funded vehicle) will be a lot more expensive than a similar disposable conventional rocket program (1.2 Billion US compared to 100-250 Million for traditional capsule return system). That means that for 1.2 Billion (plus options) any Kerbin nation, Corporation, or shoot... very rich individual could own their very own KSO with lifter (support systems, maintenance program sold separately). Those are my figures for Kerbal land, not real world figures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then we have construction and reusability. The KSO uses kerbon-graphite monocoque construction on top of titanite or alium frames. Its wings use kyrofoam cores with polykerbon honeycomb sheeting (similar to an F-16\u0027s control surfaces). Hence they are super light, but very strong. Its heat shield uses an advanced aerogel that requires very little maintenance if any (replacement of some of the tiles begins at around the third launch). Again keep in mind size of Kerbin, atmospheric density, and the size of the KSO. Also, the rest of the KSO\u0027s internal components are off the shelf, significantly reducing its cost further. Need to replace its tires? Any aviation grade radials of the same size will do. Need to replace an actuator? Same thing. Servos? Same thing. It\u0027s multi-function displays break? Order a new one from a variety of companies (Anatid Robotics, RPM Industries, etcetera).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lifter itself is currently disposable, but I\u0027m sure various programs or companies have their own lifter version that may be reusable. Keep in mind that the KSO can be purchased standalone (800 million for a Block 7) and you can provide your own lift vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t worked out what the launch cost is compared to the real world. I\u0027ve figured given the entire program, you\u0027d be looking at 100million for your first launches and slowly that price would reduce down to about 40-50 million per launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, just some fluff!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, that KSO you\u0027re flying costs about 800 million US..

Also, and personally I\u0027ve found this incredibly helpful for using MechJeb with the shuttle, raise your maneuver planner tolerance from 0.1m/s to 6.0m/s (yes, 6.0m/s - NOT 0.6m/s).
