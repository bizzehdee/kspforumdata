I think that the \u0022body\u0022 should fall back away from the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E In case you don\u0027t understand what I\u0027m talking about I\u0027ll try to explain it a little better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you launch your ship off the Launch Pad you usually use some Stability Enhancers so you ship doesn\u0027t tip over before launch. Well I\u0027ve noticed that sometimes (very rarely) after you launch your ship the \u0022arms\u0022 of the Stability Enhancers that connect to your ship decouple and drop down but that still leaves the \u0022body\u0022 of the Stability Enhancers standing right in the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E For instance if you have a really tall rocket with a few Stability Enhancers attached to the bottom, middle, and top of the craft then the \u0022body\u0022 of the Stability Enhancers toward the top can clip your rocket and cause bad things to happen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thought on a solution would be to make the \u0022body\u0022 of the Stability Enhancer fall away from the craft instead of just standing there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould you somehow be able to make the stock Stability Enhancer do this? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould you have to create an animation for it? or could you just change something in the cfg file ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do believe that the FASA pack has some that do this but I want the stock Stability Enhancer to do this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERambling Done!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-07T10:26:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould need to replace the stock stability enhancer itself to do it.
