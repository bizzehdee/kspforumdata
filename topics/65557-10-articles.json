It differs from the regular pendulum by the two additional relevant degrees of freedom driven mainly by precession (there is interaction between them and the regular pendulum degrees of freedom). Those degrees of freedom are already there in the regular pendulum (take one, rotate the weight about the x axis, release), of course, it\u0027s just that they are strongly damped and thus not normally relevant.\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Momentus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Momentus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere is no practical, theoretical or ethical reason for Cambridge to so grotesquely distort the original.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are practical reasons.
