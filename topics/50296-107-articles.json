If I had to choose one to call \u0027Real\u0027 I\u0027d go with Normal and then try to code the mod to behave realistically on the default settings, with the caveat that I might have to abstract some things in the interest of game play. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, tl;dr, the difficulty menu is simply about giving people who think it\u0027s too hard or not hard enough an easy way of changing things up at the push of a button. I probably won\u0027t get the answers I\u0027m seeking with my request and I posted it with that knowledge in mind so I\u0027ll end up just choosing some some obvious candidates to change values for and put the update out.
