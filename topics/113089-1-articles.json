This would avoid having to add in extra probe cores and/or docking ports for a craft that moves in multiple directions (such as a VTOL lander), but more importantly helps avoid having to stick a probe core on the front of a lander to drive it effectively (seriously, even the Rovemate\u0027s navball points straight upwards when the best way to drive a rover is with a sideways-pointing navball to show the direction the rover is going in).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BoomShroom","CreatedById":124216,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T05:34:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis seems like a wonderful idea.
