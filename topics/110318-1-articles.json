What is far more needed is an alarm clock system. In KSP, missions take months or years, most of which is idly drifting through space, interspersed with a few minutes, at most, that require the player. There\u0027s virtually no chance that you would have to be attending to two things at the same time on separate missions. If we do the math, and we assume that the distribution of player input times is random (A bit of a spherical-cow assumption), and that each of those instances takes five minutes, and you have say 50 instances (A quite large number, really) per in-game year, then the chance of having two events at the same time is: 5.3127076511630764472152467433303981261085575475531642760906042083334359\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D10^-8.

Kerbal alarm clock is an essential mod to me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill as as you say the time scale is vast and events in that scale are rare which to me means if you focus on one mission at stay with it and warp those empty bits of time you neglect the space centre. If you keep an eye on the space centre and getting funds up to target the next interplanetary window by the time you come back to the first mission and its year long drift through space it could be days or weeks depending how much real life has gotten in the way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo to me splitting the time would allow us to wear two hats.
