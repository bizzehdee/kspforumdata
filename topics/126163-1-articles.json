They will be cheap tiny things, and I have two questions:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. Duna\u0026#39;s atmosphere is thin from what I know, do I need heat shields? Something like this is what I have in mind for my first Duna lander:\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/2pgghd1.jpg[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Since its atmosphere is rather dense, will one 1.5m heat shield be enough for Eve?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;m specifically asking for 1.5 and its somewhat reworked atmosphere.

The Eve one will be similar but wider and flatter due to the heat shield.\n"}]}
