The following is a edited quote from that other thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA quick idea I had of my ideal multiplayer for this game would be a coopetition kind of mode, place 4-5 KSC\u0027s around Kerbin, each would be part of their own \u0022country\u0022. At the beginning of the game the players either choose they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re location or are given one randomly from the 4-5 preexisting KSC\u0027s. Give each player the ability to trade with the other players if they chose to, or compete in a kind of \u0022Space race\u0022 scenario, but make it so other player can only see other players creations but not touch them unless some sort of permission is given. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really like the idea of a \u0022Kommand \u0026amp; Kontrol\u0022 mode too, one person teams up with another. One is the \u0022Pilot\u0022 and the other is \u0022Kommand\u0022. The pilot is stuck in IVA, make it so hes stuck in a first person space suit as well, and all he has is his instruments and those tiny windows to guide his craft. And then you have \u0022Kontrol\u0022 who\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s stuck with maps and telemetry from the craft in question and the two players have to kommunicate to get things done. You could add this to the coopetition mode and allow a total of 8-10 players as 4-5 teams of 2. A little thing I just thought of that would keep things interesting, make it so the \u0022Pilot\u0022 and \u0022Kontrol\u0022 could switch places if they wished. Let \u0022Kontrol\u0022 have some support rolls, like they control the rovers and probes, unless the pilot is given equipment to do so. \u0022Kontrol\u0022 can control things that take two different craft like a X-15 test craft type scenario, \u0022Kontrol\u0022 flies the drop craft while the pilot flies the X-15 analog, that way the drop craft doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t just crash ruining all the K-bucks you spent on it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMultiplayer could be an awesome experience, as long as they cater to both the PvP and cooperation crowds, hopefully providing tools to keep them separate. I can see the appeal of a space war with another player, as long as iv agreed to it or am aware it could happen and can prepare myself for the eventual conflict. Maybe give players some political tools, trade agreements, declarations of war, etc.. and these things would be needed to be agreed on by both players for there to be any effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. I am aware the devs have said they will not put weapons of war into KSP, but now with MP announced it will be inevitable there will be player conflicts. Please don\u0027t put weapons of war into the game but allow players to \u0022invent\u0022 there own weapons with the provided pieces and allow some sort of war like scenario, for those players that wish to have it. But please make it separate from the rest of MP so as to keep the griefers at bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: The \u0022Kommand \u0026amp; Kontrol\u0022 idea is not wholly mine, there have been several threads around the forums that have stated this idea in one way or another, I just added a K instead of a C and squished it all into one paragraph, and added my own enthusiasm for such an idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-15T00:41:05Z\u0022 title=\u002212/15/2013 12:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Savage117\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-14T21:35:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy the hell would conflict be inevitable?
