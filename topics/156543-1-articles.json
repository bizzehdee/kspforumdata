It would give 100% of the science instead of having to run the same experiment multiple times to max it out. I don\u0027t remember the name of the mod. Are there any mods that will let me collect 100% of the science?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile we\u0027re on the subject of gathering science, I\u0027m using Automated Science Sampler and it does part of its job pretty well. It falls flat on another. What it does well is fire off experiments when they are available, it then collects the data and transfers it to the control pod with no issues. What it sucks at is resetting experiments like the SC-9001 and the MysteriousGoo. And yes, Bill is on board. I\u0027m not running any parts mods and the science parts are pure stock, so I\u0027m not sure what the issue is. Are there any other mods out there that will collect the science data and reliably reset experiments?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MalevolentNinja","CreatedById":150038,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-16T20:19:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can do that with a module manager patch.
