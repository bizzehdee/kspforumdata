It\u0027s a LOT easier than typing in a 9-digit designation. I did some calculations and found that it just barely orbits inside the optimistic habitable zone. However, if cloud cover on the front side is significant enough (which a few studies have proven to be likely for planets like this), then Iona could resist a runaway greenhouse effect. If habitable, I imagine Iona to be a tropical tidally locked planet with several large seas and rivers snaking between huge, exotic forests. It is almost definitely rocky, due to its small size (1.189 Re) and host star\u0027s high metal content (\u002B0.115 [Fe/H]), so it will likely be around 1.8 Me with a density of 5.90 g/cm^3 and 1.273 times the gravity of Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m planning to do some observations of the star sometime this week. Meanwhile, Ian (one of the Exoplanet Explorers scientists) has booked the Keck Telescopes for tonight for gathering spectral data on EPIC 212525618 to determine its size and see if the ExoFOP parameters are correct.

Nicknamed Soror (Latin for \u0022Sister\u0022), this planet is about 1.24 Re and has a temperature of 290*K. However, the Keck results make the system even more mysterious. They suggest that the star COULD be much larger than previous observations have shown. But the data appears to be a bit wonky, because an exact estimate was not given. Either way, it seems like one method could help pin down what these planets are like: Transit variations. I noticed than Iona has significant TTVs and TDVs, which can be explained by the outer second planet Soror. These variations could help pin down the mass of Soror, which is estimated to be 2.1 times that of Earth, If the variations hint at a mass of at least 3 Me, than it means that the star (and the planets) are likely larger.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve continued to scour the K2 data. Since Saturday, I\u0027ve stumbled across two systems that might have two planets each. The first, EPIC 206356472, has a 4.495 and a 6.37 Re planet orbiting every 33.396 and 75.934 days. The latter planet was identified by one transit event, and calculations showed its orbital period. Next is the EPIC 210805901, whose 3.065 and 4.345 Re planets are more likely to exist as they have both been identified with at least 3 transit events. They orbit every 11.398 and 32.640 days around a Sun-like star similar in size to HR 8832. I also found out that a large transit event in the data of EPIC 220300054 (the star with that long-period ocean planet) appears to be from a large 8.60 Re gas giant orbiting about every 91 days. Finally, just today I found my most likely planet yet: EPIC 211087003b, a 5.46 Re planet orbiting every 28.309 days. It appears to have two planetary siblings, two\u00A012.08 Re and 4.34 Re planets orbiting every 86.657 and 22.869 days. This makes the EPIC 211087003 system my largest candidate system yet. I\u0027ll make renditions of the new planets in Space Engine soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you think these are a lot of planets, it\u0027s NOTHING compared to the total amount of potential candidates found on Exoplanet Explorers. The last time the \u0022Results\u0022 page was update - I think around April 4th - they had found at least 184 candidate worlds.

Based on ExoFOP and EE data, it\u0027s a potential ocean planet of 2.187 Re orbiting an M-Dwarf star once every 19.5122 days. The host star is rather small - 0.298 solar radii and 0.317 solar masses, glowing at 3680*K. Doing a bit of calculations shows that the planet candidate has an equilibrium temperature of just 282*K. This means that it\u0027s in the habitable zone and could be a potentially habitable oceanic planet.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext is another M-Dwarf habitable zone candidate, EPIC 245941191.01. I was not able to analyze this with LcViewer, but the data on EE is solid enough to do some calculations. This is one of my largest and coldest candidates - 6.313 times the size of Earth orbiting once every 32.05727 days with a temperature of 239*K. The parent star is even smaller than the previous. EPIC 245941191 is just 0.289 solar radii and 0.295 solar masses with a temperature of 3685*K. The candidate is likely a non-habitable gas giant, but still an interesting find.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow it\u0027s time for EPIC 211844348.01, nicknamed after the Aztec god of death Xolotl. Why? This is one of the hottest planets in the Universe, roasting at almost THIRTY-SIX HUNDRED DEGREES Fahrenheit. That\u0027s well beyond the temperature to liquify iron! Orbiting just 1.122 days around a large F-type star, Xolotl is about 1.68 times the size of Earth, straddling the limit between a Mini-Neptune and a Super-Earth. However, due to its horrific temperatures, it seems likely that Xolotl is a rocky planet with all its atmosphere blown away. If it\u0027s somehow a gaseous world I will eat my hat!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, there is the red dwarf EPIC 201720151, a teeny-tiny red dwarf star with 0.162 solar radii and 0.139 solar masses, glowing at just 3188*K. I appear to have found a very likely candidate in orbit around the star. It looks like a 5.035 Re gas giant with a temperature of 363*K. Seems good, right? Not really. ExoFOP claims that this is an eclipsing binary, which makes no sense. There are no secondary eclipses of any kind visible in the data. Also, you don\u0027t get stars five times the size of Earth. But things get even more confusing. It seems to be that the star is part of a binary system, which may be part of a wider binary system, which may be an unrelated star but could be where the transit is actually occurring, which means I have the wrong star, which means I\u0027M SO CONFUSED!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:26px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETUNE IN SOMETIME LATER THIS WEEK FOR MORE HORRIFIC BALLS OF LAVA AND MIND-MELTING CONFUSION*!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E*\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EI do not compensate for those whose minds have melted.

First is EPIC 220556827b, a 1.66 Re planet orbiting once every 6.529682 days with a temperature of 426*K. While somewhat large, the parent star has a rather high metal content - \u002B0.093 [Fe/H], compared to the Sun\u0027s content at 0.0000. The planet is one of my best candidates yet and seems to be quite an interesting world. It is likely tidally locked, may contain quite a lot of supercritical water, and may be surrounded by an atmosphere of steam and methane. So maybe a scaled-up version of GJ 1132b. Or it could be more of a volcanic desert planet.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ENext is the EPIC 201619647 system, an M-dwarf in Campaign 1 with 0.423 solar radii and 0.476 solar masses glowing at 3910*K. It has a VERY likely candidate planet about 1.301 times the size of Earth orbiting once every 4.58149 days. It has a very similar temperature as the previous candidate, sizzling at 455*K. But that is not the only potential candidate around the star. I found a single transit event that appears to be from a 2.76 Re \u0022Water Giant\u0022 or Mini-Neptune orbiting once every 63.608 days inside the habitable zone of the star! There could also be additional planets in the system, but I have to do some further analysis. The first candidate is likely an inhospitable desert world, possibly a hotter and scaled-up version of Mars. The star has a lower metal content than our Sun, meaning that this planet could\u0027ve formed without an iron core.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EI also found some less likely candidates. One is an 0.807 Re planet orbiting about once a day around an F-type star much larger than our own Sun. While not as bad as Xolotl, this planet still roasts at over 1500*K. However, because of how small the potential transit event is, it could easily be a false positive. There\u0027s also a potential Hot Neptune of 4.048 Re orbiting every 2.42 days with a temperature of 1388*K. For some reason it\u0027s listed as an eclipsing binary on ExoFOP, which makes it a big ambiguous.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EThere were some other interesting finds that aren\u0027t planets.

Given it\u0027s orbit and the small size of the star this was likely a rocky planet SMACK in the middle of the habitable zone. I quickly found out and did my own calculations. Based on the EE and ExoFOP data, this is quite an interesting world. EPIC 210693462.01 (aka Ziemia, or Natalie, or The One True Iona) is about 1.278 times the size of Earth with an estimated 2.50 times the mass. This gives it a terrestrial density of 6.6 g/cm^3 and about 1.53 times the gravity of Earth. Ziemia orbits the parent star once every 31.392 days at 0.1345 AU, giving it a comfortable equilibrium temperature of 250 degrees Kelvin (-9.67*F). Speaking of the parent star, it\u0027s a red dwarf of 0.312 solar radii, 0.329 solar masses, and a temperature of 3762*K. From that information, it seemed very promising.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EThen the wifi in my area improved, allowing me to access the raw data on MAST using LcViewer. Now I could properly analyze the system! And guess what showed up? Two more potential planets. The first was identified by a single transit of a 0.66 Earth radius planet lasting about 3.4325 hours. Doing a bit of number crunching reveals that this candidate could have an orbital period of about 73.003 days and a temperature of 189*K (-119.47*F). Chilly! I continued to scour the data and found an interesting potential transit event of a 0.68 Re candidate lasting about 2.452 hours. The orbital period of this potential world was calculated to be between 26 and 27 days. Guess what? I found a nearly identical transit event, just 0.02 Re larger, only half an hour off of where the next transit was predicted I easily hailed this guy as Candidate D. It seems incredibly promising as well, making this system an absolute GOLD MINE.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ETime for characteristics of the two newer candidates. They are both Sub-Terrans, meaning that they are less than 0.800 times the radius of Earth. Candidate C, the more distant one, is likely to be very reminiscent of Mars, albeit a bit larger and cooler. It may resemble a tan desert-ice planet, maybe tidally locked, with a thin atmosphere and craters. Because of its predicted ice-rock composition I calculated a potential mass of 0.217 Me, resulting in a density of 4.162 g/cm^3 and just 49.8% the gravity of Earth. Candidate D is less like Modern Mars and possibly more like Original Mars. It\u0027s about 0.68 Re (averaging out the two transit events) with an estimated mass of 0.285 Me, density of 4.87\u00A0g/cm^3, and gravitational pull of 0.599 gees. With a temperature of 265*K (17.3*F), warmer than that of Ziemia, it will likely be a mix of forests, deserts, and seas - not unlike Earth. However, it is 99.99999% likely to be tidally locked, meaning that a large ice cap will cover the back side. Its seas will also be more like giant, fat streams due to its small size - there won\u0027t be enough water to dominate the planet\u0027s surface. The planet\u0027s size will also make cloud cover here less likely than on Ziemia, which will likely have a HUGE front side cyclone if it has oceans. Plant life on both D and Ziemia will be black-blue, but plants on D would be significantly taller while those on Ziemia would be shorter and thicker.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EThis system seems like the dream of Exoplanet Explorers, right? But there\u0027s a tiny little catch that could ruin - or improve - EVERYTHING. Determining stellar parameters for Kepler and K2 stars is quite difficult. The easiest to determine are magnitude, surface gravity, and temperature. These together provide a loose framework for where other values - radius, mass, luminosity, etc. - can be calculated. A specific program the Kepler/K2 guys have is used to figure out mathematically how large, luminous, and distant the star it. I think it also creates several different potential models and picks out the likeliest one, not unlike natural selection. This methodology is quite easy to do with A, F, and G type stars. They have radii typically between 2.5 and 0.8 times that of our Sun, making observations quite easier. It becomes increasingly difficult to produce accurate estimates the smaller and smaller the star is. By the time you get to stars about a third the size of the Sun, you\u0027re heading straight into Unreliable Math territory. For all we know this star could be a red giant. But fear not, for there is still hope left! EPIC 210693462 appears to be rather close to us in terms of other Kepler/K2 stars - 187 light years, to be exact. This makes magnitude, gravity, and temperature values a LOT more accurate than those of EPIC 212525618, which is SEVERAL hundred light years away. As a result the calculations for other parameters are also more accurate as well. There is also a glimmer of hope. I found out that if EPIC 210693462 is 0.1 solar radii and masses larger and about 100*K hotter than predicted, the entire SYSTEM would be within the habitable zone. The planets would range in temperatures from 297-217 degrees Kelvin (74.9 to -69.07*F), making all of the planets suitable for liquid water. All we have to do is wait and see. Unfortunately the earliest Ian Crossfield and the other EE scientists can get a closer look at the star is in August, so there\u0027s a lot of time to wait.

Glowing at a temperature of 4042*K, this is actually one of the smallest orange dwarf stars ever found. When I investigated this star with LcViewer, things got weirder. I managed to pick out FIVE potential planet candidates orbiting every 9.879, 17.050, 17.929, 19.686, and 28.436 days. All appeared to be between 1.9 and 3.89 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E. However, there was also a three-planet model for the data. Both models turned out to be HORRIFICALLY unstable, with at least one planet being flung into the host star within a few decades. It didn\u0027t help that the host star randomly exploded during the first simulation. So I went back into the data, folded some light curves, and found that the planets orbiting every 17.05 and 28.436 days were the most likely to exist.

The host is 0.359 R\u003Csub\u003ES\u003C/sub\u003E, 0.385 M\u003Csub\u003ES\u003C/sub\u003E, and 3862*K. This system appears to be an extensive one, with planets orbiting between 4 and 285 days.

It is around 1.654 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E, orbits every 4.458 days, and has a temperature estimated to be around 513*K (464*F). If rocky, it will have about 5.95 times the mass of Earth with a density of 7.25 g/cm\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0and nearly 2.2 gees of gravity.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nD: I\u0027m not very confident in this candidate. If it exists, it is 1.79 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0and has a year of 10.567 days. The planet\u0027s temperature is estimated to be 386*K (235*F). I\u0027m really not too sure that a planet this size would be rocky, but there have been a few examples of unusually dense worlds around red dwarfs (probably because there\u0027s more iron closer to the star where rocky worlds would form), so it may not be too unlikely. This candidate will probably have a mass no greater than 9 times that of Earth.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nF: The first possible long-period planet (worlds identified by one transit event). However, it\u0027s the least likely of those three. It appears to be 2.27 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0orbiting every 57.631 days within the outer edge of the habitable zone. That gives it an equilibrium temperature of about 219*K (-65.5*F). It could be a \u0022water giant\u0022 planet with a mass estimated to be about 7.5 M\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E, a density of about 3.54 g/cm\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E, and about 1.46 times the gravity of Earth.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nC: The second long-period candidate world. It is more likely than F, but is more like Neptune. At 3.23 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E, it is probably an ice giant planet - and a cold one at that. The duration of it\u0027s single transit shows that it\u0027s year is somewhere around 165.1 days long, giving it a temperature of just 155*K (-181*F). Chilly!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nB: This is the most likely of the long-period candidates. Its transit, when folded, is a GORGEOUS deep U-shape - the hallmark of a true transiting planet. It appears to be a Saturn-like planet of 9.35 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0orbiting once about every 285.32 days with a temperature estimated to be about 129*K (-227.5*F).

The latter has only been identified by a single transit, whose duration of about 3.5 hours led to the calculation of it\u0027s orbital period. I will DEFINITELY be putting this in ProtoJeb\u0027s Planet (which I may rename the Exoplanet Explorers Pack). Also, the method used to find these 5 planets has been used to find a third candidate of EPIC 210696763 (which has a potentially habitable Super-Earth), along with a second planet of EPIC 21080840 (both worlds of the latter star were my finds; Libmar96 and Vidar found the EPIC 210696763 system).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
