Do you use any kind of rescaling mod? Like 64K or what not? It\u0027s as though the planet is too big for the clouds. Or are you possibly using EVE WIP? This really works best with EVE 7-4. I have this working on my machine at home with Scatterer and all kinds of extras. I will check my cfg\u0027s and if I need to send you some stuff I can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso did you happen to see my post with tips and tricks 2 pages back?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/102145-0-25-Astronomer-s-Visual-Pack-Interstellar-V2?p=2064915\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post2064915\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/102145-0-25-Astronomer-s-Visual-Pack-Interstellar-V2?p=2064915\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post2064915\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warnek","CreatedById":96443,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T17:24:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk thanks!

The asset files are compiled for KSP .25 and won\u0027t work with 1.0.4. I had pink boxes all over the place when I was still learning and tried to put a lens flare in .90. The Pink box in the lower right is the animated loading prompt. It has been corrupted. And the IVA cams I thought were always laggy like that?
