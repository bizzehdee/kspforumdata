Traveling far across the sector, at an early age of 26, he has lead a revolution and has found a home for his people, free from the iron fist of his previous government, free from the oppression provided daily, free to take a breath of air and enjoy their lives for at least one moment in a day. And he called this throne; the United Kerbal Dominion. A force that is gentle and open, but when crossed, will be feared.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been 5 years of this freedom, 5 years since the beginning of the reconstruction of all the bent and tired lives that have traveled with him to this one planet. And on this day, it has marked the end of their reconstruction and the beginning of their new lives. There was no war amongst his people and no hatred. Because of this, Arcturus began so scour the solar system in search of new homes for his people and for new materials for them to use, he was certain that they would bounce back and eventually be a force to be reckoned with someday, probably within his lifetime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E On this day, he has found a pair of worlds in this system, an amethyst gem named Eve and a deep blue pearl in the stars called Laythe, the latter orbiting a gas giant. Each one was a marvel to the Dominion. Laythe is an easily hospitable planet, though mostly covered with water, perfect for an expansion of Kerbal people. And that\u0027s where Arcturus set off to first. Eve on the other hand was a different story.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAnd unfortunately, Eve is the amethyst gem that everyone is fighting over.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EChapter 1 - The Probable Problem\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Laythe has been a proud and prosperous colony of the Dominion for nearly 30 years, and in such a short time span has almost covered all of the habitable land, just a few speckles of archipelagos, on Laythe, but keeping a perfect ratio of populace to industry to crops and food on its surface. There are also some floating and underwater habitats on Laythe, but the majority of the populations lie in the massive neo-steel cities that don\u0027t just scrape the sky but carve gashes in the atmosphere. And for this time, the UKD and Laythe were in perfect harmony, exploring the system together and trading goods amongst themselves. It was an age of prosperity for both worlds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Over the course of these past 30 years, Laythe and her people have been evolving in a little bit of a different direction than the people of Kerbin. Due to Laythe\u0027s planetary conditions and attributes, being a little bit smaller and a little more wet, it\u0027s understandable that people would eventually have a different way of looking at the same things. Their technology has changed at least slightly, and even their physiology has also changed to adapt to their new homes. Some have even started calling themselves Laythanites to show off their proud new heritage and homeland. Up until recently, Arcturus has not paid this any heed, in fact, he was happy to have birthed such a proud people. People that dare not forget their history and from whence they came.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E At the same time of Laythe\u0027s infantile prosperity, Arcturus has found, with the unfortunate sacrifice of some good men, that Eve is quite literally a weapon of planetary proportions. Eve was purple in every way, its hills and valleys were different hues and tones of purple and pink, its atmosphere shined with a rosy complexion, and its water was a deep purple that could not be mistaken for anything else. The liquid on the surface of the planet was a form of unrefined and somehow stable rocket fuel. Originally, he thought that with some terraforming and atmospheric tinkering, Eve would simply be another possible hospitable world. But after this discovery Arcturus wanted to learn more about the planet without the eyes of his people gawking over his shoulder, so it was reported to his people that Eve is too toxic and dangerous to colonize, and that Duna would actually be a better candidate for colonization. That statement was actually half true, Duna \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E targeted for colonization. Duna is a red and dusty planet that almost made it to being a hospitable world, if it were not for its lack of magnetic shield and smaller size\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 But it still ended up having a prosperous, although miniscule, colony on it today, but due to some... political warfare, Duna has taken a back seat to any negotiations and terraforming efforts by the UKD. Maybe the UKD will finally find the time to terraform the red planet into a wonderful new home just next door.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Ever since the discovery about Eve, the UKD has slowly been trying to build up an influence there. Not a colony, mind you, but more of a massive refinery. Arcturus is not above having a card up his sleeve, or 2 cards up his sleeves, or a card the size of a planet. And it doesn\u0027t matter for who said card would be for, whether it would be used against his old government should they try to launch an iron fist across the galaxy, or even his own people if they threaten his throne. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EEmperor Arcturus Kerman would control this sector or see it burnt to ashes around him.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The progress on Eve was surely slow for a multitude of reasons. He tried to keep this project of his a secret, trying to keep focus on the Laythe and Duna colonies. Thus, communication between Eve and Kerbin was quite slow. Although the liquid on that surface is fuel, it cannot be used properly with the ships that are sent there, and without proper refinement, said fuel is as useful as a fork when trying to eat soup. The atmosphere on Eve is also terribly thick. Leaving the planet is extremely difficult and has been met with either disastrous results or absolutely no results at all. So everyone who is sent there is... essentially stranded, but thanks to Arcturus\u0027 silver tongue, the researchers easily fall prey to his propaganda and willingly stay on the planet. And to support these brilliant stranded minds, large amounts of food and materials to build biomes, had to be sent there before any construction of a refinery or research can take place. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The toll on Arcturus\u0027 personal resources and patience was astronomical. But unlike the finite amount of resources Kerbin can provide, his patience was unshakable if it meant that he would have his foot in the door of an advantageous situation. In due time, over the course of these 30 years, a trickle of results came to pour into Arcturus\u0027 hypothetical mug. Although the research done on the surface of Eve had to be analyzed twice, once by the surface researchers and once by his personal staff of scientists on Kerbin, Arcturus couldn\u0027t be more pleased. 30 years after Eve\u0027s discovery, it has been found that the mass to energy ratio that the Eve fuel provided was at least ten-fold more powerful than the conventional liquid fuel that the UKD and its colonies used. And the research was still barely finished. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EPerhaps...

It wasn\u0027t in any plotted courses or on any star maps... It was as if it was a solar tumbleweed that just bounced in front of their travels and all that their supercarriers could do was stop before they crashed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Arcturus was one of the two hundred thousand passengers that each of the 20 \u0022liberated\u0022 supercarriers carried from the scorched capital of his old government to their destination, but like how Columbus accidentally discovered America by looking for a route to India, these supercarriers stopped short on their trek across the galaxy for their own India and stumbled on the Kerbol system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The supercarriers that were used to bring these people to Kerbin have all, essentially, disintegrated in the efforts to build the new lives of his people. Their super structures were the basis of buildings and their technology has been stripped and repurposed for use on this new planet. But the drives that carried 4 million people here at faster than the speed of light had no use on this planet, not even in this solar system, they simply didn\u0027t work. They stopped working as soon as they reached the edge of the solar system. All of the super carriers were flung out of the rift and were forced to use conventional fuel to land on Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Sometimes, Arcturus dreams that the supercarriers somehow flung them into a different dimension, where the physics, although quite similar, simply didn\u0027t allow for speeds faster than light. Due to how quantum mechanics works, it was a plausible idea, one that even his scientists lean toward. But Arcturus funnels as much resources into this research as possible just for some answers, for some closure as to what happened to his and everyone else\u0027s past. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Once he got word from his researchers about Eve, Arcturus thought that some of that closure might be within his grasp. If only that \u0022word\u0022 about Eve was his and his alone, that vision may have been plausible. But being preoccupied by the results of the 30 year long research on Eve, Arcturus forgot that 30 years ago, Laythe, too, was also discovered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EEmperor Arcturus has been summoned to an emergency meeting by the Laythe Magistrate.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EChapter 3 - The Procedure\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWhat is it, Magistrate?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Arcturus asked with a politician\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s smile. Looking back at Arcturus through the vid screen, Magistrate Magnus Kerman of the Laythe colony, replied, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CEmperor, we have new findings in regards to Eve, it seems that it is not as toxic as first reported.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Arcturus chose his words wisely, letting his mind slip to the side to raise concern over the fact that the Magistrate required a meeting but did not meet in person. Even though a meeting in his private quarters through a vid screen was just as effective, it was still pretty rude to put a screen between you and your Emperor. Finally, Arcturus asked with sincerity, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWhat have you found?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 The Magistrate shuffled through some papers and found what he was looking for and placed a finger on the text as he began to skim and finally paraphrase to the Emperor what they have found. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThe liquid on the surface of Eve is actually a type of\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 unrefined fuel of some sort, different from our conventional fuel.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Arcturus had a feeling as to what this had meant; Laythe would want to grab Eve for itself, so to confirm he asked inquisitively, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWhat does this mean for you, Magistrate?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CFor me, Emperor?

But due to the planet being made mostly of water, much of Laythanite resources were extremely difficult to come by. A lot of the materials they used for their buildings and their ships were either recycled, making some of their ships practically ancient, or harvested from the nearby moons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Only within 4 months of labor, Laythe has sent over a dozen brand new ships to Kerbin, only to be refueled, fitted with Arcturus\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 researchers, and sent off to Eve. In these 4 months, most of Laythe\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s material reserves were nearly exhausted. Normally, these reserves, carefully rationed as necessary among Laythe\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s industry, would last years and years.

He had in his hands a lit cigar and a glass of whiskey. The cigar was not the one he normally smoked for flavor, this one is for the nicotine to calm his nerves, and the whiskey he was now drinking had only just been opened for the first time and was being used for the same effect. He wasn\u0027t sure of what to think in regards to Laythe\u0027s defection from the Dominion nearly a month ago. Are they a clear enemy and threat to the Dominion? Or do these people just want their freedom? Has he really pushed them too far? Or were they just out to grab Eve for themselves? The alcohol was making him more paranoid than he normally is, and that is a dangerous place to be. \u0022Fine, let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s just see where Magnus takes this...\u0022 Arcturus said out loud to himself, as to reassure he wasn\u0027t being \u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E paranoid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Arcturus took a deep breath and finally brought his attention to the manila folder on his table. It was unmarked but visibly had quite a few papers stuffed inside. He opened it slowly, and remembered what he had to do. \u0022This is just a precaution,\u0022 he thought as he flipped through the papers to one that said, \u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc1/920364_10200134385696819_1240457169_o.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHyperion\u003C/a\u003E.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Arcturus immediately began to reminisce to the days of a rebel rouser. The Hyperion was his flagship during his revolution against his old government. At 104 tonnes, it was a sturdy vessel, held plenty of fuel, and took him where he needed to go. It has always spearheaded every battle Arcturus has fought in. And although he was in fact one of the passengers on the supercarriers that took him to Kerbin, he spent most of his time on the Hyperion during their travel through space, it was quite literally his home for a long time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Arcturus let out a hearty chuckle when he remembered the last day that he spent on the capital of his old government. He flew the Hyperion directly into the political meeting hall, nearly collapsing the building. He crashed it in such a way that only the nose stuck inside the building, letting the massive engines keep the ship floating above the ground. He then stood on the nose of the Hyperion, looked down at all the politicians that gawked in awe in his literal \u0022crashing\u0022 of their meeting, and yelled down to them whilst pointing to the ceiling, \u0022We will not crumble under your unjust fist, it is we who will thrust up through you and pierce the heavens!\u0022 His voice resonated in the hall so well, that the dome of the hall began to collapse. No debris fell on him, but enough fell away that a beam of light illuminated him and him alone. Thinking back at it now, destiny had overly romanticized his revolution, and with that, almost made it seem like a huge joke, literally. But Arcturus knew that it was no joke, and let his memory continue to replay in his head, remembering putting on a smile and returning back to the cockpit of the Hyperion. As he piloted the ship out of the hole in the side of the building, it completely collapsed... Apparently, the ship was holding the hall up all this time. The politicians were not hurt, personal shields protected them, but the collapse of the building was a powerful and literal symbol to the end of their reign. He then led the 20 supercarriers that were waiting for him in orbit out into the stars. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Now, 35 years after that triumph, Arcturus now feels like a tyrant, and his ship, refitted with conventional engines, orbits his planet as a symbol and a reminder of who he once was; a beloved man who put his people before himself. The Hyperion is still active, patrolling Kerbin and its two moons, even sometimes visiting the other colonies. No matter who he is now, the ship still brings good memories to his people and to himself. But times have changed, and he has lost his way. Sadness washed over Arcturus as he lowered his drink and put out his cigar. He must protect the people that still love him. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EEven though he has made an enemy of the people he loved, they are still an enemy.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EChapter 7 - The Machine\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The memories of his beloved Hyperion distracted Arcturus from his original intentions of looking through the folder. \u003Cem\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CFocus, Arcturus, you must be careful.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/em\u003E Arcturus flipped through the papers grabbing on to a note that said \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CIn Progress\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 and opened the folder there.

It is gargantuan. It is twice the size of the Hyperion in every way. So large in fact, that each part must be constructed in space. There was no conventional way to build it and then send it into orbit. The Bucephalus would act as the last line of defense for the UKD. Nothing could challenge the might of this vessel. If the enemy got too close to the home of the UKD, Kerbin, the Bucephalus would instantly be sent to the homeworld of the invaders and be leveled by the apocalypse class missiles sitting in the cargo bay of the Bucephalus. Their world would turn to glass, never to sprout life again. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CApocalypse class\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 is a description that is far too accurate for the missiles. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The Bucephalus is also the new Flagship for Arcturus, taking over where the Hyperion left off. The Hyperion would still be in active duty of course, but as a piece of military hardware, it is a relic, whereas the Bucephalus is state of the art. Perfect. It will be the new symbol for the Dominion; proud, strong, and not easily swayed. Perfect attributes for this new age where the Dominion has a new enemy in the stars. His people need this new symbol, to know that they are protected. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E As the feelings of awe began to settle from reading about the Bucephalus, Arcturus decided to check on its progress.

Their attempts to settle on Eve have been rendered all in vain as each ship that was sent there was shot down by the UKD, time and time again. The Prime Minister didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know what to do. His people were being killed. His negotiations with Arcturus always fell through. The Duna colony just sat there. It was finally time to take action. Magnus\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 vid-screen flickered to life, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CMitsy, has your team started the work on the radar bug?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Mitsy replied with a more confident voice, with faith in her Prime Minister, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CYes, Magis--- Prime Minister, it will be ready within the week.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Magnus wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t offended with her about to call him the Magistrate; it was a very difficult change for all the people of Laythe to realize that they were now independent. He finally replied, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CVery good. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be sending an addition to the Mun base every week upon your completion.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Mitsy nodded and waited for Magnus to turn off the vid-screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E A week later, Mitsy toggled a switch and the radar dish on her research base sent out a pulse. The pulse consisted of very specific information; nothing. To conserve energy, the pulse would initiate every time the UKD Munnar Scanner satellite came within 30 km of the facility. When the pulse activates, the scanning information gathered by the satellite would be pretty much empty. Essentially, from the radar readings, Mun would seem completely desolate, no bases, nothing kerbal-made. Although the satellite also sent back pictures of the surface, the scientists on Kerbin normally don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t check those without first checking the radar readings. After all, why look for something that isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t there?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Over the course of the next few weeks, under the cover of the virus that pulsated into the UKD satellite, Magnus has sent down a multitude of tools and expansions to the Mun base. In this time, it has become enormous, and completely mobile if necessary. It started out with only being able to hold 6 researchers and had limited resources for science, but due to its expansion, it now contains room for 26 researchers, a dedicated fuel depot, and massive radar dishes for a clearer and faster connection to any ships in the area and even Magnus back on Laythe. Once all the connections among the modules were done and pressurized, Mitsy let out a sigh of relief and became ready to take on a new role as Magnus\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 adjutant, his military advisor. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It was a difficult decision for Magnus to make Mitsy his adjutant, but there were several factors that played into his verdict. She was the head of her research team that was supposed to be sent to Eve, but instead has been redirected to the UKD\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Mun base, so she has been the closest Laythanite to Kerbin for quite a long time. Now that she has all these additions to the Mun, she has more influence on what happens around the Mun, and to a smaller extent, Kerbin. It was an advantage that Magnus couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t let go of. She, of course, was very bright; otherwise he wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have sent her to Eve in the first place. Finally, Magnus let out a sigh as he reminded himself of the biggest factor that lead him to his decision, almost everyone in the entirety of the Kerbol system were scientists. There was no strife before this, soldiers were unnecessary. Though they had a small force when under the threat of the old government during their escape, the majority of the passengers of the supercarriers were civilians and refugees, and the soldiers that they \u003Cem\u003Edid\u003C/em\u003E have retired by now. There were only a handful of military minds in the entire system; Magnus and Arcturus were two of them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The Prime Minister knew that propaganda was unnecessary to gain support of his people if he wanted to go to war, and he was sure that his people are as sick of the UKD\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s unfairness as he is.

If it wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t for him, Arcturus would probably have been executed by now. Hawking, alongside Gordon, were the brilliant minds that made it possible to live in the Kerbol system without faster than light speed travel, their revolutionary technologies helped them move beyond Kerbin and its moons upon landing in the system. But of the two brilliant minds, Hawking was far older and he finally passed away. And in honor to commemorate him, Arcturus named his new radar and telescope after him. It is a space telescope and radar capable of near lag-less communication between any planets in the system, and the resolution on the massive dish allowed for the crispest and clear pictures ever to have been taken ever. It was a scientific pride and joy.

He was very calm, probably because there was something finally happening. The inactivity of the past year was starting to get to him and his paranoia; he was getting extremely anxious, losing focus. He forgot about the Mun base and even started paying less attention to the research that has been coming in from Eve.

The Hyperion approached the Icarus from the rear and they were aligned top to top. As it approached, the silhouette of the Icarus appeared on the Hyperion, revealing some ammunition attached to the sides, but at first glance, the cargo bay was empty. Finally, the Hyperion\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s pilot flipped the vessel 180 degrees to align the vessels nose to nose and began docking procedures.

It still made the Hyperion crew uneasy. Before communications were opened, a request for a hard visual inspection of the cargo hold was requested and instantly accepted and the Laythe\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Icarus\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 cargo bay opened. Lambert Kerman, second in command of the Hyperion, prepared for his EVA into the cargo bay. As he exited the piloting can of the Hyperion, his leg got caught on the ladder and he spun out momentarily before proceeding, he was terribly nervous. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E He approached the Icarus from above, focusing carefully on both, The Hyperion and the Icarus. Finally, he entered the cargo bay, looking at the docking port and the rear of the ship; he has found it to be completely empty and safe. Reporting this to his pilot, he continued his inspection around the ship; hell, it couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t hurt to be safe. As he elevated above the Icarus and headed towards the rear of the craft, he spotted a small, one man craft sitting directly behind the Icarus and he caught the unmistakable shape of a Fire and Forget missile docked to its nose. In an instant, it occurred to him; before they approached the Icarus, this small fighter undocked and hid around the larger craft as if it was a game of hide and seek. It used tiny thrusts of RCS to maneuver, that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s probably why they couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t detect it behind the Icarus\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 thick plating. Upon this realization, Lambert throttled his personal RCS boosters to max and headed back to the Hyperion, at the last second, he turned around to see the small fighter coming up into view from behind the Icarus. This was the last thing he saw as he smashed into a solar panel on the side of the Hyperion, rending him unconscious and breaking the panel into several pieces. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Melbro Kerman, the pilot of the Hyperion, began to yell in frustration into his headset for Lambert to answer. He then viewed the medical readings of his second in command on a screen in the craft, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CLambert Kerman: Unconscious, recommended immediate EVA for rescue.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Melbro hit the button to open communication with HQ on Kerbin, but the screen locked up. As he looked around, all of the screens on the ship were completely frozen. There was no communication, and as the small one manned fighter flew above the Hyperion and out of view, Melbro\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s racing heart finally sank. He slouched in his seat and slapped the control stick of the Hyperion. He knew he was about to die. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E From his position, Melbro could see inside the cockpit of the Laythe Icarus and was able to make eye contact with one of the pilots. They both stared at each other for a few moments. Melbro finally raised his hand and waved goodbye. The Laythe pilot looked away. It was clear he was upset, it was clear he didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t enjoy this. But it didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t matter, no later than the pilot\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s exchange; Melbro heard a muffled boom and felt a sudden pull come from behind him. Melbro\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s visor began to get covered in a spray of blood as his face was split open by a piece of steel propelled by an explosion from the rear of the cabin. The vacuum of space sucked out his limp body out of the ship, to forever drift in emptiness. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The one manned fighter approached the Icarus and re-docked with a side port. The Laythe pilot hit a few buttons in the cockpit and finally undocked his Icarus from the Hyperion after a few minutes. He opened the solar panels to once again charge the ship and backed away from the Hyperion with a few thrusts of his RCS boosters. He stared at the charred remains of the Hyperion drift away. It was unseen by anyone, but the Hyperion\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s cockpit flickered into life and the following text scrolled on its working screens:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CInitiate override of Hyperion\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompleted\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESet course; Sub-Orbital trajectory\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETarget; Mun\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe destruction of the Hyperion will be the worst thing to happen in Kerbol history.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EChapter 11 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 A Son\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Lament\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E After the sudden loss of communication with the Hyperion, Arcturus knew that the 3 hour radio silence was no glitch with the ship. He knew it no longer existed. Arcturus paged Dr. Gordon and Shiny into his office. Arcturus cut straight to the point, his people were dying, and he would not allow this to continue to happen, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CDr. Gordon, prepare the Tabibiko for a sortie, have it resupply with the ammo drone on the Mun. Neutralize the threat, capture any survivors.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Dr. Gordon nodded, but before leaving, he interjected his Emperor with a suggestion, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CArcturus, may I request to pilot the WASP in the sortie?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Arcturus was perfectly fine with Gordon calling him by his first name, he was practically one of his best friends, but an image had to be upheld, and a glare was shot to Gordon, \u003Cem\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CNot in front of the boy.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 \u003C/em\u003EBut Arcturus continued to think, quickly, and he concluded that it would probably be best for Gordon to pilot the first sortie of this war, after all, they fought together against the old government, Gordon was as close to military as you were going to get these days. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CVery well, Dr. Gordon. Come back alive, good luck.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Gordon turned on his heel and left the room. Arcturus looked at Shiny and saw a heart in shambles. He knew that the destruction of the Hyperion weighed heavily on the boy, he didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know why, but it did. The news of the skirmish has not been put out to the press yet, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s only known to a dozen or so people. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CShiny, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re a bright young man,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Arcturus\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 flattery didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t faze the boy, he still stood there with fire in his eyes, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 Build me a ship.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Shiny took a step back, analyzing his Emperor in case it was a joke.

After clearing the shuttle, the Tabibiko set course for Mun. Like every trip ever made there, it was no frills, quick, and boring. But as the Tabibiko approached, the drone on Mun\u0027s surface was signaled to activate. The drone came to life and fired its rockets to accelerate it into low orbit around Mun. As the drone dropped its rockets, the Tabibiko came into view. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The two vessels rendezvoused and the drone wasted no time docking its payload with the Tabibiko. It was effective, accurate, and as soon as the job was finished, set a suicidal course for the surface of Mun. After all, its job was done. When he got the \u0022all clear,\u0022 Dr. Gordon opened the cargo doors and transferred himself into the cockpit of the WASP. Once he was ready, the pilot of the Tabibiko set course for a rendezvous with the enemy Laythe Icarus. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The orbital transfer from low moon orbit to 1 million meters above its surface just in viewing distance of the Laythe Icarus was done with absolute precision and grace by the Tabibiko pilot. He didn\u0027t require any praise, it was honestly pleasure enough knowing he did such a wonderful job. Coming within just 2 kilometers of the enemy, Dr. Gordon undocked from the Tabibiko and prepared to load the FAF missile onto his ship. He knew he needed to act quickly. Two kilometers on the surface of any planet is not a terribly short distance, but in space, you might as well be trading paint with the other ship. \u0022Locked and loaded.\u0022 said Dr. Gordon into his microphone as he turned on his thrusters to close the gap between him and the enemy Icarus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Dr. Gordon was now just about 500 meters from the enemy. He stopped all relative velocity between them and took aim. With only the slightest hesitation, he launched his missile at the enemy ship. It took a few moments for the missile to accelerate and reach its target. It was too late of a reaction by the Laythe Directorate in response to the UKD approach, their orbital transfer was too quick, and they couldn\u0027t pick it up in time. Just as they realized they were about to get attacked, the UKD missile found its mark. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The captain of the sortie of Laythe ship was sitting in the fighter that was still docked at the side of the ship when he heard a whistle and felt a strong rumble under his seat. He realized that the whistle was escaping air. The UKD missile severed his cockpit from the engine of the fighter, slicing a gash under his seat from the explosion. Luckily, the cockpit was thick and protected him from any worse injuries, just as lucky, since he was sitting in the fighter, he already had his helmet on, but this meant that his suit would have to take up the slack of providing him oxygen. He didn\u0027t have an unlimited amount, the crossfeed of oxygen from the main cockpit of the Icarus was damaged in the attack. Just as he was about to abandon the cockpit of the fighter and return to the Icarus, he felt the ship move. \u003Cem\u003E\u0022I guess they\u0027re taking evasive action to escape.\u0022 \u003C/em\u003EThe captain slumped back in the seat, hoping to be rescued by his crewmates soon. The pilot of the Laythe Icarus folded up the solar panels and prepared to boost away from the Tabibiko, but his systems weren\u0027t responding. Being rocked by the attack showed the age of the ship, it\u0027s practically going to break apart if anything hits it directly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Dr. Gordon, though pleased, was not distracted by his successful hit. He quickly returned to the Tabibiko to reload. Once completed, he returned once more to the enemy, this time, facing directly at the nose of the craft. Once in position, he zeroed the relative velocity and took aim once more. As he launched the missile, their relative velocity increased. \u003Cem\u003E\u0022They\u0027re accelerating!\u0022\u003C/em\u003E The Laythe pilot finally got the rockets to spark and ignite. He accelerated toward the WASP fighter, and turned to avoid the incoming missile. Dr. Gordon swore under his breath at the miss, but got a brilliant idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Dr. Gordon fought alongside Arctrus for years, and his dedication to his Emperor was unquestionable. He provided Arcturus with his best research and technologies, because he knew that in the end, Arcturus would use it to help his people. And so, Gordon didn\u0027t mind taking this risk for Arcturus, for the Dominion, for the Kerbals. He brought his ship into full acceleration and braced himself for impact with the enemy ship. Their relative velocities increased and Dr. Gordon\u0027s ship collided with the Laythe Icarus; a series of explosions from his RCS fuel tanks rocked both his and the enemy\u0027s ships. The explosion caused a chain reaction with the fuel tanks of the Laythe ship which tore a hole in the side of their cockpit. The pilot sitting closest to the explosion was killed with the pressure wave before the air was sucked out, and as the second pilot was impaled on jutting debris as he was being sucked out by the vacuum of space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E A second explosion now rocked only the Laythe ship, as a second fuel tank became volatile and sent the remains of the Laythe Icarus tumbling through space, dislodging the cockpit as well as the captain and his half of the fighter ship. The explosions were quite violent and would have sent the captain tumbling around his cockpit, but he was secure in his seat. He used the remaining energy left in the cockpit to activate its SAS torque to stabilize the ship. He found that on the nose of the ship, an FAF missile was still docked with him. He pressed the distress button, knowing in his gut that nothing much would really happen. To his surprise, a communications channel was open only a second later. He didn\u0027t say anything, only waited for instructions. After a few seconds of static, he heard the voice of his Prime Minister, it was sad, but not disappointed or condescending, \u0022Captain, do not allow the UKD forces to capture you. Is that understood?\u0022 The captain let out an inaudible sigh, said \u0022Yes, sir.\u0022 and flicked off the comm channel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The captain angled the engine of the missile in a retrograde burn. He wasn\u0027t sure if it was going to work, but he might as well try. Either he would lower his altitude and crash to the moon or explode in his cockpit. He didn\u0027t want to suffocate in space. He didn\u0027t undock the missile, but turned on its thruster. With a low enough thrust, he wasn\u0027t cooked, and instead, it steadily lowered the captain\u0027s speed until he was in a sub-orbital trajectory. He then let gravity do the work. As he accelerated towards the Mun, he began to reminisce of his family... He remembered his mother and father seeing him off about 10 or so years ago to help with the construction on Laythe. Although he has grown fond of the place he has helped build and is now fighting for, he will never forget where it all started; home. He rotated his ship only to find Kerbin enter his viewport. He was glad that it was the last thing he saw as his cockpit crashed into the Munar surface, shooting dust hundreds of meters high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E As the Laythe Icarus exploded, Dr. Gordon was fastened in the seat of half a fighter. The entire front of the ship was gone, no console, no controls, nothing. He had no idea how he survived, it is a story that will set him up to be a living martyr for his people. But these thoughts were quickly thrown out when he realized he was starting to get sick. \u003Cem\u003E\u0022The ship is spinning, idiot.\u0022 \u003C/em\u003EThe remaining half of the WASP was spinning end over end from the collision. The doctor unbuckled his seat and was flung out through the hole of the ship. He quickly turned on his personal RCS thrusters to stabilize himself and throttled himself straight towards the Tabibiko. Dr. Gordon regrettably reported \u0022No survivors.\u0022 into his microphone as he saw the cockpit of the Laythe captain decelerate in a suicide trajectory. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Leaving the floating carcass of the Laythe Icarus floating around the Mun, the Tabibiko plotted a course back to Kerbin orbit where a shuttle was waiting to take the crew back to the ground. Once it was reported that the crew has safely landed, Arcturus nodded at the camera crew. A red light blinked on and Arcturus began.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003EFellow Kerbals, I come to you in the wake of recent events to issue a call to reason.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EChapter 12\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-31T08:14:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2013 08:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by bacondeity\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mekan1k","CreatedById":48750,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-22T08:25:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk.
