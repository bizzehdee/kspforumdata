Little did i know of the horrors that would come out of that particular move. So i get it inside Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and i wait for aerobraking. When going for the circularization burn, I realised that i didn\u0027t have enough fuel.

After about 5 seconds of falling, it splashed down.However, as nothing happened after the splash down mission control has concluded that asteroids are merely made by posters of asteroid pictures held together by glue and struts for rigidness.
