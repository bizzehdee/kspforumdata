We love this nifty mod. What if we told you that you can have a much wider pick in engines, fuel tanks and other parts, as well as get gigantic solar arrays, bigger structural parts and so much more without adding much at all to your memory usage? \n\nThat\u2019s exactly what Tweakscale will provide you with! The mod allows you to resize a lot of parts in the game which means you can have a 3.75 meter Rockomax 48-7S engine, or a truss that\u2019s two times its original size, and while all that is happening the part properties scale along with it where applicable.\n\u003Cfigure\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://31.media.tumblr.com/d6c54cf67cdbebbef54ba67e295178ad/tumblr_inline_nk8vdjz1lY1rr2wit.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/figure\u003E\nTweakscale was originally developped by Goodspeed and Biotronic, but due to a lack of time they\u2019ve passed on the torch to Pellinor.\n\nGet the mod [http://goo.gl/56k9l5](\u003Ca%20href=)\u0022\u003E**HERE**"},{"CreatedByName":"Daveroski","CreatedById":93896,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T22:15:09Z","Content":"Come on Squad... you *know* that this should be stock."},{"CreatedByName":"SquaredSpekz","CreatedById":124226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T22:15:14Z","Content":"Good very good"},{"CreatedByName":"biohazard15","CreatedById":91655,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T22:31:43Z","Content":"One of the most bug-inducing mods I\u0027ve ever seen."},{"CreatedByName":"Caelib","CreatedById":59329,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T22:32:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Come on Squad... you *know* that this should be stock.\n\nI tend to agree, but I would hope that squad would create more procedural parts so this wasn\u0027t necessary.

For some reason, I guess it was always using relative sizes, as opposed to always calculating based on the stock size and mass.\n\nTBH, I like it, but only used it for IR, since it was so buggy. I haven\u0027t tried it since 0.25 though. I hope it\u0027s a lot better. :-)"},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T00:33:52Z","Content":"One aspect of craft building, that I like, is solving a problem using the parts I\u0027m given. The \u0027stock\u0027 game - in career mode - forces you to think about parts counts and mass limits, until everything is upgraded. The variety of unique parts we have - add a \u0022Tetris\u0022 puzzle game aspect to career-mode contract challenges. I want to keep parts diversity. It would not seem \u0022right\u0022 to me, to just *scale* one or two base model tanks to fit a huge variety of sizes and capacities, quickly solving a building challenge.\n\nBut, I think tweak options in general, could be very useful at helping with other things. As a new player, my eyes kinda bugged out at the huge amount of parts on display. The new categories and custom categories added in .90 give new ways to organize parts, but, that doesn\u0027t really help a new player. \n\nI think adding tweak options to *switch* or *select* (not scale) similar part types, would help cut down on visual clutter in the toolbox - for ex. wing sections (delta wing: large and small, other generic A and B versions. Switching between FL-100 thru 800.) This could also be visualized with a gizmo: after placing a generic FL tank, a gizmo (or highlight color) could indicate variants are available: accessed by right-click, scroll wheel, and/or tugging at the gizmo."},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedCowboy","CreatedById":92106,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T01:17:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Come on Squad... you *know* that this should be stock.\n\nSo with you there, It should so much be stock!"},{"CreatedByName":"jaddbo","CreatedById":117784,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T01:27:16Z","Content":"again? seems like we just got this.\n\nbut anyway, \n\nWARNING!!!!\n\nlast i checked with this mod, when you scale up parts, they weigh more than they should.\n\nYOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!"},{"CreatedByName":"Mighty1","CreatedById":95750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T07:19:07Z","Content":"A perfect TweakScale option would be (atleast for the LFO tanks) Change diameter whitch we have now and a second toggle for changing leinght.
