I have some questions about all the settings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m wondering about how the root range setting and the multiple antenna multiplier combine? So with a Communotron 16 and a CommTech EXP-VR-2T on two different ships, they would normally have a max range of 5,200 kilometers, because the ranges are 2500 and 3000 individually, so 2500\u002Bsqrt(2500*3000). Let\u0027s say I were to add a second Communotron 16 onto the first ship, so... the ship now has 5000 on its own, correct? And does it just use that number in the root formula? So 3000\u002Bsqrt(5000*3000)=6873?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also wanted to lower the multiple antenna multiplier to like 0.9 just for a slightly added challenge, I just want to make sure I understand its effect first. So when you have it set to 1.0 it just straight adds the range - so if I had a Communotron 16 and a CommTech EXP-VR-2T on the SAME ship, the individual range of that ship would just be 2500\u002B3000=5500. If I set it to 0.9, does it just multiply that by their combined amount? So that ship\u0027s range is 0.9(5500)=4950? And then for it communicating with another ship would just plug that number in for its range in the root formula?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I was doing the calculations before to figure out the minimum altitude I would need for a satellite constellation, so let\u0027s say I wanted to put some satellites up which would constantly be in range with each other at a distance of, say, 20000 km. If I set the multiple antenna multiplier to 0.9, to make it so that these two satellites had a constant omni connection with each other, I would want to put, say, five Communotron 16s on each satellite, which would give each an individual range of 0.9(5*2500)=11111, which would mean that the two satellites would have a max range of 22222.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I doing this right?
