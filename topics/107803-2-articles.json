The issue with the Science Archive has to do with the order in which you do the tests. If you reorder them as I have done, the zero science entries will not appear in the Science Archive.\n\nI also included a IsOnetimeNotRunnable() function that can be used to allow run once experiments to execute once per flight.

The mod doesn\u0027t really do anything that can\u0027t be done manually. It just removes the tedium, and lets you focus on building, flying and exploring, which are far more engaging experiences in the game, but keeping the incentive from science to do more things.\n\u003E \n\nWell it does though, if you don\u0027t get into space, it allows you to dump science parts and use lesser parachutes to return.  While you could just not do that, it could also happen if you are forced to abort due to a launch mishap, and then you get the science you shouldn\u0027t be getting anyway.  That\u0027s ok though, I\u0027ll stick to doing it the good ol fashioned way.\n\nFor the rest of you, you are reading way too far into the word \u0027cheating\u0027.
