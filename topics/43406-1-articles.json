Additional tools that might be available are slowing down time, and pause-on-and-mark-structural-faillure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps a simulation can also look like a simulation, where the world\u0027s textures are overlayed by a wireframe, glowing grid or \u0027matrix\u0027 appearance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESuggestion two: Hardcore mode\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that a simulations are simulations, we can scrap the revert option for those who want to play with an extra challenge. But not for all, as sandbox is sandbox and should keep the revert option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn hardcore mode reverting would be impossible; all actions are permanent. Perhaps even quicksaving and loading is disabled. Simulations will be more than a few useful tools and are an important action before actually launching a rocket for real.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo keep everybody happy I suggest to simply split hardcore mode from the normal gamemodes.

It\u0027d be absolutely phenomenal for KSP if we had a realism or difficulty menu in the options wherein we could toggle various features like advanced life support, budget or science income and other such things to custom-tune our play experience just like any other good or decent simulator(or game for that matter).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for simulations, it\u0027s been suggested before....kind of. I know it\u0027s been suggested that we have some kind of computer simulation building or wind tunnel room or other such things. I quite like the idea of having various testing environments or buildings where we can drive around rovers or drop landers to see how well they work and so on. For a lot of people, I think it\u0027d just be fun...but at the same time, that\u0027s kind of what sandbox mode is for. Well, I guess sandbox is more for people who want to play KSP without the responsibility of actually managing a space program. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, whatever...I agree that having some kind of simulation or test facility would be awesome. Maybe incorporate a couple big fields into the R\u0026amp;D complex. Or behind, beside, in front of...just kind of surrounding the R\u0026amp;D building. An obstacle course for rovers, a small launchpad for testing out landers and things...and whatever other little test areas that people could come up with. Would be very fun, I think.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RandomGuy5040","CreatedById":16801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-22T22:14:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUsually, before a launch I just call whether a flight is a simulation or an actual mission.
