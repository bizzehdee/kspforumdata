You really probably \u0022could\u0022 in reality but that gets into n-body physics and I have no way of making that sort of thing happen that I can tell as all I can do is work with the numbers produced by ballistic trajectories.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example: If you warp from Kerbin to another planet on the other side of Kerbol. You\u0027ll be heading in the wrong direction (a lot like the velocity conservation version of the drive), but with far less energy as you only have Kerbin\u0027s orbital momentum and a small fraction from your orbital momentum around Kerbin. You can still use Kerbol to change your velocity vector direction which would help a lot but... you can\u0027t simply change your orbital momentum the same way you can your velocity. You\u0027ll need to use your thrusters. When you keep warping back at the planet you\u0027ll see your velocity returns to exactly where it was. You can use the gravity of the planet to change the direction of your velocity vector, but all the while your angular momentum remains the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically the trick of warp from Kerbin out to Jool, keep warping at Jool until you bleed off the excess velocity... that doesn\u0027t work with this take on warp drive. Departure windows still make your life a lot easier (though they are different than normal, you want the planets aligned on the same side of the star).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShort version of what to expect is, if you did a regular hohmann transfer, you need to \u0022pay for\u0022 all the deltaV needed at your destination if you warp straight there. That\u0027s not 100% true you can do things more efficiently than a hohmann transfer, but usually not. What you get with the orbital momentum conservation version is not needing to wait months to get to your destination. I think it\u0027s a really neat effect and interesting to use the other take on how a warp drive might behave. Personally I like it better than the velocity conservation version as the numbers don\u0027t seem to get as silly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T09:46:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to toss it up - I\u0027m curious how the feel is.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"helaeon","CreatedById":101767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T10:40:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWarpDrive Test.zip here : \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/k0q5tg08dzwck5y/WarpDrive%20-%20Test.zip?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/k0q5tg08dzwck5y/WarpDrive%20-%20Test.zip?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the source to the new DLL : \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/fcye1h5mft0mrhl/USI_ModuleWarpEngine%20CThree.cs?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/fcye1h5mft0mrhl/USI_ModuleWarpEngine%20CThree.cs?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe zip is the whole directory.

DLL is really all you need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis includes the latest commits so if there is weirdness with the bubble guide that\u0027s good to know too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote you can change the \u0022mode\u0022 of the drive in the VAB/SPH, but not in flight. It will tell you the mode of that drive while in flight. Default mode is Angular Momentum / Orbital Energy conservation. If you have any ships currently in flight with the warp drive they will become angular momentum conserving drives! (I did this for my own test save purposes. Will change to classic velocity conservation drive being default when I do commit to github.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWierd/bad things happen at very high warp sometimes on sphere of influence changes. If that happens, I think I may know the problem but unfortunately the answer is... slow down on those transitions. Which you should anyway, navigating at 15c is hard! I find I fly most places at about half throttle unless I\u0027m trying to cover large distances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a bit of a beast of a computer, so feedback on performance hit or crashes while active is appreciated too. Runs nice on my rig using a 275 part spaceplane \u002B lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are also concerns with G loading as the velocity is changed during warp flight. DRE users want to chime in on if it causes a problem? I\u0027m not sure if there is a solution to it though. I don\u0027t use DRE myself, so I don\u0027t know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal issue is the math isn\u0027t perfect. Partly due to floating point errors, partly due to how KSP calculates trajectories and changes its frames of reference. If you warp to Eve and return to Kerbin taking up the exact orbit you had when you left is impossible/nearly impossible. You will have a different velocity, especially on multiple SOI changes. Now... at this point considering all the formulas and equations and things that have been looked at trying to get this to behave \u0022just\u0022 right, this might have to be accepted as an unexpected effect of using warp and that gravity and trajectories while warping do affect your ship in sometimes unexpected ways.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T13:54:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll take a peek - I assume if all looks good you have no aversion to this being rolled in?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"royying","CreatedById":20591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T17:17:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi RoverDude, can you make a radial version warp drive part?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to build a ship like enterprise or phoenix, the stack driver part can\u0027t make this\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T17:56:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot on my list tbh, these will all be stack parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mekan1k","CreatedById":48750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T18:24:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOut of curiosity, why does the warp engine need Xenon?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T18:28:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause you have to have some mass for the engine part module to work, and ExoticMatter has no mass as it\u0027s shared with KSPI\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mekan1k","CreatedById":48750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T19:22:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RoverDude\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RoverDude\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBecause you have to have some mass for the engine part module to work, and ExoticMatter has no mass as it\u0027s shared with KSPI\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy not have the engine auto-generate a small quantity of mass with an arbitrary name?

If you select \u0022Velocity Conservation\u0022 in the VAB and it works as it does now. Behavior is effectively that the warp bubble pops you out of space time, and you continue on upon bubble collapse just as you were when you entered. You get free potential energy by warping away from the center of gravitation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you select \u0022Angular Momentum Conservation\u0022 in the VAB you get the new behavior. It keeps constant the magnitude of the orbit.h vector (specific angular momentum) and direction of the velocity vector. Basically as you warp away from the planet/star your orbital velocity will reduce, as you warp towards it, it will increase. Some odd stuff happens with hyperbolic trajectories which requires special math in order to conserve angular momentum. Your angular momentum and semi-latus rectum remain constant, and your velocity changes based on your current position\u0027s SMA and radius. In a way it functions kind of like the opposite of the current behavior. You get no free energy with this one. You stay put space moves you. If you warp out to Jool you usually have too little velocity like a Hohmann transfer rather than too much. This means you can adjust your orbit in interesting ways, when I push this along I\u0027ll write a tips \u0026amp; what you can do guide for those curious in this alternate hypothesis on the behavior of an Alcubierre drive.
