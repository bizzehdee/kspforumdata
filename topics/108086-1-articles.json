The original reason I created this thread was because when I had a gigantor solar panel landed on Minmus, it still produced electricity when the Sun had set.\n\n\u003E ![H3uRv2i.png](http://i.imgur.com/H3uRv2i.png)\n\nAt first I thought it was because I had entered timewarp before the sun had set, but even after I slowed down to real-time it kept on providing power.\n\n\u003E ![WkLihyl.png](http://i.imgur.com/WkLihyl.png)\n\nSince there are other threads with different but related issues, I figured I\u0027d make this a more general solar panel weirdness thread, and link those threads here.\n\n[**OX-SAT solar panels still provide power when inside closed service bay**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118014-Bug-OX-SAT-solar-panels-still-provide-power-when-inside-closed-service-bay)\n\n[**Bug - Solar panels generate power while the sun is blocked by Minmus**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118983-Bug-Solar-panels-generate-power-while-the-sun-is-blocked-by-Minmus)\n\n[**OX-STAT work inside closed Service Bay**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118871-OX-STAT-work-inside-closed-Service-Bay)\n\n[**OX Solar Panels are not obstructed by closed Service Bay Doors**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119283-OX-Solar-Panels-are-not-obstructed-by-closed-Service-Bay-Doors)\n\n[**Bug: Solar Panels work while covered by closed Service Bay**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119379-Bug-Solar-Panels-work-while-covered-by-closed-Service-Bay)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T18:05:16Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 06:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by adinfinitum**\n  \nfixed pictures"},{"CreatedByName":"Tarheel1999","CreatedById":123965,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T19:48:09Z","Content":"The Minmus thing has existed since at least .90. If you look at the panels they track the sun (even through the surface of the moon) and receive power regardless of the sun\u0027s location. The only exception may be either a munar or Kerbin eclipse."},{"CreatedByName":"adinfinitum","CreatedById":49226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T19:55:26Z","Content":"Ah, well that\u0027s at least one of the issues answered, I never played 0.90 so that\u0027s interesting to know. I vaguely remember it being an issue back in one of the 0.2x versions, but I thought they had fixed it once between then and now."}]}
