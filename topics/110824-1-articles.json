It\u0027s not automatic, its not available in the action groups, and theres no right click option for it? I looked in the thread but didn\u0027t see anything there either. Does anybody know?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-26T01:11:42Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2015 01:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OddFunction**"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T01:03:18Z","Content":"OP of the mod\u0027s thread says that parachute deployment is an action-group-capable action of the pod\u0027s propulsion unit. \n\nIf that\u0027s not working try a reinstall; if it\u0027s still duff after that you might need to look at conflicts with other mods, or you might need to file a bug report with the mod\u0027s author."},{"CreatedByName":"OddFunction","CreatedById":143805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T01:11:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E OP of the mod\u0027s thread says that parachute deployment is an action-group-capable action of the pod\u0027s propulsion unit. \n\u003E If that\u0027s not working try a reinstall; if it\u0027s still duff after that you might need to look at conflicts with other mods, or you might need to file a bug report with the mod\u0027s author.\n\nI will look closer, thanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"MrDude","CreatedById":134194,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T04:15:35Z","Content":"Change Log mentioned that the parachute was being depreciated (removed) in favor of a lifting wing design. \n\nThe lift and thus duration of the descent was insane! Just glide it in, ensuring that you bleed off speed. I splashed down in excess of 100 m/s and was fine. Have yet to test a dirt landing but the glide ability is so large I passed multiple land masses with ease. \n\nI would prefer a chute or both - it took so long but was kind of neat."}]}
