Because what little social media and internet engagement this game already got will now fall off a cliff due to this news.\u00A0 Because the majority of people like me, who barely checked in once every 2 months due to past ineptitude on the project, will barely check back in a year or two, ...or if ever.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat will mean less interest in the game, and Take 2 (as this whole debacle has proven) are led by metrics alone.
