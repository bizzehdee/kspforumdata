(Perhaps they don\u0027t even exist at all, until spawned when the fairing opens.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe weight of the parts is calculated into the fairing base. Of course the center of mass shifts accordingly. (Don\u0027t forget angular inertia as well.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of this, the fairing is a perfect substitute for the parts, it physically represents all of them - in one single physics entity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEffects of doing this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-A 1000 part \u0022thing\u0022 can be sent up by a huge lifter without any lag. (No longer plagued by physics lag, now we can launch \u003Cem\u003Eanything\u003C/em\u003E.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The fairing \u0022protects\u0022 the part from structural failure as a result of wobbling or G-forces. (For realism, you can think of the parts being structurally attached to and supported by the fairing.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Less flailing, wobbling, wiggling and whatnot that makes attitude control a PITA. (We can actually steer.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-There is a good reason to use fairings other than aesthetics.

In real rockets, a stack of satellites or landers are not bearing eachother\u0027s weight, there are supports that carry each module. In KSP we cannot properly do this because of the parts only attaching in a tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The fairing has extra weight, roughtly equivalent or more to what you would normally spend on struts and girders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The fairing is breakable.
