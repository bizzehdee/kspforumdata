So a mainsail engine with say, horrible gimbling, but still nearly full power. These would be randomly generated for used parts. The idea being to save money and cut costs, while putting your flight at risk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother idea along the same lines would be \u0022the junkyard\u0022. Which is basically just a VAB of mismatched sort-of-does-the-job junk, for when you need to throw together a lander that is quite literally a trash can because your space program is out of money. That could be hilarious. \u0022Well Jeb we can afford to get you to the moon and back, but your re-entry shield is a moldy old mattress.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
