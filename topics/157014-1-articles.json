Idea is for you to design modules for me to send them to new station.But i will have strict requirements about mass and funds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VJMIe4Q.png\u0022 style=\u0022width:800px;height:auto;\u0022 alt=\u0022VJMIe4Q.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt has only 1 docking port. So i request, you to make a concept of habitat module that weights no higher than 25 tons, after you designed it, send a screenshot/photo of concept.Then after i day i will pick the best and the most interesting concept and launch it into space.(failures and delays might happen,so don\u0027t be random in designing a craft.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know you might think \u0022DESIGN YOUR MODULES YOURSELF\u0022 but i already did that and i want some people who can\u0027t go to space to make their dreams become true.Or even who can,try designing something special.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will report about success/failure of a mission !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
