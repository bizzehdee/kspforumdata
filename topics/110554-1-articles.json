So therefore, this should be my 300th post. (I never did a thread for 100 or 200, so let\u0027s go.) First of all, thanks to the wonderful Kerbal Kommunity that has been helping me since late October 2014. It\u0027s been a wild ride to 300 posts and nearly 200 rep, and you guys were willing to stick with me through it all. Next, a personal thanks to Starship and zekes, who were (and Starship still is) the people I communicated with the most. Last of all but definitely not least, thank you HarvesteR and Squad as a whole for dreaming up the game, and getting it all the way to 1.0, ***and*** letting me interact with many amazing people. Thank you to all, and have a good time.\n\nCheers, RAINCRAFER.\n\n![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nEDIT: Also thanks to Astrogamer. I forgot to include him in this post orginally, but this edit is fixing that. He is a great Youtuber and Forum-goer who pleases everyone. RAINCRAFTER, out.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-25T11:23:38Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2015 11:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RAINCRAFTER**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T22:29:38Z","Content":"Congrats! \n\n*Are we talking about me?*"},{"CreatedByName":"sj176","CreatedById":138287,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T23:08:14Z","Content":"woot woot"},{"CreatedByName":"RAINCRAFTER","CreatedById":127524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T12:53:58Z","Content":"Any other congratulations?"},{"CreatedByName":"RAINCRAFTER","CreatedById":127524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T00:02:30Z","Content":"Anyone else?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Well done Raincrafter, you\u0027ve been a good member for your first 300, keep it up for your next ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThank you.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m (Almost I think) at 1,000.\n\u003E Congrats!\n\u003E \n\u003E EDIT:\n\u003E \n\u003E I broke 1,000!\n\nThanks, and Congrats!
