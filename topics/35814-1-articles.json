First, burn retrograde (backwards) at your apoapsis to lower your periapsis to only a few km above the surface of the planet/moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, burn retrograde at your periapsis, but actively follow your retrograde vector as it moves towards the vertical as you slow down. When the retrograde vector is pointing straight up, you\u0027ve stopped moving laterally and can just decend the last few hundred/thousand m to the surface in a very controlled manner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo reasons I do it like this: First, it limits the area in which you will end up landing significantly, making precision landings a bit easier. (this is relevant if you\u0027re about to send a rescue mission) Second, when you\u0027re burning retrograde at your periapsis, your vertical velocity is nil so your orbital velocity is your lateral velocity so you have a very good idea of how much burn is required to halt that motion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing I like to do is just at touchdown, assuming my spacecraft is facing directly vertical, is to flare the engines quickly to nearly halt my decent 3-5m from the surface, then cut power completely with x. Then as my craft is hitting the ground, use RCS translate down to halt any potential bounces or rattling around.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kevo","CreatedById":67975,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-05T22:44:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehi sirrobet ive just tried and i hvnt even got enough fuel to get into a full orbit . plus i pressed end game by mistake so my lander and kerbal hve dissapeared now just my flag left there\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kevo","CreatedById":67975,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-05T22:48:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehi cartz thx for the advice il be trying all that . in ur last paragraph wht uve mentioned i was trying to do that on all my other failed landings i guess im must be heavy handed on the throttle cos i just start ascending again plus i didnt hve rcs on my lander like u said. i think il start putting rcs on my landers more\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-06T12:38:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kevo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kevo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E i guess im must be heavy handed on the throttle cos i just start ascending again plus i didnt hve rcs on my lander like u said.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes caps lock reduce throtteling up/down as it does with movement?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cartz\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cartz\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, when you\u0027re burning retrograde at your periapsis, your vertical velocity is nil so your orbital velocity is your lateral velocity so you have a very good idea of how much burn is required to halt that motion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou just gave me a hand-to-forehead-lightbulb-moment, thank you!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CCKinnison","CreatedById":71439,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-06T13:02:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerbMav\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerbMav\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDoes caps lock reduce throtteling up/down as it does with movement?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does not.
