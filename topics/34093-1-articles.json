According to my plan each module should have docking port on top of it and skycrane should dock by landing \u0022on top of\u0022 module. Unfortunately, my tests have shown that this way of mating moudle and skycrate is practically infeasible, at least for my piloting skills. Even after some practice I had less that 10% success rate with other 90% being complete disaster: either fuel ran out or skycrane crashed into module or ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENevertheless, I do not want to drop the whole concept of skycrane for by base, because I do not want to pollute design of modules with propulsion systems. So, I\u0027am asking for your help in this matter.

These work well, but take an incredibly long time to turn with a payload attached (or use a lot of RCS or both). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first option uses a payload attached via a docking port which you lower all the way to the surface, disconnect and fly off/establish orbit, or use the landing legs on your crane to drop down next to it (or if your\u0027e super fast drive out from under it and drop straight down). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond option uses a vertically mounted winch from KAS instead of the under slung docking port which gives you a LOT more freedom of movement in that you can lower your payload on a winch system to the surface increasing your margin of error quite significantly. However it\u0027s quite hard to get the winch connected to the centre of mass of the part your\u0027e moving. I found myself attaching radial mounts to \u0022mark\u0022 the centre, then using an EVA trip to connect the electromagnet to the centre of that giving me a correct centre of mass marker. You do most of your flight with teh winch reeled all teh way in and only extend it on the vertical descent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Merinsan","CreatedById":57629,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-21T15:15:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs I understand it, your problem is not landing things with the sky crane, but picking them up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried this myself, and the only solution I found was to land the sky crane first, then drive the cargo underneath, and subsequently lower the sky crane. Docking while in gravity is essentially impossible. I have done it on occasion with horizontal docking, light craft and RCS. Vertical docking somehow seems harder.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-21T16:01:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you trying to construct a base with this sky crane?
