Just about nothing. No windows, no navball, and the worst bit, no snacks! I then checked out some of the other IVAs to see what they had to offer. After checking out all pods and the hitchhiker canister thing, I thought that some of them could do with some new IVAs. Considering that none of them have had any IVA updates, I think that 0.24 should be the \u0027IVA update\u0027 or at least have one or two new IVAs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-09T15:24:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe spaceplane cockpits (along with many of the spaceplane parts) are due for a complete re-do at some point, and AFAIK the devs do not want to do an IVA space for the Mk3 cockpit until they get round to redoing the spaceplane parts completely, otherwise they\u0027re just wasting valuable development time.
