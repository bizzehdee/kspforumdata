You touch the panels end to end, then rotate them (WASDQE) until the panels are flush with one another. It helps if you\u0027re zoomed in (keypad \u002B and - control zoom in the VAB and SPH); you get a bit more control that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJohnno\u0027s got you covered on the necessary bits of rovers - only thing I\u0027ll add is to be sure to protect the vulnerable bits (the probe core and essential electrical systems) by encasing them in parts with high impact tolerance (panels and girders). Rovemates are totally unnecessary to make rovers - the core piece of the Hellhound is a reaction wheel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, there\u0027s nothing wrong with using Rovemates, particuarly for smaller rovers...the one in this pic can even haul a Kerbal around:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cLLH8p7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cLLH8p7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
