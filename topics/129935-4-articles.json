It\u0027s the difference between SpaceX landing their first stage and sending it out next launch with little to no refurb (and an already built payload), versus the space shuttle which used the same parts but had tons of refurb done so it was basically brand new.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Enginerdy","CreatedById":158880,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-19T03:12:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was very impressed when I saw this challenge.

I used TAC as my life support system, and also had KAS/KIS and USI Kolonization running. I used a SSTO which included the small drill and ISRU unit in the cargo bay so that I could refuel multiple times during the journey. I named the ship \u0022The Watney\u0022. I wasn\u0027t able to launch in time to get any of the prestige points, and I ignored any objectives that would\u0027ve required me to leave something behind. I wanted all of the hardware that I launched to return to Kerbin. I ended up visiting 5 biomes on Duna, and 5 on Ike, before returning home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cost of my ship was 228,992 funds, but I recovered it for a value of 228,883 funds. Apparently food, water and oxygen are a lot cheaper than I expected. I scored 27 points from visiting 5 biomes on Duna and Ike, and from putting one Kerbal into orbit and on the ground of each body.

It\u0027s a huge PITA when you\u0027re just dropping SRBs and don\u0027t really want to spend a bunch of time watching them descend on parachutes. That\u0027s why I went out of the way to make sure StageRecovery is compatible with it: when FMRS is off SR runs, but when FMRS is on SR won\u0027t try to recover anything. That way you can get the best of both worlds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d also like to mention that StageRecovery does support powered landings, not just parachute based ones.
