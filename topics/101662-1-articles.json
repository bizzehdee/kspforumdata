Cameras.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat HE meant was photographic cameras. I told him just to take screenshots, but what he meant was to have the ability to take a snapshot of a moon or planet to return to Kerbin for science, much like the photographs of the dark side of the moon in the Apollo missions. I guess you could argue that the \u0022crew report\u0022 would sort of include photographic evidence from the Kerbal inside the ship, but i did like his idea, and it got me thinking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about if there were video cameras that can be added to the exterior of the ship? The idea here is that you can actually hit a hotkey and have a first person angle from the cameras, and the best part is you get to choose where they\u0027re placed. Think of it as switching to IVA, but instead to a live camera feed. This would allow you to get angles which are inaccessible to the current camera settings. Also, I\u0027d think they would be pretty fun to use around an orbiting space station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFjord","CreatedById":97341,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T07:49:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShow your brother \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57603-0-23-RasterPropMonitor-make-your-IVA-a-glass-cockpit-%28v0-14%29-24-Jan\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least it should cover the IVA and camera stuff (and besides, it\u0027s awesome).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64972-0-90-DMagic-Orbital-Science-New-Science-Parts-V0-9-2-%282-26-15%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis one\u003C/a\u003E should cover all your needs for making science in orbit.
