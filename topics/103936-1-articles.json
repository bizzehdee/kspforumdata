That\u0027s the theme that seems to keep reoccurring. But, I don\u0027t know your life. I would think it would be hard to interpret a dream without knowing what\u0027s going on with your life.\n\nPersonally, I\u0027d go with the story that you were visited by a telepathic alien who is studying human psychology.\n\nIn all seriousness, I think most dreams, even vivid dreams, mean nothing. It may be your subconscious trying to tell you something, but it might not be. If you think that it is, then you can try to interpret it, but for me it\u0027s usually something I already know, but never really put into words. Sometimes it\u0027s something I know perfectly well. Of course, that doesn\u0027t mean to disregard it. I\u0027ve heard of scientists coming up with great discoveries because they listened to what their dreams told them about something.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-11T20:36:10Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2015 08:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Vaporo**"},{"CreatedByName":"kStrout","CreatedById":116630,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T20:39:10Z","Content":"your dreams make way too much sense compared to my dreams, for example, if I had that dream and grabbed the scissors, I probably would find myself as a different age in a playground on another planet, and find it perfectly normal.

If the dream makes too much sense, it might just be that the memories it was constructed from are fresh and/or easily accessed, and put into a sequence that just happened to make sense.\n\nOr it might really mean something. I\u0027d rather if it didn\u0027t, because if dreams are a meaningful part of our psyche, then I probably belong in a lunatic asylum ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nEDIT: Also, I\u0027m slightly disappointed by the lack of double rainbows in your dream.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-11T22:03:29Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2015 10:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Deutherius**"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T23:03:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E In all seriousness, I think most dreams, even vivid dreams, mean nothing.
