The fall-off in terms of science points gathered is a little quick and players get forced into doing very difficult and long deep space missions as soon as the technology allows them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me personally there should be choice in terms of how you want your space program to evolve, right now the campaign eats up too much time because in order to get science points you really need to get high Isp engines which can take hours of burn time to change course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means that KSP can\u0027t be played effectively without a great expense of time, something which not all of KSP\u0027s player base has.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo fix this, I suggest that the fall-off in science point gathering from one place ought to be less severe, this would allow players to refine their skills before being pushed on to the next conquest.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T05:30:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe feeling for this is because the only thing to do in career is unlocking the tech tree.

Staying around and making science from low orbit and surface from the several Biomes on KErbin can earn you a lot of science on it\u0027s own, one more reason to stay in LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Roderik","CreatedById":85776,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T07:56:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust ask for different difficulties in the game\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Algiark","CreatedById":83907,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T08:47:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe LKO can be some sort of testing grounds or training facility for kerbonauts\u0027 physical and mental health to help them prepare for long missions...?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T09:37:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELKO is where I stick my refueling stations, and dock different modules tougether into an interplanetair rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only engines that take hours for a burn are ion engines.
