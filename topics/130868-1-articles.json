It shows up in the game, and can see the model, but when selected it shows the two nodes for top and bottom but not the part. There is the main part and 6 cylinders that are separate but under the main body in unity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf more info is needed I can supply it.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-28T02:43:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI saw this once. Went back into Blender and the parts were a light purple/pink. Redid the textures so they displayed properly in blender - ran the parts through Unity and re-wrote the .mu file. They reappeared correctly in game.

I have altered the rotation in blender and unity in 90 degree increments and\u00A0\u00A0no matter what it will not connect properly. The cfg file is just the stock xenon tank, I must be missing something. I have spent the last hour doing different rotations with no luck.

This makes it easy to move pieces out of the way - just move the empty and the rest moves with it.
