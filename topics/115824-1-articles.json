Cantfix/Wontfix is not an appropriate response to such a serious performance issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if you think it\u0027s bad now, I\u0027m seeing a strong correlation with the number of active flights / debris... Which is why I can\u0027t ever seem to play right through a game - by the time I have the mods to patch the \u0022missing\u0022 features in and a few craft or offworld bases in play the stutter drives me away for a couple of months. I start playing again (hoping the latest patch improves it), stutter returns, cycle repeats.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConclusion: Unity is garbage, KSP is crippled because of it, none of the devs appear to care.
