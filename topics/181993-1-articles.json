So any part on either craft with autostrut that\u0027s set for the Root part has a 50% chance of suffering from ARD. (Either one ship\u0027s root will change, or the other one will -- so if you have Root autostruts on both craft then the odds jump to 100%.) It is wise to turn off all Root autostruts before docking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimilarly with Heaviest autostruts. If the new Heaviest part is on the other craft during docking, then the Heaviest autostruts will detach/reattach. So similarly, turn all those off during docking too. The problem with that is wheels and landing legs. They always have Heaviest autostruts turned on, and you can\u0027t turn it off.

Or other modules for any other vessel like a mothership that is constructed in orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsually the cargo that consists of any of your spacestation modules is on the top of your rocket, mostly encased in a fairing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey are generally well connected especially when they\u0027re faired so the cargo usually doesn\u0027t require heaviest or root part autostrut for rigidity anyway. The lifter itself however which could be quite large has especial need for strutting to heaviest or root part.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA Spacestation itself also is under microgravity, or almost all lack thereof (in i.e. solar orbit) so it isn\u0027t under strain. Only when you interact with it by docking is there a physics interaction. IME having grandparent autostrut on all the modules is sufficient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou also have to plan ahead. If you want to make a ginormous spacestation but your center modules are connected with the 1.25m docking port then the center connection points are weak so you might want to plan ahead and only use the sr docking port if your intention is to make a much larger space station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemember that you can change root in the editor. It is best for the root part to be in the middle of your rocket. This is usually one of the center fuel tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI personally never use rigid attachment. The only occasion where I used it was for a large contructional tug to haul heavy cargo on the surface made from I beams. The rigid attachment makes sure that any attachments are 100% rigid and cannot be bent. If I hadn\u0027t used the rigid attachment the construction would wiggle on the joints and the vesel would steer sideways, worse even clip inside and break apart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurthermore it\u0027s perfectly safe to use heaviest part on your spacestation. Especially if it\u0027s wide and sticking out with a lot of modules a center heaviest part connection point could be ideal for optimal rigidity.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, you will have to plan ahead. If your intention is to dock vessels to that station that have a heaviest part that is heavier then the space station consists off then it will change and physics may rip it apart.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf your intention is to never dock anything heavier then a regular MK3 cargo spaceplane or 2.5m rocket ship module a heavier kerbodyne fuel tank on your station could be a good option. All you have to make sure is that you never dock a part that is heavier or as heavy as that heavier part, or you will have to re-strut all the heaviest parts back to grandparent if you do so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemember that these physics bugs don\u0027t always surface, usually when the spacestation is part heavy or is over extended in height, width or length.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MisterKerman","CreatedById":189407,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-07T15:38:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell I had only used autostrutting for my single \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E cargo shuttle and docked with a wobbly space station.
