Back in the 60\u0027s, they had photos of the Moon, but none good enough to see what any landing site would be like. It was only when they first landed a probe they found out just how rocky it was, they did take photos when resolution got better, but at the end of the day, when Armstrong was landing Apollo, he found that the proposed landing site was too rocky, and had to go to manual piloting to move it to a better location... when I\u0027m orbiting the Mun, what I see looks OK... till I actually start to land and to my horror, see that I\u0027m heading for the side of a crater...\n\nIts the same for all the planets and moons... but even before space flight, they had some photos of Mars... and the probes provided more including other planets and moons... so really... NASA didn\u0027t have a fog of war EXCEPT when they wanted a safe place to land... and given the limits of KSP, we have that.\n\nJust my thoughts."},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T12:12:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E yeah i know, Im guessing you could have the game add and opaque EVE cloud layer whenever you go in map and remove it when you leave?\n\nNo, there are flag in the game to hide the planet and their orbits (and more ?
