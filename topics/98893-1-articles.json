The best strategy I\u0027ve found is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1-approach the station (\u0026lt;1.5km) and burn to bring your velocity relative to the target to 0m/s (or close)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2- using \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43901-0-90-Docking-Port-Alignment-Indicator-%28Version-5-1-Updated-01-10-2015%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Enavyfish docking indicator\u003C/a\u003E allign your docking port with the desired port onto the station (you can selecting it from far away with this mod)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3- align your movement with the target port, meaning that the green lines must cross in the center ( where the white axis cross) and the orange circle needs to be in the center too. (you should reach this between 1.5km and 0.2km away from the station, going between 4 and 12 m/s and timewarping)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4-when you are completely alligned you can start your final approach lowering your speed the more close you are to the station, final docking speed should be more or less 0.2 m/s \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eto move the green cross just put the yellow marker (prograde or retrograde) in that direction, keeping in mind that if you see the retrograde it means you\u0027re going away from the station (try not to exceed 2km) and if you see prograde it means you\u0027re getting closer, so if you are going outside the 2.0km/0.2km region switch between the two to not get too close/far from the station.
