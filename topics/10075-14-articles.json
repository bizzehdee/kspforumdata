Basically an orbital superweapon pointing at a power plant on earth:sticktongue:)."},{"CreatedByName":"CrashnBurn","CreatedById":32280,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-28T13:15:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What about a timestamp? So that it just remembers a global time when it was launched and then scales its power based on that.\n\u003E And some RTG have half-life of just several months (Lunokhod used such thing to survive the night), but have better power/mass ratio.\n\nIIRC, Lunokhod did not have an RTG, it used a Polonium heater to stop from freezing up at night but the heater did not generate power, Lunokhod used a solar panel for electricity. The solar panel closed over the top of the rover at night to help retain the heat from the Polonium heater. \n\nMost RTGs have useful lifetimes measured in decades with a very slow reduction in power production (a couple of % per year) over their lifetime. I doubt any KSP mission is going to last long enough to need to calculate those timelines. Although some krazy Kerbalnauts might just try. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nWith the most common RTG being Plutonium-238 powered, which will generating about 500W/kg of radio-isotope fuel divided by the efficiency of the TEG (under 10%), a very useful RTG can be the size and weight of a person and generate heat and electrical energy for decades."},{"CreatedByName":"Alchemist","CreatedById":8825,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-28T17:20:39Z","Content":"IRL you would take an RTG with lifetime just for the mission length, so that you\u0027ll take the lightest possible to provide the necessary power. Of course it will work several times longer, but the power will be lower and the craft won\u0027t work as good as it worked before.\n\nWe could have a similar set there, too: multiple RTG\u0027s that have different power/mass ratio (there should be different sizes, too) and half-live (with KSP scale it could be from several days to several thousands of days). \n\nLunokhod didn\u0027t use it as power source (just because it\u0027s more efficient to use photovoltaics here, but for hibernation the batteries are OK), but that thing is an example of using isotope with just 4 months of half-life."},{"CreatedByName":"Nori","CreatedById":41334,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-28T23:48:53Z","Content":"Okay, so I have a crazy thought. I was looking at some Ion RCS systems. They use large amounts of power for a smallish amount of thrust. The upside is they use next to no RCS fuel.
