I\u0027ve created an emissive heat animation with no problem, it works fine, I\u0027ve tested it in game, everything is great. Except I realized the models were no longer bump-mapped, so I went back and changed my shader from emissive/specular to emissive/bumped specular. However, any time I try and load the parts with the bumped specular shader, I get this error:\n\n    Load(Model): HeatManagement/IAHMS/125AHMS/model(Filename: C:/buildslave/unity/build/artifacts/StandalonePlayerGenerated/UnityEngineDebug.cpp Line: 56)File error:Failed to read past end of stream.  at System.IO.BinaryReader.ReadByte () [0x00000] in :0   at System.IO.BinaryReader.Read7BitEncodedInt () [0x00000] in :0   at System.IO.BinaryReader.ReadString () [0x00000] in :0   at A..ReadTextures (System.IO.BinaryReader br, UnityEngine.GameObject o) [0x00000] in :0   at A..ReadChild (System.IO.BinaryReader br, UnityEngine.Transform parent) [0x00000] in :0   at A..

Works fine otherwise. Any thoughts? \n\nSince it seems someone always asks for it, here\u0027s a screenshot with the hierarchy, though I don\u0027t know that it will help:\n\n![mFSwvq9.png](http://i.imgur.com/mFSwvq9.png)\n\nAnd here\u0027s a zip file with the assets I\u0027m using in it: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/xx377ewvw2r93ww/AHMS125.zip?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xx377ewvw2r93ww/AHMS125.zip?dl=0)"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T20:54:36Z","Content":"It looks like your model isnt exporting from unity properly, this is somewhat common when dealing with animation.
