the probes themselves\u00A0back to Kerbin.\u00A0 As \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022

various mod capsules) and you need 2 pilots in the controlling craft.\u00A0 Which also needs at least 1 relay antenna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have used this a couple of times and it works OK.\u00A0 The main problem is, the probe can only be \u00221 hop\u0022 from the controlling ship.\u00A0 I take this to mean there can\u0027t be any other relays between the probe and the controlling ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe whole idea is relatively useless IMHO.\u00A0 It seems to have been intended to allow you to control probes far from Kerbin before you\u0027ve upgraded the Tracking Station much if at all and unlocked the bigger relay antennae.\u00A0 But OTOH, you need to have unlocked the Mk 1-2 pod and enough rocket parts to get it all the way out there, which means you probably have all the other stuff as well.\u00A0 I suppose, therefore, that would be of most use if you use OPM, but for some reason don\u0027t also use other mods that give you big enough antennae to talk all the way out there, or didn\u0027t use the game option sliders to increase your DSN range.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgreed.... the usefulness would be for a manned craft to dialogue with, say, a lander probe on the surface of a distant\u00A0body.... or one that does not face kerbin ever,\u00A0 like the mun. A strange situation,\u00A0 as the craft flying above could just as\u00A0well be a large,\u00A0 hightech\u00A0probe itself,\u00A0 by the time you reached the science nodes required for the first situation!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
