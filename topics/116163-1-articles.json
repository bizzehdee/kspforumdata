My 0.90 save is *impressive*.\n\nAs to updating, you are missing out man. A more balanced thermodynamics system, more realistic drag and therefore ascent profiles on SSTOs... plus the memory leak fix.

At first I thought the complaints were a little silly but having started up a new campaign I kinda see where they are coming from. There is a point at which you don\u0027t have any of the airbrakes or drouge chutes and you need to do suborbital missions to continue, you can\u0027t use too many parts because you can\u0027t upgrade your launch pad, due to a bug in the tier 2 launchpad and you don\u0027t have launch clamps yet which are the workaround. The lack of parts makes it hard to get suborbital and have fuel to slow down using engines.\n\nThis perfect storm makes it really hard to slow down enough to deploy the chutes even if you do a rather wide arch. Though not impossible, you have to be really skilled. Really I like the bigger challenge but I think maybe Squad should relax it to say... 300m/s. Not a big change, but enough to not be \u0022advanced users only\u0022 while still preserving the gameplay that the more experienced users enjoy. Also, fix the blasted tier 2 launchpad Squad... I mean really, it\u0027s game breaking and it\u0027s still there.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-18T04:23:34Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2015 04:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"AbacusWizard","CreatedById":116476,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T05:24:14Z","Content":"Did the transition from 1.0.3 to 1.0.4 make any changes other than fixing the heatshield-prevents-existing-craft-from-loading-properly bug?
