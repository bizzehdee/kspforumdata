At the end of each week I had some mid-production editing sessions to reduce my post-production workload. Still filming, to be released by the end of April. You even took less time than I predicted that I will take. (cause I have lots of work, have to squeeze time for filming and making other YouTube videos). Did you have to speed up the clips to get a decent framerate? cause that happens to me that if I speed up my clips, I get the \u0022true\u0022 1x speed that we should be seeing. (that means the original non-speeded-up clips are a slow-mo)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor9","CreatedById":67915,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T20:17:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I don\u0027t necessarily plan my scenes to an extent. It depends on what kind of video I\u0027m trying to make, what maneuvers are involved, and what music I\u0027m using if any. There were a couple parts of the music score that I wanted a very specific image or scene portrayed. But mainly I just tried to capture a bunch of cool maneuvers of each plane from cool angles, and then I pieced together the clips how it seemed to fit. There was about 2 hours 36 minutes worth of footage I recorded, trimmed down to less than 5 minutes worth of the best clips.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t speed up the framerates; I use the raw footage recorded using Open Broadcaster Software. The only difference between my cinematics and gameplay vids are that the UI is hidden and I use BahamutoD\u0027s Camera Tools mod to get the cool shots. Other than that, it\u0027s pretty much me flying around and recording the maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-21T20:19:36Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2015 08:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Raptor9\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor9","CreatedById":67915,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-01T04:30:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRaptor Aerospace v2.0 video is now online.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
