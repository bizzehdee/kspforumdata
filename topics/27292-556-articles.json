As I was last typing on this thread, I realized what I needed to do was re-ballast the plane so the CoM didn\u0027t drift upwards as much, then reposition the CoT and CoL afterwards to account for the changes. So I did that - I used a couple of RCS Cylinders set below the payload to re-balance, adjusted the position of the engine clusters so that the CoT was better aligned and re-positioned the wings to put the CoL in better position. I also adjusted the position of the rudders; they were largely ineffective where they were originally.

I\u0027m a little concerned about the return; the lander didn\u0027t want to come out of the bay at first and it has no chutes, because it\u0027s supposed to rendezvous with the plane upon return to Kerbin and the plane is supposed to take it back down. Going to suck if I get back and I can\u0027t get the damn thing in to dock again - but I still think I achieved a thing of awesomeness last night. Going to be sweet if it actually does dock back up - that\u0027d be a mission to the Mun, 100% reusable for just the cost of fuel. Which probably is substantial - it\u0027s a \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1220,000 craft as is...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"inigma","CreatedById":69310,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-12T16:48:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Speeding Mullet\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Speeding Mullet\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo good!
