It uses jet engines to lift the craft up through Kerban atmosphere, then the jet engines detach and the main engine burns to either get a heavy craft into orbit or get a light craft anywhere in the solar system. This first model got the pod out to Jool and the lander visited all of the moons and crashed on Lythe. This first design doesn\u0027t use asparagus staging, instead, all of the engines run out of fuel at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/902138605368513635/245AE4BE8A99CC0A34DEAE5C53BE185998B2DB03/\u0022 alt=\u0022245AE4BE8A99CC0A34DEAE5C53BE185998B2DB03\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the improvements on the design, I got rid of the jet fuel and attached the engines to radial decouplers around a main powerful engine. The jet engines draw fuel from the extra fuel in the main engine so the Jet engines don\u0027t waste fuel when they decouple. They also automatically shut down when they\u0027re ejected because they get fuel deprived. Then the main engines burn and push the craft through the rest of the atmosphere and allow you to achieve your desired altitude. Next, the smaller 215 power engines fire and allow you to achieve orbit with fuel to spare for fine tuning and inclination changes. The next big improvement is that you can then undock the small engines from the main vessel. You then send up whatever engine you want using the same air lifter and dock it to the vessel. One double-long grey fuel tank with a nuclear engine on each of the five ports had more than enough power and fuel to get this Duna Command Center all the way to Duna, do the fine tuning, and assist with landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/902138605368502135/8919EDF4D71280F319859659925D247A481134EB/\u0022 alt=\u00228919EDF4D71280F319859659925D247A481134EB\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the base on Duna after parachute repacking and deployment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/1046252431431405359/0E0D977D4546E4A35EACA5A5AB468CAE059B0291/\u0022 alt=\u00220E0D977D4546E4A35EACA5A5AB468CAE059B0291\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the drawbacks of the lifter are: limited size and weight that they can lift into orbit, limited configurations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPros: efficient for the max payload, easy to get large surface area vessels into orbit for assembly, easy to build and set up, one size fits all in most situations, fewer stages, 0% failure rate on craft under 100 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis method can be used to lift craft in excess of 800 tons into orbit, it\u0027s very effective for getting full sized orbital fuel stations into orbit and transferring them to other planets using the attachment engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
