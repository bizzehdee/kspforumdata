(main thread here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129666-WIP-Mk3-Hypersonic-cockpit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129666-WIP-Mk3-Hypersonic-cockpit\u003C/a\u003E) The basic idea is an aerodynamic upgrade , by adding new parts, to the stock Mk3 parts. As of now I\u0027m only working on a new, sleeker Mk3 cockpit. The basic shape of the model is done, it\u0027s still a bit rough around the edges, but it will only take some minor adjustments. Now, my main problem as of now is that it is behaving really strangely with regard to physics. If I have intakes on a craft they don\u0027t work at all, and the crafts are completely uncontrollable, plus some other issues like a major camera wobble. I\u0027m posting what I have so far in the hope that someone is able to find out what\u0027s causing all the strange behaviour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome notes that might be of use (I\u0027m really not sure what info is the most relevant, but this comes to mind):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) The cfg file I\u0027m using is an edited version of the stock Mk3 cockpit cfg file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The collision mesh is a low-poly version of the model, but it may be slightly on the high side when it comes to collision meshes. It\u0027s got 186 polygons, although I\u0027m not sure how or if that would affect physics that much\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) When Kerbal Joint Reinforcement is installed, any craft with this cockpit goes completely nuts. Basically the cockpit breaks up and the rest of the craft starts floating like a hot air balloon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny and every bit of help will be enormously appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15103218/Mk3Hypersonic_test.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15103218/Mk3Hypersonic_test.zip\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
