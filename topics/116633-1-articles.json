That\u0027ll give you probably 450-500m/s limits for mains.\n\nJust a suborbital trajectory. Launch from the pad, get to 70k, and land in the ocean west of the Korean-like peninsula. You can\u0027t slow down without some other means (which I do not have unlocked). By the time you hit 250m/s you are too close to the ocean to stop, but it\u0027s just a little off, I hit 300m/s at an altitude that is reasonable for stopping.\n\nAs for copying data, it looks like this speed limit may be hard coded and would take a plugin. I don\u0027t see any configuration in the mains or the drogues for this speed.\n\nI don\u0027t think Squad tested this at a very early career. 18 ton limit, tier 3 tech tree only, carrying a science jr and two goo containers to space (discard before landing). Seems reasonable enough but it is very hard to get a wide enough trajectory to land. You can\u0027t carry enough fuel in 18 tons and without launch clamps you can\u0027t upgrade the launchpad either because...
