I wait for a second and it all the suddenly stops about 25% into the load. what I see next to the loading line says \u0022loading asset bundle definitions\u0022. so I wait some more. but it never loads anymore. thats where it stops. ive tried updating the game to the most recent version, didn\u0027t work. what\u0027s going wrong here and how can I fix it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-30T21:37:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you looked at the log files? There\u2019s one called KSP.txt or KSP.log inside the KSP folder that has some basic information in it, search from the bottom for exceptions, errors or crash reports. There are more detailed logs available but I\u2019m not sure where they are on mac- search for Player.txt or Player.log, and output_log.txt and you might find them. Log files aren\u2019t easy to read for beginners, so you can upload them to a file sharing site and then link to them here for others to take a look at.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry reinstalling the game from scratch (back up your game save files first!) or checking the file integrity if you can do that through the launcher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf that doesn\u2019t work, try what\u2019s suggested here:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u002216426\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed8091657352\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/124820-common-issues-the-launchpatcher-command-line-arguments-and-why-ksp-wont-start-on-macos/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:211px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd welcome to the forums!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
