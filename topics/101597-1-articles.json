We\u0027re heading up to Nefreys pass, a valley between 2 mountains 10 km away from our current position. We\u0027re going to rendezvous with the rest of the platoon there. Once we are there we will roll out and push the enemy back.

I was shocked, not by the fact that people scared me, but by the fact people had actually shown up to my birthday. For the past 3 years since I joined EKU, most of my family had forgotten about me and I spent all the holidays and my birthdays alone. \u0022Happy birthday bud.\u0022 said Alden, my best friend. He offered me a beer but I refused and proceeded to my room as everyone else partied and made a mess of my dorm. The next morning I woke up to find my dorm clean and everyone gone. I check my KPhone and saw that I had received a message. It was from an unknown person. The text read \u0022Meet me at hangar 3 for further instructions\u0022. I Figured it was from one of my commanders that I hadn\u0027t added to my contacts. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E I left my dorm hopped on my ATV and drove there. I was greeted by a taller Kerbal with black hear and black glasses on. He brought me to an office in the back of the hangar. The man appeared to be a Brigadier General. \u0022Listen here boy, you have a special opportunity to join some of my most tactically proficient men. I realize that you are just a mechanic but I need your tasks. \u0022Are you in?\u0022 said the General. There was so much on my mind I couldn\u0027t comprehend what he said. I had to think it through hard, but I accepted. Not knowing what I just did I panicked but I kept quiet. \u0022I expect you to be here by 03:30 tomorrow morning!\u0022 he said as he escorted me out of his office. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EChapter 2: Training\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003E It was 03:20 as I woke up and rushed to get dressed.

I got on my ATV and arrived at the hangar at 03:29 and was ready to do what I had signed up to do.\u0022Ah yes, there you are, follow me.\u0022 He said as he gestured me onto a jet-plane. When I boarded the aircraft I couldn\u0027t help but gawk at it\u0027s technological advances and how pretty it is. I finally sat down and he started talking about how I would start training for the mission. \u0022You will be joined by Alden, Erdlin, Randall, and Edmy. These are your battle buddies for this mission and your training. Get some rest, the flight is about 3 hours.\u0022 He said as 4 other kerbals walked on strapped in and looked at me. Alden was a surprise to me. I didn\u0027t know he was coming. Erdlin was a strange fellow. He seemed as if he was pissed all the time and that he was the big one of the 4. Randall was the tallest and looked rather average in looks but inside he looked like he knew nothing but how to shoot. Edmy was the highest rank of them all with Master Sergeant. He was very buff and he looked like he knew how to get stuff done. Before I shut my eyes I thought to my self that I was in good hands with these 4. Make that 3 because I don\u0027t trust Erdlin.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E 3 hours had passed when I woke up and the aircraft had just touched down.\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E*Screach* \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EThe wheels of the aircraft skidded to a halt. The cargo bay door lowered and we got out. We were greeted with a group of soldiers who were saluting us. The general and us got into his armored M-ATV and drove to the training site. Once there, we got out and were escorted to the first course, Weapons. Alden was very good with the M4 and HK-USP, same with Erdlin and Randall. Edmy was the best out of all of us. Then there was me. Everyone else shot in the targets where I was shooting all over the place because I couldn\u0027t keep my rifle steady.\u003C/span\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EOnce I was done we moved on the physical portion which I had passed.
