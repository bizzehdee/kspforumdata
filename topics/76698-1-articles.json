The case of a vertical launcher is fairly straightforward; A lifter generating 16.7 m/sec at the start can lift a fixed mass of fuel and tankage. This represents the upper limit of what is possible with a single stage composed of an infinite number of engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If it is at all possible, it would involve the aerospike (although you can use the same method to check other possibilities).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The aerospike generates 175 KN, which translates to roughly 10 1/2 tons at 1 G on Eve. Subtract the mass of the engine (1.5t) and that leaves 9 tons of tank \u0026amp; fuel, 8 tons of which is fuel. Our \u0022dead weight\u0022 is therefore 2 1/2 tons and our fuel is 8 tons. Plugging that into the rocket equation generates less than 5,500 m/sec delta vee. Not enough, so we can confidently state that a vertical lift SSTO from Eve is mathematically impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The aircraft is a different beast, since thrust is no longer a going concern. Here we assume no mass other than the Xenon tanks and try to guesstimate how much wing we need to lift them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The absolute limit of an infinite number of xenon tanks and a single PB-ION is 69,000 m/sec delta vee. Easily over the limit. Reversing the rocket equation, we can figure the minimum mass ratio that will still do the job. For 8,500 DV, it\u0027s 1.114, which means that 11.4% of the total mass of the vehicle needs to be Xenon. Accordingly, 4.8% of the vehicle\u0027s mass needs to be Xenon tanks, thus 16.2% is xenon and tanks, while 83.8% is not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Assuming zero mass other than engines and wings and assuming a pair of delta wings for each engine (why not?), this is .39T per engine/ wing combo. This would require 63.2 kG of xenon and tank. But of course our tanks weigh 120 kg, so we\u0027re looking at 2 engines and 4 wings per tank of xenon. This combo should be just enough to pull it off, and it looks like there\u0027s plenty of leeway to juggle that and even add payload/ control surfaces/ etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027m gonna call it possible, though watching something that slow get to orbit would be about as exciting as watching paint dry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts/ corrections/ criticism? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slashy\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-05T17:12:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGoSlash27, that\u0027s a good analysis, but I think you\u0027d need more than 8,500m/s of dV for a plane.

I greatly disagreed with the change (the highest thrust ion engine every created was like, 5N, and now, KSP\u0027s ion engine produces what- 2 kN? Or is it even higher? I can\u0027t remember). The main reason I disagreed though was that it makes ion engines TOO good- you can even use them as lander engines now, for small bodies. Honestly, ion engine airplanes are even more of an exploit, as ion engines only function in a vacuum IRL, and I really don\u0027t think that Squad introduced ion engines for people to use them on airplanes. They\u0027re supposed to be low thrust, high Isp engines for efficient interplanetary probes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that ion engines only work in the atmosphere because of the (incorrect) way that the KSP Isp system works.
