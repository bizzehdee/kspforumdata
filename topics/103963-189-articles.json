Specifically, when using RVE, the scatterer effects don\u0027t load past about 10^8 meters- which means that the atmosphere of Earth appears nonexistent when at or near the Moon, which looks kinda ugly. Is there an easy way to change that load distance?\n\u003E \n\nFound it. It\u0027s in PlanetsList.cfg.
