The reason for this is that it will be easier for you to create one environment simulation and tweak it to be \u0022worse\u0022 than for you to make a wide variety of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second is that if you do want drastically varied environments, that you don\u0027t go for too much \u0022depth\u0022 within them. Try to balance out how \u0022far\u0022 they deviate from normal conditions. But for resource limitation reasons you probably don\u0027t want to go too extreme because it will likely give you very little data beyond \u0022If I put the amoeba\u0027s in pure acid, do they die?
