I just started playing KSP and for some reason decided to go to Laythe with a jet plane. now this might not seem that unusual but in my case it would be the first time I tried to leave Kerbin orbit in any kind of controllable manner. After launching an ion powered jet on a trajectory towards a Jool orbit I realized that it not only would take WAY too long to complete the trip and said plane couldn\u0027t carry enough Xenon to complete my maneuvering and fly well in the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack to the drawing board and redesign the plane to make it more stable and carry less Xenon. Now, to get this redesigned plane to Jool I decided to make a \u0022carrier\u0022 for it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, like any self respecting KSP player I decided to do a test run with my new creation halfway through the designing phase to find major failures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Reached orbit?

Check\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Why don\u0027t I try to enter orbit around the Mun to practice the maneuver before I\u0027m halfway across the solar system?\u0022 And off I went, burning another 40% fuel to get on a trajectory towards the Mun. Turns out that you don\u0027t need as much fuel to enter an orbit than you need to break out of one. Now i\u0027m orbiting the Mun with 10% fuel in the booster stage and full tanks in the carrier/station itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I got that far it felt like a waste to revert to the VAB but the unfinished craft would be unable to return to Kerbin due to a complete lack of landing legs and parachutes (remember, I was just going to see if the thing could even reach orbit). This left me with 2 options: leave the fully fueled, but useless, station in orbit untill I could return and pretent that it never happened OR I could use all that fuel to land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI chose the latter option and did a de-orbit burn that would place me in the middle of the day side of the mun. I knew that landing a space station the length of a Rockomax jumbo fuel tank without losing my sideways speed would be a bad idea so I started to slowly kill the speed until I was slowly falling straight down... Way too late I realize that I had braked too early and was descending into the darkness of the Mun\u0027s night side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere I am, 10000 meters above the Mun trying to make my first ever powered landing, in a space station, that was never intended to leave space, which on top of that is only half-finished and in complete darkness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis story had a happy ending though as I only made HALF the craft blow up on impact with the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/23970900579460762/A31A9BA2AC8C39C1D8F10907D6886682E3294BA6/\u0022 alt=\u0022A31A9BA2AC8C39C1D8F10907D6886682E3294BA6\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so Bill Kerman became the first one to land on the Mun.
