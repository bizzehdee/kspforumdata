To make it more efficient, you could dock two or more crafts together, or do a Martian style set up where a lower stage has the ISRU, drills, and ore tanks, and the upper stage has the fuel tanks, and when your ascent stage decouples, the unneeded mass is left on the surface. A variety of mods will allow you to connect the ships without docking, or allow you to transfer resources between two vessels without them even being connected (KAS/KIS, or MKS).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-31T21:46:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGameplay question move to Gameplay Questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-31T22:16:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222486016\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022135568\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221459458563\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002259580\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022johnnyhandsome\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, johnnyhandsome said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo how does mining work in KSP?

I too combine them all into one lander, but I use a docking fuel lifter to take the converted fuel up to orbit from larger moons (the Mun and bigger planets/moons).

As long as the tanks are connected (including by Klaw / docking port) they will be filled when ISRU is running.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI take it you have right-clicked on the ISRU and started converting, and that it isn\u0027t indicating that there is no ore/no space to store the output?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-31T22:17:54Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2016 10:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Plusck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blaarkies","CreatedById":153700,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-01T07:48:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/107475-step-by-step-mining-guide/\u0022\u003EStep by Step Mining Guide -by rhadamant\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou might want to take a look at that, it explains everything around mining.
