It took me month, but that\u0027s because I took month long break to finish it. It really took just few days. I feel like making another cinematic someday. For further details watch the video or check it\u0027s description. Feedback would be really appreciated!"},{"CreatedByName":"Xacktar","CreatedById":88876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T12:33:34Z","Content":"Very nice video!\n\nGreat job pacing.

Kerbcam would be probably better than static camera all the time, but hardest-to-film scenes were actually take-off and docking, because you need focus on another vessel. I don\u0027t think that Kerbcam would help with it. I am however sure that it will find it\u0027s use in next cinematic, which isn\u0027t planned right now.\n\nNext time I will try to make it better, it was pretty much to test capabilities of myself (and maybe of my computer).\n\nBtw: Just realized I forgot to credit Smart Parts used for takeoff."}]}
