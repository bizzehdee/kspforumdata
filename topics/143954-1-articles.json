It seems to happen when the sun hits it. Towards the end of the video, I change the time of day (by fast-forwarding) and you can see it is still flickering but on the other side of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think it has to do something with the sun.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried different combinations of graphic settings, reinstalling the game on a different HDD, verified files, etc. and\u00A0nothing is fixing it.
