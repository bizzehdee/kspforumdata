I started with the Mod Manager and then went down the list. I start Kerbal after every mod is installed to make sure there are no issues and it is easier to remove the mod that seems to be the problem. I installed all the mods and also Mechjeb but I got a message saying that the two mods were incompatible with the version of KSP that I am using. I deleted the mods and KSP again, reinstalled and double checked that all my mods were the latest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I doing something wrong here or is this a known issue? Is there a way I can get these mods installed or will I have to wait for an update to KSP / Mods in time?
