Obviously not of course.\u003Cbr\u003E\nPresumably if the Empire can create artificial gravity, they can also cancel natural gravity. So despite the Death Star\u0027s mass, they can make gravity go any direction they want. As to why they decided to make parallel decks, it\u0027s a mystery.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, even at 160 km across, since the Death Star\u0027s interior is mainly empty space or air (since the rooms themselves are obviously hollow):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022xdQzI2d.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022662\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xdQzI2d.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...its density is much lower than that of a typical asteroid, and even 160 km asteroids made of solid rock have really pathetic gravity.

Take for example the star destroyer wreckage seen in the trailers for The Force Awakens - it\u0027s basically whole. Even airplanes, at their comparatively low speeds and altitudes, tend to splatter everywhere when they crash, so I\u0027m pretty confident a mile-long spacecraft made out of today\u0027s materials would not only explode and scatter across several dozen miles on impact, but break up during reentry and spew debris for hundreds of miles.
