Right now a couple of the nuclear nodes will be empty because of all the parts sizes being condensed into one. I don\u0027t really like that. I think you should have to research bigger reactors separately.

Dtobi\u0027s special part pack does this, and I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s broken in my tech tree right now since the TweakScale modules assume the parts are in a different section of the tech tree. If people like that idea I could include the .cfg in the download, but that would mess up any other saves you have if they were using a different tech tree. The other problem with TweakScale modules being dependent on the tech tree is that you don\u0027t see what you\u0027re unlocking in the tech tree, so that might be confusing unless I add it to the node description or part description.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JeffreyCor","CreatedById":93167,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-27T00:14:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAn idea for knowing what techs unlock part sizes might be dummy parts that aren\u0027t actually parts but show up in the list of parts that are unlocked.
