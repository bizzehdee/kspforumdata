Discovered a minor issue with the 2.5m Astropad (see below).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart one: the ship, launch, intercept and arrival at the asteroid. It follows the \u0022pods\u0022 concept I talked about previously, just this time with fewer welded parts (actually only one, the cone/RTG power generator combo) and all combined into one ship instead of one for the drive section/drop tanks and one support ship as shown yesterday.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe images show the top section with a Philly to probe for water; then a stock gyro pod using the 2.5m Astropad grabber from this mod, the SAS modules are disabled at the start (or else = wobbly); then a refinery with more RTG power; and finally a drive section, again using my downsized 2.5m variant of the z-pinch-fusion. I really like the ZPF model, but you can just replace it with any Nuke or other engine if you prefer those... the ZPFs are a little overpowered with their ISP of 1200\u002B, but for me it\u0027s just a matter of \u0022getting there\u0022 with fewer parts and less hassle, especially for these tests \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E For the same reason I let MechJeb handle most of the flying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/n0NvB\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

This is a lot of rinse and repeat: arm grabber, attach module, activate SAS/tanks where required, and decouple pod from ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring this phase I discovered a minor issue with the grabber part: the control direction of the 2.5m part (and possibly of the Philly as well) is inverted. To reproduce, just put it on top of your rocket and right on the launched pad select \u0022control from here\u0022... you\u0027ll see what I mean. Apart from that no issues, once or twice the grabber took a while to lock but that\u0027s just the same as for docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/SHRKZ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled. View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart three: plotting to bring the asteroid into orbit around Kerbin and testing the refinery. The 4 gyro-pods are way more SAS power than required for a C-class, so it turns really well. And here we learn why I probably will not be using the refinery in my regular (career mode) game: it makes capturing E-class asteroids very easy. If this were not a 110t C-class but instead a 3000t E-class, my tiny drive section would only have fuel for about 69 m/s. For those I usually bring another two drop-tanks (stock 3.75m medium tanks, each with a grabber to attach them separately to the asteroid), for a total of about 330 m/s available delta-V. This is usually enough to adjust the approach to enter a prograde orbit and capture, but far from being able to circularize (I do not aerobreak asteroids, period). Extrapolating from the amount of water in the C-class (15k water at 110t, which should refine to 2250 units of LiquidFuel if I read the description correctly, an E-class would probably have over 61k of LF (!) which might even be enough for a powered descent into KSC ;-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/1gp42\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Would you want to have a more specialized resource detection for the different resources?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAhh ok that makes sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t mind having a single scanner/detection mechanic, keeps the part counts down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut could I put in a feature request for a randomize option? Say I add 10 resources to the potatoroid could we have the option to set a \u0022chance\u0022 value and have the system say randomly select up to 3 of them to use and then remove the rest? That way each astroid that spawns isn\u0027t guarenteed to have large quantities of everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat would allow people to use MM configs to hook new resources into the system \u0026amp; let them set a rarity chance \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-20T13:54:25Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2014 01:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ExavierMacbeth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xentoe","CreatedById":80083,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-20T15:49:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry the Active Texture Manager Mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sloves nearly all Texture Problem.-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(If you do not yet).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechnicalK3rbal","CreatedById":86903,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-20T15:51:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs the water interchangeable with the Interstellar mod or might you consider doing this in the future?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"curiousepic","CreatedById":60039,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-20T20:33:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is awesome!
