Nothing significant has changed in 1.1.2. in that regard.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou probably fly too steep a trajectory and are going too slow. You should fly a gradual arc reaching\u00A045\u00B0 at 10km and flattening out even further. The goal is to never deviate from your prograde vector too much, because that is what creates a lot of drag. Ideally that means flying a gravity turn with absolutely no control input. For that however you need your pitch maneuver to be perfect and it\u0027s not worth obsessing about this.

The only thing to remember is that between 270m/s and 340m/s is the transonic region before passing the soundbarrier. In that region of speeds you will encounter more drag. Once you pass the sound barrier, you are encountering less drag actually. So try to point exactly prograde while you are between 270m/s and 340m/s. One thing you can do is to punch through the sound barrier on SRBs early on.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-06T02:00:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222562261\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022139005\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462422382\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022111592\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nater662\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n21 hours ago, nater662 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you both!

Second, jets have much more complicated thrust characteristics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou need to go supersonic at modest altitude (under 10km) and then you begin to gain more thrust than drag as you speed up. That\u0027s the point where you want to start climbing; a common figure is a 30-degree pitch. Probably a shallower pitch would do better, but there\u0027s a risk of melting your cockpit if you climb too slowly and gain too much speed at low altitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-06T07:19:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222562099\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022139005\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462415754\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022112072\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Empiro\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 05/05/2016 at 4:35 AM, Empiro said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re working with very old information, ever since the Aero update, the process is:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.3 TWR on the pad.\u00A0Fly up until 50 m/s, pitch to the right 5\u00A0degrees.
