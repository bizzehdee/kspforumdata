KSP calculates most physics on a per-part basis. There are a few exceptions to this (and more that are activated above a certain time warp value), with orbital pathing being one. Atmospheric drag, however, is not, to force-load that so craft which dip into the upper atmosphere experience orbital decay would apply the full physics impact of undergoing reentry with that vessel, plus whatever vessel you\u0027re currently flying.\n\nNow, your request of \u0022force physics to calculate all the things all the time\u0022 would induce so much computational load, the game would grind to an unplayable halt. Unity 5 will allow for multithreading of physics in multi-craft situations (which means bases and other constructions are only limited by the largest single-vessel by part count instead of the total part count within physics range), but there\u0027s still limits and what you\u0027re considering is breaking those limits.\n\nTL;DR: the game doesnt calculate physics all the time for a reason.\n\nIf you still want to know more, there\u0027s a few mods out there which force vessels to stay loaded (via a part hook). I suggest you take a peek at their source if thats your fancy."},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T09:25:14Z","Content":"The CPU usage is not even the real problem.

So beyond 16km your physic precision is getting worse and worse.\n\nIf your active a vessel physic near the mun when you are on kerbin that vessel physic would have a precision of \u002B/- 2 meters."},{"CreatedByName":"almagnus1","CreatedById":78068,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T21:49:23Z","Content":"Ok, so what are the exact implications of setting the physic range to MAX\\_DOUBLE?\n\n@Captain Sierra:\n\nRandom question, but did you ever play any of the Outposts or Space Quests?"}]}
