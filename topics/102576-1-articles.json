Don\u0027t forget with aerodynamics comes drag. Forward drag will pull an un-aerodynamic craft around exactly as you are describing. If you are launching a simple command pod with a parachute on top, it should be fine, but if you have a flat surface at the front of your rocket or just have dragging parts sticking out off the sides, that is bad. Make sure you are using a fairing mod (procedural fairings, KW rocketry, etc) to direct airflow around your payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have all that taken care of, then look at your launch profile.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"soulsource","CreatedById":110576,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T10:29:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore: Check the FAR info window. It has a display of stability derivatives (a measure of how a movement in a certain direction causes forces and torques in/around other directions). Ferram was nice enough to colour code them, so you can spot any stability issues immediately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the possible solutions, I fully agree with what has been posted already. I\u0027d just like to elaborate on the possible reasons your craft might get unstable in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most probable issue would be if your first stage contains a tank that is in front of the rockets center of mass (COM). This is a fairly common situation with big crafts and very hard to avoid. As KSP will first empty the tank that is the farthest from the engine, a tank in front of the COM will lead to a shift of the COM backwards, what reduces stability. So, in such a case, display both, COM and center of lift (COL) in the editor, and empty the tanks of the bottom stage that are above COM using their right click menu, of course starting from the farthest tank. You should see the COM move. If it ends up too close to COL, or even behind it, your craft will probably get unstable in flight. Just to be on the safe side, you can rerun the FAR panel stability simulation with empty tanks to see how emptying the tanks affects your ship. Of course, don\u0027t forget to refill the tanks before launch (you might laugh, but that happens to me regularly).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMach effects are another thing. Above the speed of sound aerodynamics change. As I don\u0027t really recall the details from the hydrodynamics lecture, I sadly cannot tell you the formulas, but regarding the game it\u0027s enough to know that control surfaces are less effective and that the drag forces are different at such high velocities. Again, I\u0027d like to refer you to the FAR window in editor, which allows you to plot aerodynamic properties of your ship as a function of angle of attack or velocity. The latter is the thing you\u0027re going to need to figure if a too high velocity is an issue with your craft. Run the simulation for a reasonable angle of attack (the default value of 5 degrees should be fine), and follow the yellow line, which is the moment coefficient (Cm). In dense atmosphere (I\u0027d say below 35 km on Kerbin) it has to be negative, otherwise your ship will probably flip (slightly positive numbers might work if you are very good at piloting, but I wouldn\u0027t risk them). So, watch the current Mach number in flight and keep it in a range found to be safe in the editor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is one thing that you should also keep in mind: Stock KSP SAS will probably fail to keep rockets stable when using FAR. Control them manually, if possible using a gamepad or a joystick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I forget: check out Ferrams \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/ferram4/Ferram-Aerospace-Research/blob/master/README.md\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EReadme\u003C/a\u003E file.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Poynting","CreatedById":103397,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T10:54:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI personally just use plenty of fins to make my rockets stable. I take the hit on drag to ensure I can take the optimal flight path to orbit. However one trick I recomend for stable rockets is reducing the sensitivity of the fins to around 20% (right click in the VAB and set to positive 20).

Pretty much what everybody has said here is correct - boiling it down:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesign wise, your rockets will need 3500 m/s of delta-V and about 1.2 initial TWR per stage to make orbit. In my experience, that translates to \u0022Take your stock rocket and add the bits that were considered unnecessary mass in stock - like nosecones and fins. You\u0027ll be in the ballpark just by doing that\u0022. A good fairing mod also comes in handy, especially if you\u0027ve got a blunt-nosed payload (like one of my typical Munar landers). I\u0027d suggest Procedural Fairings - once you figure out how it works, it\u0027s a minimal fuss mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlying it is also going to be a little different. Imagine trying to launch in stock with nothing but aerospikes; if you\u0027ve ever tried that, you know how easy those things make your rocket flip out - and that\u0027s in the damn STOCK game. You won\u0027t be able to make that sharp turn at 10k like you\u0027re probably used to doing - you\u0027ll need to start out a little lower and a little slower. I\u0027d suggest heading for 80-85 degrees once you\u0027re in the air, and then ever so slowly nudging down to 45 degrees after that. Keep it slow - no sudden movements. Once you\u0027re at 45 degrees, you can pretty much treat it like any other kind of launch. And getting back down is cake; the only thing that FAR required me to change from my stock rocket mission profiles was that initial bit of the launch.
