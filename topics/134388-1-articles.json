I happily recovered the ship. Got the bunch of science and the recovery message box told me that the 4 Kerbals were recovered, they got the xp and stuff. Final Frontier summary also popped up. I hit the Done button and when I checked the Final Frontier window and the Astronaut Complex they all say that these 4 Kerbals died.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI reloaded the quicksave, exited the Kerbals, recovered the ship and than the Kerbals separately from the Tracking Station screen. Result is 4 dead Kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey had plenty of USI Life Supply, and the respective setting was set to turn off the dying part of this certain mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI carry the save since earlier versions and I\u0027m playing a stable 1.04 version until 1.1.
