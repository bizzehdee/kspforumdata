Isn\u0027t it interesting how the widespread access to the internet made the development of such a lively gaming culture and even identity possible? Players and consumers were now able to express their opppinions about games and gained an influence on game development. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the realization of secure economic transaction the industry was able to fragment and litte studios could finance specific ideas through crowdfunding. To raise funds small companies propose to realize a certain game concept to motivate interested players to pay in advance.

In my opinion this effect is similar to \u0022the hype\u0022 but somehow different because the players now imagine to be able to influence the product according to their wishes (they are not simply waiting for a product as consumers).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA look in the forums of crowdfunded games like KSP, star citizen or elite dangerous reveals an explosion of content that is mostly players making countless suggestions, players worrying about development decisions and criticizing or applauding certain aspects when actually implemented into the game. There is a strong tension between the promised \u0022we make the game that you want if you invest a certain amount of money\u0022 vs. thousands of thrilled players with different views on how the game has to be when released (an illusion of the individualzation of game development?).

You are investing money which is, nominally, going straight into the development of the game. Without your investment this game does not exist (kickstarters are a prime example of this). Instead of shares your dividend is a copy of the final product, perhaps some backer bonuses, and [implicitly] your beta feedback on the game as it develops. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there are no case examples for the rights of backers, nothing put into most of the agreements, and a heavy reliance on both consumer naivete and the letter of the standard EULAs. The result of that is that, for a hit to their reputation that may or may not stick with them, game companies have stumbled upon a way to print money with no strings attached. Unless the market corrects itself against these sorts of practices, I fear that the end of the early access phenomenon will be a class action lawsuit against a larger company that trotted out the \u0027we never ACTUALLY promised this\u0027 line once too often.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
