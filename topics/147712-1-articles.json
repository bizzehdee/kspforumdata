This seems to happen every time I get pretty far in the campaign. Game crashes more and more often until I finally can\u0027t play anymore. So frustrated right now. Often after a crash, my current save is corrupted, but it doesn\u0027t usually corrupt them ALL. This time it didn\u0027t seem to corrupt the last game I had loaded before I quit, but it won\u0027t let me load any of my other saves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo to sum up, I can start the game and load the current persistent file, but when I go to load the save game I actually want, I can select the save game and click load but it never finishes loading the save. Guess I\u0027ll go back for the 5th time and try to find a freaking save game that works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone know a fix to this or why it happens? I just tried verifying game cache in steam and that didn\u0027t help. I am running probably 25 mods, nothing crazy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-15T03:16:05Z\u0022 title=\u002209/15/2016 03:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by seeingeyegod\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"seeingeyegod","CreatedById":162769,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-15T19:00:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo...
