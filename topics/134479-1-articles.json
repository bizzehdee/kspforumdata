A strange thing happened. The game runs incredibly slower. Not only that but every x frames (say, every 3 seconds, real time, to 10 seconds, sometimes) the\u00A0screen freezes for half a second, and then resumes...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI removed all mods to see if it was an incompatibility problem but no... Problem remains.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI noticed that if I start a new game, build a small jet aircraft and fly it, for instance, this problem does not appears or is not noticeable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I remove almost all ships from my career saved game and fly an SSTO (more complex ship), I start noticing the slowdown\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I use my saved game in full, all ships, all missions and MechJeb (I have to have MechJeb installed in order for most of my ships to load), the problema assumes drastic proportions. I am pretty sure that it is not MJ fault, since even without it, the problema is noticeable. NOTE: There are no ships within the 2.3Km radius of the test vessel, just around Kerbol system and far away, as usual.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing 1.0.4... no problems at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny clues?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RA3236","CreatedById":150734,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-20T13:22:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat mods did you have installed in 1.0.4?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jaeleth","CreatedById":136435,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-20T17:20:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMechjeb II, AGX (action groups inflight\u00A0edit), Hyperedit, Kerbal alarm clock, ship manifest.
