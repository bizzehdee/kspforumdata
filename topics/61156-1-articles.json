The Soyuz/Progress SM carries ~2 tons of propellant and only has 390 m/s of delta. It\u0027s not a good comparison, because this tug would be much smaller and lighter, but it would also have to be able to do at least twice the orbital changes that are necessary for Soyuz/Progress mission. A closer idea would probably be the Cygnus service module, but I couldn\u0027t find the size of its propellant tanks or its dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo calculate the required dV, we would need to know what they would typically use as a parking orbit, which we don\u0027t, but I suspect that it would have to be at a safe distance from the ISS, especially if the rocket has a 30% chance of failure\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, maybe I was overestimating with 1 ton of tug propellant for each supply run, but the tug still needs to be refueled, and that will take a significant chunk of the total payload capacity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy point was that the study concentrates on the rocket but ignores the operational cost of the tug, the cost of the incessant manoeuvers and operations that need to be tracked on the ground, the additional ISS docking requirements and the disruption to ISS operations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sgt_flyer","CreatedById":57690,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-27T00:00:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEdit : heh : beat to the spot by nibb31 about the indirect costs \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if we can make it more reliable, before being able to build it they will have to create absolutely huge factories to sustain the production rates which would be needed to make it useful.
