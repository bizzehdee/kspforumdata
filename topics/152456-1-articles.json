It flew fine until about 8000-9000m altitude when it violently rolled to the right, and it was hard to control it until down to 5000-6000m altitude. I can\u0027t provide pictures for now, as I\u0027m overseas. I will post a picture/gif when I\u0027m back. For now I just want to know if anyone knows what\u0027s happening and how to fix it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-23T11:58:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDue to the fact it\u0027s pulling to one side or the other it sounds like an asymmetrical flameout - one engine is starved of air.\u00A0 You can test this by monitoring the airflow into the engines when getting to the problem altitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-23T17:07:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA craft file would be even more helpful here.
