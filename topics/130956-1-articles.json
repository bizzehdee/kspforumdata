There are mods to display the orientation numerically, but not to set it, and AFAIK nothing to change its position.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy problems were compounded when i built a twin hulled space plane, for which the symmetry does not work, so i had to build a hull, complete with fins etc, duplicate the part, apply it to the hull, use a mod to remove the symmetry, delete\u00A0parts that are no longer needed to be mirrored\u00A0and then attach everything to the craft root. Not only a nightmare, but impossible to adjust anything as you cannot make the adjustments match on each side of the craft.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Benoit Hage","CreatedById":104585,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-29T20:43:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you post a screenshot of that dual hull plane? With a bit of luck you can use the subassembly feature. To my experience, everything in KSP can be aligned. Maybe not the struts, depending on the construction of your ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr. Speed","CreatedById":72133,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-29T21:27:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah a screenshot would help. Im not sure but I have a hunch your root part is on one of these hulls? If that\u0027s the case you could try to put the rootpart in between the hulls and build the hulls out from there.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
