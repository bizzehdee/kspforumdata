I even modded to cfg files so that it can make more ammo as well (guns are from BDArmory mod). Theoretically, it can keep going and shoot down enemies forever. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qbsrrSg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022qbsrrSg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-01T20:13:41Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2015 08:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Slam_Jones\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
