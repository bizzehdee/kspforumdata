Just make the hollow ring denser. Reaction wheels concentrate as much of their mass as possible at the outer diameter to maximize polar inertia per unit mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI bet if you were to open one of those reaction wheels pictured in your post, you would find that the reaction wheel itself is hollow, with the drive mechanism and bearing in the center. Or at the very least, with a heavy \u0022doughnut\u0022 of material at the edge with a lightweight structure connected to the center spindle, like a toy gyroscope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Poking around google images, it seems that most reaction wheels are cup shaped, with most of the mass concentrated in the outer shell, with a much lighter disc at one end connected to a central spindle. The motor and bearing are placed inside the cup. I guess the mass of the bearing is a factor, a bearing for a hollow ring would be heavier than a smaller central bearing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-15T15:17:45Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2014 03:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Red Iron Crown\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-15T15:55:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen we\u0027re talking about the ASAS \u003Cem\u003Emodel\u003C/em\u003E, then I am pretty sure the reaction wheel component in it is the small yellow/orange ring, the block is meant as control unit and the rest is casing. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/72503-Saturn-V-instrument-unit-as-a-science-unit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESomeone posted a picture\u003C/a\u003E of what appears to be the inspiration of the whole part just recently and you can see that there is no room for anything huge rotating around it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Instrument_Unit_514_%28IMGP3463mod%29.jpg/800px-Instrument_Unit_514_%28IMGP3463mod%29.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022800px-Instrument_Unit_514_%28IMGP3463mod%29.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-15T15:58:43Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2014 03:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Kasuha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-15T16:02:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI assumed the yellow disc was the drive mechanism and the reaction wheel itself was inside the ring, which is noticeably thicker than the Saturn instrument ring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKind of a moot point as the reaction wheels aren\u0027t simulated to that degree anyway, they just apply force to the craft as required.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"purpletarget","CreatedById":57317,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-15T16:13:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ASAS model was from an earlier version where the part wasn\u0027t a reaction wheel, but simply a set of flight computers to allow SAS functionality (And yes, based on something similar to the pictute, which is all guidance and telemetry gear.
