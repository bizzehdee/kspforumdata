I just dont get it i guess. And before you go and say if i dont like it dont download it all im saying is its too confusing to have all that stuff.

The official updates will be done via Mini AVC so you will receive a message in KSP when there is an update.\n\nSo if you don\u0027t like to test individual parts and only want official updates I suggest you download the latest release.

When you change something dont add a new model just update the one you already have. If you look at my folder I have removed all the redundant parts and textures also move some models around. like i put the nose gear in the Crew Compartment folder so i could trim the CSS Nose folder out and i fixed the configs for the right and left oms engines and trimmed the regular oms out, I took all the boosters out but the one that fits best with my white texture."},{"CreatedByName":"Jeast","CreatedById":117273,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T17:32:58Z","Content":"Mike, do you think its possible to trim out the latest version of the mod a bit?"},{"CreatedByName":"Mike-NZ","CreatedById":142683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T22:35:55Z","Content":"I need feedback to make final selection.\n\nCheech its not in the final release stage yet.\n\nyou complained about the engine mount so there it is.

How are my comments not constructive? I gave you the solution. I think you have to much going on. I commented that engine mount 2 had a collider issue and you redone engine mount 1. And if you dont want advise and criticism then maybe you should not have taken on such an big mod. As for being part of your \u0022development team\u0022 everytime i gave you advice you got hostile about it. So i dont feel i was part of it anyway.I was just trying to make it easier for everyone but you want to make as difficult and as confusing as possible. If you make a new part put it in a new folder so people who dont want it dont have to guess what to delete. There ya go my last advice for you. I been playing KSP since it was alpha and seen many modders fail do to disorganization and treating criticism and an attack. Im just trying to help. How can you expect us to test things when there are so many of the same parts. You even messed it up and got confused on the engine mount.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nI have some ideas.

There will be no more discussion about the file size, file organization, or anything of that matter. Cheech you have made it abundantly clear that you are unhappy about the state of how the current CSS file structure. There are unnecessary parts but it has been stated several times over that this is not the final iteration of the pack. Mike Cheeche\u0027s points are valid its difficult to test parts when we aren\u0027t sure which one to test. It might seem simple cull which parts we want and don\u0027t want but it can get confusing. Cheech it is not constructive when the point is made over and over again. Especially when your point had been acknowledged. So please lets not derail this thread with trivial quibbles over file structure.
