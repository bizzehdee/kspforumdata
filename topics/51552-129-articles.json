I re-targeted that dish (after warping days ahead for the sunrise/solar power) at a satellite in my new comms fleet and Hey Presto!, I can enter the tracking station again. I don\u0027t know, is it a hint to what is going on perhaps?; or just a totally unrelated and random set of events? Is there an attempt being made to do a line rendering from the probe to a non existent vessel?
