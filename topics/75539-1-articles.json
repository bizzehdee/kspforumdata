This suggestion goes mostly towards helping new comers get to grips with the game, while also adding a challenge element to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically you would have parts that purely a fixed mass, but don\u0027t really do anything. You could have a part that is 5 mass units. You would use this as your payload to test your ability on getting it into orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould also have a 10 mass unit, 20 mass unit, 40 a 50 an 80 and a 100, for Jeb maybe a 2500 one, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo clarify. For beginners, it would let them build a rocket that they could put in the sub assembly for later use. This encourages the use of the sub assembly. It also lets them know that if they build there payload, say a lander that is less than 10 mass units, it will get into orbit, using this rocket. This will allow them to experiment more easily with building and learning how to do rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the more experienced people, these Mass units can provide a challenge. Sure I\u0027ve already seen challenges about putting so much into space using this type of rocket etc. I feel there is a challenge aspect to these parts as well people can enjoy. Since the parts are fairly simple, they should be easily mod able for any custom challenge u wanted yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly I believe this fits in with the current framework of the game, instead of providing lots of information like a spread sheet to people, like certain mods do. It provides an element people can experiment with, and in return get a useful feel for the game. Encourages the mind set of experimentation of putting the parts together to achieve a goal, but once that goal is complete you have then a standardized rocket, You built yourself and can be proud of, which can be used repeatedly for other goals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think its a fairly simple idea and shouldn\u0027t be too difficult to implement. I think as tutorial parts, it would be a good idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you guys think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Random Tank","CreatedById":104325,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T08:24:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmmm... I\u0027d prefer if it was one part that you could tweak the weight of (I KNOW THERE\u0027S A MOD FOR THAT), just to save spamming the parts bin, but a good idea nonetheless. For proper newbies it wouldn\u0027t be that useful, as they\u0027re just testing to get ANY rocket into space, let alone one with a payload; it\u0027d be more useful for testing capabilities of launch stages.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RidingTheFlow","CreatedById":111197,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T08:34:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo have this in stock, it should be made able to display assembly weights at least...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-20T09:07:20Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2014 09:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by RidingTheFlow\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pulstar","CreatedById":57193,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T10:16:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would be good for lowering the CoM on rovers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T10:26:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a good suggestion. I tend to build lifters for specific payloads, but it would be good to be able to easily tweak up the payload mass to discover exactly how much mass a launcher is capable of putting into LKO.
