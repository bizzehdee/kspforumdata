In 90\u0027 and last decade fantasy was much more popular than space, so when in the 10-20 years from now these children will have smaller incentive to support space exploration than if they get more s-f. As long as space programs are funded by the government in democracies attracting attention of the average Joe and his kid is worth effort.

To make it appealing to a large market, and if you\u0027re making a movie to make money, that\u0027s what you want, you have to make it more accessible. You make it about human drama, or about explosions. And if you\u0027ve got effective human drama or explosions, most of your audience isn\u0027t going to care if the SF is hard as cotton candy, so why bother with it? It might not actually get in the way, but if you don\u0027t need it to satisfy the majority of the audience, you might as well just ignore it from the outset.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"karolus10","CreatedById":17876,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T01:06:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIMHO, one of most shameless spaceship designs (and there is more sharing ever lower place - Armageddon, I\u0027m looking at You ;p) I remember are \u0022messiah\u0022 from deep impact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.doblu.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/deepimpact4001.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022deepimpact4001.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looks like shuttle being duct-taped to some random Russian stages with few shuttle/titan SRB\u0027s strapped around, but movie is pretending that this craft is propelled by \u0022nuclear\u0022 rocket thingy... what the hell\u0027s wrong with these people !? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERace to Mars was pretty decent movie \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-25T01:15:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2013 01:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by karolus10\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PaleoGamer","CreatedById":66992,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T01:33:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck out \u003Cem\u003EEuropa Report\u003C/em\u003E.
