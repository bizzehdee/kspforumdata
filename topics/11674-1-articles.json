If you want to launch a giant space station, we want to help you launch a giant space station. Just simply refit the indicated base with what you want to put up in the sky, and voila, it\\\u0027s in the sky. We strive to maintain the balance between overpowered and not too many parts, for most computers can barely handle KSP as it is, never mind these heavy lifters. Therefore, most of these heavy lifters will require at LEAST 3 gigs of ram and a 1.5 gig graphics card. (That\\\u0027s a little under what I have.) Okay, got it? Go. Let me help you help me help you put your station up with the stars. duuuh duh duuh, duh duh duh duh duh, duh duh duh duh.

Then this rocket is for you. Suited with 37 initial engines, 75 fuel tanks, advanced fuel system performance, which makes for very simple launching/orbiting. But be careful! This rocket has been reported to *push Kerbin away from the actual rocket*! That\\\u0027s right, folks. This rocket is so powerful, that a Kerbin year will become 80 minutes longer just by launching it! (It also produces the same amount of heat to burn down Kerbalhatton, but you don\\\u0027t have to know that.)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![megastarI2.PNG](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/33825217/Hosting/megastarI2.PNG)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![megastarI1.PNG](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/33825217/Hosting/megastarI1.PNG)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![megastarI3.PNG](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/33825217/Hosting/megastarI3.PNG)\n\u003E \n\u003E **How to fly - Step by step:**\n\u003E \n\u003E [list type=decimal]\n\u003E \n\u003E [li]Set SAS on and throttle to full.[/li]\n\u003E \n\u003E [li]Launch first stage of rocket[/li]\n\u003E \n\u003E [li]Wait until 150m/s - launch next stage[/li]\n\u003E \n\u003E [li]To turn into orbit, wait for your Ap to be 50 kilometers before your goal, disengage throttle[/li]\n\u003E \n\u003E [li]Launch next stage, set throttle to full[/li]\n\u003E \n\u003E [li]Unset SAS, turn ship to 0 pitch and wanted heading.
