TO get an opposite rotation, pass it on the inside.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the answer to that is to watch which way the predicted flyby path bends. The prediction path you see graphed on the map presumes you don\u0027t do a de-orbit burn and that there\u0027s no atmospheric drag, so it shows you which way you\u0027d be flung by the gravity assist as you pass the target by.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming you\u0027re looking at the map view down from the north rather than up from the south:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If the target\u0027s gravity assist causes your path to bend left, then the game is predicting you\u0027ll be passing on the outside of the target (You will end up counterclockwise and aligned with the rest of the solar system after you slow down to be captured in orbit.).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If the target\u0027s gravity assist causes your path to bend right, then the game is predicting you\u0027ll be passing on the inside of the target (You will end up clockwise and counter to the rest of the solar system\u0027s rotation after you slow down to be captured in orbit.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis direction of turn is the easiest clue to see when not zoomed in, and when not near enough to the target planet yet to visually tell. Knowing this ahead of time before you enter the planetary sphere of influence can save some fuel because the further back you make your burn to correct this, the less delta-V it takes to do it. (It\u0027s the difference between \u0022deflect my direction by 5 degrees to east\u0022 versus \u0022deflect my direction by 0.01 degrees to the east.\u0022) Of course this same effect can also make the burn harder to perform accurately, so be careful. (\u0022Darn I wanted to burn for 1 second but I burned for 1.2 seconds! That puts me another 300,00 miles further out from the target!\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI usually find that my bigger problem is that I didn\u0027t manage to keep the craft exactly in the level with the orbital rings, so I pass the target planet above or below it and end up in a polar orbit instead of an equatorial one. This too can be predicted and corrected before you get there by looking at whether your flyby prediction says you\u0027ll be flung north (up) out of the plane of the solar system (you are passing under the south of the target) or whether it says you\u0027ll be flung south (down) out of the plane of the solar system (you are passing over the north of the target).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ekku Zakku","CreatedById":34696,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-07T00:57:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, it\u0027s just a matter of how easily you can visualize your orbit.
