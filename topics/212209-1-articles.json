Overall the look of painted rockets. Ui seems almost perfect\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBad. No auto struts. The performance hit at high part counts.saves seemed to randomly pick up odd artifacts .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe blurry. And no this is not exactly referring to videos that blurred out some things like a rock and/ or anomaly s *. Hopefully there\u0027s a optional way to turn down some of the paint shine. Water waves\u00A0 on landing seems to be a bit exaggerated but they may turn that down. Also a couple of videos had a few too many \u0022oh I need to show you what I\u0027m doing with a hand held camera\u0022 cuts.\u00A0 To be fair some of it was ok,\u00A0 and ones showing who was around them was fine.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*To be fair, speculating what those blurs could be will be fun. Although one we know was apparently a rock ( asteroid?\u00A0 ) of some kind just from a audio comment in the background. I don\u0027t think anyone got close to one of the arches.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
