Could you upload a screenshot of your rocket either in the assembly building or before takeoff?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T00:31:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, this is extremely common when starting out in KSP. There are several common starter type rockets that most people build, and the construction usually ends up with both the engine and the parachute in the same stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you look in the lower right corner of your editor window, you\u0027ll see a little orange-ish tab with a couple icons (a parachute and engine). There is also a set of \u002B and - buttons. Click on the \u002B and it will add a new stage tab. Then you can click and drag the engine down to that stage. They should now be separate. When you launch, pressing the space bar will cycle through these stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps.
