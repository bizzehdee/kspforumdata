I find this is primarily a problem towards the late game, where\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nA. The solar system really opens up and enters \u0022sandbox\u0022 mode. Early on your sources of funding (Make orbit, plant a flag on the moon, etc) often coincide with your personal missions, but later on you often want to do things completely different from the contracts offer.\u003Cbr\u003E\nB. Your crew roster is large (especially gets out of hand when trying to build permanent colonies and bases) and hiring new crew is prohibitively expensive.\u003Cbr\u003E\nC. Rockets and hardware for more ambitious missions become exponentially larger and astronomically expensive. Especially when using things like life support mods that force you to bring much more mass along for long duration missions.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe first problem can be at least partially addressed with the various contract packs and mods like Strategia. The second can partially be offset by rescuing Kerbals from contracts. The last can be partially managed by developing reusable launchers.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI personally have been tinkering with SpaceY in my latest career, however I am so far unconvinced that this SpaceX style RTLS reusability is particularly viable given the mass fractions of KSP rocketry. For reference, in real life Elon Musk has stated that a Falcon 9 first stage pricetag ranges in the tens of millions of $$$ (I don\u0027t remember the exact number but we\u0027ll say ca. $50mn), whilst the propellant for the entire stage only runs you about $200k. Thus, notwithstanding the inevitable expenses of recovery and refurbishment, you are recovering nearly all your losses by bringing the first stage back.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow, upfront I admit I\u0027m a pretty terrible rocket designer, but in my career I developed a SpaceY booster capable of sending a 3-Kerbal capsule into LKO (basically an orbital shuttle). It consisted of a RTLS SpaceY 3.75m first stage, and an expendable stock 2.5m second stage. The cost of the first stage alone ended up coming out roughly 70,000 for the hardware, and 25,000 for fuel. And here\u0027s the rub: For 25,000 credits, it turns out I could easily have built a barebones 2.5m \u003Cstrong\u003Eexpendable \u003C/strong\u003Efirst stage instead - two orange tanks and a mainsail - capable of imparting more delta-V to the payload.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo with that, I solicit the brilliant KSP community for thoughts. Am I just a terrible designer? Is SpaceY not actually balanced with career practicality in mind? Or are there advantages to RTLS reusability that only begin to manifest at larger scales (5m)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowsteps","CreatedById":117858,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-09T14:23:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are running into the same problem Elon is going

that the ONLY thing even worth recovering are SSTOs (or multistage aircraft).\u00A0 The reason is that they use very efficient engines (most well built SSTOs dont exactly require tons of fuel as majority of the hard work is done on jets alone), and generally speaking can be landed right on the KSC runway for a 100% recovery.\u00A0 With a RTLS style booster there are 2 things going against you.\u00A0 One, is that in order to recover it effectively you need to use a near vertical ascent profile, which is so inefficient it isnt even worth bothering with.\u00A0 Second, unless you are using some obscenely expensive parts to make said booster, the cost saved because of fuel isnt really worth it when you could have created a lighter disposable rocket (and for a 2.5m payload is prolly use alot of SRBs to save even more money).\u00A0 All in all, it just isnt worth the time to engineer reusable boosters (unless you actually enjoy the challenge of engineering such a booster in of itself).\u00A0 While im not one to tell anyone what to spend their time on, i enjoy actually doing stuff once in orbit, and for me the whole lifter is essentially done as fast as possible just to get what i want in LKO in LKO, and i dont really bother engineering launch stages unless its something very hard to get into orbit like a wing covered space carrier that needs to have a top mounted engine

unfortunate that the effect is to simply drive the player to use the next bigger rocket (which is exactly what is done in real life. \u00A0Sure, there are rockets like Delta that spam boosters around the engine for bigger cargoes, but expect a bigger rocket if big cargoes become more common). \u00A0To a degree this is done in real life and KSP for similar reasons. \u00A0The engineering cost for Delta is sufficiently big that it makes more sense for an inefficient smaller rocket to spam boosters. \u00A0In KSP the true cost is player time (i.e. engineering costs) and again you add \u0022more

Am I just a terrible designer? Is SpaceY not actually balanced with career practicality in mind? Or are there advantages to RTLS reusability that only begin to manifest at larger scales (5m)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a big discussion of realworld Space-X in general in another topic. \u00A0For the record, I don\u0027t see how they can possibly make money that way given they have to over-engineer their boosters by 20-25% to make them landable, which means the payoff period is way delayed even if they can turn rockets around cheaply. \u00A0I suggest taking discussion of the real Space-X over there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut as to KSP,\u00A0any grind in career mode is a combination of 3\u00A0things: \u00A0player-controlled difficulty settings, player-controlled mission profiles, and player-controlled use of mods that add more science-per-mission. \u00A0Given that all these variables as player-controlled, the only reason to consider career mode a grind is if you do so deliberately or just don\u0027t know how to avoid grinding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, starting at the bottom and working up, there are mods like DMagic Orbital Science\u00A0that add new science experiments. \u00A0Thus, your ship can carry more instruments, so can get more total science from any location/biome it finds itself in. \u00A0This goes a LONG way to reduce grinding, especially because its effect is amplified by the other things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext is leveraging science per biome/location into science per mission by hitting multiple biomes/locations. \u00A0The way you do this is to built biome-hoppers. \u00A0You can hit every single biome on Minmus and return home with fuel to spare if your lander has 3500m/s when it 1st lands on Minmus. \u00A0Build the lander around a 1-seat pod and an Okto probe core for SAS, put a scientist aboard, and carry every instrument you can. \u00A0The scientist can reset the Goo and Materials experiments between biomes. \u00A0With such a ship, you can loot Minmus in a single mission lasting about 30 days and return with thousands of science points, having spent very little on the rocket itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd finally, you can use the difficulty sliders to make things easy on you. \u00A0Try 200% science rewards. \u00A0That makes pillaging Minmus as described above, with all sorts of DMagic experiments as well as most of the stock ones, bring home 7000-8000 science points. \u00A0After that, you can do whatever you want to finish off the tree, and then get on with the fund-limited sandbox game you wanted to play all along, using all the parts. \u00A0Life\u00A0begins when the tech tree ends. \u00A0What\u0027s the point of having all the top-tier parts if you end the game once you unlock them?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, you can also farm science with the mobile lab, but I find that too tedious. \u00A0You can get way more science in way less elapsed gametime by biome-hopping Minmus and returning everything in 30 days, and only need 1 scientist, who immediately becomes useless once you finish the tech tree anyway. \u00A0So why ever have more than 1 scientist, and why ever use the lab?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd to be back to your Space-X thing, I have NEVER found it necessary to recover stages with anything except hard difficulty settings. \u00A0If you don\u0027t have to pay entry costs for parts, and you get 100% funds rewards, you can easily afford to ditch boosters and never need bother with SSTOs. \u00A0You\u0027ll make way more than enough money on contracts along the way to finishing the tech tree to stay comfortably solvent. \u00A0Reusable rockets make sense in RSS, where they cost way more than in the stock-sized solar system. \u00A0But in the stock-sized solar system, the dV required to go anywhere isn\u0027t enough to break the bank at normal or easier difficulties.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-14T04:19:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScientists don\u0027t become useless once
