I am using far and a few other mods. I \u0060ve built a pretty solid ship so far. It takes off and can fly so so. The turn radius on the plane stings and I seem to have a slow reaction to pitching up. (any advice on this?). I can get it in to orbit but around 45-50k my nose wants to rise a lot with the smallest amount of thrust. (any advice).. All when I go to maneuver in space I cant seem to keep it on the blue nav ball thing. The plane moves a lot with just small abounts of thrust.. Any help would be great!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGA\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T15:53:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you have any pictures of it in the VAB with the Center of Lift, Center of Mass, and Center of Thrust icons on?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like to me your center of thrust for your rockets is below our center of mass thus pushing your nose up when you are using them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legion1202","CreatedById":78116,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T16:30:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197962342007/screenshot/541848004609968866\u0022 alt=\u0022541848004609968866\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edoes this work?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197962342007/screenshot/541848004609968866\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197962342007/screenshot/541848004609968866\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T17:39:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah that works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see your problem right off the bat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t have a real way to control the crafts pitch or roll. While canards are good, they are not that good, they stall out at higher angles of attack and speeds a lot easier.

Perhaps on the wings. If you can get away with a delta wing setup or a move the wings more forward so you can set up a tail section with a proper elevator to control pitch. I personally am a fan of over engineering most of my craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the tail, just use one of the larger tail sections from the B9 pack, that size craft you wont need huge, but a good sized one that has an integrated control surface to act as a rudder and control yaw movement.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
