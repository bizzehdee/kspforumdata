THIS is what I think a good stability indicator would look like for the VAB/SPH. It was put together in paint in a few minutes so don\u0027t expect anything pretty. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts based on assets already in-game and is simple to understand compared to the amount of information you get out of it. Its literally a smaller scaled C.O.L. indicator with a stick on it, attached to the existing C.O.L. indicator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JL6URjS.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022JL6URjS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000080;\u0022\u003EDirections for use:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000080;\u0022\u003ETry to keep COM indicator (yellow) between the blue spheres for controllable stable flight.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000080;\u0022\u003E-A- (green) Good positioning: craft is stable and control surfaces can overcome this stability to maneuver.

While users may not know the aerodynamic implications of COL/COM positioning, this tool I believe should be enough to learn really quick (You just learned how to use it with 6-7 sentences and a picture) and informative enough to help them design a rocket/plane that can stay in the air. While doing this it can still give the intermediate user a detailed indication of how their plane will (wont?) fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for the more intricate stuff. By changing/scaling the distance between the stability marker and the COL marker based on control authority, you can see how maneuverable your craft will be. This can help newbies figure out how many control surfaces they need too. How to calculate control authority? That\u0027s up to you. Ratio of lifting surfaces to control surfaces divided by mass? Who knows, but I\u0027m sure someone has a better formula than me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Well since you did say you wanted to hear about balancing ideas:) \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92819-An-arguement-for-a-simple-intake-jet-engine-tweak\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92819-An-arguement-for-a-simple-intake-jet-engine-tweak\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is mostly just a thread version of a previous post buried in the devnotes.

What the little marker is is the point where your control surfaces can overcome the inherent stability of your craft, allowing it to maneuver instead of act like a lawn dart. Where it is relative to the COL should be based on either some arbitrary distance that works for most planes, or be based on the ratio of control surfaces to lifting surfaces or something along those lines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T23:56:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIdea :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom the spaceplane assembly you clic on a \u0022Wind tunnel\u0022 button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn said wing tunnel physic is not \u0022calculated\u0022 but :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the CoM, CoL, drag...etc are visible\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the throttle don\u0027t change engine thrust but air-speed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- flight control do work\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- and you get indicator of wherever the plane go at any time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust got that idea reading Harv\u0027s blog\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crimson Sunrise","CreatedById":132102,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-15T00:01:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure they use fluid dynamics for those kinds of tests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut since it\u0027s KSP, the crash dummy style \u0027notation\u0027 is suitable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
