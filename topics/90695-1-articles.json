Then we can place that on some object with sufficient mass and velocity like an orbiting asteroid/space station, and we can just launch stuff to sub orbital trajectory, hookup, then get dragged along to orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would save a ton of fuel from not doing orbital burn.

No mater how you slice it you cant(baring a few mods) get around the 2.5km load limit. Even if you strung KAS winches togeather you cant get it longer than 2.5km long so you\u0027d need to at least push the payload up that high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Timeing. Asumeing you were fine launching the payload strait up to whatever orbital hight you still have to get to the right spot at the right time. On a vertical launch your hook is going to be blazing past at 2400 kph or a bit less depending on orbit hight. It will be in and out of physics window in 3-4 seconds. Your basicly trying to shoot an arrow through the head of a sewing needle from a hundred KM away. You can aliviate this somewhat by giving it some horizontal componant to the launch but the more you add to make the catch easier the closer you get to achieveing the orbit without the skyhook.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Boom. No other way to discribe whats going to happen if you make the catch. At the relitive velocities involved in this stunt I see 3 potential outcomes. First the magnet and your payload meet and mutualy anialate each other. Second it catches safely but the line stretches like a ruberband before snaping violently and most likely riping one or both objects (skyhook or payload) appart. You might get lucky and only loose the line but I doubt it. The third option, if you make the catch and survive the effects of hooking the two things togeather at that velocity your going to have the two ships springing wildly around eachother on the line. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen this in action with skycranes lifting heavy loads off of minmus. Those lines are not ridged, they stretch and bounce. I had my skycrane try to tow a 200t container of metal (extraplanetary launchpads mod) and didnt dock fully first, just draged it to orbit on the rope. I was fine on the initial takeoff as I could carefuly get the slack out before applying more thrust. When I went to circularize however the payload had drifted a bit closer to the ship and caused a slight tug when I throttled up and it snaped taunt. It stretched then swung the 30ton ship violently backwards past the cargo container. They bounced back and forth for a while and developed massive phantom forces. Eventualy the force got bad enough that it snaped the crane off the ship. Dispite cuting thrust after controll was lost enough phantom force was generated that the 200t mass was flung clear out of the kerbin system on an eve crossing trajectory while the crane would have been destined for a steep reentry on kerbin, leaving minmus\u0027s SOI in the opposite direction from the other half.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarvinKitFox","CreatedById":99545,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-19T05:37:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBasically, no.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP physics, erm I mean fizzics, only operates out to about 2400 meters from the centerpoint of your current vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo Yes, you can build a Skyhook.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will \u0022forget\u0022 to rotate if you go more than 2.4km from it, or it you switch focus to another vehicle further than that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will not be able to build a skyhook longer than ~4.8 km, no matter what you try.

I had a similar experience to merendel. Had no docking port to match my payload on the surface of minmus so winched it up instead - it was too big to lock with the crane so I had it dangling there - it basically became a rotating mess with the center of gravity half way along the line - everytime the lifter was in the right direction I would hit the thrusters to eventually pull it up in to a circular orbit. Releasing the payload like a hot potato and sending it in to a higher orbit to collect later.

My only excuse is its a bad idea doing napkin math just before passing out for the night. Either way you are not makeing the catch at that speed on anything but luck and will probably get riped appart for the effort. geting up to speed horizontaly first aliviates this problem somewhat but to get the speeds slow enough your geting close to orbital velocity already.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-19T19:05:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, timing problems would be alleviated if there are just enough hooks to make essentially an orbital transportation ring around kerbin to make the chance that one of them will be a hit a bit higher.
