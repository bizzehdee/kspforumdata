A collider, which is invisible, need not be the exact same shape as the object\u0027s mesh and in fact, a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. The simplest (and least processor-intensive) colliders and the so-called primitive collider types. In 3D, these are the Box Collider, Sphere Collider and Capsule Collider. In 2D, you can use the Box Collider 2D and Circle Collider 2D. Any number of these can be added to a single object to create compound colliders. With careful positioning and sizing, compound colliders can often approximate the shape of an object quite well while keeping a low processor overhead. Further flexibility can be gained by having additional colliders on child objects (eg, boxes can be rotated relative to the local axes of the parent object). However, you should be sure that there is only one Rigidbody and this should be placed on the root object in the hierarchy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are some cases, however, where even compound colliders are not accurate enough. In 3D, you can use Mesh Colliders to match the shape of the object\u0027s mesh exactly. In 2D, the Polygon Collider 2D will generally not match the shape of the sprite graphic perfectly but you can refine the shape to any level of detail you like. These colliders are much more processor-intensive than primitive types, however, so use them sparingly to maintain good performance. Also, a mesh collider will normally be unable to collide with another mesh collider (ie, nothing will happen when they make contact). You can get around this in some cases by marking the mesh collider as Convex in the inspector. This will generate the collider shape as a \u0022convex hull\u0022 which is like the original mesh but with any undercuts filled in. The benefit of this is that a convex mesh collider can collide with other mesh colliders so you may be able to use this feature when you have a moving character with a suitable shape. However, a good general rule is to use mesh colliders for scene geometry and approximate the shape of moving objects using compound primitive colliders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JordanL","CreatedById":95655,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T20:11:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a tapered triagular shape (tapered from 2.5m to 1.5m in the z direction over the x direction), where the y-size varies from 12m to 2m.
