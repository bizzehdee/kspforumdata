Sure, you get less drag, but terminal velocity is also a lot higher. Unlike in stock, where you can get to terminal velocity relatively quickly, FAR would require an absolutely thunderous acceleration to get to terminal velocity*.\u003Cp\u003E*Keep in mind that, the farther up you go, the thinner atmosphere is, and the higher terminal velocity is. If you don\u0027t hit terminal velocity in the first 10km, you\u0027re unlikely to ever hit it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what I\u0027m talking about; you\u0027ve conflated the terminal velocity of a powered rocket with the terminal velocity of a falling body of fixed area and drag coefficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E They\u0027re not the same thing. The terminal velocity of your ship doesn\u0027t mean anything at all in determining the ideal launch profile. What matters is the rate at which atmospheric pressure is dropping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Besides, you can reach terminal velocity in FAR very easily, even in an aircraft that has nearly zero thrust. Just don\u0027t climb, and eventually your speed will top out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slashy\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
