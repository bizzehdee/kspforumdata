In your opinion, the only changes that are worthy of note are additional parts, but the bulk of the rest of us are quite pleased (again, as indicated by ongoing discussions) with the fact that Squad are putting more attention into the performance and handling of the game engine in-general.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, to the ruckus angle: \u0022brown-noser\u0022? \u0022too afraid\u0022?

But the mods have ruined me. Ive spent alot of time building some very efficient vehicles. To me that is where the fun is. Seeing how creative you can build. And then if it actually works. Anyway, the stock parts just seem boring. I use the basics, like kethane,bobcat,damned robotic for the hinges. thats just my own opinion. I played enough to see how it runs. I really dont see what everyone is so excited about, the seats and flag will get old soon enough. To me the best part about 2.0 is the work they are doing to performance.
