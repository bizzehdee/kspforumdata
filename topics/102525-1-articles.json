Gravitational pull decreases with a square root function, so the further out you are the less you\u0027ll have to fight against gravity (but you get less benefit for each additional km of altitude). Furthermore, the way to really look at this is in the form of energy. The higher an object is, the more energy it will have. All orbits of the same period have the same total energy. A perfectly circular orbit maintains a constant balance between kinetic and potential energy, while a highly elliptical orbit trades potential energy for kinetic energy as it approaches periapse and trades that kinetic energy back to potential energy as it approaches apoapse. This having been said, the greater the orbital period the greater the stored energy... and the greater the stored energy, the less you need to add to get an escape trajectory. So if I\u0027m interpreting your question correctly, higher is better. However, it does take fuel, time, and energy to get there... and as others have pointed out, if you\u0027re going to simply go for a transfer there\u0027s no need to circularize at 800km. Higher orbits will allow you to more easily take more fuel with you (and spend less getting escape) at the cost of additional launches and efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ksp.olex.biz/\u003C/a\u003E see this link for dV\u0027s and more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-23T15:53:37Z\u0022 title=\u002203/23/2015 03:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by impyre\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T15:54:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe lower the orbit, the easier it is to have an ascent path close to horizontal, which greatly reduces gravity loss.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"impyre","CreatedById":116031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T16:02:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot really.

In that example, the 120 km apoapsis is already in the right direction, so the DV you used to go from 75x75 to 75x120 is not wasted. If you were to circularize at the 120 km apoapsis, then all the DV you spend to do that would be entirely wasted relative to your plan to eventually leave orbit because in that example you are burning on the opposite side of the orbit. So at a minimum you would be wasting the DV that it takes to go from 75x120 to 120x120, and at a maximum, if your transfer burn location does not match up with the 75 km periapsis, then you would waste even more DV than that by going to 120x120.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind though that if your transfer burn is long enough (like several minutes with a low TWR like with an LV-N on a high mass vessel), then you might run the risk of re-entering the atmosphere if the altitude of your orbit is too low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you plan to use any of the popular online transfer calculator tools to find phase angles, ejection angles, ejection burn times, etc., those tools are all expecting that you start from a circular parking orbit.

Had I used alex\u0027s calculator (which I linked above) I\u0027d have noticed that the ejection angle is significantly closer to the desired angle for the higher orbit... In this test I burned both vessels at 150 degrees to prograde. Had I compensated in the ejection angle for the higher orbit, it would\u0027ve attained an even greater altitude advantage over the lower launch.

Bear in mind you can go much higher too... launching to duna from an orbit similar to minmus (say if you just barely escaped minmus) would only require 664m/s as opposed to the 1060m/s required from LKO. For those of us with refueling bases on minmus, this is a huge deal.

Now when you burn the fuel you will get more energy from burning the fuel, due to the fuel containing more energy. This is the oberth effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is while you need less dV to change your orbit from a high circular orbit, it takes more fuel to get this amount of dVthan when you are lower down and going faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGravity losses are what you get when you are fighting gravity, eg. at the beginning of every rocket launch you are using your engines to counteract gravity\u0027s pull on your ship. Say the gravitational acceleration is 9.81 m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 (g on earth) then you are loosing 9.81 m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 of the dV you are producing. This is why it is, to a certain point, better to go sideways while launching since your lateral velocity will counteract gravity without the aforementioned gravity losses, also the thrust applied in lateral direction is free of gravity losses and adds only to your orbital velocity. This is of course disregarding drag losses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThirdly, the most efficient way to go to mun would be a launch with a gravity turn, then, insted of circularizing you would do your munar injection burn. Get a really low periapsis and do a nice, safe, and efficient grazing trajectory. Shortly before you reach periapsis you start a retrograde burn and maintain a grazing trajectory while slowing down. By doing this you maintain a high lateral velocity for the longest possible time, again reducing gravity losses to an absolute minimum.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-24T12:01:31Z\u0022 title=\u002203/24/2015 12:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheXRuler\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T13:37:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tsotha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tsotha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIntuitively I would think if you\u0027re burning horizontally just out of the atmosphere there\u0027s an instant in time where you could stop and be in a stable orbit.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s what I had been thinking.
