Umm\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 ok, technical challenge ahead. To do this quick and dirty, I suppose I\u0027d find the list of prefixes and suffixes that KSP uses to generate random names, and then write a bash script to generate 772 unique names and annotate those names with the information format that KSP uses to describe a kerbal\u0027s location and statistics in the save file. Then back up your save file. Then you\u0027d output that as text and copy/paste it into your persistent.sfs file, I guess would be simplest. The KSP namegen list suggests about (271-152)(149-53)\u002B(35)=11458 (since there\u0027s one random name that\u0027s known hard-coded never to come up) names are possible, but there\u0027s no way to know if the game will actually support 772 kerbals. Programming this, for anyone who can do it, will definitely be much faster than creating and assigning 772 kerbals in game and probably more fun as well. Do not ask me to do this unless you\u0027re offering to pay me programmer-rate money."},{"CreatedByName":"comham","CreatedById":43245,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T19:43:25Z","Content":"When you\u0027ve finally put all 772 kerbals on board, will you be happy?

I\u0027ve managed to get it up to 10,800m, after which it keeps climbing, but the game stops tracking it. Not sure if it\u0027s a bug with a particular mod or the game proper, but since it would have to work with the mods I\u0027m using.... It\u0027ll have to get redesigned. Since you asked, though, here\u0027s part of a launch attempt (about 5 minutes into flight at that point): \n\n![JBFJb5f.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/JBFJb5f.png?1)"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedCowboy","CreatedById":92106,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T03:31:19Z","Content":"That is impressive!
