I\u0027ve seen this done in some other games and it\u0027s super great. I like to play with different combinations of mods and having to have many copy/pastes of the entire game directory means I don\u0027t get cloud saves for all those copies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve also seen in some other games where you can install user published mods from right within the game. This is also super cool.

But I wonder in KSP2 if we could have this integreted in the game. It might make modding more approachable and perhaps easier to manage if it\u0027s implemented well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BowlerHatGuy3","CreatedById":222738,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-04T22:15:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOut of all the things on this sub forum, an easier way to install and update mods is mandatory.

If KSP 2 mods work anything like KSP 1 mods, then every time you add or remove mods, you need to re-load everything. This is because mods can take priority over other mods in complex ways, and all the part modules will have to be re-constructed to avoid unintended behavior. In the other hand, toggling mods from a launcher or before starting up the game would work much more easily, and databases of mods that you can download from can also be implemented nicely.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zeekzeek22","CreatedById":223169,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-10T16:05:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMods from inside games aren\u0027t that unusual.

Single-player saves and multi-player servers can have their own set of mods independent of one another, and the client prompts you when you attempt to load a game with different mods than the active client, giving a button to automatically synchronise with the save or server. And with all of this, you can still manually copy mod files into the appropriate directory, for example if you\u0027re mid-way through developing a mod, or don\u0027t want to use the in-game menu for whatever reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-11-10T19:33:37Z\u0022 title=\u002211/10/2022 07:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 10, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Ashandalar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheOtherDave","CreatedById":32305,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-12T21:13:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAllowing mods to be toggled per-save?
