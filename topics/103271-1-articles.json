My best guess, end of April.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-02T22:02:46Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2015 10:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"EladDv","CreatedById":118368,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T22:01:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I was hoping it would be at least another month before Experimentals, because this update is being made a little too fast in my opinion.

How long it remains in experimental is often dependent on how complex the new update is.
