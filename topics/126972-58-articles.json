Two years is an incredibly long time, more than 5% of my life. This year has been unexpectedly busy and distraction-filled, so the pace is nowhere near what it was two years ago. I landed the crew on Vall on the 12th of February and returned them to orbit on September 15th; and didn\u0027t post this until now, the 3rd of December (or the 4th, because of course it\u0027s late). So it really hasn\u0027t been two years - just sixteen or so months with a bunch of dead air shoved in the middle.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis likely wouldn\u0027t still be a\u00A0going concern if I didn\u0027t have readers. So to preface this 91st post I\u0027ll say thank you, and I hope you enjoy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExit Vall, Stage Outwards\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was a simple matter to bond the two Sulphurs together, a procedure both Thomlock and Gletrix had done hundred of times by now. They docked the \u0022rescue\u0022 shuttle to the business end of their lander, more to save themselves from running fuel between the two than for any other reason. A small amount of monopropellent was moved into the Sulphur 5, just in case they\u0027d need it, and then the disulphide boosted itself into a higher orbit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ascent from Low Vall orbit was the opposite of the descent. They climbed into a much higher yet eccentric orbit, altered their orbital plane to match that of their fuel can, and then dropped down to rendezvous with it. This process took several hours, but saved a considerable amount of fuel.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170915_ksp0216_vall.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022602\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170915_ksp0216_vall.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170915_ksp0225_vall.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022601\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170915_ksp0225_vall.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThankfully the fuel depot was in exactly the same orbit where they\u0027d left it. (Nothing is absolute in this universe, and there was always the possibility that whatever accident had claimed the rest of the Potassium 3\u0027s cargo would have returned and finished the job.) In absence of a source of electricity its onboard computers had once again died, but unlike before it had not started into a dangerous tumble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crew transferred fuel into the two Sulphurs just as soon as they\u0027d docked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170915_ksp0227_vall.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022631\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170915_ksp0227_vall.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMacfred ran an inventory of their fuel reserves once everything was settled. As suspected, they would have enough fuel to visit both Pol and Bop. Enough even to land on both, and maybe bring back some samples. Tylo orbit was out of the question (even a very high orbit requiring a low-energy capture), so they would at most visit four of Jool\u0027s moons. Their mission had only been designed to land on three of them, and they\u0027d lost one of their fuel depots early after arriving at Jool. All things considered they were doing quite well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA quick review of the orbits of their target moons led them to choose Pol as their next visit. Traveling to the outermost known moon of Jool required a small plane change, a bit of time, and for them to take their fuel depot with them. They would not have enough fuel to return here, top off, and then go to Bop. It also required one of the shuttles having its engines pointed away from the rest of the stack, a maneuver which Gletrix completed while the others were resting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeven days later they made their escape burn, leaving the icy moon of Vall behind them forever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170915_ksp0236_vall.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022602\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170915_ksp0236_vall.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPol-italicized Pol-lution\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt first appeared as a dark spot against the backdrop of stars. Thomlock wasn\u0027t even sure what he was seeing, but the ship\u0027s computer was convinced a small moon was exactly where he was looking. Small being the operative word, less a moon, more an unexpected bit of matter expelled by one of Jool\u0027s mighty belches. As this speck caught up to them, it took on the features typical of an airless moon - crisp shadows, areas of absolute darkness with ridges illuminated inside them, a dull shade of emptiness, et cetera, et cetera.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYet this was a strange moon. It was a dark brown color, at least from the first glance. Rather difficult to spot, such a low albedo and its dull, humorless tone. Soft against the universe, sharp against itself. And the closer they got, the more Thomlock could swear it was green. And brown. And green again, just not a healthy green. Green the shade of a morning following a late night on the town. And strangely lumpy, too. This was no moon, it was a disgusting blob of kraken disgorgement. Disturbing enough even to take away his appetite.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170915_ksp0245_pol.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022601\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170915_ksp0245_pol.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170915_ksp0253_pol.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022600\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170915_ksp0253_pol.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheir capture burn was considerable for such a small lump - 403 meters per second. This would place them into a relatively tame retrograde orbit, inclined 175 degrees against normal. The math at this excretory speck was rather kind to them at least, their final orbital velocity only a quarter of that on approach. It would\u0027ve used more fuel to enter an inclined prograde orbit than it would to just burn from their present situation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot that their inclination mattered anyway - the Calcium survey had identified only two anomalies on the moon, both near the equator. One was an unknown device broadcasting as a flag, the other an object of super-dense matter most likely made of exorem; another monolith. The crew agreed the likely monolith was the more interesting target; the flag would be a nice alternative, but unlikely to reveal anything of importance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey already knew kerbals had landed here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170916_ksp0263_pol.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170916_ksp0263_pol.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170916_ksp0259_pol.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022603\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170916_ksp0259_pol.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170916_ksp0266_pol.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022601\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170916_ksp0266_pol.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was Gletrix\u0027s turn as lander pilot, so Thomlock found a comfortable chair in the lower cabin and let her take the controls. It was a simple job, not really befitting of her masterful skills, but this and Pol were the only moons left to land on. He wondered if perhaps he shouldn\u0027t have let her land on Vall so he could instead take one of these easy ones, and then remembered she had piloted the Aluminium down to Laythe entirely alone. Even with his two landings she would come out numerically ahead, and she had the most dangerous of the landings all to herself.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheir chosen landing site wasn\u0027t exactly in the safest of neighborhoods. Their anomaly was resting atop the ridge one of the excreta\u0027s many lumps. To land near it they would either need to land directly atop the ridge, or come to rest on a somewhat unconventionally steep slope. The low gravity wouldn\u0027t tip their lander, but there was a chance it might slide down the hill away from them. They had no idea what the surface of this speck was made of.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe landing became more interesting when they discovered the entire moon was covered in strange, spiky mounds. Towers of muck, reaching outwards to spread their disease to the void. Small volcanos of puss, congealed into oddly shaped towers.

We\u0027ll make \u0027em bigger. And taller. They\u0027ll work just like the old ones, but they\u0027ll be blue instead of red. And big.

Figures. They\u0027d listen to Thomlock when he had an idea for an aircraft, or some new spacecraft, but individual parts? Not so much. (Little did he know a random intern had the exact same thought back on Kerbin. He ran to his supervisor with the idea, who then entered into discussions with Wernher up in orbit. They both agreed that, yes, they could make larger launch clamps. And maybe they should paint them blue instead of red. For reasons. The intern would go on to be just another worker bee while his boss moved onwards up the ladder.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170916_ksp0278_pol.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170916_ksp0278_pol.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170916_ksp0283_pol.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022600\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170916_ksp0283_pol.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe anomaly turned out to be further down the slope than they originally thought, and Gletrix had to make a last minute belch from the engines to dodge two pillars of puke. The Sulphur landed, or Thomlock thought it did, then started going up again. An \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E burst sent them back to the surface, which they yet again missed. He could hear Gletrix softly utter a curse in the cockpit before cutting the engines.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey stuck the next landing.

Agake slinked off to take her usual readings and do the \u0022landing science\u0022 while the rest got their bearings and suited up for the EVA. No doubt several of the reports Agake was taking made reference to the odd composition of their new home. A spiky, sickly colored, disgusting little moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn regular succession, and without fail, each of them climbed out of the cockpit, let go of the ladder, and tumbled backwards to the surface. As then, as each got to their feet and slopped the strangely adhesive dust from their suits, they noticed the monolith. The dark green monolith. Thomlock could\u0027ve sworn it was singing to him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgake wandered off towards their alien discovery when Macfred reminded them of the proper ritual - the flag planting. And so they begrudgingly held their excitement for the monolith and fought back waves of nausea over the surface while Agake inserted their marker of success into the soft rumination.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And so, the crew of the Sulphur 5 arrived here to find a mysterious green box.\u0022 She used the force of jabbing the flag into the ground to vault over it, fire up her EVA pack, and then jet away towards the monolith. \u0022Let\u0027s go see what it is!\u0022 Before long they were all four standing on it, poking at it, or otherwise bothering it in ways that future generations would find improper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170916_ksp0303_pol.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022602\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170916_ksp0303_pol.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170916_ksp0309_pol.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022602\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170916_ksp0309_pol.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170916_ksp0308_pol.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022601\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170916_ksp0308_pol.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomlock couldn\u0027t place his finger on it, but something about the monolith seemed familiar. Was it the tune it was singing? It wasn\u0027t really singing, not audibly, not on the radio, but when you were in its presence you felt like it was singing. It was a feeling so impossible to describe that he thought it best not to mention to the others. Surely they felt it too. Why had he thought of launch clamps when they got close to it? Why had that thought even occurred to him? He didn\u0027t care about launch clamps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWas this part of the park\u0027s control equipment?

There was a distinct point where the spires of gunk stopped, or appeared to stop, but otherwise the surface was the same. Just... lonely. There I was, looking out into this great empty plain and I felt nothing. Nothing at all. It was very strange.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the last several munths Thomlock wasn\u0027t sure what \u0022strange\u0022 meant, but he nodded anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Sulphur\u0027s computer blipped at them as they were climbing back inside. Another anomaly had been detected by the Calcium during their EVA, and this one was moving. Moving very slowly that is, but it was metallic and it was just over the hill from the anomaly, making it only that much more suspicious.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWere they being followed?

She hit the thrusters so hard giant globs from Pol\u0027s surface shot up, some sticking to the rear of the craft. It was just a quick hop - up, a short burn sideways, and back down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170916_ksp0322_pol.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022601\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170916_ksp0322_pol.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first they saw of their spy was a flash of sunlight reflecting off of some unknown surface. And then again. Gletrix brought the Sulphur in low and came to a hover. Familiar shapes formed as they descended - legs, solar panels, an engine. This was some sort of old probe, and it was skidding down the side of one of Pol\u0027s many ridges. Occasionally it would encounter some elastic lump and rebound into the void, only to come down softly shortly after and again continue its slide.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt showed no signs of stopping.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170916_ksp0326_pol.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022602\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170916_ksp0326_pol.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomlock tapped his suit radio and addressed the crew. \u0022We\u0027re never going to catch it like this.\u0022 He unbuckled his seat, grabbed his EVA pack, and drifted towards the rear docking port. \u0022Gletrix, hold off on the main engines for a couple seconds while I slip out of the rear airlock. I\u0027ll head down and hold on to it while you find a place to land.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Are you out of your mind?!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, maybe.\u0022 He kicked open the docking port, venting the rear cabin\u0027s atmosphere with it. The force of the decompression shot him towards the surface and the probe, and most likely boosted the Sulphur 5 back towards orbit. From the corner of his eye he saw a glob that had been stuck to the docking port shoot off into the distance, never to be seen again. One less unwanted surface sample to worry about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rest of the crew landed some distance down the slope while he wrestled with the probe. It was a strange craft, not an entirely unfamiliar design, and it appeared to still have a small electrical charge. He had no idea what had set it to bouncing and sliding, and there were no obvious signs of damage. Perhaps it had been bounding around this tiny mound of waste for many years, having never completely landed. Or maybe their own landing had disturbed it, one of their bounces sending this probe upwards and away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey would never know. He grabbed at the legs with his left hand and used his right to jet down to the surface. Even then, with him holding it, dragging it backwards, the ancient probe continued its slide. He was just dragging more of the gelatinous surface along with it. He gave his jetpack a quick burst, hopped over to the downhill side, and leaned in. Put his back into it, put his mittens against it, pressed with his EVA pack, planted his feet firmly in the muck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally it stopped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s quite a prize you\u0027ve got there, you old kerb.\u0022 He looked up to see Macfred in front of him, space wrench in hand. \u0022How about we take a look inside this thing, hmm?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomlock pushed away and motioned towards the stilled beast. \u0022Be my guest, kid.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170916_ksp0332_pol.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022603\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170916_ksp0332_pol.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere wasn\u0027t much to the small probe, just a simple fishbowl filled with various gizmos, some lights, and lots of batteries. The two goo containers on its side were empty, the goo having long ago made their escape. The probe core appeared to have had a small reaction wheel, but some unknown force had robbed it, wrenched it free. Perhaps it fell off while bouncing around, perhaps the goo took it with them. Who knows.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDespite their best efforts they were unable to bring the probe back online. And forcing the antennas open did not result in radio contact. Eventually Macfred closed the probe\u0027s hatch, put the bolts back in place, and declared it a lost cause. Thomlock ran his mittens over the builder\u0027s plate, but couldn\u0027t scrape enough of the heavily encrusted Pol Glop off to make out a name.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It doesn\u0027t look like any of the other probes we\u0027ve found,\u0022 he said while glomping back to the Sulphur with Macfred. \u0022Then again, the probes we found on Laythe weren\u0027t of the same design either. Just lots and lots of different yet similar things, scattered into places where they shouldn\u0027t be.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Too bad we can\u0027t take it to Laythe orbit and give it a closer examination. Or maybe pack it away for the return to Kerbin.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, we\u0027ve done enough of that. Enough dragging these old things about. This is where it belongs. It\u0027s an artifact now, a sort of flag, a totem sent by some madkerb and forgotten on the surface of this krakens-forsaken moon for the rest of eternity.

The other flag on the surface wasn\u0027t interesting enough to warrant another landing, and Agake managed to gather samples and data from all but the most inaccessible of Pol\u0027s biomes. They rendezvoused with the their traveling fuel depot, topped off their tanks, and made their way to Bop.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170916_ksp0337_pol.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022600\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170916_ksp0337_pol.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170916_ksp0339_pol.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022601\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170916_ksp0339_pol.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMuch later, back\u00A0on the surface of Pol, the Gambler 13 probe blinked to life. It gave its landing gear a quick twitch, and then bounded once more into the void. It had no idea why those strange green creatures were, why they had held it down, why they were so interested in it. It had been a scary few minutes as they dug around inside of it and pulled on its ears, but now they were gone and it was free once more to stroll about on the surface of Pol.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220171204_ksp0054_pol_gambler13.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022569\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20171204_ksp0054_pol_gambler13.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWheee! \u0026lt;Poing!\u0026gt; Freedom!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNavigation: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/126972-forgotten-space-program/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=3282565\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ENext Post\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-31T21:45:00Z\u0022 title=\u002201/31/2018 09:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 31, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Cydonian Monk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Matuchkin","CreatedById":135127,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-04T14:00:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 years since the three interns were blown through the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E wall\u00A0by an ignited flea-killer.

A kid, a child, a baby, a whatever. Have you seen one?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Of course.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022When? Where? How old? Be specific.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022C\u0027mon now, T, don\u0027t be absurd. I was young once, as were you. Same goes for these two. How did we get here if there aren\u0027t any young kerbs? Of course they exist. We\u0027ve just been so busy that we forgot them.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Forgot? Nonsense.\u0022 Thomlock thought for a moment. \u0022When I left Kerbin, when the Hawk 3-2 started its endless and lonely circuit of Kerbol, kerbals weren\u0027t even divided into sexes. No males, no females, just kerbals.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Whoa, What?! That\u0027s it, you\u0027ve lost it! Out of your fool mind!....\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgake put her hands up to stop Gletrix. \u0022Thomlock, that\u0027s not possible. It\u0027s not like kerbal physiology is an unknown science or some new phenomenon.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I mean sure, maybe there were female kerbals hidden away in a breeding factory or some place far away, but I\u0027d never seen one. Same for kids. The only other kerbals I remember were exactly like me. Even Albro said something to that effect, about kerbals being a manufactured species that didn\u0027t need to reproduce. Yet the more I think about it, the less it makes sense.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait, so, you\u0027re saying you don\u0027t have any...\u0022 Gletrix motioned towards Thomlock\u0027s suit....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMacfred interrupted her. \u0022Are you suggesting we\u0027re grown in vats?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I don\u0027t know.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why would this old friend of yours need to move us out of the Kerbol System if he can just grow more kerbals whenever he needs them?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomlock shook his head. \u0022I don\u0027t know. That\u0027s another piece that doesn\u0027t fit. I\u0027m not convinced his plan has anything to do with saving us. Maybe The Park needs to be empty to stop the Cycles?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022He wouldn\u0027t need to remove us for that, right? Couldn\u0027t he just kill all of us?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Geez, Agake....\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What? It\u0027d be the simplest way. We\u0027re pretty easy to kill, and these ships are all paper thin. A bit of high-velocity dust and we\u0027re history. You\u0027d have to get everybody on Kerbin, though, if you wanted to wipe us out. Maybe turn the atmosphere to poison or create a bunch of kerbal-eating cacti. He must need us for something.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And why does he care about the Park anyway? Isn\u0027t he free to do whatever he wants?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I don\u0027t know.\u0022 Moments passed before Thomlock returned to his writing. \u0022Look, just forget I brought it up. Of course there are young kerbals. Somewhere.\u0022 He didn\u0027t sound convinced, and all four turned the idea over inside their heads several times. What could they trust if not their memories?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe arrival at Bop and the distractions it brought with it couldn\u0027t come soon enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170916_ksp0344_bop.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022602\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170916_ksp0344_bop.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing much of note occurred until Bop slipped between the two Sulphurs and the Void. Macfred had downloaded the scan results from the Calcium 5 before they even set up their capture burn. Bop had a number of anomalies and obviously kerbal-made craft scattered around its surface, just like the other moons of Jool. One anomaly in particular grabbed Macfred\u0027s attention - a large blip identified by the Calcium 5 as containing organic compounds.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo their first landing site was obvious. There were other anomalies on the list, but anything potentially alive and in large enough quantities to be detected from orbit would always be first. There was a brief discussion among the crew and then it was decided. They had no idea what they\u0027d find, but the ruling theory suggested it was the remains of a carbonaceous asteroid, the heat from its collision perhaps forming hydrocarbons or some other beneficial compound. Bop had a low enough gravity that enough matter from such an asteroid might have survived a low-speed impact. Another theory suggested it was a naturally occurring outcropping on the surface.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey undocked from the other Sulphur and started their descent towards Bop. In the dark, as is only right and proper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170916_ksp0349_bop.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022601\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170916_ksp0349_bop.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170916_ksp0357_bop.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022601\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170916_ksp0357_bop.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt first the anomaly was little more than a speck on the surface. A tiny dark grey blip. Or was it green? It was large, whatever it was, and they were anxious to see it up close. Anything naturally occurring hydrocarbons this far from Kerbin would greatly increase Bop\u0027s importance. With it they could make fuels - real fuels, not just that manipulated water stuff - and then they\u0027d be truly free from needing assistance from the homeworld.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGletrix was bringing the Sulphur 5 down almost on top of it. The others were looking over their shoulders, eyes focused beyond the\u00A0 rear docking port\u0027s tiny window. Oft the shuttle would make a course correction, the speck moving out of view momentarily, returning yet larger and more menacing moments later. Green. It was obviously green. Perhaps it was living? Sone form of life that could survive in the harsh vacuum of space?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn unreal terror took each as they realized what their eyes were seeing. A horror from beyond the veil of time awaited them on the surface. In turn they would shiver, avert their eyes from the beast, lock their focus on some mundane object ahead of them. Another shiver would later take them, disrupt their anxious fidgeting. One would tug on their seat harnesses, another check their helmet, yet another would look nervously out of side window. Not one of them thought to stop their descent towards damnation - their fate was now sealed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170916_ksp0361_bop.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022600\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170916_ksp0361_bop.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA scream tore through the Sulphur 5 as its legs touched down. A chill ripped the souls out of its occupants to shreds. A gasp from the cockpit. Gletrix was the last to see it for what it was. The engines cut out, the death rattle of their machinery giving way to the silence of the grave.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170916_ksp0369_bop.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022601\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170916_ksp0369_bop.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey sat still and motionless for quite some time, each secured in their seats, afraid to move lest they attract unwanted attention. The straps of their harnesses meant safety, the sight outside did not.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMacfred finally broke the trance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, I have no intention of sleeping here, so unless the rest of you want to leave I suggest we get outside and go about our business.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You first.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMacfred made his way out of the cockpit and down the ladder, stopping at each rung to ensure the great beast wasn\u0027t moving. He stepped off of the ladder with great caution, placing one foot in the dust gingerly after the other. He wasn\u0027t taking any chances, and was ready to jet back up to the cockpit at a moment\u0027s notice. Dark visions whipped around his mind; hidden tentacles grabbing him from the dust, dragging him to the maw of this monster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was staring at him. One great golden eye peering into his very being. He could feel it rifling through his thoughts. Every part of him said to get back into the shuttle and leave this place. He tiptoed into the silent darkness, further from safety, closer to his certain death. The void itself breathed down his back, yet another chill ran up his spine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170916_ksp0375_bop.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022569\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170916_ksp0375_bop.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWait, why did it have only one eye?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis sudden exclamation caused screams in the shuttle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Relax, relax. Everything is ok everybody. This one can\u2019t hurt us.

One of its eyes is looking right at me. The other is lying in the dust, detached and loose, looking at nothing but the infinite beyond.\u0022 That didn\u0027t make it any less terrifying. Even when felled, the great green beast awoke some primal fear. An instinct telling them all they needed to know about these abominations. \u0022It\u0027s safe, for now. All the same I\u0027d rather not hang around longer than necessary.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170916_ksp0382_bop.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022601\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170916_ksp0382_bop.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNervous laughter permeated the flag planting ceremony. All four faced away from the terror as Gletrix drove their marker carefully into the regolith. Each was certain they\u0027d turn to find a tentacle reaching for them. Nothing happened. The terror remained. What if it wasn\u0027t alone?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170916_ksp0387_bop.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022602\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170916_ksp0387_bop.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgake was the first to approach the dead Kraken. She jetted over, hovered in front for a short while before landing atop its corpse. The others held back, wondering what fate awaited their scientist. At first she walked around gingerly, nudging the beast with her foot. Then suddenly she fell to her knees and started pounding on it with her fists. The others gasped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s petrified. Hard as the rock it\u0027s resting on.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt that she sprung up and took off at a sprint. They watched in abject terror as she jumped off the end of a tentacle as though it was a diving board at the local pool.

Even here, up close, it felt as though the great golden eye was still looking at him. The pupils appeared to have collapsed in on themselves, leaving an X-shaped cross mark. Was it dead? Or was it squinting?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe was reaching towards it when the chatter on the radio interrupted him. Agake was discussing her initial observations from atop the creature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170916_ksp0396_bop.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022602\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170916_ksp0396_bop.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s small and underdeveloped. I think it\u0027s a juvenile. I see no signs of trauma, no obvious injuries except the dislodged eye. It likely died of natural causes.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That shouldn\u0027t be possible.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Of course it\u0027s possible, Thomlock. They\u0027re organic, they\u0027re lifeforms. Nothing lives forever.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No no, not that. Being a juvenile. I agree, it\u0027s too small to be an adult. Remember that structure you found in orbit? What was it, Macfred? Thing 1?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thing A.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right. Anchorpoint Station. Well, Albro described a Kraken attack as he was leaving Kerbin for Jool. Two of these beasts, and neither fit completely inside the framework of Anchorpoint. These are huge creatures, they travel shrouded in darkness and are capable of swallowing ships whole. They\u0027d have to be five or six times the size of this one to match Albro\u0027s description.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Don\u0027t you see? It isn\u0027t fully grown, isn\u0027t properly developed. This isn\u0027t an adult. I was told in no uncertain terms these creatures had been designed to be sterile. Unable to reproduce. There shouldn\u0027t be young kraken running around so as to wind up dead on a moon of Jool. This creature is impossible.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Maybe that\u0027s why it died.\u0022 Agake walked past them towards the shuttle, carrying a handful of goop she\u0027d extracted from the beast. \u0022If Albro was being honest, and the Kraken were intended to be sterile, they\u0027ve obviously mutated to where they\u0027re not. It\u0027s unlikely the result of such a mutation would produce viable offspring. It could\u0027ve been deformed, undersized, or had any number of internal defects. It\u0027s also missing two tentacles.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGletrix was exasperated. \u0022You don\u0027t know that! Nobody knows that! Nobody has ever seen a kraken and lived to tell about it! This could be a full grown adult for all we know! Maybe they\u0027re supposed to have six legs!\u0022 She stormed off towards the ship and disappeared inside. Thomlock and Agake shook their heads and continued their discussion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022If they found a way to reproduce, it might explain why your friend Albro decided to lock them up inside the asteroids.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It might also have something to do with his plan to evacuate The Park.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Maybe. Either way, I don\u0027t know that there\u0027s much left to gain here. I\u0027ve taken a sample from the base of the tentacles, and as curious as I am I don\u0027t think it\u0027d be a good idea to climb into its beak and have a look around. Too bad we can\u0027t take the whole thing home with us.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMacfred kicked some dust around and took one last look into the eye. Only his reflection stared back. This creature was huge. If this was a juvenile, how big were they when fully grown? Bigger than the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E? A chill moved him to action. \u0022Ok, we\u0027re done here. Let\u0027s pack up our things and move on.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170916_ksp0400_bop.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022601\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170916_ksp0400_bop.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven knowing the kraken was dead, each felt a great sense of relief at finally being out of its presence. The great dread had lifted from their souls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey set off directly to the second anomaly. Gletrix kicked the Sulphur onto a very short suborbital trajectory, intending to bring them down directly on top of it. The scans from the Calcium satellite had shown this to be yet another concentration of Exorem, meaning this was likely another monolith.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat theory was proven long before they landed. A long, wedge-shaped shadow stretched across the surface.
