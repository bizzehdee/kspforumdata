Here\u0027s a solution to make the planets act like they\u0027re huge without compromising performance or accuracy. What if instead of inflating the planets, we deflate the parts! They\u0027d have the same abilities as normal parts and fuel and all other properties but be a tenth of the size. It\u0027s a little hard to explain and I don\u0027t have much time because I\u0027m REALLY TIRED and want to go to sleep. Basically the planets would LOOK huge but facilities, kerbals, flags, rocks, asteroids, and parts would all be tiny\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
