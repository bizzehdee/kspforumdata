I\u0027m only using Kerbal Alarm Clock for mods on career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have 4 may be 5 successful satellite orbits around Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy issue is I have 2 active Kerban satellite missions and 2 active Mun missions. I can\u0027t seem to get the missions to become completed. Is there a pecking order when I do them as in the highest one on the list should be completed first? Am I just slightly off my orbits where it won\u0027t take. Another possibility I just thought of is it the longest active mission I need to complete first?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI make sure I have the right science equipment on each satellite when I send them to their orbit so that\u0027s not the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr do I need to use a mod to ensure I get on the exact orbit? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am using the lowest thrust liquid engine.

It doesn\u0027t matter what order they\u0027re listed in the contracts window; you can complete any contract at any time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor missions where you have to enter a specific orbit: my experience has been that it\u0027s not super-incredibly finicky about exact alignment. If you get close enough that they line up pretty well in map view and are only off by a pixel or two, it\u0027ll be fine. So my guess is that your problem isn\u0027t \u0022my orbit is slightly off.\u0022 Satellite contracts work just fine with liquid fuel engine, you definitely don\u0027t need to go to ion propulsion for extra precision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best way to debug what the problem is, is to look carefully at the contract window. Each contract is going to have a set of requirements, such as \u0022be in orbit of Kerbin\u0022 or \u0022have a thermometer on the satellite\u0022 or whatever. As-and-when each condition is satisfied, it gets a green check mark next to it. Your contract is completed when all check marks are checked simultaneously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if you\u0027re ever wondering \u0022why is this contract not completing?\u0022, just look at its list of requirements, and see which one doesn\u0027t have a green check mark-- that\u0027s the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T04:17:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have seen many times that I\u0027m about to fine-tune my orbit and it already marks me contract completed - the orbit doesn\u0027t even overlap and seems off a lot to my eyes, but whatever...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you feel your orbit pretty exact, most of the time, the problem is either you get the orbit backwards (check AN/DN whether they are close to 180 degree), or you forgot to put some stuff (despite the obvious ones, battery doesn\u0027t count as power generator - you need solar panels), or simply you\u0027re trying to reuse some satellite that is launched before contract is accepted (you need a new one)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Razwald","CreatedById":144774,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T14:11:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo add more info. All the satellite contracts have things all ready completed from previous satellite contracts despite having no extra satellites in orbit other then the ones from completed contracts. They all have, build a satellite that can generate power and an antenna and they all have maintain stability checked off. There are only 2 contracts that need something special Goo around Kerban and Thermometer around Mun. Orbits is the only thing not checked off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had these contracts for awhile. I downloaded this from Steam a few months ago. Got back into it a couple days ago. My concern is an update messed some things up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt shouldn\u0027t matter but I\u0027ll cover everything does it matter what antenna I use.
