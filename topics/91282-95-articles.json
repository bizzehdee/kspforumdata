knowledge available at the time and the state of early Calculus than on actual reading of the Principa text. But Newton had all the machinery to realize that a spherically symmetrical body has the exact same gravitational pull as a point mass. Once you have a hypothesis that force of gravity drops as inverse square of the distance for any component\u00A0masses, deriving the fact that planets will have force between them proportional to total mass and inverse square distance between their centers is relatively straight forward. Which then confirms the inverse square hypothesis via Kepler\u0027s Laws. Showing that Elliptical orbits satisfy both is a bit more work, and I believe initial proof is due to Hooke.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, where I was going with this is that it\u0027s very likely that Newton would have pointed out that spherical bodies behave as point masses. That\u0027s not the same as saying that objects have no self-interaction via gravity. Just that we can ignore it while talking about motion of planets and other celestial bodies. But it could possibly be misread to imply it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for actually showing that a shape of a planet should be roughly a sphere, the simplest argument is via potential energy. A more rigorous proof involves a bit of Calculus of Variation. So I don\u0027t know if a good way to prove it was available to Newton, but it\u0027s a pretty intuitive notion that things trying to clump together as close as possible might make a sphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-26T01:27:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223474988\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002291282\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221540443286\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257117\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Eric S\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 hours ago, Eric S said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think someone is pulling my leg in a discussion on physics, and just wanted to get another opinion, if anyone cares to check my understanding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve read Newton\u0027s Principia, and while I don\u0027t doubt that we\u0027ve refined things since then, even disregarding relativity and QM.
