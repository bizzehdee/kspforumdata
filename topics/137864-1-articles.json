I believe you\u0027ll need 200,000 in order to get the second upgrade. Though, if you find you\u0027d like to buy that building without doing missions, you\u0027ll probably want to buy the next tier launch pad \u0026amp; VAB also, so i\u0027d just adjust funds to 500k.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd as mentioned above, you can get into orbit\u00A0\u0022manually\u0022,\u00A0if you hit M you can see where your orbit/trajectory\u00A0is taking you. Continue to fly prograde (yellow circle on the navball)\u00A0while in space, and you\u0027ll reach orbit eventually (given enough speed and fuel).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wemb","CreatedById":121979,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-24T16:26:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile you can get to the Mun and Minmus without manoeuvre nodes, you probably don\u0027t want to try.. As well as nodes the upgrade also gives you \u0027patched conics\u0027 - that is, the map will be able to show you where you will be once you\u0027ve entered the moon\u0027s gravity field - this is probably more important than nodes if you\u0027re flying to either of\u00A0the moons with a limited dV budget. \u00A0 Good luck and welcome to the KSP!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWemb\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-24T16:28:00Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2016 04:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Wemb\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
