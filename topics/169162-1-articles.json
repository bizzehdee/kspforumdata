Like for refueling large ships that landed a bit away from the Mining rig? I usually have a small rover, but i mean Like an interplanetary fuel tank to get refueled (Big orange one). I thought of having several big white ones in a modular system (One tank with doking ports on both\u00A0ends), but I\u0027m open to ideas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlyingPete","CreatedById":127384,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-02T16:35:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve built a fuel truck before that has a grabber claw at one end. On Minmus you can land things with reasonable precision, so it should only be a short run from mining base to a landed ship. Make the core of the truck an orange tank or one of the Kerbodyne tanks if you really wanted to. Certainly easier to handle than a train of several tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
