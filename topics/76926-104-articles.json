It does rather extremely well with formation/follow the leader flying if fired off in a pair or a massive swarm as noticed in the gallery I have posted. when deployed at altitudes of 1000m\u002B if i remember, it will do what is known as a \u0022pop-up\u0022 attack, it will climb to a high altitude and then dive to attack speed \u0022yes i quote star wars :3\u0022 towards the target. With the RBS-15 it will boost then go in a super/hypersonic cruise phase and target like normal missles. However, the AGM-86 is AIR LAUNCH ONLY. It needs airspeed before it can fly. Trust me I have fired one of these thing on the ground before....... Michael Bay payed me a surprise visit. With the RBS-15, it is both Air and Ground capable due to the boost. Bahamuto I enjoy this update extremely well and to add the variety of weapons, I suggest the Kh-101/55m Russian Cruise Missile or British/French Storm Shadow Cruise Missile.
