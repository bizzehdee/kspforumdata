You \u003Cem\u003Ecan \u003C/em\u003Euse only diffuse maps as mentioned, but what others have said is indeed true. Specular maps are not difficult to do and boost the quality of the part by a good amount. What I do is use a diffuse material through all my testing while the part is a work-in-progress. Then before a full release, or when I feel the part is done, I go ahead and give it a spec map in the alpha channel and change the material in Unity accordingly. In summary, you don\u0027t need it but it will be very nice to do. I suggest you definitely save a little time before you call it done to give it that extra touch.
