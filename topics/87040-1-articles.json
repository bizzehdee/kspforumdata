I had launched a load out of the bay before docking (a double-ended docking extension using a structural fuselage with docking ports on either end.)

The interior docking port was a bit of a problem, and thanks for the tip on the Alt\u002Bclick.

However, I decided to make some modifications to the spaceplane including changing out the main engine for a rapier and adding solar panels and lights to the docking extension in its bay and sent it up to repeat the original mission. It did not go smoothly. I buggered up the ascent which wasted some fuel and then ran out of power trying to wait out a rendezvous. Long story short, I had to rescue the plane twice because it kept running out of, well, everything. I tried deploying and docking to the extension so I could use its solar panels, but ran out of monopro before I could finish, and it drifted off and had to be retrieved by another ship, and, well, it was a fiasco.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, by the time the plane and its extension arrived at the station they had been separated and docked with other ships a couple times. The plane docked using the extension with the station and then undocked from the extension properly this time. The mystery is not exactly solved, but everything is working as it should now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
