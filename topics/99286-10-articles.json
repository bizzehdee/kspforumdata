Without fear of reputation loss or ability to gain a reputation, there\u0027s a likely inclination to post more honest feedback.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf made as an official Squad thing on the KSP site and then posted as a link to the other communities and the forums, it could allow for a wide range of feedback without splitting players into individual groups - hopefully giving a more accurate picture overall of what people want instead of having the different views of various communities. Of course, being unable to split players into groups is disadvantageous in some ways too, but I assume if a group is relevant then that can be asked for that information when giving feedback (ie, if interested in the views of newer players, ask for people giving feedback to say how long they\u0027ve had the game when doing so.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m unable to take this further at the moment, towards suggesting actual ways of implementing an anonymous system because different ways have different advantages and disadvantages. (A forum-style would allow for discussion, but has risks if people make inappropriate posts, a survey or simple feedback form where the only people to view it are the sender and Squad would remove that disadvantage, but also removes the ability to read discuss feedback.)
