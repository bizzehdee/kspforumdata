While this isnt really ideal, if you cant fit intakes behind the CoL, close then during reentry. During ascent you are usually too slow or too high for it to matter much (if ascent profile is your typical gun vertically to 30km, level, max speed, then punch out once ur max velocity). For shallower ascents it could be an issue either direction. Reentry is just too fast decent rate that will flip you over, unless you do it extrmeley carefully, and aerobraking is guaranteed to do it when you come in at 10Km/s to an altitude of 2km.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-27T22:26:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo reply to EVERYONE, I have some \u003Cstrong\u003Ebig \u003C/strong\u003E intakes on there about parallel the CoM.
