Because of a mistake I made most of the skins are undersized anyway. They should have 100x42 pixel, but the skins are only about 80x42 pixel. But its rarely noticeable on screen (Unity does a good job on rescaling). And at the moment all skins are derived from a skin that\u0027s a resample of Buckys Instruments. Maybe some day I will use only one skin with individual text painted on runtime over it. Or I will write a small generator for the skins. But at the moment this would be too much work. My eyes are not the best, but I can read the gauges very well and resizing them would cover to much space on the screen. This is a personal opinion of course and if someone else would upscale the skins and scales, so that they look well in their current and their native resolution I can implement an option for larger gauges. I have to get rid of a few magic numbers in the code of course, but this is doable. But I will accept the skins and scale only, if the look the same or better in the current small resolution. No compromises on this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"artboomy","CreatedById":96385,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T15:17:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENoob question - how do I redraw gadget?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nereid","CreatedById":68815,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T16:06:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022artboomy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022artboomy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENoob question - how do I redraw gadget?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERedraw gadget?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"artboomy","CreatedById":96385,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T16:15:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I found magic numbers, and I found that gauge beeing created with size from module AbstractGauge.cs.
