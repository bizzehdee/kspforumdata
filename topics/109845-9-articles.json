But it can be optimized, an algorithm could find lights which are in very similar coordinates, basically, lights which are side-to-side, and join them into one placed at the mid-point, here is how the spaceship looks optimized.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Reveal hidden contents\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [![uw1TEWR.png](http://i.imgur.com/uw1TEWR.png)](http://i.imgur.com/uw1TEWR.png \u0022Enlarge image\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E (The light is also moved away from the engines, so it does not break symmetry)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E As you rise in the atmosphere the lights would get slowly more separated (search for some images of the Saturn V in the upper atmosphere, or RSS launch videos, everything becomes a ball of fire), and then when you reach they will join again at the default, ground separation, and slowly lose light power.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hope I can make it into the mod soon, but modding KSP is really troubly with all the resets involved. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nThis would have to be tested a lot and probably won\u0027t be usable for weaker GPUs or cause a lot of flicker if pixel light count is low.
