However, when I am building craft in the VAB or SPH, I would like that list of active contracts to somehow include the amount that was advanced, and the amount that will be awarded if completed. Perhaps by clicking on a \u0022plus\u0022 sign the way certain other \u0022Notes\u0022 to contracts currently work. It seems like it would be simple. I often forget how much certain contracts are worth and have to go back to the Mission Control building and then back to the VAB in order to economize my construction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t really see a downside.

Honestly, I don\u0027t think it matters much- Perhaps it\u0027s because I\u0027ve never played on the hard difficulty or anything, but the advanced amount just adds right into your current amount of funds, and as for contract completion- Well, I\u0027ve never heard of a situation where completing a contract \u003Cem\u003Edidn\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E result in profit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe VAB/SPH shows what you need- the objectives to complete the contracts.

I only accept contracts that I\u0027m going to complete, and when I\u0027m in the VAB I don\u0027t care what they pay out any more. I already made that decision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever I think the whole \u0022every building gets one thing\u0022 paradigm is flawed in this way. There should be a fully functional contract widget that\u0027s available to pull up at any time, and review, accept, decline, or cancel contracts. Yes, even while you\u0027re landing on Mun (though I don\u0027t suggest you try). Same goes for hiring Kerbals and futzing with strategies. VAB and SPH are unique, sure, but the rest of the screens don\u0027t need dedicated full-screen windows that take multiple clicks to get to. They need a single button in the taskbar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETracking station, too, with the difference that it should be a toggleable mode when you\u0027re in the map.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
