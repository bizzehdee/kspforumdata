For instance, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E can induce some wobble in an aircraft if the Center of Lift is way behind the Center of Mass, noticeable especially at very high speeds. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E input is just too coarse and therefore always overcompensates, leading to a pitching up and down cycle.
