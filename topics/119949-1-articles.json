However it\u0027s stuck at 14 and I don\u0027t get new contracts available unless I finish (or cancel) an active contract. Some of the contracts I have are long term (get to Duna, Ike, probe in an orbit around Kerbol, etc.) and I\u0027d like to keep picking up contracts while I\u0027m trying to fulfill those. I have been sitting for a while, shuttling Kerbals to the Mun and Minmus to get experience. Maybe the contract system is trying to encourage me to hurry up and get to Duna?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is: Are available contracts actually limited to 14, or is does my KSP have a bug?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-02T06:42:04Z\u0022 title=\u002209/02/2015 06:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FastMINI42\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-02T05:49:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt seems to cap out at about 15.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FastMINI42","CreatedById":76767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-02T06:41:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eah, so it\u0027s not just me.
