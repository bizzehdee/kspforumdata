A short and wide lander is less prone to tipping over, can have a higher TWR because of its increased surface area, and its easier to set up your ladders to allow your Kerbals to get on and off the lander. Of course, the best way to go short and wide is with an asparagus-staged pancake shaped lander. Now, if you simply want to return a command chair to Eve orbit, asparagus staged Rockomax 48-7S are your friend. They are extremely light, have a lot of trust and decent efficiency so they are perfect for small Eve landers. However, if you aren\u0027t so found of the \u0022ride a lawn chair into the hottest planet in the Kerbol System\u0022 idea and want to return a command pod to orbit, then things get more complicated. When you need to push more mass around, 48-7S engines become far less useful. Instead, I recommend you use Aerospikes for the first stage, as they have good efficiency in atmosphere and decent thrust, then use 48-7S engines for the final stage once the lander is out of the thicker parts of the atmosphere. Landing the lander is pretty easy with Eve\u0027s thick atmosphere, just slap a bunch of parachutes on a few decouplers, parachute down to the surface, and detach them before launch. For the landing legs, I recommend you use rover wheels, specifically, the TR-2L Ruggedized Vehicular Wheel. Not only are these wheels tough and can take a landing, you can use them to drive around the surface of Eve and find a suitable launch site, preferably at the top of a tall mountain. Be warned though, the wheels will often \u0022pop\u0022 on touchdown, so you need to take a Kerbal out to fix them. For example, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/v28jke3yku0qock/2014-06-09_00004.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere is my Eve lander than I built around these principles\u003C/a\u003E. It is an asparagus staged 48-7S pancake carrying a command chair. The engines are mounted beneath every FL-T200 fuel tank. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve is, without a doubt, the hardest planet to land on and return from. Hopefully, my advice helps you build a capable Eve lander to overcome the purple planet. Good Luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
