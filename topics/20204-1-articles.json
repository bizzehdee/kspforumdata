This was the first rocket that allowed to me to make proper Mun landings before stock landing parts were ever provided. One thing to note is that it is a very old rocket (built around March 15th, 2012) and it might not even be as efficient as the later rockets I built (considering I put a whole bunch of fuel tanks compared to future models I later built). Y\u0027all could say I also possess smaller rockets that are just as Mun-capable as this one, but this one would be suitable for interplanetary travel (if it weren\u0027t for being rather difficult to control at the first stage \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe aware this rocket will only function at 0.13 (though a similar rocket can be built in 0.14 or later) in terms of the craft files being provided.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some screenshots of this rocket:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v458/Bandock/Screenshots/Brasturn-VI1_zps6fc6ec98.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Brasturn-VI1_zps6fc6ec98.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v458/Bandock/Screenshots/Brasturn-VI2_zpsa00b406b.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Brasturn-VI2_zpsa00b406b.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v458/Bandock/Screenshots/Brasturn-VI3_zpsf2e48ad2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Brasturn-VI3_zpsf2e48ad2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy for those who enjoy a bit of nostalgia. And by the way, this rocket did have a bit of inspiration from trydyingtolive\u0027s rocket (with four winglets and entirely liquid engine powered used instead).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarning: Due to the many parts used in this rocket, expect a bunch of lag or choppiness at the very start. Must also remember the craft file is at 0.13 (though a similar craft could be built in 0.14 or later).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
