I think its a great idea and I am keeping in mind exactly that as I work on this. Now I will be honest. The mappings for the cockpit are gone. All groups and meshes was combined into one single texture and mesh. This was absolutely necessary in order not to lag the game. Believe me the cockpit lagged it big-time. But I dont think this will be a factor because people just want to re-skin the outside anyways. So I think we are safe there in that regard."},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T22:51:32Z","Content":"Yes, keeping an identical interior is probably a wise idea.

Long-haul cargo ship with 40 cargo slots standard. (Those had better be KIS crate compatible, Redneck. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) ) Crew capacity of, what, 25? Something like that. Internal docking bay suitable for either the Delta Glider OR the XR-2 Ravenstar. Rover lift to support an Azure Rover (you should throw the Azure-only rule out so other designs can be used). INSANE dV budget... but no flying from Earth/Kerbin as packaged... the hover thrusters weren\u0027t strong enough for that. Landings on most other bodies weren\u0027t an issue, though.\n\nHrm... Since you\u0027re toying around with more than just the XR family, perhaps you would be wiling to look into the Shuttle-A? You\u0027d need Infernal Robotics support for the side engines, but... Food for though.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-22T03:10:38Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2015 03:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MaverickSawyer**"},{"CreatedByName":"Redneck","CreatedById":2030,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T03:32:03Z","Content":"no doubt so many possiblities.
