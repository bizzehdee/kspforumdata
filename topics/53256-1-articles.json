That was a lot more involved than originally anticipated, but I took the opportunity to go over all the camera code in the game and clean it up, since most of that hadn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t been touched for a really long time now, and some of it was in dire need of attention. I also created a new settings page on the Input Settings screen, with a new parameter to disable the auto-align-to-camera behaviour on EVAs when you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re using the jetpack. Today I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been working on something we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re calling \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Ancient Bug Hunt\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been able to fix a few very old and very annoying bugs, mainly around docking this far, but there are more bugs to go through still, and I think this will make a noticeable difference. Just to give an example of an ancient bug, today I was able to isolate and fix (hopefully) a bug where docking wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t take into account physicsless parts that could be in the middle of the vessel hierarchy.
