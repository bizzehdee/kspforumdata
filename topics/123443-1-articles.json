My new challenge is refueling my space plane from my previous post. Unfortunately my design has the only docking port on the top and in between the wings. This has presented an issue with surface fueling, as my options are limited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy current idea is to make a fuel boom that would attach to the miner. The end of the boom would have the docking port as well as an empty tank. The tank purpose is to add weight to lower the boom to dock. This presents an issue of assembling this boom. My best option is to send it up stacked and then dock the boom to the support before dropping it down to duna. Which is a bit odd looking, and landing it on the surface has been tricky unless I land then stand it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am away from the game so no pictures yet, I\u0027d really just like to see what you guys have come up with.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-22T23:58:35Z\u0022 title=\u002210/22/2015 11:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ForScience6686\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Signo","CreatedById":103766,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-20T19:01:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EClaw tanker truck FTW\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/p47IPa1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022p47IPa1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(the claw may summon the kraken anytime, you may want to put the claw on the active docking vessel only to minimize the effect)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thegamer211","CreatedById":149354,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-20T19:02:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Signo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Signo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EClaw tanker truck FTW\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/p47IPa1.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/p47IPa1.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(the claw may summon the kraken anytime, you may want to put the claw on the active docking vessel only to minimize the effect)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it safe to quicksave with a claw now?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat if you have stock bug fix modules?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Signo","CreatedById":103766,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-20T19:10:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETBH I never save the two vessels \u0022clawed\u0022 anymore.
