So far I have 120 distinct mounts (and that is without counting any over-sized mounts; e.g. SLS/SaturnV/Pyrios). Multiply that by the engines usable for each mount size (generally 4 per mount size), and you still have ~480 distinct part variants (can minus some for the non-existent 0.375m, 2.625, 3m engines, but then add nearly the same amount for the oversized/lower stage mounting options). Will likely have a final count later today... but yes, it is definitely going to be multiple hundreds of distinct variants.\n\nYes, this is going to take me awhile to put together; just the geometry for the mounts will likely take a few days/weeks to put together (thats ... alot ... of mounts).

But there will be a 4x 1.5m and 5x 1.5m mount for 5m tanks as those variants are not available in smaller sizes.\n\nStill working on figuring out all the mount variants I need to come up with.

You cannot do a clean engine implementation while deriving the class from the stock ModuleEngines (you are stuck with all of the stock garbage that way). Yes, MJ/etc pick up subclasses of ModuleEngines properly; my problem is that they do not pick up clean (non-derived) base classes, regardless of interface used (e.g. there is a IThrustProvider interface in stock, but MJ/etc do not use it for determining what module is an engine).\n\nAnyway, I\u0027ve moved past the whole unable-to-use-custom-engine-class problem, and have settled on using the stock engine modules with all their quirks and inefficiencies. Now I just need to find the best way to manipulate it to make it work with my intended setup (as far as I know it is all doable; all the fields I need to manipulate in the engine module are public / visible / readily alterable). The biggest bit that I haven\u0027t worked out yet is the run-time population of the FX for the different engines.\n\nHmm... will def. look into the RF EnginesConfig module, if nothing else than as to references as to how they are manipulating stats/etc. And solver engines; I\u0027ve heard the name tossed around a ton (especially in regards to RO), but have never investigated them/looked at it. Will do that before I start doing the coding end of things. Might not have to completely re-invent the wheel, as it where.\n\nDid quite a bit of trimming to the engine mounts list, using smaller sized mounts where possible (e.g. not creating the bigger one if a smaller size with the same engines exists), and I\u0027m down to 35 distinct models that I need to make (not including the oversized mounts... still undecided as to the best way to do those/what sizes)."},{"CreatedByName":"JoseEduardo","CreatedById":127759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-21T21:46:26Z","Content":"Do you plan to build every engine mesh config or something like the nosecones and endcaps? personally something like the nosecones/endcaps where you stick the mount and then select which engine and how many would be awesome, and you wouldn\u0027t have to make every variable mesh, just have them configured via a plugin, like Procedural Parts does with the thrust plate and procedural fairings with fairing and interstage base, except that they add nodes, not whole engines\n\nEDIT: BTW, will you make just upper stage mounts or lower stage mounts too?\n\nhere\u0027s why I\u0027m asking:\n\n[http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/satrnc3b.htm](http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/satrnc3b.htm)\n\n[http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/saturnc4.htm](http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/saturnc4.htm)\n\n[http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/satrnc4b.htm](http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/satrnc4b.htm)\n\nand because of the Jupiters I showed before ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nbtw, as it appears from the drawings the C-3B would have 3 inline F-1 and two aerodynamic covers (even though the inclined one shows 4), resembling the Jupiter from DIRECT V2 with 3x RS-68\n\nC-4B looks like a reguar Saturn V F-1 mount, but without the center engine\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-21T22:57:32Z\u0022 title=\u002210/21/2015 10:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JoseEduardo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-21T23:56:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Do you plan to build every engine mesh config or something like the nosecones and endcaps? personally something like the nosecones/endcaps where you stick the mount and then select which engine and how many would be awesome, and you wouldn\u0027t have to make every variable mesh, just have them configured via a plugin, like Procedural Parts does with the thrust plate and procedural fairings with fairing and interstage base, except that they add nodes, not whole engines\n\nWill be using mesh-variant setups like the nose-cones. Basically it will be the thrust-plates from PP, but with engines integrated all into a single part, with hand-built models for everything.\n\nThere will be one part in the editor per stack size (0.625m, 1.25m, 1.875m, 2.5m, 3.75m). You will slap this onto your rocket in its intended position/orientation. From there you will pick the engine type and clustering configuration through right-click menus (or other GUI selection in the future).\n\nI would love to do completely custom models per-engine-per-cluster-per-stack size; but ugh... that is far too many models and textures to manage. It is already going to be a handful as it is.\n\nAfter 1.1 is release I will likely revisit the GUI and parts layout to combine them -all- into a single part where you add it to the ship and right-click to configure everything (stack size, engine type, cluster layout). Would need a more complex GUI than I can currently do using stock right-click mechanics, so this will have to wait until the GUI updates. (Yes, I know, it -is- possible to do custom GUI\u0027s right now, such as Real-Fuels fuel selection GUI, but I\u0027m holding off on doing any GUI work until Squad has a unified system in place).\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Nozzle area is a bit harder, but the diagram riocrokite showed might help (and [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Falcon_9_v1.0%2C_Falcon_9_v1.1_and_SHLV_comparison.svg) is a larger SVG version). Not sure what variant it\u0027s for though. You can also use the formula ThrustVac-ThrustSL = NozzleArea \\* PressureSL. Using this I get a diameter of 0.868m for the 1C and 0.938m for the 1D (note that this is internal diameter)\n\u003E \n\u003E But this assumes no flow separation, so it wouldn\u0027t work for the vacuum variants (which don\u0027t have known SL stats anyway). Pixel measurements of [this image](http://www.spacex.com/sites/all/themes/spacex2012/images/reveal-merlin-heavy-inner.png) could give the diameter approximately (I can do that later if you want).\n\u003E \n\u003E Finally, I\u0027d say don\u0027t worry about creating too many variants of the same engine. All of the merlin variants are very similar in terms of performance, and there\u0027s probably not a reason to use older ones when newer ones are available.

The walls of the bell usually only appear to be ~1.5cm thick for most engines that I\u0027ve examined, so the outer diameter would likely not be too much greater than what you have listed.\n\nI\u0027ve included multiple variants of some of the engines as I intend some of those variants to become unlocked earlier in career-mode games. Yes, some will likely become obsoleted later in the game by other variants/other engines. Some may have specific characteristics that still make them desirable late-game. Also, variants are fairly easy to create as they generally will share a lot of geometry (and possibly texture). Still working through the whole thing though, so I\u0027m open to suggestions. Certainly some of the variant stuff will come later. The initial selection might only be 8-10 engines, though I\u0027ve tried to get a decent assortment put together for various purposes.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E EDIT: BTW, will you make just upper stage mounts or lower stage mounts too?\n\u003E \n\u003E here\u0027s why I\u0027m asking:\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/satrnc3b.htm](http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/satrnc3b.htm)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/saturnc4.htm](http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/saturnc4.htm)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/satrnc4b.htm](http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/satrnc4b.htm)\n\u003E \n\u003E and because of the Jupiters I showed before ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E btw, as it appears from the drawings the C-3B would have 3 inline F-1 and two aerodynamic covers (even though the inclined one shows 4), resembling the Jupiter from DIRECT V2 with 3x RS-68\n\u003E \n\u003E C-4B looks like a reguar Saturn V F-1 mount, but without the center engine\n\nI intend on making several shrouded/shielded mounts as well, where mostly just the bell is sticking out.

Some engines will even have specific covers for that engine in some setups; such as the RS-68 (pretty much requires a custom shroud with those big arms/exhaust ducts sticking out). I even intend on providing several aesthetic-only layout options for some cluster configurations (such as 5 engines in a ring, 5 engines in a cross, or 5 engines in a flattened cross (SLS)).

If not I\u0027m quite sure that people would write addons to those (for example new categories in KER \u003E cluster dV/TWR/thrust) so they show correct numbers. I also wouldn\u0027t worry about other people writing custom MM configs since those could also be modified to be correct with a custom engine module.\n\u003E \n\u003E @blowfish\n\u003E \n\u003E About that raptor engine, this pic shows Merlin 2 engine concept (supposedly), a predecessor to raptor (since raptor itself hasn\u0027t been revealed yet)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://spaceflight101.com/spacex-launch-vehicle-concepts-designs/](http://spaceflight101.com/spacex-launch-vehicle-concepts-designs/)\n\u003E \n\u003E some more stats:\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://104.131.251.97/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SpaceX-Concept.jpg](http://104.131.251.97/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SpaceX-Concept.jpg)[http://104.131.251.97/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Raptor.jpg](http://104.131.251.97/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Raptor.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Interestingly Russians are developing their own versions of Raptor methalox engines with similar stats (RD-0162 and RD-0164):\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=33645.0](http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=33645.0)\n\u003E \n\u003E They intend to use them for new Soyuz 5 launch vehicles:\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://www.russianspaceweb.com/soyuz5.html](http://www.russianspaceweb.com/soyuz5.html)\n\u003E \n\u003E LEFT: RD-0162, 2032 kN SL thrust, weight = 2.1t, height: 3.5m, diameter(max): 1.65m, isp:321-356\n\u003E \n\u003E RIGHT: RD-0164, 2800-3000 kN thrust - single engine per column\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://www.kbkha.ru/upload/kpo/581650053.jpg](http://www.kbkha.ru/upload/kpo/581650053.jpg)[http://www.russianspaceweb.com/images/rockets/soyuz/soyuz5/soyuz5_lebourget_2013_side_2.jpg](http://www.russianspaceweb.com/images/rockets/soyuz/soyuz5/soyuz5_lebourget_2013_side_2.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ---\n\u003E \n\u003E  Meanwhile here are some pictures that might help with modelling Merlin engine (by Brain Haeger; [www.bionic3d.com](http://www.bionic3d.com) ):\n\u003E \n\u003E [**http://41.media.tumblr.com/475967aac187835776ff340285765e2e/tumblr\\_mh3evvJ2Tg1r01w8mo1\\_1280.jpg**](https://41.media.tumblr.com/475967aac187835776ff340285765e2e/tumblr_mh3evvJ2Tg1r01w8mo1_1280.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://www.bionic3d.com/style/images/portfolio/merlin-spacex-rocket-motor.jpg](http://www.bionic3d.com/style/images/portfolio/merlin-spacex-rocket-motor.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://www.bionic3d.com/style/images/portfolio/merlin-spacex-illustration-2.jpg](http://www.bionic3d.com/style/images/portfolio/merlin-spacex-illustration-2.jpg)\n\nAwesome, thanks for the pics and data. Will see about merging this stuff into my existing data sheets and picture stores.\n\nWRT to custom engine module; I might be contacting Sarbian shortly to figure out the best way to set this up. It seems like I\u0027m not the only mod that could benefit from custom engine modules with full MJ support, but I\u0027m unsure as to the proper method to setup such compatibility through c# while maintaining stand-alone capability (with Java you would use byte-code manipulation to strip interface defs from the class when the interface-base-class was not present). Ideally stock would add such an interface and all other mods would be able to use it for their custom engine implementations; though I highly doubt I will be able to get Squad devs to listen to my requests.\n\nGeneral Progress Update:\n\nRunning into some rather large issues with regards to rescaling; more specifically, allowing the custom engine clusters to cleanly be rescaled for use in RO/RSS/whatever and how it relates to the manually built models that I currently intend to use.\n\nEngines are all modeled at 64% of real scale. Would be easy enough to rescale the engine models themselves back to realistic sizes. The problem comes from the hand-crafted mounts for stock stack-sizes; these do not cleanly rescale to RSS sizes using the standard 1.5625 \u0027100% correction\u0027 rescale (e.g. 64% \\* 1.5625 = 100%). This results in strange/odd tank sizes (6.25m rescales to ~9.74m rather than the 10m it should, 5m = 7.8125 rather than 8.4m). If you rescale the mount to match the exact size needed all of the engines will need to be rescaled with it as well; resulting in different stack-sizes having different scaled engine models. Not good for a realism-based mod.\n\n1.) The first alternative that I\u0027ve thought up is to use consistent scaling for the engine mounts (e.g. 1.5625 scale), but allow specification of the interstage fairings to be whatever size is needed for that stack size. So, while the mount itself might be slightly smaller than the tanks, the engines would all be at proper scale. This seems like it -might- be the most workable solution; the aesthetics would be slightly off as the mounts/fuel lines would not match the tanks, but it should work.\n\n2.) A second alternative that I\u0027m heavily considering at this point is fully-procedural mounts rather than hand-built models. The problem that is ran into here is how to do this while still making them look good? Not sure that I could pull it off (without years of coding on it). A big problem with this is how to handle the special-case oversized mounts.\n\n3.) A third alternative that I\u0027m considering is somehow splitting up the mount model into multiple independently scalable parts. So you could maintain the motors at a standard rescale factor (1.5625x) but scale the stack-mounting plates by a different amount to make them cleanly line up with the stack size they are mounted on. This would also -greatly- cut down on the number of specific models that I need to create.\n\nAnd just to throw a wrench in the gears there is the case of the special \u0027oversized\u0027 engine mounts and how to cleanly rescale those to be usable with random rescaling (can\u0027t see how it would be possible).\n\nPerhaps I am getting a bit too ambitious with my plans and might need to scale this project back a bit. Even as it is (if I ignore the RSS rescale problems) the full set of parts will be 20 engine models, 51\u002B mounts, and 51\u002B mount shrouds. Of course this was with attempting to do very-detailed skeletal type mounts where all the fuel-lines match up and are routed properly. Might just rethink the mounting layout along the lines of #3 where there is a single tank-cap model that can be freely rescaled, and a single skeletal adapter per cluster layout that is rescaled appropriately for the motor mount size. Still has problems related to external shrouds (specifically the oversized/special ones).\n\nStrangely the plugin-end of things I think will be the easier bit to figure out this time. Setup thrust transforms per engine type: check, simple enough to do. Alter engine module stats for selected engine (thrust/isp/mass/heat): very doable. Position engine models where needed based on cluster layout: no problem. Re-setup engine gimbal properly for engine type: simple. Re-setup engine FX properly for engine type: Not yet figured out, but preliminary investigation points out that it is doable.\n\nRescaling of models for use in RSS: No clue where to start.\n\nHmm... still quite a bit of figuring out to do on this stuff.\n\nWill look at doing some mock-ups of engine mount stuff a bit later to see if I can figure out an easily freely-rescalable solution."}]}
