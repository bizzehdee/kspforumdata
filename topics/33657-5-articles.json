Here\u0027s why.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bottom stage\u0027s TWR of 2.5 means that at low altitudes you\u0027ll be accelerating a bit faster than the terminal velocity increases, which means you\u0027ll want to throttle down just to avoid wasting too much energy fighting drag. If you\u0027re constantly throttled down, there\u0027s not much point in having the extra engine power. You really only need a 2.1-2.2 for any stage that\u0027s intending to accelerate vertically. Once you get up out of the thick part of the atmosphere, drag stops being an issue and you can accelerate as quickly as your ship can handle. A 2.5 isn\u0027t terribly overpowered, but it means you can throw on a slightly bigger fuel tank (lowering the TWR a bit) and get quite a bit further up before the stage burns out. Alternately, you can make the upper stages a bit heavier, like replacing regular engines with nuclear ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut once you\u0027re in a circular orbit, where there\u0027s no danger of crashing back down, thrust becomes almost irrelevant. EFFICIENCY is what matters there, as measured by the ISP of your engines; an LV-N, with a vacuum ISP of 800, will use half as much fuel to get the same effect as an engine with an ISP of 400; it might take much longer to accelerate, because of the lower thrust, but it\u0027ll get you twice as far on the same load of fuel (oversimplifying, of course). A TWR of over 1.0 or higher is just overkill; the main reason to want much thrust at that stage is to avoid the boredom of half-hour burn times, or when you\u0027re trying to do something with a very narrow window (like entering Gilly\u0027s SOI) where you just can\u0027t do a long burn at all. But for most situations, a far lower thrust works just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then there\u0027s your Mun stage. Mun has only 17% of Kerbin\u0027s gravity (almost identical to our own moon), which means even a TWR of 0.2 will accelerate you upwards, albeit very slowly. Granted, with no atmosphere there\u0027s less reason no to go much higher, but it still means you\u0027re lifting more engine weight than you actually need if you\u0027ve got a TWR of 1.2; you could easily back that off to a 0.8 or so, use the weight savings to add more fuel, and get a higher effective delta-V. But the higher thrust gives you a bit more room for error on the landing, which might be good for you in light of...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI misjudged the surface, slowed down way too early, burned up all my fuel.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Flight Engineer mod is really helpful for this, as it includes two separate altitude readouts, a \u0022pressure altitude\u0022 (i.e., what the game gives you right now, a distance above the \u0022sea level\u0022 for that planet) as well as a \u0022radar altitude\u0022 (altitude above the actual surface below you). Having both available simultaneously makes it much, much easier to judge a descent, and frankly it\u0027s something the game should have gone with from the start, as the only times you really care about the distance above sea level is when you\u0027re flying a spaceplane or trying to aerobrake. This wouldn\u0027t be so bad if KSP didn\u0027t have such strange definitions of \u0022sea level\u0022 on some moons (Gilly being a good example). Yes, you can use the in-cockpit view to see the altimeter, but I don\u0027t LIKE the cockpit views much and it\u0027s just a bit too limiting in general.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other option, if you dislike mods, is to just add some spotlights to the bottom of your ship and turn them on during the descent. The moment you see the ground light up at all, jam the throttles, and use the compactness of the illuminated area to judge your altitude. (This is basically how I did my first Duna landing.) You\u0027ll still need to slow down a bit first, depending on how much engine power your lander has, but it makes it does help, depending on the time of day and color of the terrain.

Above 69078m, there\u0027s no atmosphere at all, so orbits will stay perfectly stable... except that when you\u0027re controlling some other vessel, the game doesn\u0027t use quite as accurate a simulation for all other vessels in the game. This can cause orbits to wobble a bit, which might take your depot below 69km if you were to put it at 70-75. Now, the game also doesn\u0027t model friction for any vessels other than the active one; if your depot WERE to drift below 69km while you were controlling your lander, it wouldn\u0027t start to spiral in from friction. Instead, the game hard-kills any other vessel that goes below about 25km altitude, but that\u0027s not likely to be an issue. But you don\u0027t want your depot to drift below the 69km line, because anything trying to dock with it WOULD feel drag (making it pretty much impossible to link up), as would the depot if you were to switch back to it. So the absolute minimum altitude I\u0027d use is around 80km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou want to be as low as possible to leverage the Oberth Effect, but you also want to be high enough that a vessel trying to dock with your depot doesn\u0027t accidentally skim the atmosphere. My first fuel station was at 90-100km because of this. The idea would be that a vessel would take off, circularize in a low orbit and dock with the depot, refuel, and then easily travel out of the Kerbin SOI. Putting the station much higher reduces this effect, which costs you fuel in the long run.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there\u0027s one other consideration: time acceleration. Below 120km, you\u0027re limited to x50 time acceleration, but above 120km you can also use 100x. Above 240, you can use 1000x. Time acceleration is really useful for getting orbits to line up right for docking, so being limited to x50 is a bit rough for something you\u0027ll want to use often. Because of this, I put my main fuel station at about 125km. (I\u0027ve also got one at 200 and one at 314, for other reasons.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E#EDIT2: Got an alternate version going.

As I said before, once you reach orbit what you care about most is efficiency; that poodle will take more than twice as much fuel to make the same orbital changes, and that makes a BIG difference if you\u0027re trying to get a depot to one of the other planets or something. As long as you\u0027ve got an ASAS on your tanker, you can just set it to the right heading and go watch TV for a few minutes while it burns. You COULD turn on physics acceleration, to go up to x4, but that can cause your designs to rip themselves apart so I\u0027d avoid it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, my own 450-ton tanker (capacity is about 12 orange tanks) has an inefficient, powerful engine for major orbital changes, and only uses high-efficiency engines (hybrid ions from a mod, efficiencies and thrusts comparable to the nukes) for minor tweaks. At that weight it\u0027d take hours to complete a burn to Jool if I were to use nukes, so it\u0027s just not an option. But if you\u0027re making a small depot, say 1 orange, then a cluster of nukes would work just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"el_coyoto","CreatedById":49292,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-21T16:27:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Whackjob\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Whackjob\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve got fuel-tank-lifter I euphamistically call the \u0022Addled Sow Mk1\u0022.
