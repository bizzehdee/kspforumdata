From their current position behind Kerbin, they were in an ideal spot to relay the incoming data down to Mission Control. For Edmund, it added\u00A0insult to injury. The mission was nearly flawless. Atmospheric densities, soil compositions, gravitational resonances, the numbers were \u003Cem\u003Eperfect\u003C/em\u003E. Edmund could feel his hopes being swept away in that flow of information.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe simple truth was, this base had only been a hardware test anyway. To test equipment in situ for a flight to Duna. It was only through the intervention of Chadvey Kerman, so long ago now, that the powers that be had even agreed to put a crew here in the first place. And that was only approved after the Company\u00A0agreed to cover the cost. And only if the crew had a primary objective to investigate the anomaly so near to Chadvey\u0027s chosen landing site.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdmund had watched all this unfolding, long before he was even chosen to go to the space station. He had watched... and waited. Made the right friends, said the right things to the right people, and chosen the right crew to back him up. Edgas was the smartest Kerbonaut in the corps, Billy-Bobrim was the most adaptable, and Edmund\u0027s own skill... it just wasn\u0027t enough. Here, at the end, it just wasn\u0027t enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou played the hand you were dealt, and Edmund had been dealt a looser. He\u0027d played it the very best that he could, but...

Eighty-nine days here. Not even halfway, yet. But with this... there would be virtually no chance of an extension. They might even be called home early. And Edgas was glad for it. He slept now, but he still felt terrible. The shadows still moved in ways they shouldn\u0027t. He scratched at his stubbly chin. He thought Edmund looked more and more haggard, and Billy... was getting worse. He felt so drained. A hundred and ten more days. It sounded like forever.

Outside, m\u00FCnar night laid on the small base like miasma. Edgas was on the hab deck, preparing for another long night. Edmund passed wordlessly on his way up the ladder to the lab.

Edgas just stood there, staring widely at nothing. He looked at the object in his hand. It was a small, gray, sparkly rock.

He had been afraid before, but that was the distant, indistinct fear of wandering alone in the darkness. This was something \u003Cem\u003Edifferent\u003C/em\u003E. This was the sharp, stinging fear of \u003Cem\u003Eknowing \u003C/em\u003Ethe monster was real, that it lurked there in the darkness, seeing you, smelling you, stalking you; and you knew at any moment, a moment of \u003Cem\u003Eits\u003C/em\u003E choosing, you would feel its cold, clammy digits closing around your throat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd you were helpless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas sat, and stared down at his hands.

He took a blue pill from its bottle, and tried to swallow it. It took many tries, and when he finally did, it burned all the way down.

Something... there was something important... but it was gone now. The feeling was already fading in that way nightmares do. He hated this place, hated the darkness. Maybe when this was all over, he thought, he could transfer to one of the polar research outposts. He\u0027d heard it never truly got dark out there on the ice, only a strange kind of twilight. He could tolerate twilight. He wiped more clinging sweat from his arms. And it was always cold there. That was all right, the cold never bothered him anyway.

It was finally over. They were going home. Billy\u0027s face was bandaged, and he was heavily sedated.

With a thump and a \u003Cem\u003Ewhoosh\u003C/em\u003E, the return stage began its slow climb into the sky. They had left everything behind. Belongings, research, and all the samples.

Once spent, the stage was jettisoned, and Edgas adjusted the tiny capsule\u0027s course with its own thrusters, leaving the derelict to swing past Kerbin and off into deep space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022t31KqV6.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/t31KqV6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022a1xkE8m.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/a1xkE8m.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor most of the return trip, Edmund never left Billy\u0027s side, leaving Edgas to monitor the ship, alone with his thoughts. As he stared out the window towards the diminishing M\u00FCn, he could hear Edmund reading to Billy from an old book, something about a great fish, he thought. He stared down at that cold, airless desolation.

He stared down at that heedless, indifferent sliver floating in blackness. He never wanted to go back there. Never wanted to be in space again. No one would ever know what happened down there, he already knew that. There would be questions and inquests, fingers pointed, hands wrung, then everyone would forget they had ever existed. Someone would see to that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs he stared out the window, his eyes wandered to the hatch above. None of them had their helmets on, of course. For one fleeting moment, he considered reaching up, pulling the emergency\u00A0release, ending all their troubles in a few humane seconds. But even in his despair, deep down in his being, something stirred. It was withered, weak, dormant. But it \u003Cem\u003Elived\u003C/em\u003E. Instead, Edgas\u0027s hand moved to the attitude control, and he turned the window away from the despised M\u00FCn, towards the brightness of Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022G5OErE0.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/G5OErE0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually, Edmund secured Billy, and took his place next to Edgas in the command couch. Their dialogue was sparse, and automatic. Soon the first whisps of superheated plasma glowed in the windows. The now-alien crush of gravity slowly built higher and higher, sparks and flame cascading past the windows as the pod was buffeted and shaken like a victim in the jaws of a predator. Edgas felt sure he would be crushed into nothing, but as minutes stretched on even that subsided. Then there was a jolt, and a bang, as explosive bolts separated the docking adapter and supplemental propulsion package. More jolts, and an unpleasant heaviness as the parachutes deployed, and finally the capsule splashed into the waiting sea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fHz8Dv6.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fHz8Dv6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Xvc1HfD.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Xvc1HfD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was no merriment, no cheer as Edgas popped open the hatch, and the first breaths of fresh air in many weeks filled his lungs.

There were inquests, and hearings, and panels. All of it lost in the shadow of Duna. In the end, no one really paid attention. At least on the surface. Edmund Kerman took full responsibility for the incidents on the M\u00FCn. He received a minor reprimand, and retired quietly to a large property up the beach from the Kerbal Space Center. Billy-Bobrim Kerman was committed to the psychiatric ward of the Kerbin City Sanitorium for the Severely Disabled. His sister visited him often, and always had around her neck a small, gray, sparkly rock on a silver chain. Edgas Kerman was relegated to a desk, deep within the bowels of the Administration Building, where he never had to see the M\u00FCn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFunding for the M\u00FCnbase project was terminated in its entirety, and redirected towards the planned mission to Duna.

The Kerbin City Sanatorium was a sprawling facility, not far from the space center. More of that tall wrought iron surrounded the psychiatric wing, separating it from the main campus, but otherwise... it was not at all what Edgas expected. It was a squat, modern, two story building covered in mirrored glass. Pleasant manicured gardens, winding paths, trimmed hedges, and fragrant flowers surrounded it within the fences.. Here and there, white-clad patients meandered or sat on benches, sometimes alone, sometimes in groups. Several large orderlies could also be seen, in white scrubs, trying unsuccessfully to look like they weren\u0027t watching the patients.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a wide path from the gate to the main entrance. Edgas swallowed hard. It didn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Elook\u003C/em\u003E all that menacing, but still... every horror story about the trope flooded through his mind. Especially those about being wrongly committed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EAfter all\u003C/em\u003E, the scientist in him said, \u003Cem\u003Eone \u003Cstrong\u003Ecould \u003C/strong\u003Eargue there is reason to doubt your sanity.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s what Edgas told himself, at least. He hadn\u0027t seen Billy at all since the medical team pulled him out of the capsule as it bobbed in the sea, and rushed him off into a separate transport. After that, he had only spoken to Anastasia briefly, and that hadn\u0027t really been much of a conversation. The two never really got along well, the exchange had been... awkward.\u00A0More memories came leaking into his mind, painful and unwelcomed like seepage from a festered wound long thought healed. Edgas pushed them out of his mind, gritted his teeth, and walked forward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAutomatic doors \u003Cem\u003Eswooshed\u003C/em\u003E open at the entry, and he stepped inside. The lobby was long, with a large counter at the far end where a receptionist with a patient and helpful look on his face sat. It was flanked on either side by glass walls, behind which were large, open rooms filled with various comfortable-looking chairs and couches. The patients within sat reading, or watching the entertainment box, or just staring vacantly off into space. The orderlies seemed a bit more watchful, and somewhat larger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomewhere down a hallway, a speaker crackled, \u0022paging Dr. Kerman, Dr. Kerman, Dr. Kerman.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas warily approached the front desk. \u0022Hello, my name is Edgas Kerman. I\u0027m here to see-\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Dr. Kerman.\u0022 Said a voice to his right, \u0022I\u0027m glad you could make it.\u0022 The owner of the voice was a tall, rather thin Kerbal, with sparse hair and a graying goatee. He wore a long white lab coat, and a shirt that didn\u0027t match. A\u00A0badge read, \u0022S. Kerman.\u0022 He offered his hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Uh, Edgas, please. Nobody ever calls me that,\u0022 said Edgas, taking Dr. Kerman\u0027s hand but looking right past him at the largest Kerbal Edgas had ever seen. He stood a full head taller than Edgas, which was something of an accomplishment for a Kerbal. Dressed in orderly\u0027s white scrubs, with his massive arms crossed over his barrel-like chest, and distinct lack of anything resembling a neck, he gave Edgas the impression of a rather large marshmallow with feet. Edgas kept this assessment to himself, however, as the impassive, unconcerned, slightly bored look on Mr. Marshmallow\u0027s face seemed to say, \u003Cem\u003EI could break you in half with barely a thought. Right in half.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So, uh,\u0022 began Edgas once he tore his gaze away from the white mountain, \u0022what is this all about?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We should go where we can speak in private,\u0022 said Dr. Kerman, and gestured towards the receptionist, \u0022Sondsen here will get you checked in.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd so he did. Edgas was fingerprinted and photographed, his IDs checked and re-checked, and finally issued his own temporary badge from a machine on the counter. He then followed Dr. Kerman down a long, white hallway, followed by Marshmallow, followed by whatever small moons his mass had dragged from their orbits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This place. It\u0027s... not what I was expecting,\u0022 Edgas said awkwardly as they walked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027ve seen too many movies, my friend,\u0022 replied Dr. Kerman, \u0022this is a place of \u003Cem\u003Ehealing\u003C/em\u003E, like any other hospital. And like any other-\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey were passed by three doctors in lab coats, having a very animated argument about something. It seemed to be getting violent. Marshmallow tapped Dr. Kerman gently on the shoulder with a finger as thick as Edgas\u0027s arm, nodded towards the group, and grunted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, yes, I\u0027ll have a chat with the Chief of Staff later,\u0022 he said to Marshmallow, \u0022I\u0027ve had about enough of those stooges myself. Now, what was I saying?\u0022 He turned back to Edgas,\u00A0\u0022ah yes. This is a place for sick people to get treatment, but like any other hospital,\u0022 he paused as they came to a large, heavy set of doors at the end of the hallway, \u0022some of our patients are too ill to leave.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMarshmallow opened one of the massive painted steel doors for them. Edgas was expecting it to make an ominous creaking, but instead he could only hear a light \u003Cem\u003Eshhhhhhh\u003C/em\u003E as it closed with a hydraulic damper. They were now in a short corridor, at the far end was another transparent wall, this one made of polycarbonate or some other impact resistant, slightly flexible plastic. The haze of scratches implied that it had resisted many impacts. In the center of this wall was a single transparent door. The frame and anything else that wasn\u0027t transparent was heavily padded. Along the side wall were many thick windows, behind which must have been a guard room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDr. Kerman held his badge up to one of the white-clad Kerbals on the other side of the first window. He gave it a long, considering look, then pressed a button somewhere, and a buzzing and loud \u003Cem\u003Ethunk \u003C/em\u003Eannounced that the transparent door was now unlocked. The three proceeded through the door into another short corridor with another polycarbonate wall and door. The first door closed, its electric lock\u003Cem\u003E thunk\u003C/em\u003Eed loudly, then the far door buzzed and \u003Cem\u003Ethunk\u003C/em\u003Eed. They went through, the door \u003Cem\u003Ethunk\u003C/em\u003Eed again behind them, and they were before a rather normal-looking set of double doors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This is our maximum-security ward,\u0022 announced Dr. Kerman with a hand on the door, \u0022try to understand, this is a place for people who have demonstrated they are a threat to others. Or themselves.\u0022 He emphasized the word \u003Cem\u003Epeople\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-21T19:39:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2017 07:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheAdversary238","CreatedById":138827,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T22:13:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWorking a Saturday overtime.

Lining each wall were more of the transparent-wall-and-door arrangements, each perhaps three meters wide, separated from each other by a stout wall. Hanging on the polycarbonate wall by each door was a placard with a name, and other presumably important information about the resident, as well as a holder for medical charts. The room behind was small, about two meters deep, furnished only with a round-edged table and two or three light, plastic chairs. At the far end of each of these vestibules was a solid wall, and a wide door in the center with a small, square hatch at eye level, covering a window. A pair of orderlies walked the hall, peering into the empty vestibules. Edgas also noticed ceiling-mounted cameras looking into each room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs they walked past the rows of doors, he could occasionally see shadowy movement through the few window hatches that had been left open. Some of the doors had large red X\u0027s on them. These never had open windows. They stopped in front of one such door midway down the hall. Billy\u0027s name was on the placard, along with a substantial paragraph of medical jargon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EBilly...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This is it.\u0022 Dr. Kerman said. He looked up at the camera across from the door and nodded.

Marshmallow stood by the wall, crossed his arms, and did his best impression of a glacier. A menacing glacier. \u0022So, you\u0027re wondering why I asked you here on such short notice.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes...\u0022 replied Edgas, still quite bewildered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022When someone in an acute psychotic dissociative fugue, who hasn\u0027t made a coherent sound in all the time he\u0027s been here, suddenly begins speaking, one takes notice.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Is... is that what\u0027s wrong with him?

It\u0027s the psychological equivalent of saying the engine just won\u0027t run and you don\u0027t know why. The truth is, I don\u0027t have the slightest idea what\u0027s wrong with him, nor does anyone else who\u0027s examined him. He\u0027s been given every test I\u0027ve ever heard of, every parameter comes back normal. Everything except one.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022His brain activity is off the scale. EEG, EMG, alpha wave analysis, the readings were so high the machines had to be recalibrated. I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going on in his head but there certainly is a lot of it. Three years with no improvement in his condition, no change in his detachment, and absolutely no underlying physiological cause. That in its self is extremely rare. But then, just a few days ago, he began asking for you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What does he say?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s it, just that he needs to see you. Not a word otherwise. Eventually, he gets so agitated that he has to be sedated, but that much is typical for his case. I called you down here because I\u0027m out of ideas, and at this point I don\u0027t think anything could hurt. At this point, I would call a witchdoctor, if I thought it would help.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas didn\u0027t think the doctor was making a joke. He stood up and moved to the door, gesturing to the window cover, \u0022may I?\u0022 Dr. Kerman looked grave, but nodded. Edgas steeled himself, and slid the small hatch open.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd there was Billy. The room was completely empty, the four walls heavily padded. Billy sat huddled in the corner, facing the far wall, secured in a straitjacket. Edgas frowned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Is that really necessary?\u0022 He said incredulously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m afraid so,\u0022 Dr. Kerman replied, \u0022he\u0027s been known to attack the staff, or try to injure himself. We can\u0027t keep any furniture in the room at all, not even a bed, and it\u0027s either this or sedate him to unconsciousness and restrain him on a bed all the time.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas looked back through the window. Billy\u0027s face was bandaged, and even from this distance, he could see it just didn\u0027t look right. A Kerbal\u0027s face shouldn\u0027t be so... smooth. Edgas shut the hatch and closed his eyes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So what\u0027s the catch?\u0022 he asked, \u0022what are you expecting from me?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t know,\u0022 said Dr. Kerman, \u0022everything will be recorded, of course.\u0022 He glanced toward the camera in the ceiling, \u0022other than that, I\u0027m just hoping for some kind of change. Some kind of insight into what the problem is. Are you ready?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas sighed and stepped back. Dr. Kerman walked to the door and inserted a key in the lock. Marshmallow tensed, and for a moment the pressure in the room rose slightly from the air he displaced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We will be right out here, watching,\u0022 Dr. Kerman said, \u0022probably best if we don\u0027t cause any influence.\u0022 He turned the key, and opened the door.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-23T04:27:46Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2017 04:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
