You can make airplaines before you can make spaceplanes, why not allow people to make land rovers before they can make mun rovers? It\u0026#39;s good practice for later. Plus there is good science early on to grab all over Kerbin. It\u0026#39;d be nice not to have to rely on airplane wheels for offroad driving.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-17T13:02:11Z\u0022 title=\u002211/17/2015 01:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tricky14\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andem","CreatedById":155578,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-14T14:14:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes.
