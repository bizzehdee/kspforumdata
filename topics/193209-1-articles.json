There are other factors such as the eddies from the wash coming off of the flaps that then impinge upon the rear elevators; ground effects; surface adhesion; spoilers; canards; and automated trim settings that can all be designed to compensate for this typical nosing down on real aircraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIdeally, for the purposes of this game, the flaps should be attached as near to the center-of-mass as possible. One way to do this is to just move the wings forward a little. This reduces the torque from the lever effect, but it\u0027s often difficult to move a wing forward without messing up all sorts of other mass/lift balance issues. If you can still balance everything well it works like a dream - that is what I would do. There are other options however that are used in real life designs. You could:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nAdd spoilers to the leading edge of the wing which deploy upwards to correct the angle of attack.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMove the flaps to the underside center of the wing in line with the center-of-mass so that they won\u0027t have any effect on your pitch.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAdd canards to pull the nose up.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIncrease the control authority of the rear elevators and add some extra trim to them to compensate. Holding ALT then tapping \u0022S\u0022 will incrementally add upwards pitch trim (ALT\u002BW = downwards.) Remember to cancel trim with ALT\u002BX when retracting flaps. This simulates the control programs many planes use to automatically adjust trim in different stages of flight.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRotate the wings very very slightly to add a positive angle of incidence. In other words, when looking at the side view the leading edge of the wings is up higher than the trailing edge as they slope downwards from front to back. Even one degree can be enough. This allows the wings to generate more lift in level flight without raising the nose at all. It will usually also move the center-of-pressure forward so you\u0027ll have to carefully balance their placement and even possibly add some positive incidence to the rear elevators too so that the plane doesn\u0027t nose-up all the time. You may find that the increased lift means that you don\u0027t even need flaps anymore.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe one or a few of these ideas will be the solution you are looking for. Or, if not, maybe it\u0027s given you an idea of something that might work better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck, and happy flying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-04-18T06:06:15Z\u0022 title=\u002204/18/2020 06:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EApril 18, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by HvP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-18T06:31:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree, you do seem to be doing everything right, and what you see is what I would expect as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nModerate flaps (usually about 10\u00B0) let aircraft take-off at a slightly lower speed, by giving the wing a bit more lift,\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eif \u003C/strong\u003Eyou pull the\u00A0 stick back (elevator pitching down) as much as you need to lift the nose-wheel.\u00A0 You can see at\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.faasafety.gov/files/gslac/courses/content/35/376/Use%20of%20Flaps.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.faasafety.gov/files/gslac/courses/content/35/376/Use of Flaps.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0that the usual case \u0022the nose-down pitching moment\u0022 from flaps is taken for granted.\u00A0 The pilot almost automatically pulls back as needed on the stick to keep the aircraft in the attitude that he wants.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Cu\u003Eunusual \u003C/u\u003Ecase is that flaps on \u003Cu\u003Esome \u003C/u\u003Ehigh-wing aircraft have enough down-wash that they can push the tail down, nose up.\u00A0 Stock KSP does not simulate interactions between wing and tail; \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E tries to, but I am not sure it considers interaction\u00A0that far away.\u00A0 It might be interesting to see if we can build a high-wing aircraft that will pitch up with flaps under \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-18T16:13:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP doesn\u0027t really do air physics that well- the wings only provide lift if they are angled down and provide zero lift at 0 degrees angle of attack. Building a plane exactly like a real one won\u0027t work that well, so you need to make a few alterations:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Angle your wings a few degrees upwards, this gives them a slight angle of attack and causes them to generate lift even when then nose is level e.g. on the runway. The angle will vary depending on how fast your plane will go, and for really fast planes you have to balance getting more lift at low speeds with the additional drag you\u0027ll get at high speeds. This was done on planes such as the PBY5 Catalina to give them additional lift at low speeds, particularly useful for seaplanes and flying boats.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Use leading edge slats or spoilers rather than trailing edge flaps, especially with delta wings. On the leading edge they\u0027ll probably be in front of the centre of lift and when tilted up will generate both lift and a bit of nose-up rotation, whereas on the trailing edge they\u0027ll provide lift but a nose-down rotation too. For real planes, the slats deploy downwards to extend the leading edge of the wing, but since KSP doesn\u0027t do aerofoils and wings simply provide lift based on their angle of attack you should make them deploy upwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Nose mounted canards- a bit like slats, they\u0027ll give you more lift and help get your nose up. Just be careful though, there\u0027s a fine line between \u0027pulling your nose up\u0027 and \u0027pulling an unplanned Pugachev\u0027s Cobra at Mach 3 and ripping various wing surfaces off followed by an inexorable nosedive or humiliating parachute to the ground surrounded by a rain of debris\u0027...

This can make for some interesting landings if you brake too hard and end up planting the nose in the runway and either doing some front flips or just exploding depending on your speed and the sturdiness of the parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeldenthuis","CreatedById":204066,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-18T18:24:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/146104-hvp/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022146104\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/146104-hvp/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@HvP\u003C/a\u003E!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have chosen to go with a flap arrangement on the tail.\u00A0 The flap on the tail goes negative (up) which pushes the back down.\u00A0 It 1) keeps the theme of advanced programming, 2) does not mess with lift much (using the leverage), and 3) it looks like a plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe plane takes off like a breeze at 45 m/s.\u00A0 It climbs a bit much at the beginning, which I can likely modify.\u00A0 It lands acceptably with flaps, although the transition to landing position is stressful, again I think I can tweak that by managing the tail flap pitch better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
