I don\\\u0027t plan on making it overpowered though. This is my first mod so don\\\u0027t be too harsh on me ;P\n\nThe shuttle has 4 fully working tilting air breathing engines for takeoff and landing as well as 2 main engines.\n\nYou will need the MuMechLib plugin by r4mon. This mod also features a modded version of the tiltrotor and the turbine from the damned aerospace pack by damnyoujapan/r4mon. So I\\\u0027ll probably need their permission to release this mod.\n\nPart list\n\n- [li]Valkyrie Nose[/li]  \n[li]Valkyrie Cockpit[/li]  \n[li]Valkyrie Air intake[/li]  \n[li]Valkyrie Cargo Bay[/li]  \n[li]Valkyrie Main Engine Right/Left[/li]  \n[li]Valkyrie Wing Right/Left[/li]  \n[li]Valkyrie Front Engine Right/Left[/li]  \n[li]Valkyrie Rear Engine Right/Left[/li]  \n[li]Modded Tiltrotor[/li]\n\nTo do:\n\n- [li]Balance the parts[/li]  \n[li]Make the craft stable for vertical takeoff/landing[/li]  \n[li]Improve Texturing[/li]  \n[li]Fix gaps between parts (It\\\u0027s fine in the VAB but not on the launchpad for some reason)[/li]  \n[li]Landing gear[/li]  \n[li]Cargo bay door[/li]  \n[li]Docking port[/li]\n\nI will probably release the mod after .15 when the shuttle is stable.\n\nPlease keep in mind I am quite busy and it may take a while before some features on this list can be implemented.\n\nIf you have comments, suggestions, insults, please feel free to share them.\n\ncredits for the orginal model goes to arthur-----a,s\n\n\u003E ![screenshot7.png](http://s14.postimage.org/d97e67mkh/screenshot7.png)\n\n\u003E ![screenshot8.png](http://s15.postimage.org/w19lyqkmz/screenshot8.png)\n\n\u003E ![screenshot9.png](http://s12.postimage.org/w0fz99xv1/screenshot9.png)\n\n\u003E ![screenshot10.png](http://s15.postimage.org/7wdhurpq3/screenshot10.png)\n\n\u003E ![screenshot11.png](http://s17.postimage.org/umgcm8uxr/screenshot11.png)\n\n\u003E ![screenshot12.png](http://s17.postimage.org/7ikxqrxy7/screenshot12.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocketscienist","CreatedById":12576,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-09T13:56:33Z","Content":"It liooks intersting!"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-09T14:41:52Z","Content":"I want that so bad...."},{"CreatedByName":"Rocketscienist","CreatedById":12576,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-09T14:42:54Z","Content":"You could add a little cart onto it to bring it away from the launchpad!"},{"CreatedByName":"tadeass","CreatedById":16874,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-09T16:27:36Z","Content":"Looks good, but I think it needs another texure. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nBut other is great."},{"CreatedByName":"Horizon","CreatedById":14902,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-09T17:00:00Z","Content":"I agree.
