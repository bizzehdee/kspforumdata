And until now didn\u0027t saw any shuttle orbiter kind of parts. So I wondered if this was possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFound the Tiberdyne mod and thought this would be the only way to get a working shuttle. From what I gather lurking around for a while, the developer is very busy on Nova Punch and basically made correction for it to work with 0.23 and that\u0027s it (for now). Also, it was recommended by Kerbal wiki as a shuttle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I used it. Got a lot of problems launching it, and equal problems to make it go steady in space. Firing the engines made it pitch all the time. Read this was mainly due the above mentioned problems and I should use the Intrepid. So I did, and it\u0027s indeed more stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen got into the problem that, after being docked a while with my space station, it couldn\u0027t fire engines anymore and I couldn\u0027t get it to de-orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELurked around once more and read this was because of the power issues. This seems odd, because other rockets (docked with my space station) get power from the space station (or am I mistaken?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen read it\u0027s possible to transfer power like with fuel. But although I get the \u0022in\u0022 and \u0022out\u0022 buttons, it didn\u0027t transfer power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it could be that some engine ran out of fuel but I can\u0027t seem to find the \u0022tank\u0022 that is used for this engine and could not transfer fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I am very NOOB-ish when it comes to the math and formulas. Read that you could put solar panels to the cargo bay doors to give it more power (also the generator is running....).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut putting those tiles to the cargo bay doors leave them \u0022floating\u0022 in the air when you close the cargo bay doors. They don\u0027t interact with the doors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy conclusion therefor is (from my noob point of view perhaps) this is not \u0027fit\u0027 for your everyday player yet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy only use for the shuttle would be to use it like the real life situation would be, build my station faster and use the cargo bay for hauling up tanks and satellites. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I\u0027ve spend about an hour trying to make the coupler work that is supplied to firmly attach cargo. It just works ... well, not good. Finally with some adjusting (adding a fuel tank first, and then my load) worked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly to see it explode in space when I found out the gear was down (default) at launch. Getting the gear in causes the wheels to \u0022appear\u0022 in the cargo bay, and exploding my cargo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally... I kindly ask .. Do any of you use \u0027KSP native\u0027 parts (I like to play vanilla) to create a useable shuttle craft. On that has a cargo bay that is. For the soul purpose of bringing tanks and parts to the space station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe a craft file I can look at ? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKind regards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMartin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mach_XXII","CreatedById":94457,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-11T11:39:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck out Ej_sa on twitch.

But for me, besides it\u0027s great flying a shuttle like that Buran of Bobcat, I would like to use it to bring payload to my station.
