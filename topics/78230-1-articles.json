I use KER, so I already know the dV, TWR, ISP and Burn Time of each stage, but I can\u0027t quite figure out the math behind distance travelled and max velocity during the course of a stage. If I didn\u0027t have to deal with non-constant acceleration, and drag, and so on, this would be simpler, but I\u0027m not entirely sure how to figure it out- especially with the gravity-turn to consider (or maybe my sleep-deprived brain is missing something blindingly obvious).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously I want to design my first stage to run out when I\u0027m at the target altitude and velocity, without wasting fuel, since the idea is to be as economical and efficient as possible, so does anyone have a way of figuring this out?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsh\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T15:30:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can manually keep the acceleration more or less constant by throttling back as the rocket climbs., keeping 1 eye on the G meter beside the NavBall.

You can use distance from KSC to help. (leave a ship down there so you can reference your distance from it).

Just hit the red X button instead of the green check button. Once declined, the bad contract goes away and is replaced by 1 or more new contracts that have a chance of being better. This is especially true if a contract has been lingering unaccepted on the list while your technology and achievements have advanced. When 1st offered, the contract might have had a decent reward for your current financial and tech levels, but not now. So junk them. In fact, junk anything with ridiculous requirements. pathetic rewards, or that you just don\u0027t want to bother with. Also note that as you go along, the number of contracts on offer at once does increase. I\u0027ve had over a dozen at once so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, what I find useful is to concentrate on the following types of contracts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ELanded at Kerbin.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESplashed down at Kerbin.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIn flight with speed/altitude combos that are roughly within the range of a normal rocket ascent profile. Just do these as part of other missions without having to alter your flight much if at all.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESuborbital trajectories: Usually quite easy as part of normal business.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIn orbit: Ditto\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, 1st you decline all contracts that don\u0027t fit into one of these boxes. Then you make a 2nd pass looking at the rewards. Ignore rep rewards as a decision criterion; rep doesn\u0027t pay the bills or unlock tech, and you amass it anyway just by not dying. What you\u0027re looking for mostly is high cash payouts because that\u0027s mostly what contracts are good for. Some give science but usually no more than about 2/3 of the price of a single node on the tier you\u0027re currently working on, usually only 1/2 that. To score big on science, you have to do like in previous versions of the game and do serious science-gathering missions to other planets. The underlying idea seems to be that your science missions cost money and your contract missions pay the bills for them. This is why cash contracts pay a lot more than the cost of the rocket needed to do them. At least they do if you keep declining those that don\u0027t, so you\u0027re always seeing new ones that fit your current status.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy now you should have a rough idea of what rockets cost with your available parts. Pick contracts that pay more than that. And if you see a decent science reward in there, take it, too. Junk the rest. This should give you a set of 2-4 contracts you can do without breaking a sweat and give you a very healthy profit. So go do them. When you get back, you\u0027ll have another batch of contracts to sort through. Repeat as necessary or until you get bored, then go do a Mun landing or something.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
