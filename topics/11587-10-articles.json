Well, it\\\u0027s not like every ten years every couple in the world has a child. Eventually people would grow old and the new generation would be too young, and soon after the new generation grows up the generation before that would die, keeping the population fairly level (Albeit over a large course of time), unless families have more than an average of two children each (One per ten years as according to the way things are set up now).\n\nBasically, it\\\u0027s this:\n\n![6oumL.png](http://i.imgur.com/6oumL.png)\n\nVersus this:\n\n![BsEV0.png](http://i.imgur.com/BsEV0.png)\n\nOf course, I could be getting this completely wrong and it\\\u0027s correct the way you have it."},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-16T23:12:19Z","Content":"The problem with that is it assumes that most people in a \\\u0027generation\\\u0027 are around the same age, when in reality people are being born at a pretty constant rate all the time, and the whole concept of \\\u0027generations\\\u0027 is rather dubious."},{"CreatedByName":"Anomalous_Matter","CreatedById":24939,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-16T23:26:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The problem with that is it assumes that most people in a \\\u0027generation\\\u0027 are around the same age, when in reality people are being born at a pretty constant rate all the time, and the whole concept of \\\u0027generations\\\u0027 is rather dubious.\n\nEither way, in my opinion it still seems slightly more accurate than assuming every couple in the world has a child every ten years, and no one ever dies."},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-16T23:39:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Either way, in my opinion it still seems slightly more accurate than assuming every couple in the world has a child every ten years, and no one ever dies.\n\n Not really, unless your population consists of a only few people; it\\\u0027s simply a rate of change, which should stay constant in a large population.

Your pixel count has yielded you a population of 100 Kerbals (your really tiny.).\n\nThey will automatically be divided into 3 groups - Children (30%), Adults (60%), and Seniors (10%).\n\nChildren will mature in the next birth cycle\n\nAdults will have children in this birth cycle and will become seniors in the next.\n\nHalf of the Seniors will die in the next birth cycle, the other half will die in the next (ouch)\n\nSo, Nation A has 60 Adults, 30 Children, and 10 Seniors. In this birth cycle, there will be 30 children born, and 5 seniors will die.

The formula I used made the assumption that each couple would have only 1 child, which is a definite death spiral. To combat this, I would use a number provided by random.org to designate the number of children to be had by the families of Nation A. So, it would work like this-\n\nNation A has 60 adults, 30 children, and 10 seniors. In this birth cycle, each couple will have 2 children, for a total of 60 children born (1.9, but you can\\\u0027t have .1 children running around), and 10 seniors will die. Thus, the population of Nation A will increase by 50 to 150.\n\nNow there are 60 children, 30 adults, and 60 seniors. In this birth cycle, each couple will have 2 children (1.5) for a total of 60 children born, and 60 seniors will die. Thus, the population of Nation A will not change.\n\nNow there are 60 children, 60 adults, and 30 seniors. In this birth cycle, each couple will have 1 child (1.1), for a total of 30 children born, and 30 seniors will die. Thus, the population of Nation A will remain the same.\n\nNow there are 30 children, 60 adults, and 60 seniors. In this birth cycle, each couple will have 1 child (1.4), for a total of 30 children born, and 60 seniors will die. Thus, the population of Nation A will decrease by 30 to 120.\n\nNow there are 30 children, 30 adults, and 60 seniors. In this birth cycle, each couple will have 3 children (2.8 ), for a total of 90 children born, and 60 seniors will die. Thus, the population of Nation A will increase by 30 to 150.\n\nNow there are 90 children, 30 adults, and 60 seniors. In this birth cycle, each couple will have 2 children (2.3), for a total of 60 children born, and 60 seniors will die. Thus, the population of Nation A will remain the same.\n\nNow there are 60 children, 90 adults, and 30 seniors. In this birth cycle, each couple will have 2 (2.1), for a total of 90 children born, and 30 seniors will die. Thus, the population of Nation A will increase by 60 to 210.\n\nNow there are 90 children, 60 adults, and 90 seniors. In this birth cycle, each couple will have 1 child (0.5), for a total of 30 children born, and 90 seniors will die.
