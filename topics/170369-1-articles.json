It is unplayable. I tried again last night and it runs for a bit, but as you know in KSP with long missions time warp is inevitable. I had a bit of success with focusing on my vessel to save rather than map view, also deleting the persistent save before saving. That seemed to work for a bit but eventually the bug took over. I did have luck sometimes with just pushing on and hoping I don\u0027t make mistakes so I could get back to Kerbin and recover the vessel. I took off from Duna landed on Kerbin and couldn\u0027t recover the vessel or save, or anything else.
