This test is not a primary mission objective and has a low probability of success (30-40%), but we hope to gather as much data as possible to support future testing. After stage separation, when Dragon is well on its way to the ISS, the first stage will attempt to execute a reentry burn and then a landing burn over the Atlantic Ocean. Falcon 9 is carrying four landing legs, which will deploy partway into the landing burn. Eventually, SpaceX hopes to land the first stage on land. Though success is unlikely with this test, it represents an exciting effort toward someday developing a reusable rocket.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the link to the live stream.... \u003Ca href=\u0022http://new.livestream.com/spacex/events/2833937\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://new.livestream.com/spacex/events/2833937\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, even though it may work well it is going into the ocean....
