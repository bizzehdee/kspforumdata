You say in your first paragraph that it completed. So it\u0027s done, right? You got the cash reward? So how did it \u0022disappear\u0022 when you went back to your ship, isn\u0027t that what completed contracts normally do?\n\nAnyway, I don\u0027t actually have any advice to offer about the missing contract(s), have never experienced that myself, sorry I can\u0027t be of direct help. However, one comment you made did catch my eye:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I went to map mode and browsed Minmus, etc. while in my elliptical orbit. Then to the Space Center **so I could shift the focus back** to my orbiting craft.\n\nIf I\u0027m understanding correctly, I\u0027m guessing that this is what you meant: You went to map mode, and double-clicked Minmus and other planets/moons to browse around. Then you wanted to focus back to your craft, and the only way you know how to do that is to go back to KSC and then to the tracking center.\n\nIf that\u0027s it, I have good news, there\u0027s a quicker way. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) If you\u0027ve moved map-window focus away from the current craft (i.e. to a celestial body), **you can move the focus back to the active craft by pressing backspace.**\n\nApologies if you already know that... I only bring it up because it\u0027s not a very discoverable feature, and I was playing KSP for *months* before I discovered that.\n\nDoesn\u0027t help your current problem at all, but hopefully may be convenient if you didn\u0027t already know about it."}]}
