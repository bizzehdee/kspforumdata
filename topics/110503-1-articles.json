You say in your first paragraph that it completed. So it\u0027s done, right? You got the cash reward? So how did it \u0022disappear\u0022 when you went back to your ship, isn\u0027t that what completed contracts normally do?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I don\u0027t actually have any advice to offer about the missing contract(s), have never experienced that myself, sorry I can\u0027t be of direct help. However, one comment you made did catch my eye:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DennyC\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DennyC\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI went to map mode and browsed Minmus, etc. while in my elliptical orbit.

Then you wanted to focus back to your craft, and the only way you know how to do that is to go back to KSC and then to the tracking center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that\u0027s it, I have good news, there\u0027s a quicker way. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E If you\u0027ve moved map-window focus away from the current craft (i.e. to a celestial body), \u003Cstrong\u003Eyou can move the focus back to the active craft by pressing backspace.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApologies if you already know that... I only bring it up because it\u0027s not a very discoverable feature, and I was playing KSP for \u003Cem\u003Emonths\u003C/em\u003E before I discovered that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoesn\u0027t help your current problem at all, but hopefully may be convenient if you didn\u0027t already know about it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
