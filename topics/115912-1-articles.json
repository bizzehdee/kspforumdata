He had also added a couple separatrons to pull the large triple booster sections away. The net effect was that he used far fewer decouplers and the debris was more manageable (not a huge cloud of boosters).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve just started using that idea and love it. I spent a good chunk of time putting together a perfect set of boosters in this pattern, saved them as a sub-assembly, and now I just re-use them whenever. Instead of having a hundred different launchers, I sometimes just switch out between these saved single, double and triple style boosters on the same launcher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrior to this I hadn\u0027t really used sub-assemblies except for the entire launcher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have any similar ideas that I should look into? Any real launchers or space craft whose designs have cool ideas like this that I should look at?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnny Wishbone","CreatedById":118096,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T18:25:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBack when I was doing my own NASA replicas, I saved every stage of the various rockets as a separate sub-assembly so I could interchange them as necessary. It wasn\u0027t uncommon for me to put the upper stage of a Titan II GLV on top of a S-IC booster (first stage of the Saturn V) or other combinations depending on what was being launched. I actually had the most fun mixing and matching a Redstone with my version of the S-I (Saturn I first stage, which was essentially a cluster of 8 Redstone rockets itself). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESub-assemblys are also useful for more complex creations like capital ships. I\u0027ve built a bridge section that I can attach to various body designs to create some pretty cool looking ships. One of these days, maybe I\u0027ll post one in the ship exchange forum.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DancesWithSquirrels","CreatedById":138267,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T20:20:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a set of Lunar Module style RCS thrusters in my subassemblies: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuilt up with two stacked cubic struts, on the second cube an opposing pair of linear thrusters \u003Cem\u003E(from above, 12 and 6 o-clock, thrusting up and down when placed)\u003C/em\u003E, and an another opposing pair angled up at 45 degrees \u003Cem\u003E(3 and 9 o-clock, thrusting forward/back/sideways when placed)\u003C/em\u003E.
