Here\u0027s a little project I\u0027ve been working on.\n\nI often write music for short films in the area and I recently started working on some KSP inspired music, for fun.\n\nI thought I would share here - I may update it with more tracks or whatever if I continue to work on them / people listen to them.\n\nIf you want to use something in a KSP video, feel free! I just ask that you link me to it so I can see it and see where my music is going. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nLastly, thanks to HarvestR for creating the original KSP theme track! Very awesome musical skills, there.\n\nThanks everyone!\n\n[**\\[soundCloud Playlist for Kerbal Space Program Re-Score**](https://soundcloud.com/colin-thomas-nichols/sets/kerbal-space-program-re-score)"},{"CreatedByName":"Joshwoo70","CreatedById":111345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T16:14:06Z","Content":"Woooo... would work well with soundtrack editor!"},{"CreatedByName":"mythbusters844","CreatedById":72313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T19:22:33Z","Content":"This is amazing.
