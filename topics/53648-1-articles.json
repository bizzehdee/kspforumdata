You do seem a little slow to launch,this is probably over-power (over-torque from the wheels), as seen by the little wheelies you pop, I find shifting the CoM forward a little helps with the start. (while you only have 2 wheels actually in contact with the ground you obviously cant accelerate much, but doing so would be dangerous anyway as it increases the wheelie and can lead to flip-on-launch) Have to just keep tweaking the design to get them as responsive as possible.

Encase the critical hardware (command pod, batteries, etc.) in parts with high impact tolerance (e.g. structural panels and girders). If you need additional downforce, try ion thrusters or RCS (ion thrusters have the advantage that you can leave them on without constantly thrusting and they\u0027ll last longer, though the weight of the necessary equipment will be significant).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObligatory, now dated screenshots of the Hellhound on Minmus:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gUcC3gM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gUcC3gM.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4WXONu0.png\u0022 alt=\u00224WXONu0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xiphos","CreatedById":60680,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T17:26:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck out the post I made here. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54504-Turns-out-the-Mun-is-quite-large-or-getting-around-on-the-Mun-how?p=719634#post719634\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54504-Turns-out-the-Mun-is-quite-large-or-getting-around-on-the-Mun-how?p=719634#post719634\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Rover doesn\u0027t use the new rover wheels (For Low-G, they cause too much problems).
