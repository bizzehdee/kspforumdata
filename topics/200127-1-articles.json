For example, I\u00A0want to be able to filter so that the parts shown to me are the one\u0027s that meet my needs, like if i am looking for just LH2 engines or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E engines.

You know you\u2019ve got it when you see the extra column of colored icons pop up next to the part categories.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the bottom of that column you\u2019ll see a Plus icon, this lets you add your own Subcategory that you can name whatever you like. For you you\u2019d probably just want to call this \u201CEngines.\u201D Once you have created it, click it and you\u2019ll see a column pop up to the right with an additional option to add, erm... \u201Csub\u201D subcategories. These you would name whatever you are seeking to filter by -\u00A0for instance: \u201C\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u201D \u201CLH2\u201D \u201CElectric/Ion\u201D \u201CAviation\u201D etc.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, to add the engines to their respective new subcategories, go to the default\u00A0part selection list, and click the small plus symbol on each engine\u2019s picture icon. This will let you choose from the categories you\u2019ve created.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can do this for all engines in the game and then everytime you want an engine, you can easily filter the ones you don\u2019t want. Just bear in mind you must use the filter tab each time you want to take advantage of that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is a bit of work and can end up taking 15-30 minutes altogether depending how many engines you have, but it is a permanent solution that pays off. I\u00A0actually first did this for the exact same reason as you, I had too many mod engines to sort through and needed a quicker way to find the ones I needed. But over time I eventually\u00A0added my own subcategories for nearly all parts, from solar panels, to structural pieces, crew modules, and more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-02-08T17:49:07Z\u0022 title=\u002202/08/2021 05:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 8, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by lemon cup\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
