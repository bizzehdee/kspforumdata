As I have started to build bigger shuttles and bases I start to notice the game stutters badly all the time and my bases and stations just randomly starts shaking and breaks apart and sometimes they just randomly explode after a while and sometimes right after I dock a section . The stuttering at some points gets so bad that every thing is basically uncontrollable. I dont know what the problem can be as it seems to work reasonably fine with the smaller builds. All my software on my console is up to date and ksp is the only game installed on the console and i dont own a ps4 pro so my standard ps4 doesnt have a boost mode.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-04-03T12:20:40Z\u0022 title=\u002204/03/2020 12:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EApril 3, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by RuaanM\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bingleberry","CreatedById":202597,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-15T01:28:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n100 parts tends to be a limit\u00A0for ps4 part counts... beyond that, I get tremendous stuttering.
