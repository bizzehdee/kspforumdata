But Jeb is older now, and his eyes turn to the horizon and to the future of Kerbal Space Program. Seeing a need for trained and confident pilots to follow in his footsteps, he partnered up with AAC to design and build a two-seater training craft.\n\n![GtnWqjc.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/GtnWqjc.jpg)\n\nThe Fearow! Capable of single-stage-to-orbit flight, prospective Kerbals must prove superior control and precision to prove themselves worthy of the BadS=true flag. Will you set down gracefully back on Kerba Firma? Or will you crash and burn?\n\n[**VIEW AND DOWNLOAD .CRAFT HERE**](http://kerbalx.com/Samniss_Arandeen/AAC-Fearow)\n\nChallenge Rules:\n\n1.) The physical design and properties of the Fearow may NOT be altered. Fly the craft as provided above.\n\n1.1.) The fuel in the fuel tanks, however, may be adjusted as desired.\n\n1.2.) The Action Group settings, while a basic set are provided, may be rebound as desired.\n\n2.) Using whatever flight path suits you, get the Fearow into a stable (75x75km or greater) orbit and land it completely intact upon KSC terrain. You may make as many orbits as you wish. Ap/Pe altitudes will be noted in the gradebook. Extra credit if you put down on the runway.\n\n3.) All who successfully complete the challenge will be noted; however, the highest grades go to those who consume the least amounts of fuel and oxidizer.\n\n4.) NO autopilots! (I\u0027m looking at you, MechJeb...) Informational mods (KER, RPM) are fine as long as you\u0027re flying the craft manually/with the aid of stock SAS. Yes, you can use a joystick.\n\n5.) FAR/NEAR and DRE flights are a different class, and are found in the Test Pilot Academy gradebook. FAR/NEAR flight assistance is permitted.\n\n6.) All required screenshots must be provided for a given flight to be graded.\n\n7.) Jebediah Kerman must backseat the flight to a non-Orange-Suit Pilot.\n\n8.) If you find a flight path that works especially well, by all means share it with your classmates and with Jeb! We\u0027re all learning from each other.\n\nRequired Screenshots:\n\n- Crew Roster proving Jeb backseating another Pilot.\n\n- Craft on the runway before launch, Resources tab open.\n\n- Map Screen of the craft\u0027s achieved orbit, Ap and Pe visible.\n\n- Craft in orbit.\n\n- Craft on approach for landing.\n\n- Craft landed and stopped, Resources tab open. If not on the runway, KSC must be clearly visible in this shot.\n\n- Anything else you deem necessary!\n\n- You may substitute video for the screenshots if you wish.\n\nJeb tells me the man who taught him how to fly had a saying. \u0022Fly Safe!\u0022\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n**Passed the test:** The lower the fuel consumption, the higher the grade.\n\n[Starhawk](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130639-Jebediah-Kerman-s-Flight-School-Challenge?p=2120619\u0026viewfull=1#post2120619) Phore Kerman now has her spaceflight qualifications.

Orbital inclination was 0.6 degrees, measured against the orbit of Mun.\n\nRe-entry was straight forward, with no overheating issues, and with a slight cough from the back seat as to when he should make his burn, they came in nicely over KSC and were able to land on the runway dead stick.\n\nJebediah and Kalpond are selected for the mission\n\n![AAC01.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/AAC01.jpg)\n\nFinal checks on the runway before setting off\n\n![AAC02.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/AAC02.jpg)\n\n100x100km orbit established\n\n![AAC03.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/AAC03.jpg)\n\nAdmiring the view\n\n![AAC04.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/AAC04.jpg)\n\nFinal stages of re-entry with KSC in sight\n\n![AAC05.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/AAC05.jpg)\n\nLined up on the runway\n\n![AAC06.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/AAC06.jpg)\n\nParachutes were useful, but not entirely essential\n\n![AAC07.jpg](http://www.88qv.com/KSP/AAC07.jpg)\n\nBack in time for breakfast.

View full album](//imgur.com/a/g5Hp6)\n\nI\u0027ve made about 10 takeoff attempts, and each one ended pretty much like this. It\u0027s surprising how little influence any of my steering attempts actually had - the plane seemed to largely ignore all my feeble flailings during the short 2-3 seconds it remained airborne. There\u0027s only one in two possible results: if I countersteer, the plane flips forward, pancakes into the airstream and stalls; if I don\u0027t countersteer, the plane flips upright, pancakes into the airstream and stalls. It wants to point any direction *except* forward, like a rocket with a giant fairing and no fins. And I didn\u0027t even get anywhere near transsonic yet...\n\nSo yeah - I think your leaderboard for the pilot academy will be remaining empty.

It still tries to pancake.\n\nSimilarly, I tried moving the canards back, to reduce the amount of lift and drag in the front, and eventually removed them entirely; this also helped a little, but again not enough to get rid of the inherent pitch instability. It also makes the area ruling slightly worse than it already was.\n\nOverall, I\u0027d have to change the plane too much to make it work - probably involving removing both the canards and the tailplanes, moving the main delta wing and intake assembly way back and fitting it with elevons, and then smoothing out the curve with some wing strakes further forward. It would no longer be the plane Samniss provided for the challenge, and thus it\u0027s pointless to try.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-06T21:25:57Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2015 09:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas H.","CreatedById":146617,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T06:55:32Z","Content":"An excuse to bring a space plane to orbit.
