In the olden days, programs were all single-threads, and there was no multi-tasking. With modern operating systems, multi-tasking is normal, and programs run concurrently all the time. However, each CPU core can technically only do one thing at a time, so CPU time is sliced up (very rapidly) to give each thread time to run. How much time a thread gets in each pass depends on a lot of factors, such as what it\u0027s doing, priority level, and so on. However, threads can relinquish time if they\u0027re waiting on something external, like disk or network access, or other external calls, or by design if there are conditions they\u0027re waiting to have met. This is an important aspect. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat that means is that, even if you only have a single CPU core, you can still see some performance gains from a *sensibly* multi-threaded program. Some threads may be waiting on something, and others can simultaneously be hard at work. However if those threads are doing nothing but hard math, you might see a performance loss from overly breaking up the work into separate threads, just because of the overhead of thread management. You might also not see any performance benefit if those threads are all spending time waiting on things and simply don\u0027t need that much CPU. Usually there is an optimal, \u0022happy medium\u0022 somewhere in there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese days multi-core CPUs are pretty standard, which means you also have more than one core to handle threads simultaneously, competing less for CPU time slices, memory channels, and so on. To further muddy the waters, Intel CPUs have a feature called HyperThreading, which basically means that each core can run two threads through the pipeline at any given moment. However, the CPU core isn\u0027t any faster, and those threads have to compete for the same resources (CPU time, cache, memory access). If a program is specifically designed around HyperThreading so that the threads don\u0027t step on each others toes, there can be maybe upward of a 30% performance gain over not having HyperThreading enabled. However since not many programs are designed for that specifically, the performance gain may be small, or even result in a slight performance loss. So for the sake of discussion, it\u0027s best to ignore HyperThreading, and still think of each core as just a core.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T14:54:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFurther to NecroBone\u0027s (excellent) explanation, AMD also has some oddness regarding cores: There are twice as many integer units as floating point units. So an eight core processor will perform like an eight core when doing integer tasks but only a four core when doing floating point tasks. IIRC most of the physics work in KSP is floating point, so AMD users should expect threading gains to be similar to a system with half as many cores.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
