And it\u0027s analysis says, my plane is well-ish designed.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut when starting from the runway with or without SAS, it doesn\u0027t want to take off, even at 140 m/s.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd the plane begins to vibrate and shake left-to-right on its two rear landing gears at about above 70 m/s until it disassembles itself on the runway\u003Cbr\u003E\nbefore I have the chance to take off.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy plane is completely symmetrical and I even exchanged the wings from two aeroplane tail fins to delta wings, because I thought they may act weird if misused as main wings.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI increased the control surcfaces, added canards. But it still rips apart before lifting off the ground.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe front steering wheel is set to \u0022no friction\u0022 like many players here recommend, to avoid skidding off the runway.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy TWR is 1.53.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/FGhF0ce\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPlane\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAny Ideas what\u0027s going on here?\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt feels really different from my expierience in KSP 1.0.5...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEDIT: I moved the rear landing gear forward, directly under the CoL now to have a better leverage when pitching up.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut it still wobbles like mad on those rear gears and explodes before liftoff. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:mellow:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_mellow.png\u0022 title=\u0022:mellow:\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEDIT: Solved.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI attached medium landing gears now. That did the trick.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI heard that landing gears are now a big factor. But having to use those heavy, large \u0022medium landing gears\u0022 on such a small, light craft seems odd to me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-26T11:27:40Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2016 11:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Cairol\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
