I\u0027ve been doing the same thing, actually had my Dragon/Falcon9 ready on the launch pad for the SpaceX\u0027s mission. I was planning to fly it in tandem, but when theirs blew up I kinda lost control of mine!

I didn\u0027t spend a ton of time figuring out exactly where docking ports are on the real ISS so while mine looks very similar, it has some...kerbal discrepancies. Yours, however, is much closer to the real thing. Nice work!"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T07:03:39Z","Content":"This report of a mission has been moved to Mission Reports."}]}
