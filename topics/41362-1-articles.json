I\u0027ve had this problem, where the windowed mode of KSP prevents you from maximising the game, since the taskbar at the bottom covers up the \u0027Accept\u0027 button. There are three possible fixes, all of which I\u0027ve used in the past: (I\u0027m assuming you\u0027re running Windows)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOne:\u003C/strong\u003E change your desktop orientation so that everything\u0027s flipped horizontal (under \u0027Screen Resolution\u0027 when you right click on the desktop). Then go to your KSP window and maneuver the mouse somehow to click the \u0027Accept\u0027 button, and after 15 seconds of flipped screen it should revert to normal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETwo:\u003C/strong\u003E Go into the KSP directory, and open up \u0027settings.cfg\u0027 in NotePad. Scroll down until you see \u0027FULLSCREEN = False\u0027. Change that to \u0027FULLSCREEN = True\u0027 (case is important!). When you next open up KSP, the game will be in fullscreen mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThree:\u003C/strong\u003E Check \u0027Auto-Hide the taskbar\u0027 under Taskbar Properties (right-click on the taskbar). This will cause it to disappear, allowing you to click the \u0027Accept\u0027 button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope these help!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
