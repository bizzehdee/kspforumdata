There\u0027s something that will always be cool about driving across the Duna flats with nothing in front of you but sand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to ride in something cool though. Ideally I\u0027d like to fly a duna mission, unpack a rover, build it and then drive it, but I\u0027d settle for someone modelling this thing and I can take a crack at coding it myself. (I know nothing about modelling and just a little bit about coding).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had 2 concepts that I\u0027ve found for rover design that seem like they\u0027d be cool. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first is a short-range rover, 2 or 3 person, 6 wheeled (though it could work with just 4) with a small trunk in the rear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/N7EZ8oq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022N7EZ8oq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EWOqri8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EWOqri8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second design is a little larger. 3 or 4 kerbals with a sealed bubble to use as a cockpit. This would be a long-duration rover for over-night expeditions. I\u0027m thinking we put a flatbed in the back for hauling samples and/or equipment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EmQshIk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022EmQshIk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, for a little extra fun:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also really want to recreate this concept art, so I\u0027d love for someone to take a crack at a motorcycle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PPUxaMS.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022PPUxaMS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got ideas for how these can all work in my head, but I don\u0027t have the technical expertise with the modelling programs KSP uses in order to do them properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny modders out there up to the task?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
