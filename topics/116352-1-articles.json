That tipped me over the edge - I haven\u0027t built many planes since about 0.15, but I\u0027ve been churning out fighters for the last few weeks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next step was to test them. Doing a human trial is far too subjective, so letting the AI do it seemed much fairer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI quickly found 2 v 2 battles, where each team starts either side of the runway, all AI active and guard mode on, until I switch one to team B. At that point, all the planes scramble and I have plenty of time to switch the wingman to team B too. I then sit back and watch to see which plane wins the most fights, probably best of 3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWinning means having at least one plane under controlled, powered flight when the other team doesn\u0027t (in some cases, they ran out of fuel!). If there\u0027s a mutual wipeout, it\u0027s a draw. I guess a whitewash, a win with both planes still flying, is worth a bonus point. Planes that fly out of guard mode range before they can turn and engage are deemed lost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy question is, would anyone be interested in a builders\u0027 contest, designing planes and then having a knockout contest to find the winner, using this format?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, would there be interest in recording videos of the battles? I find them mesmerising! My PC, however, is very old, so I\u0027m unsure how good performance would be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, would stock plus BD be the way to go, or allow a few select mods? Would different classes of plane be desired - e.g. twin turbofans are much more dangerous than single turbofans, and wouldn\u0027t be a fair fight. Perhaps old-school prop engine dogfights would be desirable. I\u0027m unfamiliar with FAR, and would prefer to conduct the tests under stock aero,but as the AI does the flying and everyone else does the building, that may not matter. Weapon loadouts may also be open or restricted, again depending on feedback. AI settings would be whatever the plane\u0027s craft file is set to, though there would be max and min altitudes set.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found that pure performance wasn\u0027t the only factor in design - redundancy and using tough parts play a part, in a speed v toughness tradeoff which challenges builders.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy house rule for part clipping is it\u0027s fine unless both parts are fuel tanks (I wouldn\u0027t count things like the engine precooler, as it has barely any), in which case only one can carry fuel, the other must be drained, or both only partially filled depending on degree of overlap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the course of this thread, I\u0027ve developed a few more ideas:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-cite=\u0022colmo\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022colmo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\ncolmo said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- \u003Cstrong\u003EArms Race AI:\u003C/strong\u003E a no-holds barred, anything goes contest. Mods allowed (there are other BD based weapon mods, are they balanced?), all weapons open. Planes and anything else you can control using the AI. The only limit would be part count. The winner is the last one with something left still with propulsion and under control/controllable. For practical purposes, 1v1 is advised at the point of launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- \u003Cstrong\u003ETop Gun AI Pro:\u003C/strong\u003E A FAR based version of the fighter challenge.

I envision three rounds:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*Air-to-air (v the same plane, probably a 3v2 scenario to push the designs to cope in an outnumbered scenario),\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*Air-to-ground (testing their ability to take out ground defences and survive Goalkeepers and SAM missiles), and\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*Interceptor (scramble and defend the KSC from incoming bombers, on a set flightpath targetting probes with weapon managers placed on the KSC, testing their ability to launch and attain altitude then take out large, turreted bombers).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPoints would be awarded for each round depending on value and number of targets destroyed, losses and damage sustained. The only changes allowed between rounds would be AI settings, weapon loadout (hard points would need to be the same in all rounds, so give those careful thought), and fuel levels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis one may take some improvements in the AI to pull off, Guard range being the biggest limitation at the moment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- \u003Cstrong\u003EDuck Hunt AI:\u003C/strong\u003E Use the Air Race features in Kerbal Konstructs to time a plane in taking out a series of targets, placed on the ground (or floating in the air) in series which the plane will follow in order. Mountains would make it extra challenging. I recall this being a challenge a very long time ago, using balloons. Now we can do it with AI.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- \u003Cstrong\u003ETop Gun VTOL AI:\u003C/strong\u003E A variant of the fighter format, but especially for VTOLs.

I\u0027d say it would just be easier to limit the total amount of fuel an aircraft can have based on its engines. Speed and maneuverability are going to be major advantages in the competition, and tiny aircraft would be easy abusers of that, along with being harder to hit.
