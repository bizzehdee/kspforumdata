Certainly there are a multitude of advantages to it, including a built in Dv boost since the aircraft is already moving, no need to deal with the lower atmosphere, thus the ability to design more efficient rockets that work well in low pressure, more flexibility in the use of higher ISP fuels that would otherwise be impractical or too dangerous to use in surface to orbit applications, lower propellant weight allowing for high payload weight, and ability to effectively launch from anywhere to any inclination directly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-03T22:52:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to do this in KSP I would suggest you try \u003Cstrong\u003EB9 Aerospace\u003C/strong\u003E.
